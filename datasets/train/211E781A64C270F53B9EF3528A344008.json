NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nIrbesartan Zentiva 75 mg tablets. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 75 mg of irbesartan. \n \nExcipient with known effect: 15.37 mg of lactose monohydrate per tablet. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet. \nWhite to off-white, biconvex, and oval-shaped with a heart debossed on one side and the number 2771 \nengraved on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIrbesartan Zentiva is indicated in adults for the treatment of essential hypertension. \nIt is also indicated for the treatment of renal disease in adult patients with hypertension and type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus as part of an antihypertensive medicinal product regimen (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 \nand 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe usual recommended initial and maintenance dose is 150 mg once daily, with or without food. \nIrbesartan Zentiva at a dose of 150 mg once daily generally provides a better 24 hour blood pressure \ncontrol than 75 mg. However, initiation of therapy with 75 mg could be considered, particularly in \nhaemodialysed patients and in the elderly over 75 years. \n \nIn patients insufficiently controlled with 150 mg once daily, the dose of Irbesartan Zentiva can be \nincreased to 300 mg, or other antihypertensive agents can be added (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \nIn particular, the addition of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an additive \neffect with Irbesartan Zentiva (see section 4.5). \n \nIn hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, therapy should be initiated at 150 mg irbesartan once daily \nand titrated up to 300 mg once daily as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease. \nThe demonstration of renal benefit of Irbesartan Zentiva in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is \nbased on studies where irbesartan was used in addition to other antihypertensive agents, as needed, to \nreach target blood pressure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \n \nSpecial Populations \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower starting dose \n(75 mg) should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 3 \n\nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There is no \nclinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nOlder people \n \nAlthough consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 75 mg in patients over 75 years of \nage, dosage adjustment is not usually necessary for older people. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Irbesartan Zentiva in children aged 0 to 18 has not been established. \nCurrently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. \n \nMethod of Administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nSecond and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n \n The concomitant use of Irbesartan Zentiva with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in \npatients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60 \nml/min/1.73m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIntravascular volume depletion: symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in \npatients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, \ndiarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Irbesartan \nZentiva. \n \n\nRenovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency \nwhen patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney \nare treated with medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. While this is \nnot documented with Irbesartan Zentiva, a similar effect should be anticipated with angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. \n \n\nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Irbesartan Zentiva is used in patients with \nimpaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium and creatinine serum levels is \nrecommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of Irbesartan Zentiva in patients \nwith a recent kidney transplantation. \n \n\nHypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of irbesartan both on renal and \ncardiovascular events were not uniform across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study \nwith patients with advanced renal disease. In particular, they appeared less favourable in women and \nnon-white subjects (see section 5.1). \n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): there is evidence that the \nconcomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of \nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual \nblockade of RAAS  through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \n\n\n\n \n\n 4 \n\naliskirenis therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1 If dual blockade therapy is considered \nabsolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to frequent close \nmonitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II \nreceptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic nephropathy. \n \nHyperkalaemia: as with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, \nhyperkalaemia may occur during the treatment with Irbesartan Zentiva, especially in the presence of \nrenal impairment, overt proteinuria due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring \nof serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \n\nLithium: the combination of lithium and Irbesartan Zentiva is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \n\nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Irbesartan Zentiva is not recommended. \n \n\nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.5). As with any \nantihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or \nischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nAs observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, irbesartan and the other angiotensin \nantagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, \npossibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nPregnancy: angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \n \nPaediatric population: irbesartan has been studied in paediatric populations aged 6 to 16 years old but \nthe current data are insufficient to support an extension of the use in children until further data become \navailable (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nLactose: patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDiuretics and other antihypertensive agents: other antihypertensive agents may increase the \nhypotensive effects of irbesartan; however Irbesartan Zentiva has been safely administered with other \nantihypertensive agents, such as beta-blockers, long-acting calcium channel blockers, and thiazide \ndiuretics. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of \nhypotension when initiating therapy with Irbesartan Zentiva (see section 4.4). \n \n\nAliskiren-containing products or ACE-inhibitors: clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events \n\n\n\n \n\n 5 \n\nsuch as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) \ncompared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n \nPotassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: based on experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and \nis, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \n\nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Therefore, this combination is not recommended \n(see section 4.4). If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is \nrecommended. \n \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \n\nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by coadministration of \nirbesartan. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \n\n\n\n \n\n 6 \n\nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Irbesartan Zentiva during breast-feeding, \nIrbesartan Zentiva is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety \nprofiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nIt is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its \nmetabolites in milk (for details see 5.3). \n \nFertility \n \nIrbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing \nthe first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBased on its pharmacodynamic properties, irbesartan is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use \nmachines. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness \nor weariness may occur during treatment. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn placebo-controlled trials in patients with hypertension, the overall incidence of adverse events did \nnot differ between the irbesartan (56.2%) and the placebo groups (56.5%). Discontinuation due to any \nclinical or laboratory adverse event was less frequent for irbesartan-treated patients (3.3%) than for \nplacebo-treated patients (4.5%). The incidence of adverse events was not related to dose (in the \nrecommended dose range), gender, age, race, or duration of treatment. \n \nIn diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal renal function, orthostatic \ndizziness and orthostatic hypotension were reported in 0.5% of the patients (i.e., uncommon) but in \nexcess of placebo. \n \nThe following table presents the adverse drug reactions that were reported in placebo-controlled trials \nin which 1,965 hypertensive patients received irbesartan. Terms marked with a star (*) refer to the \nadverse reactions that were additionally reported in > 2% of diabetic hypertensive patients with \nchronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria and in excess of placebo. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nAdverse reactions additionally reported from post\u2013marketing experience are also listed. These adverse \nreactions are derived from spontaneous reports. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 7 \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nNot known:  thrombocytopenia \n \nImmune system disorders \nNot known:  hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema, rash, urticaria, anaphylactic reaction, \nanaphylactic shock \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nNot known:  hyperkalaemia \n \nNervous system disorders \nCommon: dizziness, orthostatic dizziness* \nNot known: vertigo, headache \n \nEar and labyrinth disorder \nNot known: tinnitus \n \nCardiac disorders \nUncommon: tachycardia \n \nVascular disorders \nCommon: orthostatic hypotension* \nUncommon: flushing \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: cough \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea, dyspepsia/heartburn \nNot known: dysgeusia \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \nUncommon: jaundice \nNot known: hepatitis, abnormal liver function \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nNot known: leukocytoclastic vasculitis \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon: musculoskeletal pain* \nNot known: arthralgia, myalgia (in some cases associated with increased plasma creatine kinase  \n levels), muscle cramps \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nNot known:  impaired renal function including cases of renal failure in patients at risk (see \n\nsection 4.4) \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nUncommon: sexual dysfunction \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 8 \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon: fatigue \nUncommon: chest pain \n \nInvestigations \nVery common: Hyperkalaemia* occurred more often in diabetic patients treated with irbesartan than \n\nwith placebo. In diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal \nrenal function, hyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 29.4% of the patients in the \nirbesartan 300 mg group and 22% of the patients in the placebo group. In diabetic \nhypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria, \nhyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 46.3% of the patients in the irbesartan group \nand 26.3% of the patients in the placebo group. \n\nCommon: significant increases in plasma creatine kinase were commonly observed (1.7%) in \nirbesartan treated subjects. None of these increases were associated with identifiable \nclinical musculoskeletal events. \nIn 1.7% of hypertensive patients with advanced diabetic renal disease treated with \nirbesartan, a decrease in haemoglobin*, which was not clinically significant, has been \nobserved. \n\n \nPaediatric population  \nIn a randomised trial of 318 hypertensive children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years, the following \nadverse reactions occurred in the 3-week double-blind phase: headache (7.9%), hypotension (2.2%), \ndizziness (1.9%), cough (0.9%). In the 26-week open-label period of this trial the most frequent \nlaboratory abnormalities observed were creatinine increases (6.5%) and elevated CK values in 2% of \nchild recipients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nExperience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity. The most \nlikely manifestations of overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia might \nalso occur from overdose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with \nIrbesartan Zentiva. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic \nand supportive. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated \ncharcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin-II antagonists, plain. \nATC code: C09C A04. \n \nMechanism of action  \nIrbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. It is \nexpected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source \nor route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors \nresults in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma \naldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at \nthe recommended doses. Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates \n\n\n\n \n\n 9 \n\nangiotensin-II and also degrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require \nmetabolic activation for its activity. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nHypertension \n\nIrbesartan lowers blood pressure with minimal change in heart rate. The decrease in blood pressure is \ndose-related for once a day doses with a tendency towards plateau at doses above 300 mg. Doses of \n150-300 mg once daily lower supine or seated blood pressures at trough (i.e. 24 hours after dosing) by \nan average of 8-13/5-8 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) greater than those associated with placebo. \nPeak reduction of blood pressure is achieved within 3-6 hours after administration and the blood \npressure lowering effect is maintained for at least 24 hours. At 24 hours the reduction of blood \npressure was 60-70% of the corresponding peak diastolic and systolic responses at the recommended \ndoses. Once daily dosing with 150 mg produced trough and mean 24 hour responses similar to twice \ndaily dosing on the same total dose. \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of Irbesartan Zentiva is evident within 1-2 weeks, with the \nmaximal effect occurring by 4-6 weeks after start of therapy. The antihypertensive effects are \nmaintained during long term therapy. After withdrawal of therapy, blood pressure gradually returns \ntoward baseline. Rebound hypertension has not been observed. \nThe blood pressure lowering effects of irbesartan and thiazide-type diuretics are additive. In patients \nnot adequately controlled by irbesartan alone, the addition of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide \n(12.5 mg) to irbesartan once daily results in a further placebo-adjusted blood pressure reduction at \ntrough of 7-10/3-6 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic). \nThe efficacy of Irbesartan Zentiva is not influenced by age or gender. As is the case with other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably \nless response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low \ndose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the antihypertensive response in black patients \napproaches that of white patients. \nThere is no clinically important effect on serum uric acid or urinary uric acid secretion. \n \nPaediatric population \nReduction of blood pressure with 0.5 mg/kg (low), 1.5 mg/kg (medium) and 4.5 mg/kg (high) target \ntitrated doses of irbesartan was evaluated in 318 hypertensive or at risk (diabetic, family history of \nhypertension) children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years over a three week period. At the end of the \nthree weeks the mean reduction from baseline in the primary efficacy variable, trough seated systolic \nblood pressure (SeSBP) was 11.7 mmHg (low dose), 9.3 mmHg (medium dose), 13.2 mmHg (high \ndose). No significant difference was apparent between these doses. Adjusted mean change of trough \nseated diastolic blood pressure (SeDBP) was as follows: 3.8 mmHg (low dose), 3.2 mmHg (medium \ndose), 5.6 mmHg (high dose). Over a subsequent two week period where patients were re-randomized \nto either active medicinal product or placebo, patients on placebo had increases of 2.4 and 2.0 mmHg \nin SeSBP and SeDBP compared to +0.1 and -0.3 mmHg changes respectively in those on all doses of \nirbesartan (see section 4.2). \n \nHypertension and type 2 diabetes with renal disease \n\nThe \u201cIrbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT)\u201d shows that irbesartan decreases the progression \nof renal disease in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria. IDNT was a double \nblind, controlled, morbidity and mortality trial comparing Irbesartan Zentiva, amlodipine and placebo. \nIn 1,715 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria \u2265 900 mg/day and serum creatinine \nranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dl, the long-term effects (mean 2.6 years) of Irbesartan Zentiva on the \nprogression of renal disease and all-cause mortality were examined. Patients were titrated from 75 mg \nto a maintenance dose of 300 mg Irbesartan Zentiva, from 2.5 mg to 10 mg amlodipine, or placebo as \ntolerated. Patients in all treatment groups typically received between 2 and 4 antihypertensive agents \n(e.g., diuretics, beta blockers, alpha blockers) to reach a predefined blood pressure goal of \n\u2264 135/85 mmHg or a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure if baseline was > 160 mmHg. Sixty per \ncent (60%) of patients in the placebo group reached this target blood pressure whereas this figure was \n76% and 78% in the irbesartan and amlodipine groups respectively. Irbesartan significantly reduced \nthe relative risk in the primary combined endpoint of doubling serum creatinine, end-stage renal \n\n\n\n \n\n 10 \n\ndisease (ESRD) or all-cause mortality. Approximately 33% of patients in the irbesartan group reached \nthe primary renal composite endpoint compared to 39% and 41% in the placebo and amlodipine \ngroups [20% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.024) and 23% relative risk reduction \ncompared to amlodipine (p = 0.006)]. When the individual components of the primary endpoint were \nanalysed, no effect in all cause mortality was observed, while a positive trend in the reduction in \nESRD and a significant reduction in doubling of serum creatinine were observed. \n \nSubgroups consisting of gender, race, age, duration of diabetes, baseline blood pressure, serum \ncreatinine, and albumin excretion rate were assessed for treatment effect. In the female and black \nsubgroups which represented 32% and 26% of the overall study population respectively, a renal \nbenefit was not evident, although the confidence intervals do not exclude it. As for the secondary \nendpoint of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, there was no difference among the three groups \nin the overall population, although an increased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen for women and a \ndecreased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen in males in the irbesartan group versus the placebo-\nbased regimen. An increased incidence of non-fatal MI and stroke was seen in females in the \nirbesartan-based regimen versus the amlodipine-based regimen, while hospitalization due to heart \nfailure was reduced in the overall population. However, no proper explanation for these findings in \nwomen has been identified. \n \nThe study of the \u201cEffects of Irbesartan on Microalbuminuria in Hypertensive Patients with type 2 \nDiabetes Mellitus (IRMA 2)\u201d shows that irbesartan 300 mg delays progression to overt proteinuria in \npatients with microalbuminuria. IRMA 2 was a placebo-controlled double blind morbidity study in \n590 patients with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/day) and normal renal function \n(serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dl in males and < 1.1 mg/dl in females). The study examined the long-term \neffects (2 years) of Irbesartan Zentiva on the progression to clinical (overt) proteinuria (urinary \nalbumin excretion rate (UAER) > 300 mg/day, and an increase in UAER of at least 30% from \nbaseline). The predefined blood pressure goal was \u2264 135/85 mmHg. Additional antihypertensive \nagents (excluding ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and dihydropyridine calcium \nblockers) were added as needed to help achieve the blood pressure goal. While similar blood pressure \nwas achieved in all treatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in the \nplacebo (14.9%) or in the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint of overt proteinuria, \ndemonstrating a 70% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose. An \naccompanying improvement in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not observed during the first \nthree months of treatment. The slowing in the progression to clinical proteinuria was evident as early \nas three months and continued over the 2 year period. Regression to normoalbuminuria (< 30 mg/day) \nwas more frequent in the Irbesartan Zentiva 300 mg group (34%) than in the placebo group (21%). \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs \nNephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of \ncardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of \nend-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \ndiabetic nephropathy. \nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \nresults are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy. \nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor \nor an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney \ndisease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk \nof adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the \naliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest \n\n\n\n \n\n 11 \n\n(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren \ngroup than in the placebo group. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration, irbesartan is well absorbed: studies of absolute bioavailability gave values of \napproximately 60-80%. Concomitant food intake does not significantly influence the bioavailability of \nirbesartan.  \n \nDistribution \n \nPlasma protein binding is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood components. \nThe volume of distribution is 53-93 litres.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nFollowing oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma \nradioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via \nglucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide \n(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect. \n \nLinearity / non-linearity \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg (twice the maximal \nrecommended dose) was observed; the mechanism for this is unknown. Peak plasma concentrations \nare attained at 1.5-2 hours after oral administration. The total body and renal clearance are 157-\n176 and 3-3.5 ml/min, respectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. \nSteady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing \nregimen. Limited accumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily \ndosing. In a study, somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female \nhypertensive patients. However, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of \nirbesartan. No dosage adjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values \nwere also somewhat greater in older subjects (\u2265 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). \nHowever the terminal half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in \nolder people. \n \nElimination \n \nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or IV \nadministration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, and the \nremainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged irbesartan. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were evaluated in 23 hypertensive children after the administration \nof single and multiple daily doses of irbesartan (2 mg/kg) up to a maximum daily dose of 150 mg for \nfour weeks. Of those 23 children, 21 were evaluable for comparison of pharmacokinetics with adults \n(twelve children over 12 years, nine children between 6 and 12 years). Results showed that Cmax, AUC \nand clearance rates were comparable to those observed in adult patients receiving 150 mg irbesartan \ndaily. A limited accumulation of irbesartan (18%) in plasma was observed upon repeated once daily \ndosing. \n \nRenal impairment \n\n\n\n \n\n 12 \n\n \nIn patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters \nof irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not \nsignificantly altered. \nStudies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThere was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In \nnon-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (\u2265 250 mg/kg/day in rats and \u2265 100 mg/kg/day in \nmacaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). \nAt very high doses (\u2265 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidney (such as interstitial \nnephritis, tubular distension, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and \ncreatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the \nhypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, \nirbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at \u2265 90 mg/kg/day, in \nmacaques at \u2265 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the \npharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the hyperplasia/ \nhypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n \nFertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at \noral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including \nmortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live \nfoetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. \nStudies in animals indicate that the radiolabelled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit foetuses. \nIrbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption were noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nIrbesartan Zentiva 150 mg tablets. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 150 mg of irbesartan. \n \nExcipient with known effect: 30.75 mg of lactose monohydrate per tablet. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet. \nWhite to off-white, biconvex, and oval-shaped with a heart debossed on one side and the number 2772 \nengraved on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIrbesartan Zentiva is indicated in adults for the treatment of essential hypertension. \nIt is also indicated for the treatment of renal disease in adult patients with hypertension and type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus as part of an antihypertensive medicinal product regimen (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 \nand 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe usual recommended initial and maintenance dose is 150 mg once daily, with or without food. \nIrbesartan Zentiva at a dose of 150 mg once daily generally provides a better 24 hour blood pressure \ncontrol than 75 mg. However, initiation of therapy with 75 mg could be considered, particularly in \nhaemodialysed patients and in the elderly over 75 years. \n \nIn patients insufficiently controlled with 150 mg once daily, the dose of Irbesartan Zentiva can be \nincreased to 300 mg, or other antihypertensive agents can be added (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \nIn particular, the addition of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an additive \neffect with Irbesartan Zentiva (see section 4.5). \n \nIn hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, therapy should be initiated at 150 mg irbesartan once daily \nand titrated up to 300 mg once daily as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease. \nThe demonstration of renal benefit of Irbesartan Zentiva in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is \nbased on studies where irbesartan was used in addition to other antihypertensive agents, as needed, to \nreach target blood pressure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and  5.1). \n \nSpecial Populations \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower starting dose \n(75 mg) should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 15 \n\nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There is no \nclinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nOlder people \n \nAlthough consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 75 mg in patients over 75 years of \nage, dosage adjustment is not usually necessary forolder people. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Irbesartan Zentiva in children aged 0 to 18 has not been established. \nCurrently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. \n \nMethod of Administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nSecond and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n \n The concomitant use of Irbesartan Zentiva with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in \npatients with diabetes mellitus or moderate to severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n(GFR) <60 ml/min/1.73m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIntravascular volume depletion: symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in \npatients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, \ndiarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Irbesartan \nZentiva. \n \n\nRenovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency \nwhen patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney \nare treated with medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. While this is \nnot documented with Irbesartan Zentiva, a similar effect should be anticipated with angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. \n \n\nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Irbesartan Zentiva is used in patients with \nimpaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium and creatinine serum levels is \nrecommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of Irbesartan Zentiva in patients \nwith a recent kidney transplantation. \n \n\nHypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of irbesartan both on renal and \ncardiovascular events were not uniform across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study \nwith patients with advanced renal disease. In particular, they appeared less favourable in women and \nnon-white subjects (see section 5.1). \n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): there is evidence that the \nconcomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of \nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual \nblockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  If dual blockade therapy is \n\n\n\n \n\n 16 \n\nconsidered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to \nfrequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors and \nangiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic \nnephropathy. \n \nHyperkalaemia: as with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, \nhyperkalaemia may occur during the treatment with Irbesartan Zentiva, especially in the presence of \nrenal impairment, overt proteinuria due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring \nof serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \n\nLithium: the combination of lithium and Irbesartan Zentiva is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \n\nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Irbesartan Zentiva is not recommended. \n \n\nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.5). As with any \nantihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or \nischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nAs observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, irbesartan and the other angiotensin \nantagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, \npossibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nPregnancy: angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \n \nPaediatric population: irbesartan has been studied in paediatric populations aged 6 to 16 years old but \nthe current data are insufficient to support an extension of the use in children until further data become \navailable (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nLactose: patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDiuretics and other antihypertensive agents: other antihypertensive agents may increase the \nhypotensive effects of irbesartan; however Irbesartan Zentiva has been safely administered with other \nantihypertensive agents, such as beta-blockers, long-acting calcium channel blockers, and thiazide \ndiuretics. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of \nhypotension when initiating therapy with Irbesartan Zentiva (see section 4.4). \n \n\nAliskiren-containing products or ACE-inhibitors: clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events \n\n\n\n \n\n 17 \n\nsuch as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) \ncompared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n \nPotassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: based on experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and \nis, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \n\nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Therefore, this combination is not recommended \n(see section 4.4). If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is \nrecommended. \n \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \n\nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by coadministration of \nirbesartan. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \n\n\n\n \n\n 18 \n\nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Irbesartan Zentiva during breast-feeding, \nIrbesartan Zentiva is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety \nprofiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nIt is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its \nmetabolites in milk (for details see 5.3). \n \nFertility \n \nIrbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing \nthe first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBased on its pharmacodynamic properties, irbesartan is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use \nmachines. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness \nor weariness may occur during treatment. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn placebo-controlled trials in patients with hypertension, the overall incidence of adverse events did \nnot differ between the irbesartan (56.2%) and the placebo groups (56.5%). Discontinuation due to any \nclinical or laboratory adverse event was less frequent for irbesartan-treated patients (3.3%) than for \nplacebo-treated patients (4.5%). The incidence of adverse events was not related to dose (in the \nrecommended dose range), gender, age, race, or duration of treatment. \n \nIn diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal renal function, orthostatic \ndizziness and orthostatic hypotension were reported in 0.5% of the patients (i.e., uncommon) but in \nexcess of placebo. \n \nThe following table presents the adverse drug reactions that were reported in placebo-controlled trials \nin which 1,965 hypertensive patients received irbesartan. Terms marked with a star (*) refer to the \nadverse reactions that were additionally reported in > 2% of diabetic hypertensive patients with \nchronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria and in excess of placebo. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nAdverse reactions additionally reported from post\u2013marketing experience are also listed. These adverse \nreactions are derived from spontaneous reports. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 19 \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nNot known:  thrombocytopenia \n \nImmune system disorders \nNot known:  hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema, rash, urticaria, anaphylactic reaction, \nanaphylactic shock \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nNot known:  hyperkalaemia \n \nNervous system disorders \nCommon: dizziness, orthostatic dizziness* \nNot known: vertigo, headache \n \nEar and labyrinth disorder \nNot known: tinnitus \n \nCardiac disorders \nUncommon: tachycardia \n \nVascular disorders \nCommon: orthostatic hypotension* \nUncommon: flushing \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: cough \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea, dyspepsia/heartburn \nNot known: dysgeusia \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \nUncommon: jaundice \nNot known: hepatitis, abnormal liver function \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nNot known: leukocytoclastic vasculitis \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon: musculoskeletal pain* \nNot known: arthralgia, myalgia (in some cases associated with increased plasma creatine kinase  \n levels), muscle cramps \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nNot known:  impaired renal function including cases of renal failure in patients at risk (see \n\nsection 4.4) \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nUncommon: sexual dysfunction \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 20 \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon: fatigue \nUncommon: chest pain \n \nInvestigations \nVery common: Hyperkalaemia* occurred more often in diabetic patients treated with irbesartan than \n\nwith placebo. In diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal \nrenal function, hyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 29.4% of the patients in the \nirbesartan 300 mg group and 22% of the patients in the placebo group. In diabetic \nhypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria, \nhyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 46.3% of the patients in the irbesartan group \nand 26.3% of the patients in the placebo group. \n\nCommon: significant increases in plasma creatine kinase were commonly observed (1.7%) in \nirbesartan treated subjects. None of these increases were associated with identifiable \nclinical musculoskeletal events. \nIn 1.7% of hypertensive patients with advanced diabetic renal disease treated with \nirbesartan, a decrease in haemoglobin*, which was not clinically significant, has been \nobserved. \n\n \nPaediatric population  \nIn a randomised trial of 318 hypertensive children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years, the following \nadverse reactions occurred in the 3-week double-blind phase: headache (7.9%), hypotension (2.2%), \ndizziness (1.9%), cough (0.9%). In the 26-week open-label period of this trial the most frequent \nlaboratory abnormalities observed were creatinine increases (6.5%) and elevated CK values in 2% of \nchild recipients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nExperience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity. The most \nlikely manifestations of overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia might \nalso occur from overdose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with \nIrbesartan Zentiva. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic \nand supportive. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated \ncharcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin-II antagonists, plain. \nATC code: C09C A04. \n \nMechanism of action  \nIrbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. It is \nexpected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source \nor route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors \nresults in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma \naldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at \nthe recommended doses. Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates \n\n\n\n \n\n 21 \n\nangiotensin-II and also degrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require \nmetabolic activation for its activity. \n \nClinical efficacy: \n \nHypertension \nIrbesartan lowers blood pressure with minimal change in heart rate. The decrease in blood pressure is \ndose-related for once a day doses with a tendency towards plateau at doses above 300 mg. Doses of \n150-300 mg once daily lower supine or seated blood pressures at trough (i.e. 24 hours after dosing) by \nan average of 8-13/5-8 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) greater than those associated with placebo. \nPeak reduction of blood pressure is achieved within 3-6 hours after administration and the blood \npressure lowering effect is maintained for at least 24 hours. At 24 hours the reduction of blood \npressure was 60-70% of the corresponding peak diastolic and systolic responses at the recommended \ndoses. Once daily dosing with 150 mg produced trough and mean 24 hour responses similar to twice \ndaily dosing on the same total dose. \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of Irbesartan Zentiva is evident within 1-2 weeks, with the \nmaximal effect occurring by 4-6 weeks after start of therapy. The antihypertensive effects are \nmaintained during long term therapy. After withdrawal of therapy, blood pressure gradually returns \ntoward baseline. Rebound hypertension has not been observed. \nThe blood pressure lowering effects of irbesartan and thiazide-type diuretics are additive. In patients \nnot adequately controlled by irbesartan alone, the addition of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide \n(12.5 mg) to irbesartan once daily results in a further placebo-adjusted blood pressure reduction at \ntrough of 7-10/3-6 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic). \nThe efficacy of Irbesartan Zentiva is not influenced by age or gender. As is the case with other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably \nless response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low \ndose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the antihypertensive response in black patients \napproaches that of white patients. \nThere is no clinically important effect on serum uric acid or urinary uric acid secretion. \n \nPaediatric population \nReduction of blood pressure with 0.5 mg/kg (low), 1.5 mg/kg (medium) and 4.5 mg/kg (high) target \ntitrated doses of irbesartan was evaluated in 318 hypertensive or at risk (diabetic, family history of \nhypertension) children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years over a three week period. At the end of the \nthree weeks the mean reduction from baseline in the primary efficacy variable, trough seated systolic \nblood pressure (SeSBP) was 11.7 mmHg (low dose), 9.3 mmHg (medium dose), 13.2 mmHg (high \ndose). No significant difference was apparent between these doses. Adjusted mean change of trough \nseated diastolic blood pressure (SeDBP) was as follows: 3.8 mmHg (low dose), 3.2 mmHg (medium \ndose), 5.6 mmHg (high dose). Over a subsequent two week period where patients were re-randomized \nto either active medicinal product or placebo, patients on placebo had increases of 2.4 and 2.0 mmHg \nin SeSBP and SeDBP compared to +0.1 and -0.3 mmHg changes respectively in those on all doses of \nirbesartan (see section 4.2). \n \n\nHypertension and type 2 diabetes with renal disease \n\nThe \u201cIrbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT)\u201d shows that irbesartan decreases the progression \nof renal disease in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria. IDNT was a double \nblind, controlled, morbidity and mortality trial comparing Irbesartan Zentiva, amlodipine and placebo. \nIn 1,715 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria \u2265 900 mg/day and serum creatinine \nranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dl, the long-term effects (mean 2.6 years) of Irbesartan Zentiva on the \nprogression of renal disease and all-cause mortality were examined. Patients were titrated from 75 mg \nto a maintenance dose of 300 mg Irbesartan Zentiva, from 2.5 mg to 10 mg amlodipine, or placebo as \ntolerated. Patients in all treatment groups typically received between 2 and 4 antihypertensive agents \n(e.g., diuretics, beta blockers, alpha blockers) to reach a predefined blood pressure goal of \n\u2264 135/85 mmHg or a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure if baseline was > 160 mmHg. Sixty per \ncent (60%) of patients in the placebo group reached this target blood pressure whereas this figure was \n76% and 78% in the irbesartan and amlodipine groups respectively. Irbesartan significantly reduced \nthe relative risk in the primary combined endpoint of doubling serum creatinine, end-stage renal \n\n\n\n \n\n 22 \n\ndisease (ESRD) or all-cause mortality. Approximately 33% of patients in the irbesartan group reached \nthe primary renal composite endpoint compared to 39% and 41% in the placebo and amlodipine \ngroups [20% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.024) and 23% relative risk reduction \ncompared to amlodipine (p = 0.006)]. When the individual components of the primary endpoint were \nanalysed, no effect in all cause mortality was observed, while a positive trend in the reduction in \nESRD and a significant reduction in doubling of serum creatinine were observed. \n \nSubgroups consisting of gender, race, age, duration of diabetes, baseline blood pressure, serum \ncreatinine, and albumin excretion rate were assessed for treatment effect. In the female and black \nsubgroups which represented 32% and 26% of the overall study population respectively, a renal \nbenefit was not evident, although the confidence intervals do not exclude it. As for the secondary \nendpoint of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, there was no difference among the three groups \nin the overall population, although an increased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen for women and a \ndecreased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen in males in the irbesartan group versus the placebo-\nbased regimen. An increased incidence of non-fatal MI and stroke was seen in females in the \nirbesartan-based regimen versus the amlodipine-based regimen, while hospitalization due to heart \nfailure was reduced in the overall population. However, no proper explanation for these findings in \nwomen has been identified. \n \nThe study of the \u201cEffects of Irbesartan on Microalbuminuria in Hypertensive Patients with type 2 \nDiabetes Mellitus (IRMA 2)\u201d shows that irbesartan 300 mg delays progression to overt proteinuria in \npatients with microalbuminuria. IRMA 2 was a placebo-controlled double blind morbidity study in \n590 patients with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/day) and normal renal function \n(serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dl in males and < 1.1 mg/dl in females). The study examined the long-term \neffects (2 years) of Irbesartan Zentiva on the progression to clinical (overt) proteinuria (urinary \nalbumin excretion rate (UAER) > 300 mg/day, and an increase in UAER of at least 30% from \nbaseline). The predefined blood pressure goal was \u2264 135/85 mmHg. Additional antihypertensive \nagents (excluding ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and dihydropyridine calcium \nblockers) were added as needed to help achieve the blood pressure goal. While similar blood pressure \nwas achieved in all treatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in the \nplacebo (14.9%) or in the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint of overt proteinuria, \ndemonstrating a 70% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose. An \naccompanying improvement in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not observed during the first \nthree months of treatment. The slowing in the progression to clinical proteinuria was evident as early \nas three months and continued over the 2 year period. Regression to normoalbuminuria (< 30 mg/day) \nwas more frequent in the Irbesartan Zentiva 300 mg group (34%) than in the placebo group (21%). \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs \nNephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of \ncardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of \nend-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \ndiabetic nephropathy. \nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \nresults are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy. \nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor \nor an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney \ndisease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk \nof adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the \naliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest \n\n\n\n \n\n 23 \n\n(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren \ngroup than in the placebo group. \n \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration, irbesartan is well absorbed: studies of absolute bioavailability gave values of \napproximately 60-80%. Concomitant food intake does not significantly influence the bioavailability of \nirbesartan.  \n \nDistribution \n \nPlasma protein binding is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood components. \nThe volume of distribution is 53-93 litres.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nFollowing oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma \nradioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via \nglucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide \n(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect. \n \nLinearity / non-linearity \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg (twice the maximal \nrecommended dose) was observed; the mechanism for this is unknown. Peak plasma concentrations \nare attained at 1.5-2 hours after oral administration. The total body and renal clearance are 157-\n176 and 3-3.5 ml/min, respectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. \nSteady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing \nregimen. Limited accumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily \ndosing. In a study, somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female \nhypertensive patients. However, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of \nirbesartan. No dosage adjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values \nwere also somewhat greater in older subjects (\u2265 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). \nHowever the terminal half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in \nolder people. \n \nElimination \n \nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or IV \nadministration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, and the \nremainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged irbesartan. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were evaluated in 23 hypertensive children after the administration \nof single and multiple daily doses of irbesartan (2 mg/kg) up to a maximum daily dose of 150 mg for \nfour weeks. Of those 23 children, 21 were evaluable for comparison of pharmacokinetics with adults \n(twelve children over 12 years, nine children between 6 and 12 years). Results showed that Cmax, AUC \nand clearance rates were comparable to those observed in adult patients receiving 150 mg irbesartan \ndaily. A limited accumulation of irbesartan (18%) in plasma was observed upon repeated once daily \ndosing. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 24 \n\nRenal impairment \n \nIn patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters \nof irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not \nsignificantly altered. \nStudies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThere was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In \nnon-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (\u2265 250 mg/kg/day in rats and \u2265 100 mg/kg/day in \nmacaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). \nAt very high doses (\u2265 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidney (such as interstitial \nnephritis, tubular distension, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and \ncreatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the \nhypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, \nirbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at \u2265 90 mg/kg/day, in \nmacaques at \u2265 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the \npharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the hyperplasia/ \nhypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n \nFertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at \noral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including \nmortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live \nfoetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. \nStudies in animals indicate that the radiolabelled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit foetuses. \nIrbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption were noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet. \nWhite to off-white, biconvex, and oval-shaped with a heart debossed on one side and the number 2773 \nengraved on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIrbesartan Zentiva is indicated in adults for the treatment of essential hypertension. \nIt is also indicated for the treatment of renal disease in adult patients with hypertension and type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus as part of an antihypertensive medicinal product regimen (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 \nand 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe usual recommended initial and maintenance dose is 150 mg once daily, with or without food. \nIrbesartan Zentiva at a dose of 150 mg once daily generally provides a better 24 hour blood pressure \ncontrol than 75 mg. However, initiation of therapy with 75 mg could be considered, particularly in \nhaemodialysed patients and in the elderly over 75 years. \n \nIn patients insufficiently controlled with 150 mg once daily, the dose of Irbesartan Zentiva can be \nincreased to 300 mg, or other antihypertensive agents can be added (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \nIn particular, the addition of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an additive \neffect with Irbesartan Zentiva (see section 4.5). \n \nIn hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, therapy should be initiated at 150 mg irbesartan once daily \nand titrated up to 300 mg once daily as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease. \nThe demonstration of renal benefit of Irbesartan Zentiva in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is \nbased on studies where irbesartan was used in addition to other antihypertensive agents, as needed, to \nreach target blood pressure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \n \nSpecial Populations \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower starting dose \n(75 mg) should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 27 \n\nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There is no \nclinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nOlder people \n \nAlthough consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 75 mg in patients over 75 years of \nage, dosage adjustment is not usually necessary forolder people. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Irbesartan Zentiva in children aged 0 to 18 has not been established. \nCurrently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. \n \nMethod of Administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nSecond and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n \nThe concomitant use of Irbesartan Zentiva with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in \npatients with diabetes mellitus or moderate to severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n(GFR) <60 ml/min/1.73m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n \n \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIntravascular volume depletion: symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in \npatients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, \ndiarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Irbesartan \nZentiva. \n \n\nRenovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency \nwhen patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney \nare treated with medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. While this is \nnot documented with Irbesartan Zentiva, a similar effect should be anticipated with angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. \n \n\nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Irbesartan Zentiva is used in patients with \nimpaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium and creatinine serum levels is \nrecommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of Irbesartan Zentiva in patients \nwith a recent kidney transplantation. \n \n\nHypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of irbesartan both on renal and \ncardiovascular events were not uniform across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study \nwith patients with advanced renal disease. In particular, they appeared less favourable in women and \nnon-white subjects (see section 5.1). \n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): there is evidence that the \nconcomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of \nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual \n\n\n\n \n\n 28 \n\nblockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  If dual blockade therapy is \nconsidered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to \nfrequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors and \nangiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic \nnephropathy. \n \n \nHyperkalaemia: as with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, \nhyperkalaemia may occur during the treatment with Irbesartan Zentiva, especially in the presence of \nrenal impairment, overt proteinuria due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring \nof serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \n\nLithium: the combination of lithium and Irbesartan Zentiva is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \n\nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Irbesartan Zentiva is not recommended. \n \n\nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.5). As with any \nantihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or \nischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nAs observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, irbesartan and the other angiotensin \nantagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, \npossibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nPregnancy: angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \n \nPaediatric population: irbesartan has been studied in paediatric populations aged 6 to 16 years old but \nthe current data are insufficient to support an extension of the use in children until further data become \navailable (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nLactose: patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDiuretics and other antihypertensive agents: other antihypertensive agents may increase the \nhypotensive effects of irbesartan; however Irbesartan Zentiva has been safely administered with other \nantihypertensive agents, such as beta-blockers, long-acting calcium channel blockers, and thiazide \ndiuretics. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of \nhypotension when initiating therapy with Irbesartan Zentiva (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 29 \n\nAliskiren-containing products or ACE-inhibitors: clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events \nsuch as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) \ncompared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n \nPotassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: based on experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and \nis, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \n\nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Therefore, this combination is not recommended \n(see section 4.4). If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is \nrecommended. \n \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \n\nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by coadministration of \nirbesartan. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 30 \n\nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Irbesartan Zentiva during breast-feeding, \nIrbesartan Zentiva is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety \nprofiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nIt is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its \nmetabolites in milk (for details see 5.3). \n \nFertility \n \nIrbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing \nthe first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBased on its pharmacodynamic properties, irbesartan is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use \nmachines. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness \nor weariness may occur during treatment. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn placebo-controlled trials in patients with hypertension, the overall incidence of adverse events did \nnot differ between the irbesartan (56.2%) and the placebo groups (56.5%). Discontinuation due to any \nclinical or laboratory adverse event was less frequent for irbesartan-treated patients (3.3%) than for \nplacebo-treated patients (4.5%). The incidence of adverse events was not related to dose (in the \nrecommended dose range), gender, age, race, or duration of treatment. \n \nIn diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal renal function, orthostatic \ndizziness and orthostatic hypotension were reported in 0.5% of the patients (i.e., uncommon) but in \nexcess of placebo. \n \nThe following table presents the adverse drug reactions that were reported in placebo-controlled trials \nin which 1,965 hypertensive patients received irbesartan. Terms marked with a star (*) refer to the \nadverse reactions that were additionally reported in > 2% of diabetic hypertensive patients with \nchronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria and in excess of placebo. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nAdverse reactions additionally reported from post\u2013marketing experience are also listed. These adverse \nreactions are derived from spontaneous reports. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 31 \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nNot known:  thrombocytopenia \n \nImmune system disorders \nNot known:  hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema, rash, urticaria, anaphylactic \nreaction,anaphylactic shock \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nNot known:  hyperkalaemia \n \nNervous system disorders \nCommon: dizziness, orthostatic dizziness* \nNot known: vertigo, headache \n \nEar and labyrinth disorder \nNot known: tinnitus \n \nCardiac disorders \nUncommon: tachycardia \n \nVascular disorders \nCommon: orthostatic hypotension* \nUncommon: flushing \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: cough \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea, dyspepsia/heartburn \nNot known: dysgeusia \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \nUncommon: jaundice \nNot known: hepatitis, abnormal liver function \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nNot known: leukocytoclastic vasculitis \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon: musculoskeletal pain* \nNot known: arthralgia, myalgia (in some cases associated with increased plasma creatine kinase  \n levels), muscle cramps \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nNot known:  impaired renal function including cases of renal failure in patients at risk (see \n\nsection 4.4) \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nUncommon: sexual dysfunction \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 32 \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon: fatigue \nUncommon: chest pain \n \nInvestigations: \nVery common: Hyperkalaemia* occurred more often in diabetic patients treated with irbesartan than \n\nwith placebo. In diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal \nrenal function, hyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 29.4% of the patients in the \nirbesartan 300 mg group and 22% of the patients in the placebo group. In diabetic \nhypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria, \nhyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 46.3% of the patients in the irbesartan group \nand 26.3% of the patients in the placebo group. \n\nCommon: significant increases in plasma creatine kinase were commonly observed (1.7%) in \nirbesartan treated subjects. None of these increases were associated with identifiable \nclinical musculoskeletal events. \nIn 1.7% of hypertensive patients with advanced diabetic renal disease treated with \nirbesartan, a decrease in haemoglobin*, which was not clinically significant, has been \nobserved. \n\n \nPaediatric population  \nIn a randomised trial of 318 hypertensive children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years, the following \nadverse reactions occurred in the 3-week double-blind phase: headache (7.9%), hypotension (2.2%), \ndizziness (1.9%), cough (0.9%). In the 26-week open-label period of this trial the most frequent \nlaboratory abnormalities observed were creatinine increases (6.5%) and elevated CK values in 2% of \nchild recipients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nExperience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity. The most \nlikely manifestations of overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia might \nalso occur from overdose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with \nIrbesartan Zentiva. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic \nand supportive. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated \ncharcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin-II antagonists, plain. \nATC code: C09C A04. \n \nMechanism of action \nIrbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. It is \nexpected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source \nor route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors \nresults in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma \naldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at \nthe recommended doses. Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates \n\n\n\n \n\n 33 \n\nangiotensin-II and also degrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require \nmetabolic activation for its activity. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nHypertension \n\nIrbesartan lowers blood pressure with minimal change in heart rate. The decrease in blood pressure is \ndose-related for once a day doses with a tendency towards plateau at doses above 300 mg. Doses of \n150-300 mg once daily lower supine or seated blood pressures at trough (i.e. 24 hours after dosing) by \nan average of 8-13/5-8 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) greater than those associated with placebo. \nPeak reduction of blood pressure is achieved within 3-6 hours after administration and the blood \npressure lowering effect is maintained for at least 24 hours. At 24 hours the reduction of blood \npressure was 60-70% of the corresponding peak diastolic and systolic responses at the recommended \ndoses. Once daily dosing with 150 mg produced trough and mean 24 hour responses similar to twice \ndaily dosing on the same total dose. \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of Irbesartan Zentiva is evident within 1-2 weeks, with the \nmaximal effect occurring by 4-6 weeks after start of therapy. The antihypertensive effects are \nmaintained during long term therapy. After withdrawal of therapy, blood pressure gradually returns \ntoward baseline. Rebound hypertension has not been observed. \nThe blood pressure lowering effects of irbesartan and thiazide-type diuretics are additive. In patients \nnot adequately controlled by irbesartan alone, the addition of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide \n(12.5 mg) to irbesartan once daily results in a further placebo-adjusted blood pressure reduction at \ntrough of 7-10/3-6 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic). \nThe efficacy of Irbesartan Zentiva is not influenced by age or gender. As is the case with other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably \nless response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low \ndose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the antihypertensive response in black patients \napproaches that of white patients. \nThere is no clinically important effect on serum uric acid or urinary uric acid secretion. \n \nPaediatric population \nReduction of blood pressure with 0.5 mg/kg (low), 1.5 mg/kg (medium) and 4.5 mg/kg (high) target \ntitrated doses of irbesartan was evaluated in 318 hypertensive or at risk (diabetic, family history of \nhypertension) children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years over a three week period. At the end of the \nthree weeks the mean reduction from baseline in the primary efficacy variable, trough seated systolic \nblood pressure (SeSBP) was 11.7 mmHg (low dose), 9.3 mmHg (medium dose), 13.2 mmHg (high \ndose). No significant difference was apparent between these doses. Adjusted mean change of trough \nseated diastolic blood pressure (SeDBP) was as follows: 3.8 mmHg (low dose), 3.2 mmHg (medium \ndose), 5.6 mmHg (high dose). Over a subsequent two week period where patients were re-randomized \nto either active medicinal product or placebo, patients on placebo had increases of 2.4 and 2.0 mmHg \nin SeSBP and SeDBP compared to +0.1 and -0.3 mmHg changes respectively in those on all doses of \nirbesartan (see section 4.2). \n \nHypertension and type 2 diabetes with renal disease \n\nThe \u201cIrbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT)\u201d shows that irbesartan decreases the progression \nof renal disease in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria. IDNT was a double \nblind, controlled, morbidity and mortality trial comparing Irbesartan Zentiva, amlodipine and placebo. \nIn 1,715 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria \u2265 900 mg/day and serum creatinine \nranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dl, the long-term effects (mean 2.6 years) of Irbesartan Zentiva on the \nprogression of renal disease and all-cause mortality were examined. Patients were titrated from 75 mg \nto a maintenance dose of 300 mg Irbesartan Zentiva, from 2.5 mg to 10 mg amlodipine, or placebo as \ntolerated. Patients in all treatment groups typically received between 2 and 4 antihypertensive agents \n(e.g., diuretics, beta blockers, alpha blockers) to reach a predefined blood pressure goal of \n\u2264 135/85 mmHg or a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure if baseline was > 160 mmHg. Sixty per \ncent (60%) of patients in the placebo group reached this target blood pressure whereas this figure was \n76% and 78% in the irbesartan and amlodipine groups respectively. Irbesartan significantly reduced \nthe relative risk in the primary combined endpoint of doubling serum creatinine, end-stage renal \n\n\n\n \n\n 34 \n\ndisease (ESRD) or all-cause mortality. Approximately 33% of patients in the irbesartan group reached \nthe primary renal composite endpoint compared to 39% and 41% in the placebo and amlodipine \ngroups [20% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.024) and 23% relative risk reduction \ncompared to amlodipine (p = 0.006)]. When the individual components of the primary endpoint were \nanalysed, no effect in all cause mortality was observed, while a positive trend in the reduction in \nESRD and a significant reduction in doubling of serum creatinine were observed. \n \nSubgroups consisting of gender, race, age, duration of diabetes, baseline blood pressure, serum \ncreatinine, and albumin excretion rate were assessed for treatment effect. In the female and black \nsubgroups which represented 32% and 26% of the overall study population respectively, a renal \nbenefit was not evident, although the confidence intervals do not exclude it. As for the secondary \nendpoint of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, there was no difference among the three groups \nin the overall population, although an increased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen for women and a \ndecreased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen in males in the irbesartan group versus the placebo-\nbased regimen. An increased incidence of non-fatal MI and stroke was seen in females in the \nirbesartan-based regimen versus the amlodipine-based regimen, while hospitalization due to heart \nfailure was reduced in the overall population. However, no proper explanation for these findings in \nwomen has been identified. \n \nThe study of the \u201cEffects of Irbesartan on Microalbuminuria in Hypertensive Patients with type 2 \nDiabetes Mellitus (IRMA 2)\u201d shows that irbesartan 300 mg delays progression to overt proteinuria in \npatients with microalbuminuria. IRMA 2 was a placebo-controlled double blind morbidity study in \n590 patients with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/day) and normal renal function \n(serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dl in males and < 1.1 mg/dl in females). The study examined the long-term \neffects (2 years) of Irbesartan Zentiva on the progression to clinical (overt) proteinuria (urinary \nalbumin excretion rate (UAER) > 300 mg/day, and an increase in UAER of at least 30% from \nbaseline). The predefined blood pressure goal was \u2264 135/85 mmHg. Additional antihypertensive \nagents (excluding ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and dihydropyridine calcium \nblockers) were added as needed to help achieve the blood pressure goal. While similar blood pressure \nwas achieved in all treatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in the \nplacebo (14.9%) or in the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint of overt proteinuria, \ndemonstrating a 70% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose. An \naccompanying improvement in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not observed during the first \nthree months of treatment. The slowing in the progression to clinical proteinuria was evident as early \nas three months and continued over the 2 year period. Regression to normoalbuminuria (< 30 mg/day) \nwas more frequent in the Irbesartan Zentiva 300 mg group (34%) than in the placebo group (21%). \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs \nNephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of \ncardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of \nend-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \ndiabetic nephropathy. \nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \nresults are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy. \nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor \nor an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney \ndisease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk \nof adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the \naliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest \n\n\n\n \n\n 35 \n\n(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren \ngroup than in the placebo group. \n \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration, irbesartan is well absorbed: studies of absolute bioavailability gave values of \napproximately 60-80%. Concomitant food intake does not significantly influence the bioavailability of \nirbesartan.  \n \nDistribution \n \nPlasma protein binding is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood components. \nThe volume of distribution is 53-93 litres.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nFollowing oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma \nradioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via \nglucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide \n(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect. \n \nLinearity / non-linearity \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg (twice the maximal \nrecommended dose) was observed; the mechanism for this is unknown. Peak plasma concentrations \nare attained at 1.5-2 hours after oral administration. The total body and renal clearance are 157-\n176 and 3-3.5 ml/min, respectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. \nSteady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing \nregimen. Limited accumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily \ndosing. In a study, somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female \nhypertensive patients. However, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of \nirbesartan. No dosage adjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values \nwere also somewhat greater in older subjects (\u2265 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). \nHowever the terminal half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in \nolder people. \n \nElimination \n \nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or IV \nadministration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, and the \nremainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged irbesartan. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were evaluated in 23 hypertensive children after the administration \nof single and multiple daily doses of irbesartan (2 mg/kg) up to a maximum daily dose of 150 mg for \nfour weeks. Of those 23 children, 21 were evaluable for comparison of pharmacokinetics with adults \n(twelve children over 12 years, nine children between 6 and 12 years). Results showed that Cmax, AUC \nand clearance rates were comparable to those observed in adult patients receiving 150 mg irbesartan \ndaily. A limited accumulation of irbesartan (18%) in plasma was observed upon repeated once daily \ndosing. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 36 \n\nRenal impairment \n \nIn patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters \nof irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not \nsignificantly altered. \nStudies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThere was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In \nnon-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (\u2265 250 mg/kg/day in rats and \u2265 100 mg/kg/day in \nmacaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). \nAt very high doses (\u2265 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidney (such as interstitial \nnephritis, tubular distension, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and \ncreatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the \nhypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, \nirbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at \u2265 90 mg/kg/day, in \nmacaques at \u2265 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the \npharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the hyperplasia/ \nhypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n \nFertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at \noral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including \nmortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live \nfoetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. \nStudies in animals indicate that the radiolabelled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit foetuses. \nIrbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption were noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIrbesartan Zentiva is indicated in adults for the treatment of essential hypertension. \nIt is also indicated for the treatment of renal disease in adult patients with hypertension and type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus as part of an antihypertensive medicinal product regimen (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 \nand 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe usual recommended initial and maintenance dose is 150 mg once daily, with or without food. \nIrbesartan Zentiva at a dose of 150 mg once daily generally provides a better 24 hour blood pressure \ncontrol than 75 mg. However, initiation of therapy with 75 mg could be considered, particularly in \nhaemodialysed patients and in the elderly over 75 years. \n \nIn patients insufficiently controlled with 150 mg once daily, the dose of Irbesartan Zentiva can be \nincreased to 300 mg, or other antihypertensive agents can be added (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \nIn particular, the addition of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an additive \neffect with Irbesartan Zentiva (see section 4.5). \n \nIn hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, therapy should be initiated at 150 mg irbesartan once daily \nand titrated up to 300 mg once daily as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease. \nThe demonstration of renal benefit of Irbesartan Zentiva in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is \nbased on studies where irbesartan was used in addition to other antihypertensive agents, as needed, to \nreach target blood pressure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \n \nSpecial Populations \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower starting dose \n(75 mg) should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 39 \n\nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There is no \nclinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nOlder people \n \nAlthough consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 75 mg in patients over 75 years of \nage, dosage adjustment is not usually necessary forolder people. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Irbesartan Zentiva in children aged 0 to 18 has not been established. \nCurrently available data are described in section 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. \n \nMethod of Administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nSecond and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n \nThe concomitant use of Irbesartan Zentiva with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in \npatients with diabetes mellitus or moderate to severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n(GFR) <60 ml/min/1.73m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n \n \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIntravascular volume depletion: symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in \npatients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, \ndiarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Irbesartan \nZentiva. \n \nRenovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency \nwhen patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney \nare treated with medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. While this is \nnot documented with Irbesartan Zentiva, a similar effect should be anticipated with angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Irbesartan Zentiva is used in patients with \nimpaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium and creatinine serum levels is \nrecommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of Irbesartan Zentiva in patients \nwith a recent kidney transplantation. \n \nHypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of irbesartan both on renal and \ncardiovascular events were not uniform across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study \nwith patients with advanced renal disease. In particular, they appeared less favourable in women and \nnon-white subjects (see section 5.1). \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): there is evidence that the \nconcomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of \nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual \n\n\n\n \n\n 40 \n\nblockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  If dual blockade therapy is \nconsidered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to \nfrequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors and \nangiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic \nnephropathy. \n \n \nHyperkalaemia: as with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, \nhyperkalaemia may occur during the treatment with Irbesartan Zentiva, especially in the presence of \nrenal impairment, overt proteinuria due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring \nof serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Irbesartan Zentiva is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Irbesartan Zentiva is not recommended. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.5). As with any \nantihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or \nischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nAs observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, irbesartan and the other angiotensin \nantagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, \npossibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nPregnancy: angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \n \nPaediatric population: irbesartan has been studied in paediatric populations aged 6 to 16 years old but \nthe current data are insufficient to support an extension of the use in children until further data become \navailable (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nLactose: patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDiuretics and other antihypertensive agents: other antihypertensive agents may increase the \nhypotensive effects of irbesartan; however Irbesartan Zentiva has been safely administered with other \nantihypertensive agents, such as beta-blockers, long-acting calcium channel blockers, and thiazide \ndiuretics. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of \nhypotension when initiating therapy with Irbesartan Zentiva (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 41 \n\nAliskiren-containing products and ACE-inhibitors: clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events \nsuch as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) \ncompared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n \nPotassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: based on experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and \nis, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Therefore, this combination is not recommended \n(see section 4.4). If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is \nrecommended. \n \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by coadministration of \nirbesartan. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 42 \n\nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Irbesartan Zentiva during breast-feeding, \nIrbesartan Zentiva is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety \nprofiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nIt is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its \nmetabolites in milk (for details see 5.3). \n \nFertility \n \nIrbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing \nthe first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBased on its pharmacodynamic properties, irbesartan is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use \nmachines. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness \nor weariness may occur during treatment. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn placebo-controlled trials in patients with hypertension, the overall incidence of adverse events did \nnot differ between the irbesartan (56.2%) and the placebo groups (56.5%). Discontinuation due to any \nclinical or laboratory adverse event was less frequent for irbesartan-treated patients (3.3%) than for \nplacebo-treated patients (4.5%). The incidence of adverse events was not related to dose (in the \nrecommended dose range), gender, age, race, or duration of treatment. \n \nIn diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal renal function, orthostatic \ndizziness and orthostatic hypotension were reported in 0.5% of the patients (i.e., uncommon) but in \nexcess of placebo. \n \nThe following table presents the adverse drug reactions that were reported in placebo-controlled trials \nin which 1,965 hypertensive patients received irbesartan. Terms marked with a star (*) refer to the \nadverse reactions that were additionally reported in > 2% of diabetic hypertensive patients with \nchronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria and in excess of placebo. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nAdverse reactions additionally reported from post\u2013marketing experience are also listed. These adverse \nreactions are derived from spontaneous reports. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 43 \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nNot known:  thrombocytopenia \n \nImmune system disorders \nNot known:  hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema, rash, urticaria, anaphylactic reaction, \nanaphylactic shock \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nNot known:  hyperkalaemia \n \nNervous system disorders \nCommon: dizziness, orthostatic dizziness* \nNot known: vertigo, headache \n \nEar and labyrinth disorder \nNot known: tinnitus \n \nCardiac disorders \nUncommon: tachycardia \n \nVascular disorders \nCommon: orthostatic hypotension* \nUncommon: flushing \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: cough \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea, dyspepsia/heartburn \nNot known: dysgeusia \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \nUncommon: jaundice \nNot known: hepatitis, abnormal liver function \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nNot known: leukocytoclastic vasculitis \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders  \nCommon: musculoskeletal pain* \nNot known: arthralgia, myalgia (in some cases associated with increased plasma creatine kinase  \n levels), muscle cramps \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nNot known:  impaired renal function including cases of renal failure in patients at risk (see \n\nsection 4.4) \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nUncommon: sexual dysfunction \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 44 \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon: fatigue \nUncommon: chest pain \n \nInvestigations \nVery common: Hyperkalaemia* occurred more often in diabetic patients treated with irbesartan than \n\nwith placebo. In diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal \nrenal function, hyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 29.4% of the patients in the \nirbesartan 300 mg group and 22% of the patients in the placebo group. In diabetic \nhypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria, \nhyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 46.3% of the patients in the irbesartan group \nand 26.3% of the patients in the placebo group. \n\nCommon: significant increases in plasma creatine kinase were commonly observed (1.7%) in \nirbesartan treated subjects. None of these increases were associated with identifiable \nclinical musculoskeletal events. \nIn 1.7% of hypertensive patients with advanced diabetic renal disease treated with \nirbesartan, a decrease in haemoglobin*, which was not clinically significant, has been \nobserved. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \nIn a randomised trial of 318 hypertensive children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years, the following \nadverse reactions occurred in the 3-week double-blind phase: headache (7.9%), hypotension (2.2%), \ndizziness (1.9%), cough (0.9%). In the 26-week open-label period of this trial the most frequent \nlaboratory abnormalities observed were creatinine increases (6.5%) and elevated CK values in 2% of \nchild recipients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nExperience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity. The most \nlikely manifestations of overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia might \nalso occur from overdose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with \nIrbesartan Zentiva. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic \nand supportive. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated \ncharcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin-II antagonists, plain. \nATC code: C09C A04. \n \nMechanism of action \nIrbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. It is \nexpected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source \nor route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors \nresults in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma \naldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at \nthe recommended doses. Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates \n\n\n\n \n\n 45 \n\nangiotensin-II and also degrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require \nmetabolic activation for its activity. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nHypertension \n\nIrbesartan lowers blood pressure with minimal change in heart rate. The decrease in blood pressure is \ndose-related for once a day doses with a tendency towards plateau at doses above 300 mg. Doses of \n150-300 mg once daily lower supine or seated blood pressures at trough (i.e. 24 hours after dosing) by \nan average of 8-13/5-8 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) greater than those associated with placebo. \nPeak reduction of blood pressure is achieved within 3-6 hours after administration and the blood \npressure lowering effect is maintained for at least 24 hours. At 24 hours the reduction of blood \npressure was 60-70% of the corresponding peak diastolic and systolic responses at the recommended \ndoses. Once daily dosing with 150 mg produced trough and mean 24 hour responses similar to twice \ndaily dosing on the same total dose. \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of Irbesartan Zentiva is evident within 1-2 weeks, with the \nmaximal effect occurring by 4-6 weeks after start of therapy. The antihypertensive effects are \nmaintained during long term therapy. After withdrawal of therapy, blood pressure gradually returns \ntoward baseline. Rebound hypertension has not been observed. \nThe blood pressure lowering effects of irbesartan and thiazide-type diuretics are additive. In patients \nnot adequately controlled by irbesartan alone, the addition of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide \n(12.5 mg) to irbesartan once daily results in a further placebo-adjusted blood pressure reduction at \ntrough of 7-10/3-6 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic). \nThe efficacy of Irbesartan Zentiva is not influenced by age or gender. As is the case with other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably \nless response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low \ndose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the antihypertensive response in black patients \napproaches that of white patients. \nThere is no clinically important effect on serum uric acid or urinary uric acid secretion. \n \nPaediatric population \nReduction of blood pressure with 0.5 mg/kg (low), 1.5 mg/kg (medium) and 4.5 mg/kg (high) target \ntitrated doses of irbesartan was evaluated in 318 hypertensive or at risk (diabetic, family history of \nhypertension) children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years over a three week period. At the end of the \nthree weeks the mean reduction from baseline in the primary efficacy variable, trough seated systolic \nblood pressure (SeSBP) was 11.7 mmHg (low dose), 9.3 mmHg (medium dose), 13.2 mmHg (high \ndose). No significant difference was apparent between these doses. Adjusted mean change of trough \nseated diastolic blood pressure (SeDBP) was as follows: 3.8 mmHg (low dose), 3.2 mmHg (medium \ndose), 5.6 mmHg (high dose). Over a subsequent two week period where patients were re-randomized \nto either active medicinal product or placebo, patients on placebo had increases of 2.4 and 2.0 mmHg \nin SeSBP and SeDBP compared to +0.1 and -0.3 mmHg changes respectively in those on all doses of \nirbesartan (see section 4.2). \n \nHypertension and type 2 diabetes with renal disease \n\nThe \u201cIrbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT)\u201d shows that irbesartan decreases the progression \nof renal disease in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria. IDNT was a double \nblind, controlled, morbidity and mortality trial comparing Irbesartan Zentiva, amlodipine and placebo. \nIn 1,715 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria \u2265 900 mg/day and serum creatinine \nranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dl, the long-term effects (mean 2.6 years) of Irbesartan Zentiva on the \nprogression of renal disease and all-cause mortality were examined. Patients were titrated from 75 mg \nto a maintenance dose of 300 mg Irbesartan Zentiva, from 2.5 mg to 10 mg amlodipine, or placebo as \ntolerated. Patients in all treatment groups typically received between 2 and 4 antihypertensive agents \n(e.g., diuretics, beta blockers, alpha blockers) to reach a predefined blood pressure goal of \n\u2264 135/85 mmHg or a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure if baseline was > 160 mmHg. Sixty per \ncent (60%) of patients in the placebo group reached this target blood pressure whereas this figure was \n76% and 78% in the irbesartan and amlodipine groups respectively. Irbesartan significantly reduced \nthe relative risk in the primary combined endpoint of doubling serum creatinine, end-stage renal \n\n\n\n \n\n 46 \n\ndisease (ESRD) or all-cause mortality. Approximately 33% of patients in the irbesartan group reached \nthe primary renal composite endpoint compared to 39% and 41% in the placebo and amlodipine \ngroups [20% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.024) and 23% relative risk reduction \ncompared to amlodipine (p = 0.006)]. When the individual components of the primary endpoint were \nanalysed, no effect in all cause mortality was observed, while a positive trend in the reduction in \nESRD and a significant reduction in doubling of serum creatinine were observed. \n \nSubgroups consisting of gender, race, age, duration of diabetes, baseline blood pressure, serum \ncreatinine, and albumin excretion rate were assessed for treatment effect. In the female and black \nsubgroups which represented 32% and 26% of the overall study population respectively, a renal \nbenefit was not evident, although the confidence intervals do not exclude it. As for the secondary \nendpoint of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, there was no difference among the three groups \nin the overall population, although an increased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen for women and a \ndecreased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen in males in the irbesartan group versus the placebo-\nbased regimen. An increased incidence of non-fatal MI and stroke was seen in females in the \nirbesartan-based regimen versus the amlodipine-based regimen, while hospitalization due to heart \nfailure was reduced in the overall population. However, no proper explanation for these findings in \nwomen has been identified. \n \nThe study of the \u201cEffects of Irbesartan on Microalbuminuria in Hypertensive Patients with type 2 \nDiabetes Mellitus (IRMA 2)\u201d shows that irbesartan 300 mg delays progression to overt proteinuria in \npatients with microalbuminuria. IRMA 2 was a placebo-controlled double blind morbidity study in \n590 patients with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/day) and normal renal function \n(serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dl in males and < 1.1 mg/dl in females). The study examined the long-term \neffects (2 years) of Irbesartan Zentiva on the progression to clinical (overt) proteinuria (urinary \nalbumin excretion rate (UAER) > 300 mg/day, and an increase in UAER of at least 30% from \nbaseline). The predefined blood pressure goal was \u2264 135/85 mmHg. Additional antihypertensive \nagents (excluding ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and dihydropyridine calcium \nblockers) were added as needed to help achieve the blood pressure goal. While similar blood pressure \nwas achieved in all treatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in the \nplacebo (14.9%) or in the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint of overt proteinuria, \ndemonstrating a 70% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose. An \naccompanying improvement in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not observed during the first \nthree months of treatment. The slowing in the progression to clinical proteinuria was evident as early \nas three months and continued over the 2 year period. Regression to normoalbuminuria (< 30 mg/day) \nwas more frequent in the Irbesartan Zentiva 300 mg group (34%) than in the placebo group (21%). \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs \nNephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of \ncardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of \nend-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \ndiabetic nephropathy. \nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \nresults are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy. \nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor \nor an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney \ndisease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk \nof adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the \naliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest \n\n\n\n \n\n 47 \n\n(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren \ngroup than in the placebo group. \n \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration, irbesartan is well absorbed: studies of absolute bioavailability gave values of \napproximately 60-80%. Concomitant food intake does not significantly influence the bioavailability of \nirbesartan. \n \nDistribution \n \n Plasma protein binding is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood components. \nThe volume of distribution is 53 - 93 litres.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nFollowing oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma \nradioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via \nglucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide \n(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect. \n \nLinearity / non-linearity \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg (twice the maximal \nrecommended dose) was observed; the mechanism for this is unknown. Peak plasma concentrations \nare attained at 1.5 - 2 hours after oral administration. The total body and renal clearance are 157 -\n 176 and 3 - 3.5 ml/min, respectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11 - 15 hours. \nSteady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing \nregimen. Limited accumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily \ndosing. In a study, somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female \nhypertensive patients. However, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of \nirbesartan. No dosage adjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values \nwere also somewhat greater in older subjects (\u2265 65 years) than those of young subjects (18 - 40 years). \nHowever the terminal half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in \nolder people. \n \nElimination \n \nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or IV \nadministration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, and the \nremainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged irbesartan. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were evaluated in 23 hypertensive children after the administration \nof single and multiple daily doses of irbesartan (2 mg/kg) up to a maximum daily dose of 150 mg for \nfour weeks. Of those 23 children, 21 were evaluable for comparison of pharmacokinetics with adults \n(twelve children over 12 years, nine children between 6 and 12 years). Results showed that Cmax, AUC \nand clearance rates were comparable to those observed in adult patients receiving 150 mg irbesartan \ndaily. A limited accumulation of irbesartan (18%) in plasma was observed upon repeated once daily \ndosing. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 48 \n\nRenal impairment \n \nIn  patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters \nof irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIn  patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not \nsignificantly altered.  \nStudies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThere was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In \nnon-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (\u2265 250 mg/kg/day in rats and \u2265 100 mg/kg/day in \nmacaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). \nAt very high doses (\u2265 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidney (such as interstitial \nnephritis, tubular distension, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and \ncreatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the \nhypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, \nirbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at \u2265 90 mg/kg/day, in \nmacaques at \u2265 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the \npharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the hyperplasia/ \nhypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n \nFertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at \noral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including \nmortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live \nfoetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. \nStudies in animals indicate that the radiolabelled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit foetuses. \nIrbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption were noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIrbesartan Zentiva is indicated in adults for the treatment of essential hypertension. \nIt is also indicated for the treatment of renal disease in adult patients with hypertension and type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus as part of an antihypertensive medicinal product regimen (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 \nand 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe usual recommended initial and maintenance dose is 150 mg once daily, with or without food. \nIrbesartan Zentiva at a dose of 150 mg once daily generally provides a better 24 hour blood pressure \ncontrol than 75 mg. However, initiation of therapy with 75 mg could be considered, particularly in \nhaemodialysed patients and in the elderly over 75 years. \n \nIn patients insufficiently controlled with 150 mg once daily, the dose of Irbesartan Zentiva can be \nincreased to 300 mg, or other antihypertensive agents can be added (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \nIn particular, the addition of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an additive \neffect with Irbesartan Zentiva (see section 4.5). \n \nIn hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, therapy should be initiated at 150 mg irbesartan once daily \nand titrated up to 300 mg once daily as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease. \nThe demonstration of renal benefit of Irbesartan Zentiva in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is \nbased on studies where irbesartan was used in addition to other antihypertensive agents, as needed, to \nreach target blood pressure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \n \nSpecial Populations \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower starting dose \n(75 mg) should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 51 \n\nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There is no \nclinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nOlder people \n \nAlthough consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 75 mg in patients over 75 years of \nage, dosage adjustment is not usually necessary forolder people. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Irbesartan Zentiva in children aged 0 to 18 has not been established. \nCurrently available data are described in section 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. \n \nMethod of Administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nSecond and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n \nThe concomitant use of Irbesartan Zentiva with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in \npatients with diabetes mellitus or moderate to severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n(GFR) <60 ml/min/1.73m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIntravascular volume depletion: symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in \npatients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, \ndiarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Irbesartan \nZentiva. \n \nRenovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency \nwhen patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney \nare treated with medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. While this is \nnot documented with Irbesartan Zentiva, a similar effect should be anticipated with angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Irbesartan Zentiva is used in patients with \nimpaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium and creatinine serum levels is \nrecommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of Irbesartan Zentiva in patients \nwith a recent kidney transplantation. \n \nHypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of irbesartan both on renal and \ncardiovascular events were not uniform across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study \nwith patients with advanced renal disease. In particular, they appeared less favourable in women and \nnon-white subjects (see section 5.1). \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): there is evidence that the \nconcomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of \nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual \nblockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \n\n\n\n \n\n 52 \n\naliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  If dual blockade therapy is \nconsidered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to \nfrequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors and \nangiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic \nnephropathy. \n \n \nHyperkalaemia: as with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, \nhyperkalaemia may occur during the treatment with Irbesartan Zentiva, especially in the presence of \nrenal impairment, overt proteinuria due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring \nof serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Irbesartan Zentiva is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Irbesartan Zentiva is not recommended. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.5). As with any \nantihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or \nischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nAs observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, irbesartan and the other angiotensin \nantagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, \npossibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nPregnancy: angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \n \nPaediatric population: irbesartan has been studied in paediatric populations aged 6 to 16 years old but \nthe current data are insufficient to support an extension of the use in children until further data become \navailable (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nLactose: patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDiuretics and other antihypertensive agents: other antihypertensive agents may increase the \nhypotensive effects of irbesartan; however Irbesartan Zentiva has been safely administered with other \nantihypertensive agents, such as beta-blockers, long-acting calcium channel blockers, and thiazide \ndiuretics. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of \nhypotension when initiating therapy with Irbesartan Zentiva (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 53 \n\nAliskiren-containing products and ACE-inhibitors:  clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events \nsuch as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) \ncompared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nPotassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: based on experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and \nis, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Therefore, this combination is not recommended \n(see section 4.4). If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is \nrecommended. \n \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by coadministration of \nirbesartan. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \n\n\n\n \n\n 54 \n\nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Irbesartan Zentiva during breast-feeding, \nIrbesartan Zentiva is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety \nprofiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nIt is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its \nmetabolites in milk (for details see 5.3). \n \nFertility \n \nIrbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing \nthe first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBased on its pharmacodynamic properties, irbesartan is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use \nmachines. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness \nor weariness may occur during treatment. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn placebo-controlled trials in patients with hypertension, the overall incidence of adverse events did \nnot differ between the irbesartan (56.2%) and the placebo groups (56.5%). Discontinuation due to any \nclinical or laboratory adverse event was less frequent for irbesartan-treated patients (3.3%) than for \nplacebo-treated patients (4.5%). The incidence of adverse events was not related to dose (in the \nrecommended dose range), gender, age, race, or duration of treatment. \n \nIn diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal renal function, orthostatic \ndizziness and orthostatic hypotension were reported in 0.5% of the patients (i.e., uncommon) but in \nexcess of placebo. \n \nThe following table presents the adverse drug reactions that were reported in placebo-controlled trials \nin which 1,965 hypertensive patients received irbesartan. Terms marked with a star (*) refer to the \nadverse reactions that were additionally reported in > 2% of diabetic hypertensive patients with \nchronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria and in excess of placebo. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nAdverse reactions additionally reported from post\u2013marketing experience are also listed. These adverse \nreactions are derived from spontaneous reports. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 55 \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nNot known:  thrombocytopenia \n \nImmune system disorders \nNot known:  hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema, rash, urticaria, anaphylactic reaction, \nanaphylactic shock \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nNot known:  hyperkalaemia \n \nNervous system disorders \nCommon: dizziness, orthostatic dizziness* \nNot known: vertigo, headache \n \nEar and labyrinth disorder \nNot known: tinnitus \n \nCardiac disorders \nUncommon: tachycardia \n \nVascular disorders \nCommon: orthostatic hypotension* \nUncommon: flushing \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: cough \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea, dyspepsia/heartburn \nNot known: dysgeusia \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \nUncommon: jaundice \nNot known: hepatitis, abnormal liver function \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nNot known: leukocytoclastic vasculitis \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders  \nCommon: musculoskeletal pain* \nNot known: arthralgia, myalgia (in some cases associated with increased plasma creatine kinase  \n levels), muscle cramps \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nNot known:  impaired renal function including cases of renal failure in patients at risk (see \n\nsection 4.4) \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nUncommon: sexual dysfunction \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 56 \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon: fatigue \nUncommon: chest pain \n \nInvestigations \nVery common: Hyperkalaemia* occurred more often in diabetic patients treated with irbesartan than \n\nwith placebo. In diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal \nrenal function, hyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 29.4% of the patients in the \nirbesartan 300 mg group and 22% of the patients in the placebo group. In diabetic \nhypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria, \nhyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 46.3% of the patients in the irbesartan group \nand 26.3% of the patients in the placebo group. \n\nCommon: significant increases in plasma creatine kinase were commonly observed (1.7%) in \nirbesartan treated subjects. None of these increases were associated with identifiable \nclinical musculoskeletal events. \nIn 1.7% of hypertensive patients with advanced diabetic renal disease treated with \nirbesartan, a decrease in haemoglobin*, which was not clinically significant, has been \nobserved. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \nIn a randomised trial of 318 hypertensive children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years, the following \nadverse reactions occurred in the 3-week double-blind phase: headache (7.9%), hypotension (2.2%), \ndizziness (1.9%), cough (0.9%). In the 26-week open-label period of this trial the most frequent \nlaboratory abnormalities observed were creatinine increases (6.5%) and elevated CK values in 2% of \nchild recipients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nExperience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity. The most \nlikely manifestations of overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia might \nalso occur from overdose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with \nIrbesartan Zentiva. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic \nand supportive. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated \ncharcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin-II antagonists, plain. \nATC code: C09C A04. \n \nMechanism of action  \nIrbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. It is \nexpected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source \nor route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors \nresults in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma \naldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at \nthe recommended doses. Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates \n\n\n\n \n\n 57 \n\nangiotensin-II and also degrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require \nmetabolic activation for its activity. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nHypertension \nIrbesartan lowers blood pressure with minimal change in heart rate. The decrease in blood pressure is \ndose-related for once a day doses with a tendency towards plateau at doses above 300 mg. Doses of \n150-300 mg once daily lower supine or seated blood pressures at trough (i.e. 24 hours after dosing) by \nan average of 8-13/5-8 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) greater than those associated with placebo. \nPeak reduction of blood pressure is achieved within 3-6 hours after administration and the blood \npressure lowering effect is maintained for at least 24 hours. At 24 hours the reduction of blood \npressure was 60-70% of the corresponding peak diastolic and systolic responses at the recommended \ndoses. Once daily dosing with 150 mg produced trough and mean 24 hour responses similar to twice \ndaily dosing on the same total dose. \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of Irbesartan Zentiva is evident within 1-2 weeks, with the \nmaximal effect occurring by 4-6 weeks after start of therapy. The antihypertensive effects are \nmaintained during long term therapy. After withdrawal of therapy, blood pressure gradually returns \ntoward baseline. Rebound hypertension has not been observed. \nThe blood pressure lowering effects of irbesartan and thiazide-type diuretics are additive. In patients \nnot adequately controlled by irbesartan alone, the addition of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide \n(12.5 mg) to irbesartan once daily results in a further placebo-adjusted blood pressure reduction at \ntrough of 7-10/3-6 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic). \nThe efficacy of Irbesartan Zentiva is not influenced by age or gender. As is the case with other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably \nless response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low \ndose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the antihypertensive response in black patients \napproaches that of white patients. \nThere is no clinically important effect on serum uric acid or urinary uric acid secretion. \n \nPaediatric population \nReduction of blood pressure with 0.5 mg/kg (low), 1.5 mg/kg (medium) and 4.5 mg/kg (high) target \ntitrated doses of irbesartan was evaluated in 318 hypertensive or at risk (diabetic, family history of \nhypertension) children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years over a three week period. At the end of the \nthree weeks the mean reduction from baseline in the primary efficacy variable, trough seated systolic \nblood pressure (SeSBP) was 11.7 mmHg (low dose), 9.3 mmHg (medium dose), 13.2 mmHg (high \ndose). No significant difference was apparent between these doses. Adjusted mean change of trough \nseated diastolic blood pressure (SeDBP) was as follows: 3.8 mmHg (low dose), 3.2 mmHg (medium \ndose), 5.6 mmHg (high dose). Over a subsequent two week period where patients were re-randomized \nto either active medicinal product or placebo, patients on placebo had increases of 2.4 and 2.0 mmHg \nin SeSBP and SeDBP compared to +0.1 and -0.3 mmHg changes respectively in those on all doses of \nirbesartan (see section 4.2). \n \nHypertension and type 2 diabetes with renal disease \n\nThe \u201cIrbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT)\u201d shows that irbesartan decreases the progression \nof renal disease in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria. IDNT was a double \nblind, controlled, morbidity and mortality trial comparing Irbesartan Zentiva, amlodipine and placebo. \nIn 1,715 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria \u2265 900 mg/day and serum creatinine \nranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dl, the long-term effects (mean 2.6 years) of Irbesartan Zentiva on the \nprogression of renal disease and all-cause mortality were examined. Patients were titrated from 75 mg \nto a maintenance dose of 300 mg Irbesartan Zentiva, from 2.5 mg to 10 mg amlodipine, or placebo as \ntolerated. Patients in all treatment groups typically received between 2 and 4 antihypertensive agents \n(e.g., diuretics, beta blockers, alpha blockers) to reach a predefined blood pressure goal of \n\u2264 135/85 mmHg or a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure if baseline was > 160 mmHg. Sixty per \ncent (60%) of patients in the placebo group reached this target blood pressure whereas this figure was \n76% and 78% in the irbesartan and amlodipine groups respectively. Irbesartan significantly reduced \nthe relative risk in the primary combined endpoint of doubling serum creatinine, end-stage renal \n\n\n\n \n\n 58 \n\ndisease (ESRD) or all-cause mortality. Approximately 33% of patients in the irbesartan group reached \nthe primary renal composite endpoint compared to 39% and 41% in the placebo and amlodipine \ngroups [20% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.024) and 23% relative risk reduction \ncompared to amlodipine (p = 0.006)]. When the individual components of the primary endpoint were \nanalysed, no effect in all cause mortality was observed, while a positive trend in the reduction in \nESRD and a significant reduction in doubling of serum creatinine were observed. \n \nSubgroups consisting of gender, race, age, duration of diabetes, baseline blood pressure, serum \ncreatinine, and albumin excretion rate were assessed for treatment effect. In the female and black \nsubgroups which represented 32% and 26% of the overall study population respectively, a renal \nbenefit was not evident, although the confidence intervals do not exclude it. As for the secondary \nendpoint of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, there was no difference among the three groups \nin the overall population, although an increased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen for women and a \ndecreased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen in males in the irbesartan group versus the placebo-\nbased regimen. An increased incidence of non-fatal MI and stroke was seen in females in the \nirbesartan-based regimen versus the amlodipine-based regimen, while hospitalization due to heart \nfailure was reduced in the overall population. However, no proper explanation for these findings in \nwomen has been identified. \n \nThe study of the \u201cEffects of Irbesartan on Microalbuminuria in Hypertensive Patients with type 2 \nDiabetes Mellitus (IRMA 2)\u201d shows that irbesartan 300 mg delays progression to overt proteinuria in \npatients with microalbuminuria. IRMA 2 was a placebo-controlled double blind morbidity study in \n590 patients with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/day) and normal renal function \n(serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dl in males and < 1.1 mg/dl in females). The study examined the long-term \neffects (2 years) of Irbesartan Zentiva on the progression to clinical (overt) proteinuria (urinary \nalbumin excretion rate (UAER) > 300 mg/day, and an increase in UAER of at least 30% from \nbaseline). The predefined blood pressure goal was \u2264 135/85 mmHg. Additional antihypertensive \nagents (excluding ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and dihydropyridine calcium \nblockers) were added as needed to help achieve the blood pressure goal. While similar blood pressure \nwas achieved in all treatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in the \nplacebo (14.9%) or in the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint of overt proteinuria, \ndemonstrating a 70% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose. An \naccompanying improvement in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not observed during the first \nthree months of treatment. The slowing in the progression to clinical proteinuria was evident as early \nas three months and continued over the 2 year period. Regression to normoalbuminuria (< 30 mg/day) \nwas more frequent in the Irbesartan Zentiva 300 mg group (34%) than in the placebo group (21%). \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs \nNephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of \ncardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of \nend-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \ndiabetic nephropathy. \nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \nresults are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy. \nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor \nor an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney \ndisease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk \nof adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the \naliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest \n\n\n\n \n\n 59 \n\n(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren \ngroup than in the placebo group. \n \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration, irbesartan is well absorbed: studies of absolute bioavailability gave values of \napproximately 60-80%. Concomitant food intake does not significantly influence the bioavailability of \nirbesartan.  \n \nDistribution \n \nPlasma protein binding is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood components. \nThe volume of distribution is 53 - 93 litres.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nFollowing oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma \nradioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via \nglucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide \n(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect. \n \nLinearity / non-linearity \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg (twice the maximal \nrecommended dose) was observed; the mechanism for this is unknown. Peak plasma concentrations \nare attained at 1.5 - 2 hours after oral administration. The total body and renal clearance are 157 -\n 176 and 3 - 3.5 ml/min, respectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11 - 15 hours. \nSteady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing \nregimen. Limited accumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily \ndosing. In a study, somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female \nhypertensive patients. However, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of \nirbesartan. No dosage adjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values \nwere also somewhat greater in older subjects (\u2265 65 years) than those of young subjects (18 - 40 years). \nHowever the terminal half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in \nolder people. \n \nElimination \n \nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or IV \nadministration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, and the \nremainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged irbesartan. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were evaluated in 23 hypertensive children after the administration \nof single and multiple daily doses of irbesartan (2 mg/kg) up to a maximum daily dose of 150 mg for \nfour weeks. Of those 23 children, 21 were evaluable for comparison of pharmacokinetics with adults \n(twelve children over 12 years, nine children between 6 and 12 years). Results showed that Cmax, AUC \nand clearance rates were comparable to those observed in adult patients receiving 150 mg irbesartan \ndaily. A limited accumulation of irbesartan (18%) in plasma was observed upon repeated once daily \ndosing. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 60 \n\nRenal impairment \n \nIn patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters \nof irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not \nsignificantly altered.  \nStudies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThere was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In \nnon-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (\u2265 250 mg/kg/day in rats and \u2265 100 mg/kg/day in \nmacaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). \nAt very high doses (\u2265 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidney (such as interstitial \nnephritis, tubular distension, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and \ncreatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the \nhypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, \nirbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at \u2265 90 mg/kg/day, in \nmacaques at \u2265 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the \npharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the hyperplasia/ \nhypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n \nFertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at \noral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including \nmortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live \nfoetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. \nStudies in animals indicate that the radiolabelled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit foetuses. \nIrbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption were noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIrbesartan Zentiva is indicated in adults for the treatment of essential hypertension. \nIt is also indicated for the treatment of renal disease in adult patients with hypertension and type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus as part of an antihypertensive medicinal product regimen (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 \nand 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe usual recommended initial and maintenance dose is 150 mg once daily, with or without food. \nIrbesartan Zentiva at a dose of 150 mg once daily generally provides a better 24 hour blood pressure \ncontrol than 75 mg. However, initiation of therapy with 75 mg could be considered, particularly in \nhaemodialysed patients and in the elderly over 75 years. \n \nIn patients insufficiently controlled with 150 mg once daily, the dose of Irbesartan Zentiva can be \nincreased to 300 mg, or other antihypertensive agents can be added (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1).. \nIn particular, the addition of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an additive \neffect with Irbesartan Zentiva (see section 4.5). \n \nIn hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, therapy should be initiated at 150 mg irbesartan once daily \nand titrated up to 300 mg once daily as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease. \nThe demonstration of renal benefit of Irbesartan Zentiva in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is \nbased on studies where irbesartan was used in addition to other antihypertensive agents, as needed, to \nreach target blood pressure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \n \nSpecial Populations \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower starting dose \n(75 mg) should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 63 \n\nHepatic impairment \n \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There is no \nclinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nOlder people \n \nAlthough consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 75 mg in patients over 75 years of \nage, dosage adjustment is not usually necessary forolder people. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Irbesartan Zentiva in children aged 0 to 18 has not been established. \nCurrently available data are described in section 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. \n \nMethod of Administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nSecond and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n \nThe concomitant use of Irbesaratn Zentiva with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in \npatients with diabetes mellitus or moderate to severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n(GFR) <60 ml/min/1.73m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIntravascular volume depletion: symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in \npatients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, \ndiarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Irbesartan \nZentiva. \n \nRenovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency \nwhen patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney \nare treated with medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. While this is \nnot documented with Irbesartan Zentiva, a similar effect should be anticipated with angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Irbesartan Zentiva is used in patients with \nimpaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium and creatinine serum levels is \nrecommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of Irbesartan Zentiva in patients \nwith a recent kidney transplantation. \n \nHypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of irbesartan both on renal and \ncardiovascular events were not uniform across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study \nwith patients with advanced renal disease. In particular, they appeared less favourable in women and \nnon-white subjects (see section 5.1). \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): there is evidence that the \nconcomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of \nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual \nblockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  If dual blockade therapy is \n\n\n\n \n\n 64 \n\nconsidered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to \nfrequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors and \nangiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic \nnephropathy. \n \nHyperkalaemia: as with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, \nhyperkalaemia may occur during the treatment with Irbesartan Zentiva, especially in the presence of \nrenal impairment, overt proteinuria due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring \nof serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Irbesartan Zentiva is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Irbesartan Zentiva is not recommended. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.5). As with any \nantihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or \nischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nAs observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, irbesartan and the other angiotensin \nantagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, \npossibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nPregnancy: angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \nPaediatric population: irbesartan has been studied in paediatric populations aged 6 to 16 years old but \nthe current data are insufficient to support an extension of the use in children until further data become \navailable (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nLactose: patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDiuretics and other antihypertensive agents: other antihypertensive agents may increase the \nhypotensive effects of irbesartan; however Irbesartan Zentiva has been safely administered with other \nantihypertensive agents, such as beta-blockers, long-acting calcium channel blockers, and thiazide \ndiuretics. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of \nhypotension when initiating therapy with Irbesartan Zentiva (see section 4.4). \n \nAliskiren-containing products and ACE-inhibitors: clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events \n\n\n\n \n\n 65 \n\nsuch as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) \ncompared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nPotassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: based on experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and \nis, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Therefore, this combination is not recommended \n(see section 4.4). If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is \nrecommended. \n \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by coadministration of \nirbesartan. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \n\n\n\n \n\n 66 \n\nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Irbesartan Zentiva during breast-feeding, \nIrbesartan Zentiva is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety \nprofiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nIt is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its \nmetabolites in milk (for details see 5.3). \n \nFertility \n \nIrbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing \nthe first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBased on its pharmacodynamic properties, irbesartan is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use \nmachines. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness \nor weariness may occur during treatment. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIn placebo-controlled trials in patients with hypertension, the overall incidence of adverse events did \nnot differ between the irbesartan (56.2%) and the placebo groups (56.5%). Discontinuation due to any \nclinical or laboratory adverse event was less frequent for irbesartan-treated patients (3.3%) than for \nplacebo-treated patients (4.5%). The incidence of adverse events was not related to dose (in the \nrecommended dose range), gender, age, race, or duration of treatment. \n \nIn diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal renal function, orthostatic \ndizziness and orthostatic hypotension were reported in 0.5% of the patients (i.e., uncommon) but in \nexcess of placebo. \n \nThe following table presents the adverse drug reactions that were reported in placebo-controlled trials \nin which 1,965 hypertensive patients received irbesartan. Terms marked with a star (*) refer to the \nadverse reactions that were additionally reported in > 2% of diabetic hypertensive patients with \nchronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria and in excess of placebo. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nAdverse reactions additionally reported from post\u2013marketing experience are also listed. These adverse \nreactions are derived from spontaneous reports. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 67 \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nNot known:  thrombocytopenia \n \nImmune system disorders \nNot known:  hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema, rash, urticaria, anaphylactic reaction, \nanaphylactic shock \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nNot known:  hyperkalaemia \n \nNervous system disorders \nCommon: dizziness, orthostatic dizziness* \nNot known: vertigo, headache \n \nEar and labyrinth disorder \nNot known: tinnitus \n \nCardiac disorders \nUncommon: tachycardia \n \nVascular disorders \nCommon: orthostatic hypotension* \nUncommon: flushing \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: cough \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea, dyspepsia/heartburn \nNot known: dysgeusia \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \nUncommon: jaundice \nNot known: hepatitis, abnormal liver function \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nNot known: leukocytoclastic vasculitis \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon: musculoskeletal pain* \nNot known: arthralgia, myalgia (in some cases associated with increased plasma creatine kinase  \n levels), muscle cramps \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nNot known:  impaired renal function including cases of renal failure in patients at risk (see \n\nsection 4.4) \n \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nUncommon: sexual dysfunction \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 68 \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon: fatigue \nUncommon: chest pain \n \nInvestigations \nVery common: Hyperkalaemia* occurred more often in diabetic patients treated with irbesartan than \n\nwith placebo. In diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal \nrenal function, hyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 29.4% of the patients in the \nirbesartan 300 mg group and 22% of the patients in the placebo group. In diabetic \nhypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria, \nhyperkalaemia (\u2265 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 46.3% of the patients in the irbesartan group \nand 26.3% of the patients in the placebo group. \n\nCommon: significant increases in plasma creatine kinase were commonly observed (1.7%) in \nirbesartan treated subjects. None of these increases were associated with identifiable \nclinical musculoskeletal events. \nIn 1.7% of hypertensive patients with advanced diabetic renal disease treated with \nirbesartan, a decrease in haemoglobin*, which was not clinically significant, has been \nobserved. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \nIn a randomised trial of 318 hypertensive children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years, the following \nadverse reactions occurred in the 3-week double-blind phase: headache (7.9%), hypotension (2.2%), \ndizziness (1.9%), cough (0.9%). In the 26-week open-label period of this trial the most frequent \nlaboratory abnormalities observed were creatinine increases (6.5%) and elevated CK values in 2% of \nchild recipients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nExperience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity. The most \nlikely manifestations of overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia might \nalso occur from overdose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with \nIrbesartan Zentiva. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic \nand supportive. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated \ncharcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin-II antagonists, plain. \nATC code: C09C A04. \n \nMechanism of action \nIrbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. It is \nexpected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source \nor route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors \nresults in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma \naldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at \nthe recommended doses. Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates \n\n\n\n \n\n 69 \n\nangiotensin-II and also degrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require \nmetabolic activation for its activity. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nHypertension \n\nIrbesartan lowers blood pressure with minimal change in heart rate. The decrease in blood pressure is \ndose-related for once a day doses with a tendency towards plateau at doses above 300 mg. Doses of \n150-300 mg once daily lower supine or seated blood pressures at trough (i.e. 24 hours after dosing) by \nan average of 8-13/5-8 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) greater than those associated with placebo. \nPeak reduction of blood pressure is achieved within 3-6 hours after administration and the blood \npressure lowering effect is maintained for at least 24 hours. At 24 hours the reduction of blood \npressure was 60-70% of the corresponding peak diastolic and systolic responses at the recommended \ndoses. Once daily dosing with 150 mg produced trough and mean 24 hour responses similar to twice \ndaily dosing on the same total dose. \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of Irbesartan Zentiva is evident within 1-2 weeks, with the \nmaximal effect occurring by 4-6 weeks after start of therapy. The antihypertensive effects are \nmaintained during long term therapy. After withdrawal of therapy, blood pressure gradually returns \ntoward baseline. Rebound hypertension has not been observed. \nThe blood pressure lowering effects of irbesartan and thiazide-type diuretics are additive. In patients \nnot adequately controlled by irbesartan alone, the addition of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide \n(12.5 mg) to irbesartan once daily results in a further placebo-adjusted blood pressure reduction at \ntrough of 7-10/3-6 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic). \nThe efficacy of Irbesartan Zentiva is not influenced by age or gender. As is the case with other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably \nless response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low \ndose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the antihypertensive response in black patients \napproaches that of white patients. \nThere is no clinically important effect on serum uric acid or urinary uric acid secretion. \n \nPaediatric population \nReduction of blood pressure with 0.5 mg/kg (low), 1.5 mg/kg (medium) and 4.5 mg/kg (high) target \ntitrated doses of irbesartan was evaluated in 318 hypertensive or at risk (diabetic, family history of \nhypertension) children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years over a three week period. At the end of the \nthree weeks the mean reduction from baseline in the primary efficacy variable, trough seated systolic \nblood pressure (SeSBP) was 11.7 mmHg (low dose), 9.3 mmHg (medium dose), 13.2 mmHg (high \ndose). No significant difference was apparent between these doses. Adjusted mean change of trough \nseated diastolic blood pressure (SeDBP) was as follows: 3.8 mmHg (low dose), 3.2 mmHg (medium \ndose), 5.6 mmHg (high dose). Over a subsequent two week period where patients were re-randomized \nto either active medicinal product or placebo, patients on placebo had increases of 2.4 and 2.0 mmHg \nin SeSBP and SeDBP compared to +0.1 and -0.3 mmHg changes respectively in those on all doses of \nirbesartan (see section 4.2). \n \nHypertension and type 2 diabetes with renal disease \n\nThe \u201cIrbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT)\u201d shows that irbesartan decreases the progression \nof renal disease in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria. IDNT was a double \nblind, controlled, morbidity and mortality trial comparing Irbesartan Zentiva, amlodipine and placebo. \nIn 1,715 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria \u2265 900 mg/day and serum creatinine \nranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dl, the long-term effects (mean 2.6 years) of Irbesartan Zentiva on the \nprogression of renal disease and all-cause mortality were examined. Patients were titrated from 75 mg \nto a maintenance dose of 300 mg Irbesartan Zentiva, from 2.5 mg to 10 mg amlodipine, or placebo as \ntolerated. Patients in all treatment groups typically received between 2 and 4 antihypertensive agents \n(e.g., diuretics, beta blockers, alpha blockers) to reach a predefined blood pressure goal of \n\u2264 135/85 mmHg or a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure if baseline was > 160 mmHg. Sixty per \ncent (60%) of patients in the placebo group reached this target blood pressure whereas this figure was \n76% and 78% in the irbesartan and amlodipine groups respectively. Irbesartan significantly reduced \nthe relative risk in the primary combined endpoint of doubling serum creatinine, end-stage renal \n\n\n\n \n\n 70 \n\ndisease (ESRD) or all-cause mortality. Approximately 33% of patients in the irbesartan group reached \nthe primary renal composite endpoint compared to 39% and 41% in the placebo and amlodipine \ngroups [20% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.024) and 23% relative risk reduction \ncompared to amlodipine (p = 0.006)]. When the individual components of the primary endpoint were \nanalysed, no effect in all cause mortality was observed, while a positive trend in the reduction in \nESRD and a significant reduction in doubling of serum creatinine were observed. \n \nSubgroups consisting of gender, race, age, duration of diabetes, baseline blood pressure, serum \ncreatinine, and albumin excretion rate were assessed for treatment effect. In the female and black \nsubgroups which represented 32% and 26% of the overall study population respectively, a renal \nbenefit was not evident, although the confidence intervals do not exclude it. As for the secondary \nendpoint of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, there was no difference among the three groups \nin the overall population, although an increased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen for women and a \ndecreased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen in males in the irbesartan group versus the placebo-\nbased regimen. An increased incidence of non-fatal MI and stroke was seen in females in the \nirbesartan-based regimen versus the amlodipine-based regimen, while hospitalization due to heart \nfailure was reduced in the overall population. However, no proper explanation for these findings in \nwomen has been identified. \n \nThe study of the \u201cEffects of Irbesartan on Microalbuminuria in Hypertensive Patients with type 2 \nDiabetes Mellitus (IRMA 2)\u201d shows that irbesartan 300 mg delays progression to overt proteinuria in \npatients with microalbuminuria. IRMA 2 was a placebo-controlled double blind morbidity study in \n590 patients with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/day) and normal renal function \n(serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dl in males and < 1.1 mg/dl in females). The study examined the long-term \neffects (2 years) of Irbesartan Zentiva on the progression to clinical (overt) proteinuria (urinary \nalbumin excretion rate (UAER) > 300 mg/day, and an increase in UAER of at least 30% from \nbaseline). The predefined blood pressure goal was \u2264 135/85 mmHg. Additional antihypertensive \nagents (excluding ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and dihydropyridine calcium \nblockers) were added as needed to help achieve the blood pressure goal. While similar blood pressure \nwas achieved in all treatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in the \nplacebo (14.9%) or in the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint of overt proteinuria, \ndemonstrating a 70% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose. An \naccompanying improvement in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not observed during the first \nthree months of treatment. The slowing in the progression to clinical proteinuria was evident as early \nas three months and continued over the 2 year period. Regression to normoalbuminuria (< 30 mg/day) \nwas more frequent in the Irbesartan Zentiva 300 mg group (34%) than in the placebo group (21%). \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs \nNephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of \ncardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of \nend-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \ndiabetic nephropathy. \nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \nresults are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy. \nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor \nor an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney \ndisease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk \nof adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the \naliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest \n\n\n\n \n\n 71 \n\n(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren \ngroup than in the placebo group. \n \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration, irbesartan is well absorbed: studies of absolute bioavailability gave values of \napproximately 60-80%. Concomitant food intake does not significantly influence the bioavailability of \nirbesartan.  \n \nDistribution \n \nPlasma protein binding is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood components. \nThe volume of distribution is 53 - 93 litres.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nFollowing oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma \nradioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via \nglucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide \n(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect. \n \nLinearity / non-linearity \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg (twice the maximal \nrecommended dose) was observed; the mechanism for this is unknown. Peak plasma concentrations \nare attained at 1.5 - 2 hours after oral administration. The total body and renal clearance are 157 -\n 176 and 3 - 3.5 ml/min, respectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11 - 15 hours. \nSteady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing \nregimen. Limited accumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily \ndosing. In a study, somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female \nhypertensive patients. However, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of \nirbesartan. No dosage adjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values \nwere also somewhat greater in oldersubjects (\u2265 65 years) than those of young subjects (18 - 40 years). \nHowever the terminal half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in \nolder people. \n \nElimination \n \nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or IV \nadministration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, and the \nremainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged irbesartan. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were evaluated in 23 hypertensive children after the administration \nof single and multiple daily doses of irbesartan (2 mg/kg) up to a maximum daily dose of 150 mg for \nfour weeks. Of those 23 children, 21 were evaluable for comparison of pharmacokinetics with adults \n(twelve children over 12 years, nine children between 6 and 12 years). Results showed that Cmax, AUC \nand clearance rates were comparable to those observed in adult patients receiving 150 mg irbesartan \ndaily. A limited accumulation of irbesartan (18%) in plasma was observed upon repeated once daily \ndosing. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 72 \n\nRenal impairment \n \nIn  patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters \nof irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not \nsignificantly altered.  \nStudies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThere was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In \nnon-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (\u2265 250 mg/kg/day in rats and \u2265 100 mg/kg/day in \nmacaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). \nAt very high doses (\u2265 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidney (such as interstitial \nnephritis, tubular distension, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and \ncreatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the \nhypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, \nirbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at \u2265 90 mg/kg/day, in \nmacaques at \u2265 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the \npharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the hyperplasia/ \nhypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n \nFertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at \noral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including \nmortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live \nfoetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. \nStudies in animals indicate that the radiolabelled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit foetuses. \nIrbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption were noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n \n\n 100 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \nIrbesartan Zentiva 75 mg tablets \n\nirbesartan \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n\u25aa Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\u25aa If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\u25aa This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\u25aa If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

What you need to know before you take Irbesartan Zentiva \n3. How to take Irbesartan Zentiva \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Irbesartan Zentiva \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Irbesartan Zentiva is and what it is used for \n \nIrbesartan Zentiva belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. \nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body which binds to receptors in blood vessels causing \nthem to tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan Zentiva prevents the binding \nof angiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. \nIrbesartan Zentiva slows the decrease of kidney function in patients with high blood pressure and \ntype 2 diabetes. \n \nIrbesartan Zentiva is used in adult patients \n\u25aa to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension) \n\u25aa to protect the kidney in patients with high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and laboratory \n\nevidence of impaired kidney function. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Irbesartan Zentiva \n \nDo not take Irbesartan Zentiva \n\u25aa if you are allergic to irbesartan or any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n\u25aa if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Irbesartan Zentiva in early \n\npregnancy \u2013 see pregnancy section) \n\u25aa if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \n\nlowering medicine containing aliskiren.  \n \nWarning and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Irbesartan Zentiva and if any of the following apply to you: \n\u25aa if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea \n\u25aa if you suffer from kidney problems \n\u25aa if you suffer from heart problems \n\u25aa if you receive Irbesartan Zentiva for diabetic kidney disease. In this case your doctor may \n\nperform regular blood tests, especially for measuring blood potassium levels in case of poor \nkidney function \n\n\u25aa if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics \n\u25aa if you are taking  any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n\n\n \n\n 101 \n\no an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have \ndiabetes-related kidney problems. \n\no aliskiren \nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. \n \nSee also information under the heading \u201cDo not take Irbesartan Zentiva\u201d. \n \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Irbesartan Zentiva is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicinal product should not be used in children and adolescents because the safety and efficacy \nhave not yet been fully established. \n \nOther medicines and Irbesartan Zentiva \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nYour doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions. \n If you are taking  an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings \u201cDo not take \nIrbesartan Zentiva \u201d and \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n \n \nYou may need to have blood checks if you take: \n\u25aa potassium supplements \n\u25aa salt substitutes containing potassium \n\u25aa potassium-sparing medicines (such as certain diuretics) \n\u25aa medicines containing lithium \n \nIf you take certain painkillers, called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the effect of irbesartan \nmay be reduced. \n \nIrbesartan Zentiva with food and drink \nIrbesartan Zentiva can be taken with or without food. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally \nadvise you to stop taking Irbesartan Zentiva before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you \nare pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Irbesartan Zentiva. Irbesartan \nZentiva is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months \npregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Irbesartan Zentiva is and what it is used for \n \nIrbesartan Zentiva belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. \nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body which binds to receptors in blood vessels causing \nthem to tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan Zentiva prevents the binding \nof angiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. \nIrbesartan Zentiva slows the decrease of kidney function in patients with high blood pressure and \ntype 2 diabetes. \n \nIrbesartan Zentiva is used in adult patients \n\u25aa to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension) \n\u25aa to protect the kidney in patients with high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and laboratory \n\nevidence of impaired kidney function. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Irbesartan Zentiva \n \nDo not take Irbesartan Zentiva \n\u25aa if you are allergic to irbesartan or any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n\u25aa if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Irbesartan Zentiva in early \n\npregnancy \u2013 see pregnancy section) \n\u25aa if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \n\nlowering medicine containing aliskiren.  \n \nWarning and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Irbesartan Zentiva and if any of the following apply to you: \n\u25aa if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea \n\u25aa if you suffer from kidney problems \n\u25aa if you suffer from heart problems \n\u25aa if you receive Irbesartan Zentiva for diabetic kidney disease. In this case your doctor may \n\nperform regular blood tests, especially for measuring blood potassium levels in case of poor \nkidney function \n\n\u25aa if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics \n\u25aa if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n\n\n \n\n 107 \n\no an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have \ndiabetes-related kidney problems. \n\no aliskiren \nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. \n \nSee also information under the heading \u201cDo not take Irbesartan Zentiva\u201d. \n \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Irbesartan Zentiva is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicinal product should not be used in children and adolescents because the safety and efficacy \nhave not yet been fully established. \n \nOther medicines and Irbesartan Zentiva \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nYour doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions: \n If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings \u201cDo not take \nIrbesartan Zentiva\u201d and \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n \n \nYou may need to have blood checks if you take: \n\u25aa potassium supplements \n\u25aa salt substitutes containing potassium \n\u25aa potassium-sparing medicines (such as certain diuretics) \n\u25aa medicines containing lithium \n \nIf you take certain painkillers, called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the effect of irbesartan \nmay be reduced. \n \nIrbesartan Zentiva with food and drink \nIrbesartan Zentiva can be taken with or without food. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally \nadvise you to stop taking Irbesartan Zentiva before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you \nare pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Irbesartan Zentiva. Irbesartan \nZentiva is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months \npregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Irbesartan Zentiva is and what it is used for \n \nIrbesartan Zentiva belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. \nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body which binds to receptors in blood vessels causing \nthem to tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan Zentiva prevents the binding \nof angiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. \nIrbesartan Zentiva slows the decrease of kidney function in patients with high blood pressure and \ntype 2 diabetes. \n \nIrbesartan Zentiva is used in adult patients \n\u25aa to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension) \n\u25aa to protect the kidney in patients with high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and laboratory \n\nevidence of impaired kidney function. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Irbesartan Zentiva \n \nDo not take Irbesartan Zentiva \n\u25aa if you are allergic to irbesartan or any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n\u25aa if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Irbesartan Zentiva in early \n\npregnancy \u2013 see pregnancy section) \n\u25aa if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \n\nlowering medicine containing aliskiren.. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Irbesartan Zentiva and if any of the following apply to you: \n\u25aa if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea \n\u25aa if you suffer from kidney problems \n\u25aa if you suffer from heart problems \n\u25aa if you receive Irbesartan Zentiva for diabetic kidney disease. In this case your doctor may \n\nperform regular blood tests, especially for measuring blood potassium levels in case of poor \nkidney function \n\n\u25aa if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics \n\u25aa if you are taking  any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n\n\n \n\n 119 \n\no an ACE-inhibitor ( for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril) in particular if you have \ndiabetes-related kidney problems. \n\no aliskiren \nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. \n \nSee also information under the heading \u201cDo not take Irbesartan Zentiva\u201d. \n \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Irbesartan Zentiva is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicinal product should not be used in children and adolescents because the safety and efficacy \nhave not yet been fully established. \n \nOther medicines and Irbesartan Zentiva \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking,have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nYour doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions: \nIif you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings \u201cDo not take \nIrbesartan Zentiva\u201d and \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n \nYou may need to have blood checks if you take: \n\u25aa potassium supplements \n\u25aa salt substitutes containing potassium \n\u25aa potassium-sparing medicines (such as certain diuretics) \n\u25aa medicines containing lithium \n \nIf you take certain painkillers, called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the effect of irbesartan \nmay be reduced. \n \nIrbesartan Zentiva with food and drink \nIrbesartan Zentiva can be taken with or without food. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant.

What Irbesartan Zentiva is and what it is used for \n \nIrbesartan Zentiva belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. \nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body which binds to receptors in blood vessels causing \nthem to tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan Zentiva prevents the binding \nof angiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. \nIrbesartan Zentiva slows the decrease of kidney function in patients with high blood pressure and \ntype 2 diabetes. \n \nIrbesartan Zentiva is used in adult patients \n\u25aa to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension) \n\u25aa to protect the kidney in patients with high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and laboratory \n\nevidence of impaired kidney function. \n \n \n2.

In this case your doctor may \n\nperform regular blood tests, especially for measuring blood potassium levels in case of poor \nkidney function \n\n\u25aa if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics \n\u25aa if you are taking  any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n\n\n \n\n 125 \n\no an ACE-inhibitor ( for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril) in particular if you have \ndiabetes-related kidney problems. \n\no aliskiren \nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. \n \nSee also information under the heading \u201cDo not take Irbesartan Zentiva\u201d. \n \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Irbesartan Zentiva is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicinal product should not be used in children and adolescents because the safety and efficacy \nhave not yet been fully established. \n \nOther medicines and Irbesartan Zentiva \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking,have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nYour doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions: \n If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings \u201cDo not take \nIrbesartan Zentiva\u201d and \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n \n \nYou may need to have blood checks if you take: \n\u25aa potassium supplements \n\u25aa salt substitutes containing potassium \n\u25aa potassium-sparing medicines (such as certain diuretics) \n\u25aa medicines containing lithium \n \nIf you take certain painkillers, called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the effect of irbesartan \nmay be reduced. \n \nIrbesartan Zentiva with food and drink \nIrbesartan Zentiva can be taken with or without food. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant.

(It is also better to avoid Irbesartan Zentiva in early \n\npregnancy \u2013 see pregnancy section) \n\u25aa if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \n\nlowering medicine containing aliskiren.  \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Irbesartan Zentiva and if any of the following apply to you: \n\u25aa if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea \n\u25aa if you suffer from kidney problems \n\u25aa if you suffer from heart problems \n\u25aa if you receive Irbesartan Zentiva for diabetic kidney disease. In this case your doctor may \n\nperform regular blood tests, especially for measuring blood potassium levels in case of poor \nkidney function \n\n\u25aa if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics \n\u25aa if you are taking  any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n\n\n \n\n 131 \n\no an ACE-inhibitor ( for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril) in particular if you have \ndiabetes-related kidney problems. \n\no aliskiren \nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. \n \nSee also information under the heading \u201cDo not take Irbesartan Zentiva\u201d. \n \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Irbesartan Zentiva is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicinal product should not be used in children and adolescents because the safety and efficacy \nhave not yet been fully established. \n \nOther medicines and Irbesartan Zentiva \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nYour doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions: \n If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings \u201cDo not take \nIrbesartan Zentiva\u201d and \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n \nYou may need to have blood checks if you take: \n\u25aa potassium supplements \n\u25aa salt substitutes containing potassium \n\u25aa potassium-sparing medicines (such as certain diuretics) \n\u25aa medicines containing lithium \n \nIf you take certain painkillers, called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the effect of irbesartan \nmay be reduced. \n \nIrbesartan Zentiva with food and drink \nIrbesartan Zentiva can be taken with or without food. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally \nadvise you to stop taking Irbesartan Zentiva before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you \nare pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Irbesartan Zentiva. Irbesartan \nZentiva is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months \npregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Irbesartan Zentiva is not \nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for \nyou if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIrbesartan Zentiva is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, occasionally \ndizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of high blood pressure. If you experience these, \ntalk to your doctor before attempting to drive or use machines. \n \nIrbesartan Zentiva contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \nintolerance to some sugars (e.g. lactose), contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 132 \n\n \n3. How to take Irbesartan Zentiva \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nMethod of administration \nIrbesartan Zentiva is for oral use. Swallow the tablets with a sufficient amount of fluid (e.g. one glass \nof water). You can take Irbesartan Zentiva with or without food. Try to take your daily dose at about \nthe same time each day. It is important that you continue to take Irbesartan Zentiva until your doctor \ntells you otherwise. \n \n\u25aa Patients with high blood pressure \n\nThe usual dose is 150 mg once a day. The dose may later be increased to 300 mg once daily \ndepending on blood pressure response. \n\n \n\u25aa Patients with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes with kidney disease \n\nIn patients with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, 300 mg once daily is the preferred \nmaintenance dose for the treatment of associated kidney disease. \n\n \nThe doctor may advise a lower dose, especially when starting treatment in certain patients such as \nthose on haemodialysis, or those over the age of 75 years. \n \nThe maximal blood pressure lowering effect should be reached 4-6 weeks after beginning treatment. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \nIrbesartan Zentiva should not be given to children under 18 years of age. If a child swallows some \ntablets, contact your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you take more Irbesartan Zentiva than you should: \nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take Irbesartan Zentiva: \nIf you accidentally miss a daily dose, just take the next dose as normal. Do not take a double dose to \nmake up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \nSome of these effects may be serious and may require medical attention. \n \nAs with similar medicines, rare cases of allergic skin reactions (rash, urticaria), as well as localised \nswelling of the face, lips and/or tongue have been reported in patients taking irbesartan.

Efficacy and safety of \n\nsartan-containing medicines in these indications are per se well-established and are not questioned \n\nin this referral. The key issue of this referral concerns the detection of N-nitrosamine (esp. NDMA \n\nand/or NDEA) contaminations in sartans, the resulting potential long-term risk to patients and \n\nmeasures to minimise as much as possible these contaminations. \n\nNitrosamines are chemically simple molecules and can be formed in pharmaceutical manufacturing \n\nsteps whenever there is a presence of a secondary (or tertiary) amines and nitrites, usually in \n\nacidic conditions. This is the background to the current referral procedure. However, it should be \n\nnoted that nitrosamines can also be formed in many other situations, including in biological \n\nprocesses.  \n\nNDMA and NDEA are two of the most potent mutagenic carcinogens known. As soon as the \n\nproblem of nitrosamine-contamination became known, immediate, precautionary measures were \n\ntaken by competent authorities across the EU such as recalls of affected batches from pharmacies. \n\nInitially, this was only necessary for valsartan containing APIs from few manufacturers but later \n\nalso for some other sartans with a tetrazole ring. \n\nAssessment of the excess risk of cancer  \n\nThe impact of NDMA and NDEA on human health is currently only extrapolated from animal studies. \n\nHowever, as the DNA damage mechanisms documented in these studies are also relevant in \n\nhumans and in vitro data in human cells are not significantly different from those in animal cells, it \n\nis prudent to assume that effects seen in animals may also occur in humans after exposure to \n\nsufficiently large amounts of these nitrosamines.  \n\nIn addition to NDMA and NDEA, other N-nitrosamines have been detected in a few sartan-\n\ncontaining medicinal products. Risks resulting from multiple exposures are considered to add up in \n\npatients as mutagenic carcinogens are currently considered as summation toxins. \n\nThe ICH M7(R1) guideline sets out principles for determining limits for mutagenic / DNA-reactive \n\nimpurities. The determination of an acceptable intake (AI) is based on extrapolation of carcinogenic \n\nrisk from rodent carcinogenicity data, as the dose resulting in one cancer case among 100,000 \n\nindividuals exposed for a life-time to the impurity. N-nitrosamines belong to a \u201ccohort of concern\u201d \n\ncompounds in this guideline. For these reasons, N-nitrosamine impurities in pharmaceuticals such \n\nas sartans intended for long-term use should be reduced as much as possible. \n\nA full risk assessment for patients previously exposed to NDMA and/or NDEA impurities in sartans, \n\nespecially valsartan which was found to contain the highest nitrosamine contamination, is not \n\npossible as the real extent of exposure of patients is unknown. For an individual risk assessment, \n\ndata on the exact drug products and batches used by each individual patient would be necessary. \n\nThus, the risk assessment is based on a potential worst case scenario, which would be a partially \n\ncombined exposure to the highest levels of NDEA for 4 years (2011 \u2013 2015) and to NDMA for 6 \n\nyears (2012 \u2013 2018) reported from a sartan, resulting in a cumulative theoretical excess cancer \n\nrisk of 29.5:100,000 or 1:3390 (0.029%) when extrapolated from the available rat studies \n\naccording to ICH M7(R1). Compared to the lifetime cancer risk in the European population of \n\napproximately 50%, this additional risk is considered to be very low.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 138 \n\n \n\nConsiderations on monitoring of exposed patients \n\nThe above stated very small theoretical risk has to be balanced against the risks of potential \n\nmeasures to monitor patients such as colonoscopy or gastroscopy which may exceed the \n\ntheoretical excess cancer risk. For example, a recent review has estimated risks of perforation of 4 \n\nper 10,000 (95% confidence interval, 2-5) and major haemorrhage of 8 per 10,000 (95% \n\nconfidence interval, 5-14) with screening colonoscopy. In addition, advancing age, comorbidity and \n\nuse of anticoagulants were found to be strongly associated with both gastrointestinal and non-\n\ngastrointestinal complications. Furthermore, the target organ(s) of NDMA/NDEA toxicity in humans \n\nare still not sufficiently clear.  \n\nFor these reasons, CHMP could not identify cancer screening methods that patients would benefit \n\nfrom.  \n\n \n\nMeasures to mitigate the risk \n\nAppropriate regulatory actions (such as quarantine or batch recalls) have been taken where \n\nrelevant. \n\nAdditional measures are needed to minimise prospectively the reoccurrence of such contamination. \n\nBased on all available data, the CHMP requires the following: \n\n1. Obligatory risk assessments to be performed for manufacturing processes of the drug \n\nsubstances in order to evaluate the theoretical risk of N-nitrosamine formation and contamination \n\n2. Modifying manufacturing processes, where necessary, to minimise contamination as much as \n\npossible. \n\n3. Implement a control strategy to detect and control N-nitrosamine impurities in the API (or \n\nintermediate, if justified). \n\nSpecifically, CHMP considered that NDMA and NDEA limits should be as low as technically possible. \n\nIn this regard, a limit of quantification of 0.03 ppm for NDMA and NDEA would be achievable \n\naccording to the available data on analytical methods. This limit is considered a sufficiently robust \n\nthreshold for APIs that can technically be reached. In comparison to the daily intake levels \n\ncalculated based on ICH M7(R1) using non-clinical toxicology, it is possible to generate additional \n\nsafety factors ranging from 2.73 \u2013 27.3 for NDMA and 10.0 \u2013 100 for NDEA, by defining 0.03 ppm \n\nas the common technical target limit for NDEA and NDMA in tetrazole sartan APIs. The underlying \n\nconcept of the proposed approach is to keep the amount of N-nitrosamine impurities as low as \n\npossible, irrespective of the type of sartan or dose. \n\nThe limit of 0.03 ppm for NDMA and NDEA will be enforceable after a transitional period of 2 years \n\nfrom the notification of the Commission Decision. During this time period, MAHs and manufacturers \n\nare requested to introduce relevant changes to the manufacturing processes of the drug \n\nsubstances, as well as develop appropriate analytical methods while ensuring adequate supply of \n\nthe market for these essential medicinal products. An interim limit based on daily intakes according \n\nto principles in ICH M7(R1) using toxicology data are set in order to control these impurities in the \n\nmeantime at an acceptable level. These interim limits are based on the maximum daily dose \n\nauthorised in the EU for each of the sartans and therefore vary between them, as outlined in the \n\ntable below: \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 139 \n\n \n\nDrug \n\nsubstance \n\nMax. daily \n\ndose (mg) \n\nNDEA   \n\nLimit in ppm \nin API \n\nNDMA  \n\n Limit in ppm \nin API \n\nValsartan 320 0.082  0.300 \n\nLosartan 150 0.177 0.640 \n\nOlmesartan 40 0.663 2.400 \n\nIrbesartan 300 0.088 0.320 \n\nCandesartan 32 0.820  3.000 \n\n \n\nShould NDMA and NDEA be detected in parallel in an API batch, this should lead to rejection of the \n\nrespective batch, considering that a combined contamination would translate into a combined risk, \n\nwhich may be higher than one additional case of cancer in 100.000 individuals. \n\nWhilst the measures are focused on NDMA and NDEA, the principles used in this procedure in terms \n\nof toxicology assessment, control strategy and changes to the manufacturing processes for drug \n\nsubstances should be applied by analogy to other nitrosamines. \n\nIn case of identification of other nitrosamines, this should be forthwith reported to the competent \n\nauthorities, together with a toxicology assessment of the impurity, a clinical assessment for the \n\nexposed patients, a root cause analysis and a corrective action plan (e.g. changes to the \n\nmanufacturing process). \n\n \n\nOverall, taking into account the available data assessed in this procedure, the benefit risk balance \n\nof medicines containing a sartan with a tetrazole ring remains positive subject to the conditions \n\nimposed. \n\n \n\nGrounds for CHMP opinion \n\nWhereas \n\n\u2022 The CHMP considered the procedure under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC for products \n\ncontaining sartans with a tetrazole group (candesartan, irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan, \n\nvalsartan) \n\n\u2022 The CHMP reviewed data on quality regarding the manufacturing processes of sartans with \n\na tetrazole group, analytical data including test results and available methods, and \n\ntoxicological data available for the N-nitrosamines found in some of these products. The \n\nCHMP also carried out a risk assessment for patients previously exposed to NDMA and \n\nNDEA in sartans and calculated daily intake levels based on the principles of ICH M7(R1) \n\nwhich are associated with an additional lifetime risk of 1 in 100,000 patients. \n\n\u2022 Based on the analysis of potential root causes the CHMP considered that all the MAHs \n\nshould perform risk assessment of the manufacturing processes used for the APIs in their \n\nfinished products to evaluate the risk of N-nitrosamine formation and contamination. \n\n\u2022 A two-year transition period) is considered acceptable to change production processes to \n\nachieve syntheses in which N-nitrosamines are not formed, to adopt analytical methods for \n\nthe control strategy and in order to avoid product shortages.  \n\n\u2022 During this period, NDMA and NDEA impurities in the API should be controlled for a \n\ntransition period at limits calculated based on the principles of ICH M7(R1) using validated \n\nassays \n\n\n\n \n\n 140 \n\n\u2022 After the transition period, a limit for NDMA and NDEA of maximum 0.03 ppm should be \n\nimplemented, which reflects the lowest quantifiable level based on capability of the \n\navailable analytical methods. \n\n\u2022 In case of detection of other N-nitrosamines this should be forthwith reported to the \n\ncompetent authorities, together with a toxicology assessment of the impurity, a clinical \n\nassessment for the exposed patients, a root cause analysis and a corrective action plan.  \n\n\u2022 CHMP could not identify cancer screening methods that patients would benefit from, \n\nconsidering the uncertainty of the target organ(s) of NDMA/NDEA toxicity in humans and \n\nthe risks of measures to monitor patients such as colonoscopy or gastroscopy which may \n\nexceed the theoretical excess cancer risk. \n\n \n\nCHMP opinion \n\nThe CHMP, as a consequence, considers that the benefit-risk balance of products containing \n\ncandesartan, irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan, valsartan remains favourable subject to the \n\nconditions described above. \n\nTherefore the CHMP recommends the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations for \n\nproducts containing candesartan, irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan, valsartan. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

containing aliskiren. warning and precautions talk to your doctor before taking irbesartan zentiva and if any of the following apply to you: if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea if you suffer from kidney problems if you suffer from heart problems if you receive irbesartan zentiva for diabetic kidney disease. in this case your doctor may perform regular blood tests, especially for measuring blood potassium levels in case of poor kidney function if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: 101 o an ace-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have diabetes-related kidney problems. o aliskiren your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. see also information under the heading \"do not take irbesartan zentiva\". you must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. irbesartan zentiva is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). children and adolescents this medicinal product should not be used in children and adolescents because the safety and efficacy have not yet been fully established. other medicines and irbesartan zentiva tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions. if you are taking an ace-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings \"do not take irbesartan zentiva \" and \"warnings
