NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nCuprymina 925 MBq/mL radiopharmaceutical precursor, solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach mL of solution contains 925 MBq of copper (64Cu) chloride at calibration time (01h00 a.m. \nCentral European Time [CET]), corresponding to at least 0.25 micrograms of Copper-64. The \ncalibration time is set between the end of the synthesis time and the expiry time. \n \nEach vial contains an activity ranging from 925 MBq to 2,770 MBq (at calibration time) which \ncorresponds to an amount of 0.25 to 0.75 micrograms of Copper-64. The volume varies from 1 to 3 mL. \n \nThe minimal specific activity is 3,700 MBq Copper-64/micrograms of Copper at the expiry date and \ntime. \nCopper-64 has a half-life of 12.7 hours. \nCopper-64 decays by an emission of β+ (17.6 %) with a maximum energy of 0.66 MeV, an emission of \nβ- (38.5 %) with a maximum energy of 0.58 MeV and electronic capture (43.9 %). \nCopper-64 decays in stable Nickel 64Ni (61 %) by an emission of β+ (18 %) or by an electronic capture \n(43 %). Copper-64 decays also in stable Zinc (64Zn) by emission of β- (39 %). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nRadiopharmaceutical precursor, solution.  \nClear, colourless solution, free of particulate matter. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCuprymina is a radiopharmaceutical precursor. It is not intended for direct use in patients. This \nmedicinal product must be used only for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, which have been \nspecifically developed and authorised for radiolabelling with this radionuclide. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nCuprymina is only to be used by specialists experienced with in vitro radiolabelling  \n \nPosology \n \nThe quantity of Cuprymina required for radiolabelling and the quantity of Copper-64-labelled \nmedicinal product that is subsequently administered will depend on the medicinal product \nradiolabelled and its intended use. \nRefer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to \nbe radiolabelled.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nCopper-64-labelled medicinal products should not be used in children and adolescents up to 18 years. \nFor more information concerning paediatric use of Copper-64-labelled medicinal products refer to the \nSummary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the radiolabelled medicinal product. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nMethod of administration \n \nCuprymina is intended for in vitro radiolabelling of medicinal products, which are subsequently \nadministered by the approved route.  \nCuprymina should not be administered directly to the patient.  \nFor instruction on preparation of the medicinal product, see section 12. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Established or suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded (see section 4.6). \n \nFor information on contraindications to particular Copper-64-labelled medicinal products prepared by \nradiolabelling with Cuprymina refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of each \nparticular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIndividual benefit/risk justification \n \nCuprymina is not to be administered directly to the patient but must be used for the radiolabelling of \ncarrier molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other substrates. \n \nGeneral warnings \n \nRadiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in \ndesignated clinical settings. Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the \nregulations and/or appropriate licences of the competent official organisation. \n \nRadiopharmaceuticals should be prepared by the user in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety \nand pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken. \n \nFor information concerning special warnings and special precautions for use of Copper-64-labelled \nmedicinal products refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal \nproduct to be radiolabelled. It must be considered that the radiolabelled medicinal product emits high \nintensity Auger electrons. \n \nRegarding the dose for a person in close contact with the patient, this is entirely due to the gamma rays \n(Cuprymina emits 2 gamma rays at 511.0 Kev and 1,345.77 Kev), because β+ and β- emissions have no \nrole due to their very short range. \nThe Copper-64 gamma dose constant is 3.6 x 10-5 mSv x MBq-1 x h at a distance of 1 meter. Assuming \nthe worst case that the whole maximum activity (2,770 MBq) is injected to the patient and Copper-64 is \nlabelled to a molecule with infinite biological half-life (no disposal by the patient) the person is \ncontinuously exposed at a distance of 2 meters. With these assumptions the estimated dose for a person \nin close contact with the patient is 0.46 mSv, which is less than one half of the limit of not exposed \npeople (1 mSv/year). \nSpecial precautions for relatives, carers and hospital staff are provided in section 6.6. \n \nDisappearance of radioactivity \n \nConsidering that each MBq of Copper-64 causes a dose rate of 9 nSv/h (at a distance of 2 meters) and \nthat the maximum injected activity is of 2,770 MBq, the initial dose rate is 24,930 nSv/h. \nAssuming that the environmental background value is of 150 nSv/h, and requiring that the dose rate due \nto Copper-64 is lower than the environmental background the condition of negligible radioactivity in \nthe patient is reached, in practice, 4 days after injection (dose rate 132 nSv/h) as shown in table 1. \n \n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nTable 1 – Condition of negligible radioactivity in the patients \nDays after \ninjection \n(2,770 MBq) \n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 \n\nDose rate \n(nSv/h) 24,930 6,727 1,815 490 132 37 \n\n \n4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interactions studies of Copper-64 chloride with other medicinal products have been performed. \nThe possible use of chelating therapies could interfere with the use of Copper-64-labelled medicinal \nproducts. \nFor information concerning interactions associated with the use of Copper-64-labelled medicinal \nproducts refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the radiolabelled medicinal \nproduct. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWhen an administration of radioactive medicinal products to a woman of childbearing potential is \nintended, it is important to determine whether or not she is pregnant. Any woman who has missed a \nperiod should be assumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise. If in doubt about her potential \npregnancy (if the woman has missed a period, if the period is very irregular, etc.), alternative techniques \nnot using ionising radiation (if there are any) should be offered to the patient. \nBefore the use of Copper-64-labelled medicinal products, pregnancy should be excluded using an \nadequate/validated test. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThe use of Copper-64-labelled medicinal products is contraindicated during established or suspected \npregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded (see section 4.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nBefore administering radiopharmaceuticals to a mother who is breast-feeding, consideration should be \ngiven to the possibility of delaying the administration of radionuclide until the mother has ceased \nbreast-feeding, and to the choice of the most appropriate radiopharmaceuticals, bearing in mind the \nsecretion of activity in breast milk. If the administration is considered necessary, a breast-feeding \nmother should be advised to stop breast-feeding. \nThe duration of stopping will depend on the particular radiolabelled medicinal product. \nFurther information concerning the use of Copper-64-labelled medicinal products in pregnancy and \nbreast-feeding is specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal product to be \nradiolabelled. \n \nFertility \n \nAccording to literature reports, it may be considered that both spermatogenetic and genetic damage in \nmale test is are unlikely at the dose of 1,000 MBq. \nFurther information concerning the effect on fertility of the use of Copper-64-labelled medicinal \nproducts is specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal product to be \nradiolabelled. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nEffects on ability to drive and to use machines following treatment by Copper-64-labelled medicinal \nproducts is specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular \nmedicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nAdverse reactions following the intravenous administration of Copper-64-labelled medicinal products \nprepared by radiolabelling with Cuprymina, will be dependent on the specific medicinal product being \nused. Such information is supplied in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the \nmedicinal product to be radiolabelled.  \nFor each patient, exposure to ionising radiation must be justifiable on the basis of likely clinical benefit. \nThe activity administered must be such that the resulting radiation dose is as low as reasonably \nachievable bearing in mind the need to obtain the intended result. \n \nThe radiation dose to the patient resulting from exposure after administration may result in higher \nincidence of cancer and mutations. In all cases, it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation \nare less than from the disease itself. \nExposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of \nhereditary defects. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed \nin Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe presence of free copper (64Cu) chloride in the body after an inadvertent administration of \nCuprymina will lead to increased hepatotoxicity. \nTherefore, in case of an inadvertent administration of Cuprymina, the radiotoxicity for the patient must \nbe reduced by immediate (i. e. within 1 hour) intravenous administration of preparations containing \nchelators like Ca-DTPA or Ca-EDTA in order to increase the elimination of the radionuclide from the \nbody. \n \nThe following preparations must be available in medical institutions, which use Cuprymina for labelling \nof carrier molecules: \n- Ca-DTPA (Trisodium calcium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) or \n- Ca-EDTA (Calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate) \n \nThese chelating agents help elimination of copper radiotoxicity by an exchange between the calcium \nion and the copper due to their capacity of forming water soluble complexes with the chelating ligands \n(DTPA, EDTA).  \n \nThese complexes are rapidly eliminated by the kidneys. \n1 g of the chelating agents should be administered by slow intravenous injection over 3 – 4 minutes or \nby infusion (1 g in 100-250 mL of glucose, or sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection). \nThe chelating efficacy is greatest immediately or within one hour of exposure when the radionuclide is \ncirculating in or available to tissue fluids and plasma. However, a post-exposure interval > 1 hour does \nnot preclude the administration and effective action of chelator, even if with reduced efficiency. \nIntravenous administration should not be protracted over more than 2 hours. \n \nIn any case the blood parameters of the patient have to be monitored and the appropriate actions \nimmediately taken if there is evidence of damages. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n \n\nThe toxicity of the free Copper-64 due to in vivo release from the labelled biomolecule in the body \nduring therapy could be reduced by post-administration of chelating agents. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: various diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, ATC code: Not yet assigned  \n \nThe pharmacodynamic properties of Copper-64-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling \nwith Cuprymina, prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be \nradiolabelled. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular \nmedicinal product to be radiolabelled.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of the studies with \nCuprymina in all subsets of the paediatric population on grounds of lack of significant therapeutic \nbenefit over existing treatments. This waiver does however not extend to any diagnostic or therapeutic \nuses of the medicinal product when linked to a carrier molecule. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of Copper-64-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling \nwith Cuprymina, prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be \nradiolabelled. \nPharmacokinetics of Cuprymina was investigated in mice. Following intravenous administration, at \nthe beginning most organs contained an amount of radioactivity which represented their content of \nCopper-64-laden blood. Liver, kidney and the intestinal tract reached their maximal content of \nCopper-64 within the first few hours, and then radioactivity steadily diminished. Part of the decrease \ncan be attributed to excretion of Copper-64 into the bile, urine and faeces. \nBlood radioactivity decreased from 60.3 % to 3.4 % after 1 hour, and then it decreased of 1 % after \n6 hours, and increased to 5.6 % and 4.9 % after 12-24 hours. \nCopper chloride (64CuCl2) is distributed mainly in the liver and kidney and the pattern of radioactivity \nin the blood parallels the pattern of radioactivity in the liver. Almost the entire 64CuCl2 rapidly leaves \nthe blood and enters the liver and kidney. \nMaximum liver uptake was 4 hours after injection with 57.7 %. Then copper re-emerges in plasma and \nis distributed to other organs. \n \nPharmacokinetic data on Cuprymina relate to free copper \n \nWhen the precursor is bound to a carrier molecule the content of radioactive free copper is supposed to \nbe less than the stated amounts depending on the carrier used. Relevant data is included in the Summary \nof Product Characteristics of the labelled medicinal products.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nThe toxicological properties of Copper-64-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with \nCuprymina prior to administration will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be \nradiolabelled. \nNo animal toxicity studies were conducted with Cuprymina. \nToxicity of copper compounds has been extensively investigated both in human and in animals. Liver, \ngastrointestinal tract and kidney are the target organs for copper toxicity after single and repeated doses \nadministration. Many international bodies assessed copper genotoxicity and carcinogenicity concluding \nthat there is no conclusive evidence that copper may be mutagenic or carcinogenic The Scientific \nCommittee on Food of the European Commission (2003) recommend a Dietary Allowances of 0.9 mg \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\ncopper/day in adult males and females and established a Tolerable Upper Uptake level of 5 mg/day, \nallowing a huge safety margin in comparison to copper amount administered by Cuprymina. \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on available published data. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nHydrochloric acid (0.1 N). \nWater for injections. \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nRadiolabelling of carrier molecules, such as peptides, monoclonal antibodies, or other substrates, with \nCopper (64Cu) chloride is very sensitive to the presence of trace metal impurities. \nIt is important that all glassware, syringe needles etc, used for the preparation of the radiolabelled \ncompound are thoroughly cleaned to ensure freedom from such trace metal impurities. Only syringe \nneedles (for example, non-metallic) with proven resistance to dilute acid should be used to minimise \ntrace metal impurity levels. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n48 hours from date and time of End of Synthesis (EOS). \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in the original package that provides protection from radiation. \nStorage of radiopharmaceuticals should be in accordance with national regulation on radioactive \nmaterials. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nThe radiopharmaceutical precursor solution is packaged in a colourless, type I glass 10 mL vial, closed \nwith bromobutyl rubber stopper and aluminium overseal.  \nThe volume of one vial ranges from 1 to 3 mL solution (corresponding to 925 to 2,770 MBq at \ncalibration time). \nThe vials are packed into a tungsten or lead container for protective shielding. \nEach pack contains 1 vial in a tungsten or lead container. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nCuprymina is not intended for direct use in patients. \n \nCuprymina is a sterile solution. \n \nGeneral warning  \nRadiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in \ndesignated clinical settings. Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the \nregulations and/or appropriate licences of the competent official organisation.  \nRadiopharmaceuticals should be prepared in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and \npharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken.  \n \nFor instruction on preparation of the medicinal product, see section 12. \nIf at any time in the preparation of this medicinal product the integrity of this container is \ncompromised it should not be used.  \n \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nAdministration procedures should be carried out in a way to minimise risk of contamination of the \nmedicinal product and irradiation of the operators. Adequate shielding is mandatory. The surface dose \nrates and the accumulated dose depend on many factors. Measurements on the location and during \nwork are critical and should be practiced for more precise and instructive determination of overall \nradiation dose to the staff. Healthcare personnel are advised to limit the time of close contact with \npatients injected with Copper-64-radiopharmaceuticals. The use of television monitor systems to \nmonitor the patients is recommended. Given the long half-life of Copper-64 it is specially \nrecommended to avoid internal contamination. For this reason it is mandatory to use protective high \nquality (latex/nitrile) gloves in any direct contact with the radiopharmaceutical (vial/syringe) and with \nthe patient. For minimising radiation exposure with repeated exposition there is no recommendation \nexcept the strict observance of the above ones. \n \nThe administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or \ncontamination from spill of urine, vomiting, etc. Radiation protection precautions in accordance with \nnational regulations must therefore be taken. \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material must be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

DATE OF REVISION OF THE TEXT \n \n \n \n11. DOSIMETRY \n \nThe radiation dose received by the various organs following intravenous administration of a Copper-64-\nlabelled medicinal product is dependent on the specific molecule being radiolabelled. \nInformation on radiation dosimetry of each different medicinal product following administration of the \nradiolabelled preparation is available in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the \nparticular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. \nThe dosimetry table below is presented in order to evaluate the contribution of non-conjugated Copper-\n64 to the radiation dose following the administration of Copper-64-labelled medicinal product or \nresulting from an accidental intravenous injection of Cuprymina. \nThe dosimetry estimates were based on a mouse distribution study and the calculations were effected \nusing OLINDA (Organ Level INternal Dose Assessment Code) (see Table 2). Time points for \nmeasurements were 2 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 2 days, 4 days, \n6 days. \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n \nTable 2: Absorbed dose per unit activity administered  \n\n \nFor this medicinal product, the effective dose resulting from an intravenously injected activity of \n925 MBq is 65.86 mSv for a 60-kg female adult and 88.99 mSv for a 70-kg male adult. \n \n \n12. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS \n \nBefore use, packaging and radioactivity must be checked. Activity may be measured using an ionisation \nchamber. Copper-64 is a beta emitter. Activity measurements using an ionisation chamber are very \nsensitive to geometric factors and, therefore, should be performed only under geometric conditions \nwhich have been appropriately validated. \nUsual precautions regarding sterility and radioactivity must be respected. \nThe vial should never be opened and must be kept inside its shielded container. The medicinal product \nmust be aseptically withdrawn through the stopper using sterilised single-use needle and syringe after \ndisinfecting the stopper. \nAppropriate aseptic precautions must be taken, in order to maintain the sterility of Cuprymina and to \nmaintain sterility throughout the labelling procedures. \n \n\nabsorbed dose per unit activity administered \n(mGy/MBq) \n\norgan adult male (70 kg) \nadult female \n(60 kg) 15 years 10 years 5 years 1 years newborn \n\n                \nadrenals 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 \nbrain 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 \nbreasts 0.000596 0.000730 0.000732 0.00133 0.00204 0.00384 0.00776 \ngallbladder wall 0.00192 0.00230 0.00219 0.00278 0.00453 0.00917 0.0158 \nLLI wall 0.0149 0.0160 0.0195 0.0340 0.0569 0.112 0.291 \nsmall Intestine 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 \nstomach Wall 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 \nULI wall 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 \nheart wall 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 \nkidneys 0.00885 0.00969 0.0107 0.0151 0.0224 0.0401 0.106 \nliver 0.0211 0.0282 0.0283 0.0436 0.0649 0.126 0.294 \nlungs 0.00178 0.00233 0.00245 0.00351 0.00526 0.00999 0.0240 \nmuscle 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 \novaries 0.00 0.00314 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 \npancreas 0.00267 0.00310 0.00365 0.00716 0.00955 0.0199 0.0637 \nred marrow 0.00581 0.00565 0.00670 0.0118 0.0242 0.0586 0.198 \nosteogenic cells 0.00202 0.00269 0.00263 0.00426 0.00718 0.0172 0.0549 \nskin 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 \nspleen 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 \ntestes 0.0463 0.00 0.114 0.907 1.05 1.41 2.02 \nthymus 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 \nthyroid 0.000129 0.000156 0.000189 0.000292 0.000593 0.00113 0.00178 \nurinary bladder wall 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 \nuterus 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 \n \neffective dose ( Sv/1 GBq administered) \n  adult male adult female 15 years 10 years 5 years 1 years newborn \n  0.0962 0.0712 0.168 0.854 1.05 1.56 2.73 \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nThe administration of radioactive medicinal products creates risks for other persons from external \nradiation or contamination from spills of urine, vomiting, etc. Radiation protection precautions in \naccordance with national regulations must therefore be taken. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material must be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \nDetailed information on this medicinal product is available on the website of the European Medicines \nAgency http://www.ema.europa.eu \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n11 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX II \n \n\nA.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nCuprymina 925 MBq/mL radiopharmaceutical precursor, solution \nCopper (64Cu) chloride \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given the medicine combined with Cuprymina \nbecause it contains important information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the \n\nprocedure. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n \n1. What Cuprymina is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before the medicine radiolabelled with Cuprymina is used  \n3. How the medicine radiolabelled with Cuprymina is used  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Cuprymina  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Cuprymina is and what it is used for \n \nCuprymina is not a medicine and it is not intended to be used on its own.  \n \nCuprymina is a type of medicinal product called a radiopharmaceutical precursor. It contains the \nactive substance copper (64Cu) chloride. Copper-64 is a radioactive form of the chemical element \ncopper, which emits the radiation needed for certain procedures that may be carried out on you. \n \nCuprymina is used for radiolabelling, a technique in which a substance is tagged (radiolabelled) with a \nradioactive compound. Cuprymina is used to label certain medicines that have been specially \ndeveloped for use with the active substance copper (64Cu) chloride. These medicines act as a carrier to \ntake the radioactivity to where it is needed. These may be substances that have been designed to \nrecognise a particular type of cell in the body, including tumour cells.  \n \nThe use of Copper-64-labelled medicines involves exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your \ndoctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain \nfrom the procedure with the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk from radiation. \n \nPlease refer to the package leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with Cuprymina.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before the medicine radiolabelled with Cuprymina is used \n \nThe medicine radiolabelled with Cuprymina must not be used: \n- If you are allergic to copper or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in section 6. \n- If you are pregnant or believe you may be pregnant. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your nuclear medicine doctor before using the medicine that is radiolabelled with Cuprymina. \nCuprymina should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in designated clinical \nsettings. Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations and/or \nappropriate licences of the competent official organisation. \nRadiopharmaceuticals should be prepared by the user in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety \nand pharmaceutical quality requirements. \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\nIt must be considered that the radiolabelled medicinal product emits high intensity Auger electrons. \nThe condition of negligible radioactivity in the patient is reached, in practice, 4 days after injection. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nMedicines radiolabelled with Cuprymina should not be used in children and adolescents up to 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and medicines radiolabelled with Cuprymina \nTell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines since they may interfere with the interpretation of the images. \nIt is not known whether copper (64Cu) chloride may interact with other medicines as specific studies \nhave not been carried out. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour nuclear medicine doctor for advice before you are given medicines radiolabelled with \nCuprymina. \n \nYou must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before the administration of medicines radiolabelled \nwith Cuprymina if there is a possibility you might be pregnant, if you have missed your period or if \nyou are breast-feeding.  \nWhen in doubt, it is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the \nprocedure. \n \nIf you are pregnant \nMedicines radiolabelled with Cuprymina must not be administered if you are pregnant. \n \nIf you are breast-feeding  \nYou will be asked to stop breast-feeding if you need to receive a medicine radiolabelled with \nCuprymina. \nPlease ask your nuclear medicine doctor when you can resume breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThere could be effects on your ability to drive and to use machines due to the medicine used in \ncombination with Cuprymina. Please read the package leaflet of that medicine carefully. \n \n \n3. How the medicine radiolabelled with Cuprymina is used \n \nThere are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products. Medicines \nradiolabelled with Cuprymina will only be used in special, controlled areas. This medicinal product will \nonly be handled and given to you by people who are trained and qualified to use it safely. These persons \nwill take special care for the safe use of this medicinal product and will keep you informed of their \nactions. \n \nThe nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the quantity of medicine \nradiolabelled with Cuprymina to be used in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to \nachieve the appropriate outcome, depending on the co-administered medicine and its intended use.  \n \nAdministration of the medicine radiolabelled with Cuprymina and conduct of the procedure \nCuprymina must be used only in combination with another medicine which has been specifically \ndeveloped and authorised for being combined with Cuprymina, and will be administered subsequently. \n \nDuration of the procedure \nYour nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure before the \nadministration of the medicine radiolabelled with Cuprymina. \n \n \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\nAfter administration of the medicine radiolabelled with Cuprymina has been performed \nThe nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after receiving \nthe medicine radiolabelled with Cuprymina. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any \nquestions. \n \nIf you have been given more medicine radiolabelled with Cuprymina than you should  \nSince the medicine radiolabelled with Cuprymina is handled by a nuclear medicine doctor under strictly \ncontrolled conditions, there is only a very small chance of possible overdose. However, in the case of an \noverdose, you will receive the appropriate treatment. \n \nShould you have any further question on the use of Cuprymina, please ask the nuclear medicine doctor \nwho supervises the procedure. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, the medicine radiolabelled with Cuprymina can cause side effects, although not \neverybody gets them. \n \nAfter the medicine radiolabelled with Cuprymina is administered, it will deliver certain amounts of \nionising radiation (radioactivity) which can induce a certain risk of cancer and development of \nhereditary defects. In all cases, the risks of the radiation should be less than from the disease itself. \n \nFor more information, refer to the package leaflet of the particular medicine to be radiolabelled. \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed \nin Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine. \n \n \n5.  How to store Cuprymina  \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nThe following information is intended for the specialist only.  \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date and time which are stated on the label after EXP. \nCuprymina will be stored in the original package that provides protection from radiation. \n \nYou will not have to store this medicinal product. Cuprymina is stored under the responsibility of the \nspecialist in appropriate premises. Storage of radiopharmaceuticals will be in accordance with national \nregulation on radioactive materials.  \n \n \n6.
