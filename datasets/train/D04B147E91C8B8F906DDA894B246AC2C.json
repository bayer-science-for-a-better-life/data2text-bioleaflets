PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \n \nClear and colourless concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n- Prevention of skeletal related events (pathological fractures, spinal compression, radiation or \n\nsurgery to bone, or tumour-induced hypercalcaemia) in adult patients with advanced \nmalignancies involving bone. \n\n \n- Treatment of adult patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH).  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nZoledronic acid Actavis must only be prescribed and administered to patients by healthcare \nprofessionals experienced in the administration of intravenous bisphosphonates. Patients treated with \nZoledronic acid Actavis should be given the package leaflet and the patient reminder card. \n \nPosology \nPrevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone \nAdults and older people \nThe recommended dose in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced \nmalignancies involving bone is 4 mg zoledronic acid every 3 to 4 weeks.  \n  \nPatients should also be administered an oral calcium supplement of 500 mg and 400 IU vitamin D \ndaily. \n \nThe decision to treat patients with bone metastases for the prevention of skeletal related events should \nconsider that the onset of treatment effect is 2-3 months. \n \nTreatment of TIH \nAdults and older people \nThe recommended dose in hypercalcaemia (albumin-corrected serum calcium \u2265 12.0 mg/dl or \n3.0 mmol/l) is a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid.  \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nRenal impairment \nTIH: \nZoledronic acid Actavis treatment in TIH patients who also have severe renal impairment should be \nconsidered only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment. In the clinical studies, patients \nwith serum creatinine > 400 micromol/l or > 4.5 mg/dl were excluded. No dose adjustment is \nnecessary in TIH patients with serum creatinine < 400 micromol/l or < 4.5 mg/dl (see section 4.4). \n \nPrevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone: \nWhen initiating treatment with Zoledronic acid Actavis in patients with multiple myeloma or \nmetastatic bone lesions from solid tumours, serum creatinine and creatinine clearance (CLcr) should \nbe determined. CLcr is calculated from serum creatinine using the Cockcroft-Gault formula. \nZoledronic acid Actavis is not recommended for patients presenting with severe renal impairment \nprior to initiation of therapy, which is defined for this population as CLcr < 30 ml/min. In clinical \ntrials with zoledronic acid, patients with serum creatinine > 265 micromol/l or > 3.0 mg/dl were \nexcluded. \n \nIn patients with bone metastases presenting with mild to moderate renal impairment prior to initiation \nof therapy, which is defined for this population as CLcr 30-60 ml/min, the following Zoledronic acid \nActavis dose is recommended (see also section 4.4): \n \n\nBaseline Creatinine Clearance (ml/min) Zoledronic acid Actavis recommended dose* \n> 60 4.0 mg zoledronic acid \n\n50-60 3.5 mg* zoledronic acid \n40-49 3.3 mg* zoledronic acid \n30-39 3.0 mg* zoledronic acid \n\n* Doses have been calculated assuming target AUC of 0.66 (mg\u2022hr/l) (CLcr = 75 ml/min). The \nreduced doses for patients with renal impairment are expected to achieve the same AUC as that seen in \npatients with creatinine clearance of 75 ml/min. \n \nFollowing initiation of therapy, serum creatinine should be measured prior to each dose of Zoledronic \nacid Actavis and treatment should be withheld if renal function has deteriorated. In the clinical trials, \nrenal deterioration was defined as follows: \n- For patients with normal baseline serum creatinine (< 1.4 mg/dl or < 124 micromol/l), an \n\nincrease of 0.5 mg/dl or 44 micromol/l; \n- For patients with abnormal baseline creatinine (> 1.4 mg/dl or > 124 micromol/l), an increase of \n\n1.0 mg/dl or 88 micromol/l. \n \nIn the clinical studies, zoledronic acid treatment was resumed only when the creatinine level returned \nto within 10% of the baseline value (see section 4.4). Zoledronic acid Actavis treatment should be \nresumed at the same dose as that given prior to treatment interruption. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid in children aged 1 year to 17 years have not been \nestablished. Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \nIntravenous use. \nZoledronic acid Actavis 4 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion, further diluted in 100 ml (see \nsection 6.6), should be given as a single intravenous infusion in no less than 15 minutes. \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, reduced zoledronic acid doses are recommended \n(see section \u201cPosology\u201d above and section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nInstructions for preparing reduced doses of Zoledronic acid Actavis \nWithdraw an appropriate volume of the concentrate needed, as follows: \n- 4.4 ml for 3.5 mg dose \n- 4.1 ml for 3.3 mg dose \n- 3.8 ml for 3.0 mg dose \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. The \nwithdrawn amount of concentrate must be further diluted in 100 ml of sterile 0.9% w/v sodium \nchloride solution or 5% w/v glucose solution. The dose must be given as a single intravenous infusion \nover no less than 15 minutes. \n \nZoledronic acid Actavis must not be mixed with calcium or other divalent cation-containing infusion \nsolutions such as lactated Ringer\u2019s solution, and should be administered as a single intravenous \nsolution in a separate infusion line. \n \nPatients must be maintained well hydrated prior to and following administration of Zoledronic acid \nActavis. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to other bisphosphonates or to any of the excipients \n\nlisted in section 6.1  \n\u2022 Breast-feeding (see section 4.6) \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \nPatients must be assessed prior to administration of Zoledronic acid Actavis to ensure that they are \nadequately hydrated. \n \nOverhydration should be avoided in patients at risk of cardiac failure. \n \nStandard hypercalcaemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate \nand magnesium, should be carefully monitored after initiating Zoledronic acid Actavis therapy. If \nhypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia, or hypomagnesaemia occurs, short-term supplemental therapy \nmay be necessary. Untreated hypercalcaemia patients generally have some degree of renal function \nimpairment, therefore careful renal function monitoring should be considered. \n \nOther products containing zoledronic acid as active substances are available for osteoporosis \nindications and treatment of Paget\u00b4s disease of the bone. Patients being treated with Zoledronic acid \nActavis should not be treated with such products or any other bisphosphonate concomitantly, since the \ncombined effects of these agents are unknown. \n \nRenal insufficiency \nPatients with TIH and evidence of deterioration in renal function should be appropriately evaluated \nwith consideration given as to whether the potential benefit of treatment with Zoledronic acid Actavis \noutweighs the possible risk. \n \nThe decision to treat patients with bone metastases for the prevention of skeletal related events should \nconsider that the onset of treatment effect is 2-3 months. \n \nZoledronic acid, used as indicated in sections 4.1 and 4.2, has been associated with reports of renal \ndysfunction. Factors that may increase the potential for deterioration in renal function include \ndehydration, pre-existing renal impairment, multiple cycles of zoledronic acid and other \nbisphosphonates as well as use of other nephrotoxic medicinal products. While the risk is reduced with \na dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid administered over 15 minutes, deterioration in renal function may still \noccur. Renal deterioration, progression to renal failure and dialysis have been reported in patients after \n\n\n\n5 \n\nthe initial dose or a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid. Increases in serum creatinine also occur in \nsome patients with chronic administration of zoledronic acid at recommended doses for prevention of \nskeletal related events, although less frequently. \n \nPatients should have their serum creatinine levels assessed prior to each dose of Zoledronic acid \nActavis. Upon initiation of treatment in patients with bone metastases with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment, lower doses of zoledronic acid are recommended. In patients who show evidence of renal \ndeterioration during treatment, Zoledronic acid Actavis should be withheld. Zoledronic acid Actavis \nshould only be resumed when serum creatinine returns to within 10% of baseline. Zoledronic acid \nActavis treatment should be resumed at the same dose as that given prior to treatment interruption. \n \nIn view of the potential impact of zoledronic acid on renal function, the lack of clinical safety data in \npatients with severe renal impairment (in clinical trials defined as serum creatinine \u2265 400 micromol/l \nor \u2265 4.5 mg/dl for patients with TIH and \u2265 265 micromol/l or \u2265 3.0 mg/dl for patients with cancer and \nbone metastases, respectively) at baseline and only limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with \nsevere renal impairment at baseline (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), the use of Zoledronic acid \nActavis is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment. \n \nHepatic insufficiency \nAs only limited clinical data are available in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, no specific \nrecommendations can be given for this patient population. \n \nOsteonecrosis \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported uncommonly in clinical trials and in the \npost-marketing setting in patients receiving zoledronic acid. \n \nThe start of treatment or of a new course of treatment should be delayed in patients with unhealed \nopen soft tissue lesions in the mouth, except in medical emergency situations. A dental examination \nwith appropriate preventive dentistry and an individual benefit-risk assessment is recommended prior \nto treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with concomitant risk factors. \n \nThe following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an individual\u2019s risk of developing \nONJ: \n- Potency of the bisphosphonate (higher risk for highly potent compounds), route of \n\nadministration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative dose of \nbisphosphonate. \n\n- Cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking. \n- Concomitant therapies: chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors (see section 4.5), radiotherapy to \n\nneck and head, corticosteroids. \n- History of dental disease, poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, invasive dental procedures \n\n(e.g. tooth extractions) and poorly fitting dentures \n \nAll patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, undergo routine dental check-ups, \nand immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, or non-healing of \nsores or discharge during treatment with Zoledronic acid Actavis. While on treatment, invasive dental \nprocedures should be performed only after careful consideration and be avoided in close proximity to \nzoledronic acid administration. For patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on \nbisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental \nprocedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment \nreduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.  \n \nThe management plan for patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration between \nthe treating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary interruption of \nzoledronic acid treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing risk \nfactors are mitigated where possible. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nOsteonecrosis of other anatomical sites \nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with bisphosphonates, mainly in \nassociation with long-term therapy. Possible risk factors for osteonecrosis of the external auditory \ncanal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk factors such as infection or trauma. The \npossibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal should be considered in patients receiving \nbisphosphonates who present with ear symptoms including chronic ear infections. \n \nAdditionally, there have been sporadic reports of osteonecrosis of other sites, including the hip and \nfemur, reported predominantly in adult cancer patients treated with zoledronic acid. \n \nMusculoskeletal pain \nIn post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain \nhave been reported in patients that were given zoledronic acid as indicated in sections 4.1 and 4.2. \nHowever, such reports have been infrequent. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to \nseveral months after starting treatment. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping treatment. \nA subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with zoledronic acid or another \nbisphosphonate. \n \nAtypical fractures of the femur \nAtypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate \ntherapy, primarily in patients receiving long-term treatment for osteoporosis. These transverse or short \noblique fractures can occur anywhere along the femur from just below the lesser trochanter to just \nabove the supracondylar flare. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma and some patients \nexperience thigh or groin pain, often associated with imaging features of stress fractures, weeks to \nmonths before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the \ncontralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a \nfemoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. Discontinuation of \nbisphosphonate therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered \npending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. \n \nDuring bisphosphonate treatment patients should be advised to report any thigh, hip or groin pain and \nany patient presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femur fracture. \n \nHypocalcaemia \nHypocalcaemia has been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid. Cardiac arrhythmias and \nneurologic adverse events (including convulsions, hypoaesthesia and tetany) have been reported \nsecondary to cases of severe hypocalcaemia. Cases of severe hypocalcaemia requiring hospitalisation \nhave been reported. In some instances, the hypocalcaemia may be life-threatening (see section 4.8). \nCaution is advised when zoledronic acid is administered with medicinal products known to cause \nhypocalcaemia, as they may have a synergistic effect resulting in severe hypocalcaemia (see section \n4.5). Serum calcium should be measured and hypocalcaemia must be corrected before initiating \nzoledronic acid therapy. Patients should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D. \n \nZoledronic acid Actavis contains sodium \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn clinical studies, zoledronic acid, used as indicated in sections 4.1 and 4.2, has been administered \nconcomitantly with commonly used anticancer agents, diuretics, antibiotics and analgesics without \nclinically apparent interactions occurring. Zoledronic acid shows no appreciable binding to plasma \nproteins and does not inhibit human P450 enzymes in vitro (see section 5.2), but no formal clinical \ninteraction studies have been performed. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nCaution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides, calcitonin or loop \ndiuretics, since these agents may have an additive effect, resulting in a lower serum calcium level for \nlonger periods than required (see section 4.4). \n \nCaution is indicated when Zoledronic acid Actavis is used with other potentially nephrotoxic \nmedicinal products. Attention should also be paid to the possibility of hypomagnesaemia developing \nduring treatment. \n \nIn multiple myeloma patients, the risk of renal dysfunction may be increased when Zoledronic acid \nActavis is used in combination with thalidomide. \n \nCaution is advised when Zoledronic acid Actavis is administered with anti-angiogenic medicinal \nproducts, as an increase in the incidence of ONJ has been observed in patients treated concomitantly \nwith these medicinal products. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data on the use of zoledronic acid in pregnant women. Animal reproduction \nstudies with zoledronic acid have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for \nhumans is unknown. Zoledronic acid Actavis should not be used during pregnancy. Women of child-\nbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether zoledronic acid is excreted into human milk. Zoledronic acid Actavis is \ncontraindicated in breast-feeding women (see section 4.3). \n \nFertility \nZoledronic acid was evaluated in rats for potential adverse effects on fertility of the parental and F1 \ngeneration. This resulted in exaggerated pharmacological effects considered to be related to the \ncompound\u2019s inhibition of skeletal calcium metabolisation, resulting in periparturient hypocalcaemia, a \nbisphosphonate class effect, dystocia and early termination of the study. Thus these results precluded \ndetermining a definitive effect of zoledronic acid on fertility in humans. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAdverse reactions, such as dizziness and somnolence, may have influence on the ability to drive or use \nmachines, therefore caution should be exercised with the use of Zoledronic acid Actavis along with \ndriving and operating of machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nWithin three days after zoledronic acid administration, used as indicated in sections 4.1 and 4.2, an \nacute phase reaction has commonly been reported, with symptoms including bone pain, fever, fatigue, \narthralgia, myalgia, rigors and arthritis with subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve \nwithin a few days (see description of selected adverse reactions). \n \nThe following are the important identified risks with zoledronic acid in the approved indications: \nRenal function impairment, osteonecrosis of the jaw, acute phase reaction, hypocalcaemia, atrial \nfibrillation, anaphylaxis, interstitial lung disease. The frequencies for each of these identified risks are \nshown in Table 1. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following adverse reactions, listed in Table 1, have been accumulated from clinical studies and \npost-marketing reports following predominantly chronic treatment with 4 mg zoledronic acid: \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTable 1 \n \nAdverse reactions are ranked under headings of frequency, the most frequent first, using the following \nconvention: Very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare \n(\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nCommon: Anaemia \nUncommon: Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia \nRare: Pancytopenia \n\nImmune system disorders \nUncommon: Hypersensitivity reaction \nRare: Angioneurotic oedema \n\nPsychiatric disorders \nUncommon: Anxiety, sleep disturbance \nRare: Confusion \n\nNervous system disorders \nCommon: Headache \nUncommon: \n \n \nVery rare: \n\nDizziness, paraesthesia,  dysgeusia, \nhypoaesthesia, hyperaesthesia, tremor, \nsomnolence \nConvulsions, hypoaesthesia and tetany \n(secondary to hypocalcaemia) \n\nEye disorders \nCommon: Conjunctivitis \nUncommon: \nRare: \n\nBlurred vision, scleritis and orbital inflammation \nUveitis \n\nVery rare: Episcleritis \nCardiac disorders \n\nUncommon: Hypertension, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, \nhypotension leading to syncope or circulatory \ncollapse \n\nRare: Bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmia (secondary to \nhypocalcaemia) \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: \nRare: \n\nDyspnoea, cough, bronchoconstriction \nInterstitial lung disease \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite \nUncommon: Diarrhoea, constipation, abdominal pain, \n\ndyspepsia, stomatitis, dry mouth \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nUncommon: Pruritus, rash (including erythematous and \nmacular rash), increased sweating \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon: Bone pain, myalgia, arthralgia, generalised pain \nUncommon: \nVery rare: \n\nMuscle spasms, osteonecrosis of the jaw \nOsteonecrosis of the external auditory canal \n(bisphosphonate class adverse reaction) and other \nanatomical sites including femur and hip \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \nCommon: Renal impairment \nUncommon: \nRare: \n\nAcute renal failure, haematuria, proteinuria \nAcquired Fanconi syndrome \n\n\n\n9 \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon: Fever, flu-like syndrome (including fatigue, \n\nrigors, malaise and flushing) \nUncommon: \n \n \n \nRare: \n\nAsthenia, peripheral oedema, injection site \nreactions (including pain, irritation, swelling, \ninduration), chest pain, weight increase, \nanaphylactic reaction/shock, urticaria \nArthritis and joint swelling as a symptom of acute \nphase reaction \n\nInvestigations \nVery common: Hypophosphataemia \nCommon: Blood creatinine and blood urea increased, \n\nhypocalcaemia \nUncommon: Hypomagnesaemia, hypokalaemia \nRare: Hyperkalaemia, hypernatraemia \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nRenal function impairment \nZoledronic acid, used as indicated in sections 4.1 and 4.2, has been associated with reports of renal \ndysfunction. In a pooled analysis of safety data from zoledronic acid registration trials for the \nprevention of skeletal-related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone, the \nfrequency of renal impairment adverse events suspected to be related to zoledronic acid (adverse \nreactions) was as follows: multiple myeloma (3.2%), prostate cancer (3.1%), breast cancer (4.3%), \nlung and other solid tumours (3.2%). Factors that may increase the potential for deterioration in renal \nfunction include dehydration, pre-existing renal impairment, multiple cycles of zoledronic acid or \nother bisphosphonates, as well as concomitant use of nephrotoxic medicinal products or using a \nshorter infusion time than currently recommended. Renal deterioration, progression to renal failure \nand dialysis have been reported in patients after the initial dose or a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic \nacid (see section 4.4). \n \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw \nCases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients treated with \nmedicinal products that inhibit bone resorption, such as zoledronic acid (see section 4.4). Many of \nthese patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids and had signs of local infection \nincluding osteomyelitis. The majority of the reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extractions \nor other dental surgeries. \n \nAtrial fibrillation \nIn one 3-year, randomised, double-blind controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of \nzoledronic acid 5 mg once yearly vs. placebo in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), \nthe overall incidence of atrial fibrillation was 2.5% (96 out of 3,862) and 1.9% (75 out of 3,852) in \npatients receiving zoledronic acid 5 mg and placebo, respectively. The rate of atrial fibrillation serious \nadverse events was 1.3% (51 out of 3,862) and 0.6% (22 out of 3,852) in patients receiving zoledronic \nacid 5 mg and placebo, respectively. The imbalance observed in this trial has not been observed in \nother trials with zoledronic acid, including those with zoledronic acid 4 mg every 3-4 weeks in \noncology patients. The mechanism behind the increased incidence of atrial fibrillation in this single \nclinical trial is unknown. \n \nAcute phase reaction \nThis adverse drug reaction consists of a constellation of symptoms that includes fever, myalgia, \nheadache, extremity pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, arthralgia and arthritis with subsequent joint \nswelling. The onset time is \u2264 3 days post-zoledronic acid infusion (used as indicated in sections 4.1 \nand 4.2), and the reaction is also referred to using the terms \u201cflu-like\u201d or \u201cpost-dose\u201d symptoms.  \n \nAtypical fractures of the femur \nDuring post-marketing experience the following reactions have been reported (frequency rare): \nAtypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures (bisphopsphonate class adverse reaction). \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nHypocalcaemia-related ADRs \nHypocalcaemia is an important identified risk with zoledronic acid in the approved indications. Based \non the review of both clinical trial and post-marketing cases, there is sufficient evidence to support an \nassociation between zoledronic acid therapy, the reported event of hypocalcaemia, and the secondary \ndevelopment of cardiac arrhythmia. Furthermore, there is evidence of an association between \nhypocalcaemia and secondary neurological events reported in these cases including; convulsions, \nhypoaesthesia and tetany (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nClinical experience with acute overdose of zoledronic acid is limited. The administration of doses up \nto 48 mg of zoledronic acid in error has been reported. Patients who have received doses higher than \nthose recommended (see section 4.2) should be carefully monitored, since renal function impairment \n(including renal failure) and serum electrolyte (including calcium, phosphorus and magnesium) \nabnormalities have been observed. In the event of hypocalcaemia, calcium gluconate infusions should \nbe administered as clinically indicated. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for treatment of bone diseases, bisphosphonates, ATC code: \nM05BA08 \n \nZoledronic acid belongs to the class of bisphosphonates and acts primarily on bone. It is an inhibitor of \nosteoclastic bone resorption. \n \nThe selective action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralised bone, \nbut the precise molecular mechanism leading to the inhibition of osteoclastic activity is still unclear. In \nlong-term animal studies, zoledronic acid inhibits bone resorption without adversely affecting the \nformation, mineralisation or mechanical properties of bone. \n \nIn addition to being a potent inhibitor of bone resorption, zoledronic acid also possesses several \nanti-tumour properties that could contribute to its overall efficacy in the treatment of metastatic bone \ndisease. The following properties have been demonstrated in preclinical studies: \n- In vivo: Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption, which alters the bone \n\nmarrow microenvironment, making it less conducive to tumour cell growth, anti-angiogenic \nactivity and anti-pain activity. \n\n- In vitro: Inhibition of osteoblast proliferation, direct cytostatic and pro-apoptotic activity on \ntumour cells, synergistic cytostatic effect with other anti-cancer drugs, anti-adhesion/invasion \nactivity. \n\n \nClinical trial results in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies \ninvolving bone \nThe first randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared zoledronic acid 4 mg to \nplacebo for the prevention of skeletal related events (SREs) in prostate cancer patients. Zoledronic \nacid 4 mg significantly reduced the proportion of patients experiencing at least one skeletal related \nevent (SRE), delayed the median time to first SRE by > 5 months, and reduced the annual incidence of \nevents per patient - skeletal morbidity rate. Multiple event analysis showed a 36% risk reduction in \n\n\n\n11 \n\ndeveloping SREs in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group compared with placebo. Patients receiving \nzoledronic acid 4 mg reported less increase in pain than those receiving placebo, and the difference \nreached significance at months 3, 9, 21 and 24. Fewer zoledronic acid 4 mg patients suffered \npathological fractures. The treatment effects were less pronounced in patients with blastic lesions. \nEfficacy results are provided in Table 2. \n \nIn a second study including solid tumours other than breast or prostate cancer, zoledronic acid 4 mg \nsignificantly reduced the proportion of patients with an SRE, delayed the median time to first SRE by \n> 2 months, and reduced the skeletal morbidity rate. Multiple event analysis showed 30.7% risk \nreduction in developing SREs in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group compared with placebo.

Patients were \nevenly distributed between zoledronic acid-treated and placebo groups. \n \nThe SRE rate (events/person year) was 0.628 for zoledronic acid and 1.096 for placebo. The \nproportion of patients with at least one SRE (excluding hypercalcaemia) was 29.8% in the zoledronic \nacid-treated group versus 49.6% in the placebo group (p=0.003). Median time to onset of the first SRE \nwas not reached in the zoledronic acid-treated arm at the end of the study and was significantly \nprolonged compared to placebo (p=0.007). Zoledronic acid 4 mg reduced the risk of SREs by 41% in a \nmultiple event analysis (risk ratio=0.59, p=0.019) compared with placebo. \n \nIn the zoledronic acid-treated group, statistically significant improvement in pain scores (using the \nBrief Pain Inventory, BPI) was seen at 4 weeks and at every subsequent time point during the study, \nwhen compared to placebo (Figure 1). The pain score for zoledronic acid was consistently below \nbaseline and pain reduction was accompanied by a trend in reduced analgesics score. \n \nFigure 1: Mean changes from baseline in BPI scores. Statistically significant differences are \nmarked (*p<0.05) for between treatment comparisons (4 mg zoledronic acid vs. placebo) \n \n\n \n \n \n \nClinical trial results in the treatment of TIH \nClinical studies in tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH) demonstrated that the effect of zoledronic \nacid is characterised by decreases in serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion. In Phase I dose \nfinding studies in patients with mild to moderate tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH), effective \ndoses tested were in the range of approximately 1.2-2.5 mg. \n \nTo assess the effects of 4 mg zoledronic acid versus pamidronate 90 mg, the results of two pivotal \nmulticentre studies in patients with TIH were combined in a pre-planned analysis. There was faster \nnormalisation of corrected serum calcium at day 4 for 8 mg zoledronic acid and at day 7 for 4 mg and \n8 mg zoledronic acid. The following response rates were observed: \n \n\nPlacebo \nZoledronic acid \n\nB\nPI\n\n m\nea\n\nn \nch\n\nan\nge\n\n fr\nom\n\n b\nas\n\nel\nin\n\ne \n\nTime on study (weeks) \n\n\n\n14 \n\nTable 5: Proportion of complete responders by day in the combined TIH studies \n \n Day 4 Day 7 Day 10 \nZoledronic acid 4 mg (N=86) 45.3% (p=0.104) 82.6% (p=0.005)* 88.4% (p=0.002)* \nZoledronic acid 8 mg (N=90) 55.6% (p=0.021)* 83.3% (p=0.010)* 86.7% (p=0.015)* \nPamidronate 90 mg (N=99) 33.3% 63.6% 69.7% \n*p-values compared to pamidronate. \n \nMedian time to normocalcaemia was 4 days. Median time to relapse (re-increase of albumin-corrected \nserum calcium \u2265 2.9 mmol/l) was 30 to 40 days for patients treated with zoledronic acid versus \n17 days for those treated with pamidronate 90 mg (p-values: 0.001 for 4 mg and 0.007 for 8 mg \nzoledronic acid). There were no statistically significant differences between the two zoledronic acid \ndoses. \n \nIn clinical trials 69 patients who relapsed or were refractory to initial treatment (zoledronic acid 4 mg, \n8 mg or pamidronate 90 mg) were retreated with 8 mg zoledronic acid. The response rate in these \npatients was about 52%. Since those patients were retreated with the 8 mg dose only, there are no data \navailable allowing comparison with the 4 mg zoledronic acid dose. \n \nIn clinical trials performed in patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH), the overall safety \nprofile amongst all three treatment groups (zoledronic acid 4 and 8 mg and pamidronate 90 mg) was \nsimilar in types and severity. \n \nPaediatric population \nClinical trial results in the treatment of severe osteogenesis imperfecta in paediatric patients aged \n1 to 17 years \nThe effects of intravenous zoledronic acid in the treatment of paediatric patients (age 1 to 17 years) \nwith severe osteogenesis imperfecta (types I, III and IV) were compared to intravenous pamidronate in \none international, multicentre, randomised, open-label study with 74 and 76 patients in each treatment \ngroup, respectively. The study treatment period was 12 months preceded by a 4- to 9-week screening \nperiod during which vitamin D and elemental calcium supplements were taken for at least 2 weeks. In \nthe clinical programme patients aged 1 to < 3 years received 0.025 mg/kg zoledronic acid (up to a \nmaximum single dose of 0.35 mg) every 3 months and patients aged 3 to 17 years received 0.05 mg/kg \nzoledronic acid (up to a maximum single dose of 0.83 mg) every 3 months. An extension study was \nconducted in order to examine the long-term general and renal safety of once yearly or twice yearly \nzoledronic acid over the 12-month extension treatment period in children who had completed one year \nof treatment with either zoledronic acid or pamidronate in the core study. \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was the percent change from baseline in lumbar spine bone mineral \ndensity (BMD) after 12 months of treatment. Estimated treatment effects on BMD were similar, but \nthe trial design was not sufficiently robust to establish non-inferior efficacy for zoledronic acid. In \nparticular there was no clear evidence of efficacy on incidence of fracture or on pain. Fracture adverse \nevents of long bones in the lower extremities were reported in approximately 24% (femur) and 14% \n(tibia) of zoledronic acid-treated patients vs 12% and 5% of pamidronate-treated patients with severe \nosteogenesis imperfecta, regardless of disease type and causality but overall incidence of fractures was \ncomparable for the zoledronic acid and pamidronate-treated patients: 43% (32/74) vs 41% (31/76). \nInterpretation of the risk of fracture is confounded by the fact that fractures are common events in \npatients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta as part of the disease process. \n \nThe type of adverse reactions observed in this population were similar to those previously seen in \nadults with advanced malignancies involving the bone (see section 4.8). The adverse reactions ranked \nunder headings of frequency, are presented in Table 6. The following conventional classification is \nused: very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare \n(\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nTable 6: Adverse reactions observed in paediatric patients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta1 \n \nNervous system disorders  \n\nCommon: Headache \nCardiac disorders  \n\nCommon: Tachycardia \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders  \n\nCommon: Nasopharyngitis \nGastrointestinal disorders  \n\nVery common: Vomiting, nausea \nCommon: Abdominal pain \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders  \nCommon: Pain in extremities, arthralgia, musculoskeletal \n\npain \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nVery common: Pyrexia, fatigue \nCommon: Acute phase reaction, pain \n\nInvestigations  \nVery common: Hypocalcaemia \nCommon: Hypophosphataemia \n\n1Adverse events occurring with frequencies < 5% were medically assessed and it was shown that these \ncases are consistent with the well established safety profile of zoledronic acid as indicated in \nsections 4.1 and 4.2 (see section 4.8) \n \nIn paediatric patients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta, zoledronic acid seems to be associated with \nmore pronounced risks for acute phase reaction, hypocalcaemia and unexplained tachycardia, in \ncomparison to pamidronate, but this difference declined after subsequent infusions. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing zoledronic acid in all subsets of the paediatric population in \nthe treatment of tumour-induced hypercalcaemia and prevention of skeletal-related events in patients \nwith advanced malignancies involving bone (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nSingle and multiple 5- and 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg zoledronic acid in 64 patients \nwith bone metastases yielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which were found to be dose \nindependent. \n \nAfter initiating the infusion of zoledronic acid, the plasma concentrations of zoledronic acid rapidly \nincreased, achieving their peak at the end of the infusion period, followed by a rapid decline to < 10% \nof peak after 4 hours and < 1% of peak after 24 hours, with a subsequent prolonged period of very low \nconcentrations not exceeding 0.1% of peak prior to the second infusion of zoledronic acid on day 28. \n \nIntravenously administered zoledronic acid is eliminated by a triphasic process: rapid biphasic \ndisappearance from the systemic circulation, with half-lives of t\u00bd \u03b1 0.24 and t\u00bd\u03b2 1.87 hours, followed \nby a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination half-life of t\u00bd\u03b3 146 hours. There was no \naccumulation of zoledronic acid in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days. Zoledronic acid is \nnot metabolised and is excreted unchanged via the kidney. Over the first 24 hours, 39 \u00b1 16% of the \nadministered dose is recovered in the urine, while the remainder is principally bound to bone tissue. \n \nFrom the bone tissue it is released very slowly back into the systemic circulation and eliminated via \nthe kidney. The total body clearance is 5.04 \u00b1 2.5 l/h, independent of dose, and unaffected by gender, \nage, race, and body weight. Increasing the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes caused a 30% decrease \nin zoledronic acid concentration at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the \nplasma concentration versus time curve. \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \nThe interpatient variability in pharmacokinetic parameters for zoledronic acid was high, as seen with \nother bisphosphonates. \n \nNo pharmacokinetic data for zoledronic acid are available in patients with hypercalcaemia or in \npatients with hepatic insufficiency. Zoledronic acid does not inhibit human P450 enzymes in vitro, \nshows no biotransformation and in animal studies < 3% of the administered dose was recovered in the \nfaeces, suggesting no relevant role of liver function in the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid. \n \nThe renal clearance of zoledronic acid was correlated with creatinine clearance, renal clearance \nrepresenting 75 \u00b1 33% of the creatinine clearance, which showed a mean of 84 \u00b1 29 ml/min (range \n22 to 143 ml/min) in the 64 cancer patients studied. Population analysis showed that for a patient with \ncreatinine clearance of 20 ml/min (severe renal impairment), or 50 ml/min (moderate impairment), the \ncorresponding predicted clearance of zoledronic acid would be 37% or 72%, respectively, of that of a \npatient showing creatinine clearance of 84 ml/min. Only limited pharmacokinetic data are available in \npatients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). \n \nIn an in vitro study, zoledronic acid showed low affinity for the cellular components of human blood, \nwith a mean blood to plasma concentration ratio of 0.59 in a concentration range of 30 ng/ml to \n5000 ng/ml. The plasma protein binding is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% at \n2 ng/ml to 77% at 2000 ng/ml of zoledronic acid. \n \nSpecial populations \nPaediatric patients \nLimited pharmacokinetic data in children with severe osteogenesis imperfecta suggest that zoledronic \nacid pharmacokinetics in children aged 3 to 17 years are similar to those in adults at a similar mg/kg \ndose level. Age, body weight, gender and creatinine clearance appear to have no effect on zoledronic \nacid systemic exposure. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAcute toxicity \nThe highest non-lethal single intravenous dose was 10 mg/kg bodyweight in mice and 0.6 mg/kg in \nrats. \n \nSubchronic and chronic toxicity \nZoledronic acid was well tolerated when administered subcutaneously to rats and intravenously to \ndogs at doses up to 0.02 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks. Administration of 0.001 mg/kg/day subcutaneously \nin rats and 0.005 mg/kg intravenously once every 2-3 days in dogs for up to 52 weeks was also well \ntolerated. \n \nThe most frequent finding in repeat-dose studies consisted of increased primary spongiosa in the \nmetaphyses of long bones in growing animals at nearly all doses, a finding that reflected the \ncompound\u2019s pharmacological antiresorptive activity. \n \nThe safety margins relative to renal effects were narrow in the long-term repeat-dose parenteral animal \nstudies but the cumulative no adverse event levels (NOAELs) in the single dose (1.6 mg/kg) and \nmultiple dose studies of up to one month (0.06-0.6 mg/kg/day) did not indicate renal effects at doses \nequivalent to or exceeding the highest intended human therapeutic dose. Longer-term repeat \nadministration at doses bracketing the highest intended human therapeutic dose of zoledronic acid \nproduced toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen and \nlungs, and at intravenous injection sites. \n \nReproduction toxicity \nZoledronic acid was teratogenic in the rat at subcutaneous doses \u2265 0.2 mg/kg. Although no \nteratogenicity or foetotoxicity was observed in the rabbit, maternal toxicity was found. Dystocia was \nobserved at the lowest dose (0.01 mg/kg bodyweight) tested in the rat. \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \nMutagenicity and carcinogenic potential \nZoledronic acid was not mutagenic in the mutagenicity tests performed and carcinogenicity testing did \nnot provide any evidence of carcinogenic potential. \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Zoledronic acid Actavis is and what it is used for \n \nThe active substance in Zoledronic acid Actavis is zoledronic acid, which belongs to a group of \nsubstances called bisphosphonates. Zoledronic acid works by attaching itself to the bone and slowing \ndown the rate of bone change. It is used: \n\u2022 To prevent bone complications, e.g. fractures, in adult patients with bone metastases (spread \n\nof cancer from primary site to the bone). \n\u2022 To reduce the amount of calcium in the blood in adult patients where it is too high due to the \n\npresence of a tumour. Tumours can accelerate normal bone change in such a way that the \nrelease of calcium from bone is increased. This condition is known as tumour-induced \nhypercalcaemia (TIH). \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Zoledronic acid Actavis \n \nFollow carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor. \n \nYour doctor will carry out blood tests before you start treatment with Zoledronic acid Actavis and will \ncheck your response to treatment at regular intervals. \n \nYou should not be given Zoledronic acid Actavis: \n- if you are allergic to zoledronic acid, another bisphosphonate (the group of substances to which \n\nZoledronic acid Actavis belongs), or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n\n- if you are breast-feeding. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before you are given Zoledronic acid Actavis: \n- if you have or have had a kidney problem. \n- if you have or have had pain, swelling or numbness of the jaw, a feeling of heaviness in the \n\njaw or loosening of a tooth. Your doctor may recommend a dental examination before you start \ntreatment with Zoledronic acid Actavis. \n\n- if you are having dental treatment or are due to undergo dental surgery, tell your dentist that \nyou are being treated with Zoledronic acid Actavis and inform your doctor about your dental \ntreatment. \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \nWhile being treated with Zoledronic acid Actavis, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including \nregular teeth brushing) and receive routine dental check-ups. \n \nContact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth \nsuch as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of a \ncondition called osteonecrosis of the jaw. \n \nPatients who are undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, who are taking steroids, who are \nundergoing dental surgery, who do not receive routine dental care, who have gum disease, who are \nsmokers, or who were previously treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone \ndisorders) may have a higher risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw. \n \nReduced levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcaemia), sometimes leading to muscle cramps, dry \nskin, burning sensation, have been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid. Irregular heart \nbeat (cardiac arrhythmia), seizures, spasm and twitching (tetany) have been reported as secondary to \nsevere hypocalcaemia. In some instances the hypocalcaemia may be life-threatening. If any of these \napply to you, tell your doctor straight away. If you have pre-existing hypocalcaemia, it must be \ncorrected before initiating the first dose of Zoledronic acid Actavis. You will be given adequate \ncalcium and vitamin D supplements. \n \nPatients aged 65 years and over \nZoledronic acid Actavis can be given to people aged 65 years and over. There is no evidence to \nsuggest that any extra precautions are needed. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nZoledronic acid Actavis is not recommended for use in adolescents and children below the age of \n18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Zoledronic acid Actavis \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. It is \nespecially important that you tell your doctor if you are also taking: \n- Aminoglycosides (medicines used to treat severe infections), calcitonin (a type of medicine used \n\nto treat post-menopausal osteoporosis and hypercalcaemia), loop diuretics (a type of medicine to \ntreat high blood pressure or oedema) or other calcium-lowering medicines, since the \ncombination of these with bisphosphonates may cause the calcium level in the blood to become \ntoo low. \n\n- Thalidomide (a medicine used to treat a certain type of blood cancer involving the bone) or any \nother medicines which may harm your kidneys. \n\n- Other medicines that contain zoledronic acid which are used to treat osteoporosis and other non-\ncancer diseases of the bone, or any other bisphosphonate, since the combined effects of these \nmedicines taken together with Zoledronic acid Actavis are unknown. \n\n- Anti-angiogenic medicines (used to treat cancer), since the combination of these with zoledronic \nacid has been associated with an increased risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou should not be given Zoledronic acid Actavis if you are pregnant. Tell your doctor if you are or \nthink that you may be pregnant. \n \nYou must not be given Zoledronic acid Actavis if you are breast-feeding. \n \nAsk your doctor for advice before taking any medicine while you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThere have been very rare cases of drowsiness and sleepiness with the use of zoledronic acid. You \nshould therefore be careful when driving, using machinery or performing other tasks that need full \nattention. \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \nZoledronic acid Actavis contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n \n3. How Zoledronic acid Actavis is used \n \n- Zoledronic acid Actavis must only be given by healthcare professionals trained in administering \n\nbisphosphonates intravenously, i.e. through a vein. \n- Your doctor will recommend that you drink enough water before each treatment to help prevent \n\ndehydration. \n- Carefully follow all the other instructions given to you by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nHow much Zoledronic acid Actavis is given \n- The usual single dose given is 4 mg. \n- If you have a kidney problem, your doctor will give you a lower dose depending on the severity \n\nof your kidney problem. \n \nHow often Zoledronic acid Actavis is given \n- If you are being treated for the prevention of bone complications due to bone metastases, you \n\nwill be given one infusion of Zoledronic acid Actavis every three to four weeks. \n- If you are being treated to reduce the amount of calcium in your blood, you will normally only \n\nbe given one infusion of Zoledronic acid Actavis. \n \nHow Zoledronic acid Actavis is given \n- Zoledronic acid Actavis is given as a drip (infusion) into a vein which should take at least \n\n15 minutes and should be administered as a single intravenous solution in a separate infusion \nline. \n\n \nPatients whose blood calcium levels are not too high will also be prescribed calcium and vitamin D \nsupplements to be taken each day. \n \nIf you are given more Zoledronic acid Actavis than you should be \nIf you have received doses higher than those recommended, you must be carefully monitored by your \ndoctor. This is because you may develop serum electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. abnormal levels of \ncalcium, phosphorus and magnesium) and/or changes in kidney function, including severe kidney \nimpairment. If your level of calcium falls too low, you may have to be given supplemental calcium by \ninfusion. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The most \ncommon ones are usually mild and will probably disappear after a short time. \n \nTell your doctor about any of the following serious side effects straight away: \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):  \n- Severe kidney impairment (will normally be determined by your doctor with certain specific \n\nblood tests). \n- Low level of calcium in the blood. \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):  \n- Pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or non-healing sores inside the mouth or jaw, \n\ndischarge, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth. These could \nbe signs of bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis). Tell your doctor and dentist immediately if \n\n\n\n30 \n\nyou experience such symptoms while being treated with Zoledronic acid Actavis or after \nstopping treatment. \n\n- Irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) has been seen in patients receiving zoledronic acid for \npostmenopausal osteoporosis. It is currently unclear whether zoledronic acid causes this \nirregular heart rhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you experience such symptoms \nafter you have received zoledronic acid. \n\n- Severe allergic reaction: shortness of breath, swelling mainly of the face and throat. \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n- As a consequence of low calcium values: irregular heart beat (cardiac arrhythmia; secondary to \n\nhypocalcaemia). \n- A kidney function disorder called Fanconi syndrome (will normally be determined by your \n\ndoctor with certain urine tests). \n \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \n- As a consequence of low calcium values: seizures, numbness and tetany (secondary to \n\nhypocalcaemia). \n- Talk to your doctor if you have ear pain, discharge from the ear, and/or an ear infection. These \n\ncould be signs of bone damage in the ear. \n- Osteonecrosis has also very rarely been seen occurring with other bones than the jaw, especially \n\nthe hip or thigh. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as new onset or \nworsening of aches, pain or stiffness while being treated with Zoledronic acid Actavis or after \nstopping treatment. \n\n \nTell your doctor about any of the following side effects as soon as possible: \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n- Low level of phosphate in the blood. \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n- Headache and a flu-like syndrome consisting of fever, fatigue, weakness, drowsiness, chills and \n\nbone, joint and/or muscle ache. In most cases no specific treatment is required and the \nsymptoms disappear after a short time (couple of hours or days). \n\n- Gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea and vomiting as well as loss of appetite. \n- Conjunctivitis. \n- Low level of red blood cells (anaemia). \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n- Hypersensitivity reactions. \n- Low blood pressure. \n- Chest pain. \n- Skin reactions (redness and swelling) at the infusion site, rash, itching. \n- High blood pressure, shortness of breath, dizziness, anxiety, sleep disturbances, taste \n\ndisturbances, trembling, tingling or numbness of the hands or feet, diarrhoea, constipation, \nabdominal pain, dry mouth. \n\n- Low counts of white blood cells and blood platelets. \n- Low level of magnesium and potassium in the blood. Your doctor will monitor this and take any \n\nnecessary measures. \n- Weight increase. \n- Increased sweating. \n- Sleepiness. \n- Blurred vision, tearing of the eye, eye sensitivity to light. \n- Sudden coldness with fainting, limpness or collapse. \n- Difficulty in breathing with wheezing or coughing. \n- Urticaria. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n- Slow heart beat. \n- Confusion. \n- Unusual fracture of the thigh bone particularly in patients on long-term treatment for \n\nosteoporosis may occur rarely. Contact your doctor if you experience pain, weakness or \ndiscomfort in your thigh, hip or groin as this may be an early indication of a possible fracture of \nthe thigh bone. \n\n- Interstitial lung disease (inflammation of the tissue around the air sacks of the lungs) \n- Flu-like symptoms including arthritis and joint swelling. \n- Painful redness and/or swelling of the eye. \n \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): \n- Fainting due to low blood pressure. \n- Severe bone, joint and/or muscle pain, occasionally incapacitating. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.

If a lower dose of Zoledronic acid Actavis is required, first \nwithdraw the appropriate volume as indicated below and then dilute it further with 100 ml of \ninfusion solution. To avoid potential incompatibilities, the infusion solution used for dilution \nmust be either 0.9% w/v sodium chloride or 5% w/v glucose solution. \n\n \nDo not mix Zoledronic acid Actavis concentrate with calcium-containing or other divalent \ncation containing solutions such as lactated Ringer\u2019s solution. \n\n \nInstructions for preparing reduced doses of Zoledronic acid Actavis: \nWithdraw the appropriate volume of the liquid concentrate, as follows: \n- 4.4 ml for 3.5 mg dose \n- 4.1 ml for 3.3 mg dose \n- 3.8 ml for 3.0 mg dose \n\n \n- For single use only. Any unused solution should be discarded. Only clear solution free from \n\nparticles and discolouration should be used. Aseptic techniques must be followed during the \npreparation of the infusion.  \n\n \n- Shelf life after dilution: Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for \n\n24 hours at 2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C and at 25\u00b0C after dilution in 100 ml 0.9% w/v sodium chloride solution or \n100 ml 5% w/v glucose. From a microbiological point of view, the solution for infusion should \nbe used immediately after dilution. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions \nprior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at \n2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C. If refrigerated, the solution must be allowed to reach room temperature before \nadministration. \n\n \n\n\n\n34 \n\n- The solution containing zoledronic acid is given as a single 15-minute intravenous infusion in a \nseparate infusion line. The hydration status of patients must be assessed prior to and following \nadministration of Zoledronic acid Actavis to ensure that they are adequately hydrated. \n\n \n- Since no data are available on the compatibility of Zoledronic acid Actavis with other \n\nintravenously administered substances, Zoledronic acid Actavis must not be mixed with other \nmedications/substances and should always be given through a separate infusion line. \n\n \nHow to store Zoledronic acid Actavis \n \n- Keep Zoledronic acid Actavis out of the sight and reach of children. \n- Do not use Zoledronic acid Actavis after the expiry date stated on the vial and carton after EXP. \n- This medicinal product does not require any specific storage conditions. \n- For storage conditions of Zoledronic acid Actavis after dilution, see \u201cShelf life after dilution\u201d \n\nabove. \n \n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

regular intervals. you should not be given zoledronic acid actavis: - if you are allergic to zoledronic acid, another bisphosphonate (the group of substances to which zoledronic acid actavis belongs), or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). - if you are breast-feeding. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before you are given zoledronic acid actavis: - if you have or have had a kidney problem. - if you have or have had pain, swelling or numbness of the jaw, a feeling of heaviness in the jaw or loosening of a tooth. your doctor may recommend a dental examination before you start treatment with zoledronic acid actavis. - if you are having dental treatment or are due to undergo dental surgery, tell your dentist that you are being treated with zoledronic acid actavis and inform your doctor about your dental treatment. while being treated with zoledronic acid actavis, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including regular teeth brushing) and receive routine dental check-ups. contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of a condition called osteonecrosis of the jaw. patients who are undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, who are taking steroids, who are undergoing dental surgery, who do not receive routine dental care, who have gum disease, who are smokers, or who were previously treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone disorders) may have a higher risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw. reduced levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcaemia), sometimes leading to muscle cramps, dry skin, burning sensation, have been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid. irregular heart beat (cardiac arrhythmia), seizures, spasm and twitching (tetany) have been reported as secondary to severe hypocalcaemia. in some instances the hypocalcaemia may be life-threatening. if any of these apply to you, tell your doctor straight away. if you have pre-existing hypocalcaemia, it must be corrected before initiating the first dose of zoledronic acid actavis. you will be given adequate calcium and vitamin d supplements. patients aged 65 years and over zoledronic acid actavis can be given to people aged 65 years and over. there is no evidence to suggest that any extra precautions are needed. children and adolescents zoledronic acid actavis is not recommended for use in adolescents and children below the age of 18 years. other medicines and zoledronic acid actavis tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. it is especially important that you tell your doctor if you are also taking: - aminoglycosides (medicines used to treat severe infections), calcitonin (a type of medicine used to treat post-menopausal osteoporosis and hypercalcaemia), loop diuretics (a type of medicine to treat high blood pressure or oedema) or other calcium-lowering medicines, since the combination of these with bisphosphonates may cause the calcium level in the blood to become too low. - thalidomide (a medicine used to treat a certain type of blood cancer involving the bone) or any other medicines which may harm your kidneys. - other medicines that contain zoledronic acid which are used to treat osteoporosis and other non- cancer diseases of the bone, or any other bisphosphonate, since the combined effects of these medicines taken together with zoledronic acid actavis are unknown. - anti-angiogenic medicines (used to treat cancer), since the combination of these with zoledronic acid has been associated with an increased risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (onj). pregnancy and breast-feeding you should not be given zoledronic acid actavis if you are pregnant. tell your doctor if you are or think that you may be pregnant. you must not be given zoledronic acid actavis if you are breast-feeding. ask your doctor for advice before taking any medicine while you are pregnant or breast-feeding. driving and using machines there have been very rare cases of drowsiness and sleepiness with the use of zoledronic acid. you should therefore be careful when driving, using machinery or performing other tasks that need full attention. zoledronic acid actavis contains sodium this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially \"sodium-free\".", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "zoledronic acid actavis", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME",

depending on the severity of your kidney problem. how often zoledronic acid actavis is given - if you are being treated for the prevention of bone complications due to bone metastases, you will be given one infusion of zoledronic acid actavis every three to four weeks. - if you are being treated to reduce the amount of calcium in your blood, you will normally only be given one infusion of zoledronic acid actavis. how zoledronic acid actavis is given - zoledronic acid actavis is given as a drip (infusion) into a vein which should take at least 15 minutes and should be administered as a single intravenous solution in a separate infusion line. patients whose blood calcium levels are not too high will also be prescribed calcium and vitamin d supplements to be taken each day. if you are given more zoledronic acid actavis than you should be if you have received doses higher than those recommended, you must be carefully monitored by your doctor. this is because you may develop serum electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. abnormal levels of calcium, phosphorus and magnesium) and/or changes in kidney function, including severe kidney impairment. if your level of calcium falls too low, you

tests). - low level of calcium in the blood. uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): - pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or non-healing sores inside the mouth or jaw, discharge, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth. these could be signs of bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis). tell your doctor and dentist immediately if 30 you experience such symptoms while being treated with zoledronic acid actavis or after stopping treatment. - irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) has been seen in patients receiving zoledronic acid for postmenopausal osteoporosis. it is currently unclear whether zoledronic acid causes this irregular heart rhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you experience such symptoms after you have received zoledronic acid. - severe allergic reaction: shortness of breath, swelling mainly of the face and throat. rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): - as a consequence of low calcium values: irregular heart beat (cardiac arrhythmia; secondary to hypocalcaemia). - a kidney function disorder called fanconi syndrome (will normally be determined by your doctor with certain urine tests). very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): - as a consequence of low calcium values: seizures, numbness and tetany (secondary to hypocalcaemia). - talk to your doctor if you have ear pain, discharge from the ear, and/or an ear infection. these could be signs of bone damage in the ear. - osteonecrosis has also very rarely been seen occurring with other bones than the jaw, especially the hip or thigh. tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as new onset or worsening of aches, pain or stiffness while being treated with zoledronic acid actavis or after stopping treatment. tell your doctor about any of the following side effects as soon as possible: very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): - low level of phosphate in the blood. common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): - headache and a flu-like syndrome consisting of fever, fatigue, weakness, drowsiness, chills and bone, joint and/or muscle ache. in most cases no specific treatment is required and the symptoms disappear after a short time (couple of hours or days). - gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea and vomiting as well as loss of appetite. - conjunctivitis. - low level of red blood cells (anaemia). uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): - hypersensitivity reactions. - low blood pressure. - chest pain. - skin reactions (redness and swelling) at the infusion site, rash, itching. - high blood pressure, shortness of breath, dizziness, anxiety, sleep disturbances, taste disturbances, trembling, tingling or numbness of the hands or feet, diarrhoea, constipation, abdominal pain, dry mouth. - low counts of white blood cells and blood platelets. - low level of magnesium and potassium in the blood. your doctor will monitor this and take any necessary measures. - weight increase. - increased sweating. - sleepiness. - blurred vision, tearing of the eye, eye sensitivity to light. - sudden coldness with fainting, limpness or collapse. - difficulty in breathing with wheezing or coughing. - urticaria. rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): - slow heart beat. - confusion. - unusual fracture of the thigh bone particularly in patients on long-term treatment for osteoporosis may occur rarely. contact your doctor if you experience pain, weakness or discomfort in your thigh, hip or groin as this may be an early indication of a possible fracture of the thigh bone. - interstitial lung disease (inflammation of the tissue around the air sacks of the lungs) - flu-like symptoms including arthritis and joint swelling. - painful redness and/or swelling of the eye. very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): - fainting due to low blood pressure. - severe bone, joint and/or muscle pain, occasionally incapacitating. reporting of side effects if you get any side
