NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNityr 10 mg tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 10 mg nitisinone. \n \nExcipient with known effect \n \nEach tablet contains less than 120 mg of lactose (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet. \n \nWhite to beige, round (7 x 2.3 mm), flat tablets which may display light yellow to brown speckles, \nmarked “10” on one side and “L” on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of adult and paediatric patients with confirmed diagnosis of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 \n(HT-1) in combination with dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNitisinone treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the treatment of \nHT-1 patients. \n \nPosology \nTreatment of all genotypes of the disease should be initiated as early as possible to increase overall \nsurvival and avoid complications such as liver failure, liver cancer and renal disease. Adjunct to the \nnitisinone treatment, a diet deficient in phenylalanine and tyrosine is required and should be followed \nby monitoring of plasma amino acids (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nThe recommended initial dose in the paediatric and adult population is 1 mg/kg body weight \nadministered orally. The dose of nitisinone should be adjusted individually. It is recommended to \nadminister the dose once daily. However, due to the limited data in patients with body weight <20kg, \nit is recommended to divide the total daily dose into two daily administrations in this patient \npopulation.  \n \nDose adjustment \nDuring regular monitoring, it is appropriate to follow urine succinylacetone, liver function test values \nand alpha-fetoprotein levels (see section 4.4). If urine succinylacetone is still detectable one month \nafter the start of nitisinone treatment, the nitisinone dose should be increased to 1.5 mg/kg body \nweight/day. A dose of 2 mg/kg body weight/day may be needed based on the evaluation of all \nbiochemical parameters. This dose should be considered as a maximal dose for all patients. If the \nbiochemical response is satisfactory, the dose should be adjusted only according to body weight gain. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nHowever, in addition to the tests above, during the initiation of therapy, switch from twice daily to \nonce daily dosing or if there is a deterioration, it may be necessary to follow more closely all available \nbiochemical parameters (i.e. plasma succinylacetone, urine 5-aminolevulinate (ALA) and erythrocyte \nporphobilinogen (PBG)-synthase activity). \n \nSpecial populations \nThere are no specific dose recommendations for elderly or patients that have renal or hepatic \nimpairment. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe dose recommendation in mg/kg body weight is the same in children and adults. However, due to \nthe limited data in patients with body weight <20kg, it is recommended to divide the total daily dose \ninto two daily administrations in this patient population.  \n \nMethod of administration  \nThe tablets may be taken with or without food. Tablets are not suitable for breaking to make up \nadditional strengths. \n \nFor patients who require additional strengths (i.e. between multiples of 10 mg or lower than 10 mg) \nother medicinal products with lower strengths are available. \n \nFor paediatric patients who have difficulties swallowing tablets, other pharmaceutical forms are \navailable.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nBreastfeeding (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMonitoring of plasma tyrosine levels \nIt is recommended that a slit-lamp examination of the eyes is performed before initiation of nitisinone \ntreatment. A patient displaying visual disorders during treatment with nitisinone should without delay \nbe examined by an ophthalmologist. It should be established that the patient is adhering to his/her \ndietary regimen and the plasma tyrosine concentration should be measured. A more restricted tyrosine \nand phenylalanine diet should be implemented in case the plasma tyrosine level is above 500 \nmicromol/l. It is not recommended to lower the plasma tyrosine concentration by reduction or \ndiscontinuation of nitisinone, since the metabolic defect may result in deterioration of the patient’s \nclinical condition. \n \nLiver monitoring \nThe liver function should be monitored regularly by liver function tests and liver imaging. It is \nrecommended to also monitor serum alpha-fetoprotein concentrations. Increase in serum \nalpha-fetoprotein concentration may be a sign of inadequate treatment. Patients with increasing \nalpha-fetoprotein or signs of nodules in the liver should always be evaluated for hepatic malignancy. \n \nPlatelet and white blood cell (WBC) monitoring \nIt is recommended that platelet and WBC counts are monitored regularly, as a few cases of reversible \nthrombocytopenia and leucopenia were observed during clinical evaluation. \n \nMonitoring visits should be performed every 6 months; shorter intervals between visits are \nrecommended in case of adverse events. \n \nLactose \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal interaction studies with other medicinal products have been conducted. \n \nNitisinone is metabolised in vitro by CYP 3A4 and dose-adjustment may therefore be needed when \nnitisinone is co-administered with inhibitors or inducers of this enzyme. \n \nBased on in vitro studies, nitisinone is not expected to inhibit CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 or 3A4-\nmediated metabolism. \n \nA food effect study has been conducted with Nityr. The study demonstrated that Nityr can be \nadministered with or without food without affecting its bioavailability.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of nitisinone in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Nityr should \nnot be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with \nnitisinone. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether nitisinone is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nadverse postnatal effects via exposure of nitisinone in milk. Therefore, mothers receiving nitisinone \nmust not breast-feed, since a risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded (see sections 4.3 and 5.3). \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on nitisinone affecting fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNityr has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions involving the \neyes (see section 4.8) can affect the vision. If the vision is affected the patient should not drive or use \nmachines until the event has subsided. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nBy its mode of action, nitisinone increases tyrosine levels in all nitisinone treated patients. Eye-related \nadverse reactions, such as conjunctivitis, corneal opacity, keratitis, photophobia, and eye pain, related \nto elevated tyrosine levels are therefore common. Other common adverse reactions include \nthrombocytopenia, leucopenia, and granulocytopenia. Exfoliative dermatitis may occur uncommonly. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe adverse reactions listed below by MedDRA system organ class and absolute frequency, are based \non data from a clinical trial and post-marketing use. Frequency is defined as very common (≥1/10), \ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare \n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nMedDRA system organ \nclass \n\nFrequency Adverse reaction \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nCommon Thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, \ngranulocytopenia \n\nUncommon Leukocytosis \nEye disorders Common Conjunctivitis, corneal opacity, \n\nkeratitis, photophobia, eye pain \nUncommon Blepharitis \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Exfoliative dermatitis, \nerythematous rash, pruritus \n\nInvestigations Very common Elevated tyrosine levels \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nNitisinone treatment leads to elevated tyrosine levels. Elevated levels of tyrosine have been associated \nwith eye-related adverse reactions, such as e.g. corneal opacities and hyperkeratotic lesions. \nRestriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine in the diet should limit the toxicity associated with this type \nof tyrosinemia by lowering tyrosine levels (see section 4.4). \nIn clinical studies, granulocytopenia was only uncommonly severe (<0.5x109/L) and not associated \nwith infections. Adverse reactions affecting the MedDRA system organ class ‘Blood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders’ subsided during continued nitisinone treatment. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety profile is mainly based on the paediatric population since nitisinone treatment should be \nstarted as soon as the diagnosis of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1) has been established. From \nclinical study and post marketing data there are no indications that the safety profile is different in \ndifferent subsets of the paediatric population or different from the safety profile in adult patients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAccidental ingestion of nitisinone by individuals eating normal diets not restricted in tyrosine and \nphenylalanine will result in elevated tyrosine levels. Elevated tyrosine levels have been associated \nwith toxicity to eyes, skin, and the nervous system. Restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine in the \ndiet should limit toxicity associated with this type of tyrosinemia. No information about specific \ntreatment of overdose is available. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, Various alimentary tract \nand metabolism products, ATC code: A16AX04. \n \nMechanism of action \nThe biochemical defect in hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1) is a deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate \nhydrolase, which is the final enzyme of the tyrosine catabolic pathway. Nitisinone is a competitive \ninhibitor of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, an enzyme which precedes fumarylacetoacetate \nhydrolase in the tyrosine catabolic pathway. By inhibiting the normal catabolism of tyrosine in \npatients with HT-1, nitisinone prevents the accumulation of the toxic intermediates maleylacetoacetate \nand fumarylacetoacetate. In patients with HT-1, these intermediates are converted to the toxic \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n\nmetabolites succinylacetone and succinylacetoacetate. Succinylacetone inhibits the porphyrin \nsynthesis pathway leading to the accumulation of 5-aminolevulinate. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nNitisinone treatment leads to normalised porphyrin metabolism with normal erythrocyte \nporphobilinogen synthase activity and urine 5-aminolevulinate, decreased urinary excretion of \nsuccinylacetone, increased plasma tyrosine concentration and increased urinary excretion of phenolic \nacids. Available data from a clinical study indicates that in more than 90% of the patients urine \nsuccinylacetone was normalised during the first week of treatment. Succinylacetone should not be \ndetectable in urine or plasma when the nitisinone dose is properly adjusted. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe clinical study was open-labelled and uncontrolled. The dosing frequency in the study was twice \ndaily. Survival probabilities after 2, 4 and 6 years of treatment with nitisinone are summarised in the \ntable below. \n \nNTBC study (N=250) \nAge at start of treatment 2 years 4 years 6 years \n≤ 2 months 93% 93% 93% \n≤ 6 months 93% 93% 93% \n> 6 months 96% 95% 95% \nOverall 94% 94% 94% \n\n \nData from a study used as a historical control (van Spronsen et al., 1994) showed the following \nsurvival probability. \n \n\nAge at onset of \nsymptoms 1 year 2 years \n\n< 2 months 38% 29% \n> 2-6 months 74% 74% \n> 6 months 96% 96% \n\n \nTreatment with nitisinone was also found to result in reduced risk for the development of \nhepatocellular carcinoma compared to historical data on treatment with dietary restriction alone. It was \nfound that the early initiation of treatment resulted in a further reduced risk for the development of \nhepatocellular carcinoma. \n \nThe 2-, 4-, and 6-year probability of no occurrence of HCC during nitisinone treatment for patients \naged 24 months or younger at the start of treatment and for those older than 24 months at the start of \ntreatment is shown in the following table: \n \nNTBC study (N=250) \n Numbers of patients at Probability of no HCC (95% confidence interval) at \n\nStart 2 years 4 years 6 years 2 years 4 years 6 years \nAll patients 250 155 86 15 98%   (95; 100) \n\n94%   \n(90; 98) \n\n91%   \n(81; 100) \n\nStart age ≤ 24 months 193 114 61 8 99%   (98; 100) \n99%   \n\n(97; 100) \n99%   \n\n(94; 100) \nStart age > 24 months 57 41 25 8 92%   (84; 100) \n\n82%   \n(70; 95) \n\n75%   \n(56; 95) \n\n \nIn an international survey of patients with HT-1 on treatment with dietary restriction alone, it was \nfound that HCC had been diagnosed in 18% of all patients aged 2 years and above. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nA study to evaluate the PK, efficacy and safety of once daily dosing compared to twice daily dosing \nwas performed in 19 patients with HT-1. There were no clinically important differences in AEs or \nother safety assessments between once and twice daily dosing. No patient had detectable \nsuccinylacetone (SA) levels at the end of the once-daily treatment period. The study indicates that \nonce daily administration is safe and efficacious across all ages of patients. Data is, however, limited \nin patients with body weight <20 kg. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFormal absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination studies have not been performed with \nnitisinone. In 23 healthy volunteers, after administration of a single dose of Nityr tablets (10 mg) the \nterminal half-life (median) of nitisinone in plasma was 59 hours (ranging from 41 to 74 hours).   \n \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis has been conducted on a group of 207 HT-1 patients. The \nclearance and half-life were determined to be 0.0956 l/kg body weight/day and 52.1 hours \nrespectively. \n \nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes and cDNA-expressed P450 enzymes have shown \nlimited CYP 3A4-mediated metabolism. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNitisinone has shown embryo-foetal toxicity in the mouse and rabbit at clinically relevant dose levels. \nIn the rabbit, nitisinone induced a dose-related increase in malformations (umbilical hernia and \ngastroschisis) from a dose level 2.5-fold higher than the maximum recommended human dose \n(2 mg/kg/day). \n \nA pre- and postnatal development study in the mouse showed statistically significantly reduced pup \nsurvival and pup growth during the weaning period at dose levels 125- and 25-fold higher, \nrespectively, then the maximum recommended human dose, with a trend toward a negative effect on \npup survival starting from the dose of 5 mg/kg/day. In rats, exposure via milk resulted in reduced \nmean pup weight and corneal lesions. \n \nNo mutagenic but a weak clastogenic activity was observed in in vitro studies. There was no evidence \nof in vivo genotoxicity (mouse micronucleus assay and mouse liver unscheduled DNA synthesis \nassay). Nitisinone did not show carcinogenic potential in a 26-week carcinogenicity study in \ntransgenic mice (TgrasH2). \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n17 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nNityr 10 mg tablets \nnitisinone \n\n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even \n\nif their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Nityr is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you take Nityr  \n3. How to take Nityr \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Nityr \n6. Contents of the pack and other information  \n \n \n1. What Nityr is and what it is used for \n \nThe active ingredient of Nityr is nitisinone. This medicine is used for treatment of a rare disease called \nhereditary tyrosinemia type 1 in adults, adolescents and children.  \n \nIn this disease your body is unable to completely break down the amino acid tyrosine (amino acids are \nbuilding blocks of our proteins), forming harmful substances. These substances are accumulated in \nyour body. Nityr blocks the breakdown of tyrosine and the harmful substances are not formed.  \n \nYou must follow a special diet while you are taking this medicine, because tyrosine will remain in \nyour body. This special diet is based on low tyrosine and phenylalanine (another amino acid) content.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Nityr \n \nDo not take Nityr: \n- if you are allergic to nitisinone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). \n-  Do not breast-feed while taking this medicine, see section “Pregnancy and breast-feeding”. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Nityr.  \n \n- if you get red eyes or any other signs of effects on the eyes. Contact your doctor immediately for \n\nan eye examination. Eye problems could be a sign of inadequate dietary control (see section 4).  \n\n\n\n18 \n\nDuring the treatment, blood samples will be drawn in order for your doctor to check whether the \ntreatment is adequate and to make sure that there are no possible side effects causing blood disorders. \nYour liver will be checked at regular intervals because the disease affects the liver.  \n \nFollow-up by your doctor should be performed every 6 months. If you experience any side effects, \nshorter intervals are recommended.  \n \nOther medicines and Nityr  \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  \n \nNityr with food  \nNityr can be taken with or without food throughout your course of treatment.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nThe safety of this medicine has not been studied in pregnant and breast-feeding women.  \nPlease contact your doctor if you plan to become pregnant. If you become pregnant you should contact \nyour doctor immediately.  \nDo not breast-feed while taking this medicine, see section “Do not take Nityr”.  \n \nDriving and using machines  \nThis medicine has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, if you \nexperience side effects affecting your vision you should not drive or use machines until your vision is \nback to normal (see section 4 “Possible side effects”).  \n \nNityr contains lactose  \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Nityr \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  \n \nTreatment with this medicine should be started and supervised by a doctor experienced in the \ntreatment of the disease (hereditary tyrosinemia type 1).  \n \nThe recommended total daily dose is 1 mg/kg body administered orally weight. Your doctor will \nadjust the dose individually.  \nIt is recommended to administer the dose once daily. However, due to the limited data in patients with \nbody weight <20 kg, it is recommended to divide the total daily dose into two daily administrations in \nthis patient population. \n \nPatients who have problems swallowing Nityr tablets whole, are recommended to take alternative \nnitisinone formulations.   \n\n \nIf you take more Nityr than you should  \nIf you have taken more of this medicine than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist as soon as \npossible.  \n \nIf you forget to take Nityr \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you forget to take a dose, contact your \ndoctor or pharmacist.  \n \nIf you stop taking Nityr  \n\n\n\n19 \n\nIf you have the impression that the medicine is not working properly, talk to your doctor. Do not \nchange the dose or stop the treatment without talking to your doctor.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIf you notice any side effects relating to the eyes, talk to your doctor immediately to have an eye \nexamination. Treatment with nitisinone leads to higher levels of tyrosine in the blood which can cause \neye related symptoms. Common eye related side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) are \ninflammation in the eye (conjunctivitis), opacity and inflammation in the cornea (keratitis), sensitivity \nto light (photophobia) and eye pain. Inflammation of the eyelid (blepharitis) is an uncommon side \neffect (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). \n \nOther common side effects  \n- Reduced number of platelets (thrombocytopenia) and white blood cells (leukopenia), shortage of \n\ncertain white blood cells (granulocytopenia).  \n \nOther uncommon side effects  \n- increased number of white blood cells (leucocytosis),  \n- itching (pruritus), skin inflammation (exfoliative dermatitis), rash.  \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Nityr \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the bottle and the carton after “EXP”.  \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month.  \n \nThis medicine does not require any special temperature storage conditions.  \nStore in the original bottle to protect from light.  \nOnce the bottle is opened, the medicine can be stored for a period of 2 months, after which it must be \ndiscarded. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help to protect the environment.  \n \n \n6.
