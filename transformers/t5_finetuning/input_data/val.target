lemtrada contains the active substance alemtuzumab , which is used to treat a form of multiple sclerosis ( ms ) in adults , called relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis ( rrms ). lemtrada does not cure ms , but it can reduce the number of ms relapses . it can also help to slow down or reverse some of the signs and symptoms of ms . in clinical studies , patients treated with lemtrada had fewer relapses and were less likely to experience worsening of their disability compared to patients treated with a beta - interferon injected multiple times per week . lemtrada is used if your ms is highly active despite that you have been treated with at least one other medicine for ms or if your ms is rapidly evolving . what is multiple sclerosis ? ms is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord ). in ms your immune system mistakenly attacks the protective layer ( myelin ) around the nerve fibres , causing inflammation . when the inflammation causes symptoms this is often called an " attack " or a " relapse ". in rrms patients experience relapses followed by periods of recovery . the symptoms you experience are determined by which part of your central nervous system is affected . the damage done to your nerves during this inflammation may be reversible , but as your disease progresses the damage may accumulate and become permanent . how lemtrada works lemtrada adjusts your immune system to limit its attacks on your nervous system .
do not use lemtrada : if you are allergic to alemtuzumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine ( listed in section 6 ). if you are infected with human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ). if you are suffering from a serious infection if you have any of the following conditions : o other autoimmune disease besides multiple sclerosis o uncontrolled high blood pressure o history of tears in blood vessels supplying the brain o history of stroke o history of heart attack or chest pain o history of bleeding disorder warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before lemtrada is given . after having a course of treatment with lemtrada you may be at greater risk of developing other autoimmune conditions , or experiencing serious infections . it is important you understand these risks and how to monitor for them . you will be given a patient alert card and a patient guide with further information . it is important that you keep the patient alert card with you during treatment and for 4 years after your last infusion with lemtrada , because side effects may occur many years after treatment . when you have medical treatment , even if it is not for your ms , show the patient alert card to the doctor . your doctor will perform blood tests before you start treatment with lemtrada . these tests are done to see whether you may take lemtrada . your doctor will also want to make sure that you do not have certain medical conditions or disorders before you start your treatment with lemtrada . autoimmune conditions treatment with lemtrada may increase the risk for autoimmune conditions . these are conditions in which your immune system mistakenly attacks your body . information about some specific conditions that have been seen in ms patients who have been treated with lemtrada is provided below . the autoimmune conditions can occur many years after treatment with lemtrada . therefore , regular blood and urine tests are needed until 4 years after your last infusion . testing is needed even if you are feeling well and your ms symptoms are under control . there are certain signs and symptoms that you should look out for yourself . in addition , these conditions may occur beyond 4 years , therefore , you must continue to look for signs and symptoms , even after you no longer need to do monthly blood and urine tests . details about the signs and symptoms , testing , and actions you need to take are described in sections 2 and 4 autoimmune conditions . more helpful information about these autoimmune conditions ( and the testing for them ) can be found in the lemtrada patient guide . o acquired haemophilia a uncommonly , patients developed a bleeding disorder caused by antibodies that work against factor viii ( a protein needed for normal clotting of blood ), called acquired hemophilia a . this condition must be diagnosed and treated immediately . symptoms of acquired hemophilia a are described in section 4 . o immune thrombocytopenic purpura ( itp ) commonly , patients have developed a bleeding disorder caused by a low level of blood platelets , called immune thrombocytopenic purpura ( itp ). this must be diagnosed and treated early , as otherwise the effects can be serious or even fatal . signs and symptoms of itp are described in section 4 . o kidney disease ( such as anti - gbm disease ) rarely , patients have experienced autoimmune related problems with their kidneys , such as anti - glomerular basement membrane disease ( anti - gbm disease ). signs and symptoms of kidney disease are described in section 4 . if untreated it can cause kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplantation , and may lead to death . o thyroid disorders very commonly , patients have experienced an autoimmune disorder of the thyroid gland affecting its ability to make or control hormones that are important for your metabolism . lemtrada may cause different types of thyroid disorders , including : over - active thyroid gland ( hyperthyroidism ) when the thyroid produces too much hormone under - active thyroid gland ( hypothyroidism ) when the thyroid does not produce enough hormone . signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders are described in section 4 . if you develop a thyroid disorder , in most cases you will need to be treated for the rest of your life with medicines to control your thyroid disorder , and in some cases your thyroid gland may have to be removed . it is very important that you are properly treated for a thyroid disorder , especially if you become pregnant after using lemtrada . having an untreated thyroid disorder could harm your unborn baby , or harm your baby after birth . o liver inflammation some patients have developed liver inflammation after receiving lemtrada . liver inflammation can be diagnosed from the blood tests that you will be having regularly after lemtrada treatment . if you develop one or more of the following symptoms report this to your doctor : nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , fatigue , loss of appetite , yellow skin or eyes , dark urine , or bleeding or bruising more easily than normal . o other autoimmune conditions uncommonly , patients have experienced autoimmune conditions involving red blood cells or white blood cells . these can be diagnosed from the blood tests that you will be having regularly after lemtrada treatment . if you develop one of these conditions your doctor will tell you , and take appropriate measures to treat it . infusion reactions most patients treated with lemtrada will experience side - effects at the time of the infusion or within 24 hours after the infusion . to try to reduce infusion reactions , your doctor will give you other medicine ( s ) ( see section 4 infusion reactions ). other serious reactions occurring shortly after lemtrada infusion some patients have had serious or life - threatening reactions after lemtrada infusion , including bleeding in the lung , heart attack , stroke or tears in blood vessels supplying the brain . reactions may occur following any of the doses during the treatment course . in the majority of cases reactions occurred within 1 - 3 days of the infusion . your doctor will monitor vital signs , including blood pressure , before and during the infusion . get help right away if you have any of the following symptoms : trouble breathing , coughing up blood , chest pain , facial drooping , sudden severe headache , weakness on one side of the body , difficulty with speech or neck pain . haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis treatment with lemtrada may increase the risk of excessive activation of white blood cells associated with inflammation ( haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ), which can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated early . if you experience multiple symptoms such as fever , swollen glands , bruising , or skin rash , contact your doctor immediately . infections patients treated with lemtrada are at a higher risk of getting a serious infection ( see section 4 infections ). in general , the infections can be treated with standard medicines . in order to reduce the chance of getting an infection , your doctor will check if other medicines you are taking might be affecting your immune system . therefore , it is important to tell your doctor about all medicines you are taking . also , tell your doctor if you are suffering from a serious infection before the start of your lemtrada treatment as your doctor should delay the treatment until the infection is resolved . patients treated with lemtrada are at a higher risk of developing herpes infection ( e . g . a cold sore ). in general , once a patient has had a herpes infection , they have an increased risk of developing another one . it is also possible to develop a herpes infection for the first time . it is recommended that your doctor prescribes a medicine to reduce the chance of developing a herpes infection , which should be taken on the days that you receive lemtrada treatment , and for one month following the treatment . in addition , infections which can result in abnormalities of the cervix ( the neck of the womb ) are possible . therefore , it is recommended that all female patients have an annual screening performed , such as a cervical smear . your doctor will explain to you what tests you will need . infections with a virus called cytomegalovirus have been reported in patients treated with lemtrada . most cases occurred within two months of alemtuzumab dosing . tell your doctor right away if you have symptoms of infection such as fever , or swollen glands . patients treated with lemtrada have had infections due to a virus called epstein - barr virus ( ebv ), including cases with severe liver inflammation . tell your doctor right away if you have symptoms of infection such as fever , swollen glands , or fatigue . patients treated with lemtrada are also at a higher risk of developing listeria infection ( a bacterial infection caused by ingestion of contaminated foods ). listeria infection can cause serious illness , including meningitis , but can be treated with appropriate medicines . to reduce this risk , you should avoid eating uncooked or undercooked meats , soft cheeses and unpasteurized dairy products two weeks before treatment , during the treatment and for at least one month after lemtrada treatment . if you live in a region where tuberculosis infections are common , you may be at greater risk of infection with tuberculosis . screening for tuberculosis will be arranged by your doctor . if you are a carrier of hepatitis b or hepatitis c infection ( these affect the liver ), extra caution is needed before you receive lemtrada treatment as it is unknown if treatment could lead to activation of the hepatitis infection which could subsequently damage your liver . there have been cases of a rare brain infection called pml ( progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ) in patients who have been given lemtrada . pml has been reported in patients with other risk factors , specifically prior treatment with ms products associated with pml . pml may lead to severe disability over weeks or months and may be fatal . symptoms may be similar to a relapse of ms and include progressive weakness or clumsiness of limbs , disturbance of vision , speech difficulties or changes in thinking , memory , and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes . it is important to inform your relatives or caregivers about your treatment , since they may notice symptoms that you are not aware of . contact your doctor immediately if you develop any symptoms suggestive of pml . pneumonitis and pericarditis 40 pneumonitis ( inflammation of lung tissue ) has been reported in lemtrada treated patients . most cases occurred within the first month after treatment with lemtrada . cases of pericardial effusion ( collection of fluid around the heart ) and pericarditis ( inflammation of the lining around the heart ) have also been reported in patients treated with lemtrada . you should report to your doctor symptoms like shortness of breath , cough , wheezing , chest pain or tightness and coughing up blood , as these could be caused by pneumonitis , pericardial effusion or pericarditis . inflammation of the gallbladder lemtrada may increase your chance of getting inflammation of the gallbladder . this may be a serious medical condition that can be life threatening . you should report to your doctor if you have symptoms such as stomach pain or discomfort , fever , nausea or vomiting . previously diagnosed cancer if you have been diagnosed with cancer in the past , please inform your doctor about it . vaccines it is not known if lemtrada affects your response to a vaccine . if you have not completed the standard required vaccinations , your doctor will consider whether you should have them before your lemtrada treatment . in particular , your doctor will consider vaccinating you against chickenpox if you have never had it . any vaccination will need to be given to you at least 6 weeks before starting a lemtrada treatment course . you must not receive certain types of vaccines ( live viral vaccines ) if you have recently received lemtrada . children and adolescents lemtrada is not intended to be used in children and adolescents below 18 years old as it has not been studied in ms patients below 18 years old . other medicines and lemtrada tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking , have recently taken , or might take any other medicines ( including any vaccinations or herbal medecines ). besides lemtrada , there are other treatments ( including those for ms , or to treat other conditions ) which could affect your immune system and so could affect your ability to fight infections . if you are using such a medicine , your doctor may ask you to stop this medicine before starting treatment with lemtrada . pregnancy if you are pregnant , think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby , ask your doctor for advice before being given this medicine . women who are able to conceive have to use effective contraception during each treatment course with lemtrada and for 4 months after each course of treatment . if you become pregnant after treatment with lemtrada and experience a thyroid dirorder during pregnancy , extra caution is needed . thyroid disorders could be harmful to the baby ( see section 2 warnings and precautions autoimmune conditions ). breast - feeding it is unknown if lemtrada can be transferred to a baby through breast milk , but there is a possibility that it could be . it is recommended that you do not breast - feed during each course of treatment with lemtrada and for 4 months after each treatment course . however , there may be benefits of breast milk ( which can help protect a baby from infections ), so talk to your doctor if you are planning to breast -

you and your partner ' s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor experienced in treating fertility problems . do not use pergoveris if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone ( fsh ), luteinising hormone ( lh ) or any of the other ingredients of this medicine ( listed in section 6 ) 62 if you have a brain tumour ( in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland ) if you have large ovaries or sacs of fluid within your ovaries ( ovarian cysts ) of unknown origin if you have unexplained vaginal bleeding if you have cancer in your ovaries , womb or breasts if you have a condition that would make a normal pregnancy impossible , such as an early menopause , malformed sex organs or benign tumours of the womb . do not use this medicine if any of the above apply to you . if you are not sure , talk to your doctor , pharmacist or nurse before using this medicine . warnings and precautions talk to your doctor , pharmacist or nurse before using pergoveris . porphyria talk to your doctor before you start your treatment . if you or any member of your family have porphyria ( an inability to breakdown porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children ). tell your doctor straight away if : your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered , especially skin that has been frequently exposed to sunlight you have stomach , arm or leg pain . in case of above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment . ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss ) this medicine stimulates your ovaries . this increases your risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss ). this is when your follicles develop too much and become large cysts . if you get lower abdominal pain , gain any weight rapidly , feel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing , talk to your doctor straight away . they might ask you to stop using this medicine ( see in section 4 . under " most serious side effects "). in case you are not ovulating and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to , the occurrence of severe ohss is less likely . pergoveris treatment seldom causes severe ohss . this becomes more likely if the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation ( containing human chorionic gonadotrophin , hcg ) is administered ( see in section 3 . under " how much to use " for details ). if you are developing ohss your doctor may not give you any hcg in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or that you should use a barrier contraceptive method for at least four days . your doctor will ensure , careful monitoring of the ovarian response , based on ultrasound and blood tests ( oestradiol measurements ) before and during the course of treatment . multiple pregnancy when using pergoveris , you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same time (" multiple pregnancy ", mostly twins ), than if you conceived naturally . multiple pregnancy may lead to medical complications for you and your babies . you can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy by using the right dose of pergoveris at the right times . to minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy , ultrasound scans as well as blood tests are recommended . miscarriage when undergoing stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs , you are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman . ectopic pregnancy women who have ever had blocked or damaged fallopian tubes ( tubal disease ) are at risk of pregnancy where the embryo is implanted outside the womb ( ectopic pregnancy ). this is whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments . blood clotting problems ( thromboembolic events ) talk to your doctor before using pergoveris if you or a member of your family have ever had blood clots in the leg or in the lung , or a heart attack or stroke . you may be at a higher risk of serious blood clots or existing clots might become worse with pergoveris treatment . tumours of sex organs there have been reports of tumours in the ovaries and other sex organs , both benign and malignant , in women who have undergone multiple regimens for infertility treatment . allergic reactions there have been isolated reports of non - serious allergic reactions to pergoveris . if you have ever had this type of reaction to a similar medicine , talk to your doctor before using pergoveris . children and adolescents pergoveris is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old . other medicines and pergoveris tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using , have recently used or might use any other medicines . do not use pergoveris with other medicines in the same injection , except for follitropin alfa , if prescribed by your doctor . pregnancy and breast - feeding do not use pergoveris if you are pregnant or breast - feeding . driving and using machines it is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive or use machines . pergoveris contains sodium pergoveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i . e . essentially " sodium - free ".
always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you . check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure . using this medicine pergoveris is intended to be given by injection just under the skin ( subcutaneously ). to minimise skin irritation , select a different injection site each day . it comes as a powder and liquid , which you need to mix together and then use straight away . your doctor or nurse will show you how to prepare and inject this medicine . they will supervise your first injection . if they are satisfied that you can administer pergoveris safely , you can then prepare and inject the medicine yourself at home . when you do this , please carefully read and follow the instructions hereafter called " how to prepare and use the pergoveris powder and solvent ". how much to use the usual starting dose is one vial of pergoveris every day . according to your response , your doctor may decide to add every day a dose of a licensed follitropin alfa preparation to your pergoveris injection . in this case , the follitropin alfa dose is usually increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37 . 5 to 75 iu . treatment is continued until you get the desired response . this is when you have developed a suitable follicle , as assessed using ultrasound scans and blood tests . this may take up to 5 weeks . when you get the desired response , you will be given a single injection of human chorionic gonadotropin ( hcg ) 24 to 48 hours after your last pergoveris injection . the best time to have sex is on the day of the hcg injection and the day after . alternatively , intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed . if your body responds too strongly , your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hcg ( see in section 2 . under " ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss )"). in this case , your doctor will give you a lower follitropin alfa dose in the following cycle . how to prepare and use the pergoveris powder and solvent before starting the preparation , please read these instructions the whole way through first : give yourself the injection at the same time each day . 1 . wash your hands and find a clean area it is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible a good place is a clean table or kitchen surface 2 . get together everything you need and lay them out 1 vial containing pergoveris powder 1 vial containing water for injections ( solvent ) not provided in the pack : 2 alcohol swabs 1 empty syringe for injection 1 needle for preparation 1 fine bore needle for injection under the skin one sharps container for safe disposal of glass and needles 3 . preparing the solution remove the protective cap from the vial filled with water ( solvent vial ). attach the needle for preparation to the empty syringe for injection . draw up some air into the syringe by pulling the plunger to approximately the 1 ml mark . insert the needle into the vial , push the plunger to expel the air . turn the vial upside down and gently draw up all the water ( solvent ). remove the syringe from the vial and set it down carefully . do not touch the needle and do not allow the needle to touch any surface . remove the protective cap from the vial filled with pergoveris powder . pick up your syringe and slowly inject the contents of the syringe into the vial of powder . swirl gently without removing the syringe . do not shake . after the powder has dissolved ( which usually occurs immediately ), check that the resulting solution is clear and does not contain any particles . turn the vial upside down , gently draw the solution back into the syringe . check for particles as before , and do not use if the solution is not clear . 4 . getting the syringe ready for injection change the needle for the fine bore needle . remove any air bubbles : if you see air bubbles in the syringe , hold the syringe with the needle pointing upwards and gently flick the syringe until all the air collects at the top . push the plunger until the air bubbles are gone . 5 . injecting the dose immediately inject the solution . your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to inject ( e . g . tummy , front of thigh ). to minimise skin irritation , select a different injection site each day . clean the chosen skin area with an alcohol swab using a circular motion . firmly pinch the skin together and insert the needle at a 45 ° to 90 angle using a dart - like motion . inject under the skin , as you were taught . do not inject directly into a vein . inject the solution by pushing gently on the plunger . take as much time as you need to inject all the solution . then withdraw the needle and clean the skin with a new alcohol swab using a circular motion . 6 . after the injection dispose of all used items . once you have finished your injection , immediately discard all needles and empty vials in your sharps container . any unused solution must be discarded . if you use more pergoveris than you should the effects of an overdose of pergoveris are unknown , nevertheless one could expect ohss to occur . however this will only occur if hcg is administered ( see in section 2 . under " ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss )"). if you forget to use pergoveris do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose . please contact your doctor . if you have any further question on the use of this medicine , ask your doctor , pharmacist or nurse .
like all medicines , this medicine can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them . most serious side effects contact your doctor straight away if you notice any of the below listed side effects . the doctor might ask you to stop using pergoveris . allergic reactions allergic reactions such as rash , red skin , hives , swelling of your face with difficulty breathing can sometimes be serious . this side effect is very rare . ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss ) lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting . these may be the symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss ). your ovaries may have over - reacted to the treatment and formed large sacs of fluid or cysts ( see in section 2 . under " ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss )"). this side effect is common . if this happens , your doctor will need to examine you as soon as possible . the ohss may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries , decreased urine production , weight gain , difficulty in breathing and / or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest . this side effect is uncommon ( may affect up to 1 in 100 people ). complications of ohss such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting occur rarely ( may affect up to 1 in 1 , 000 people ). serious blood clotting problems ( thromboembolic events ) usually with severe ohss are found very rarely . this could cause chest pain , breathlessness , stroke or heart attack . in rare cases this can also happen independently of ohss ( see in section 2 . under " blood clotting problems ( thromboembolic events )"). other side effects very common ( may affect more than 1 in 10 people ): sacs of fluid within the ovaries ( ovarian cysts ) headache local reactions at the injection site such as pain , itching , bruising , swelling or irritation . common ( may affect up to 1 in 10 people ): diarrhoea breast pain feeling sick or vomiting abdominal or pelvic pain abdominal cramp or bloating . very rare ( may affect up to 1 in 10 , 000 people ): your asthma may get worse . reporting of side effects if you get any side effects , talk to your doctor , pharmacist or nurse . this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet . you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v . by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine .
what pergoveris contains the active substances are follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa . one vial contains 150 iu ( equivalent to 11 micrograms ) of follitropin alfa and 75 iu ( equivalent to 3 micrograms ) of lutropin alfa . after reconstitution , each ml of the solution contains 150 iu follitropin alfa and 75 iu lutropin alfa per milliliter . the other ingredients are sucrose , disodium phosphate dihydrate , sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate , methionine , polysorbate 20 , as well as concentrated phosphoric acid and sodium hydroxide for ph - adjustment . what pergoveris looks like and contents of the pack pergoveris is presented as a powder and solvent for solution for injection . the powder is a white to off - white lyophilised pellet in a glass vial with a bromobutyl rubber stopper containing 150 iu ( equivalent to 11 micrograms ) of follitropin alfa and 75 iu ( equivalent to 3 micrograms ) of lutropin alfa . the solvent is a clear colourless liquid in a glass vial containing1 ml of water for injections . pergoveris is supplied in packs of 1 , 3 and 10 vials of powder with the corresponding number of solvent ' s vials ( 1 , 3 and 10 vials ). not all pack sizes may be marketed .
puregon solution for injection contains follitropin beta , a hormone known as follicle - stimulating hormone ( fsh ). fsh belongs to the group of gonadotrophins , which play an important role in human fertility and reproduction . in women , fsh is needed for the growth and development of follicles in the ovaries . follicles are small round sacs that contain the egg cells . in men , fsh is needed for the production of sperm . puregon is used to treat infertility in any of the following situations : women in women who do not ovulate and do not respond to treatment with clomifene citrate , puregon can be used to cause ovulation . in women undergoing assisted reproduction techniques , including in vitro fertilisation ( ivf ) and other methods , puregon can bring about the development of multiple follicles . men in men who are infertile due to lowered hormone levels , puregon can be used for the production of sperm .
do not use puregon if you : are allergic to follitropin beta or any of the other ingredients of puregon ( listed in section 6 ) have a tumour of the ovary , breast , uterus , testis or brain ( pituitary gland or hypothalamus ) have heavy or irregular vaginal bleeding where the cause is unknown have ovaries that do not work because of a condition called primary ovarian failure have ovarian cysts or enlarged ovaries not caused by polycystic ovarian syndrome ( pcos ) have malformations of the sexual organs which make a normal pregnancy impossible have fibroid tumours in the uterus which make a normal pregnancy impossible are a man and are infertile because of a condition called primary testicular failure . warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before using puregon if you : have had an allergic reaction to certain antibiotics ( neomycin and / or streptomycin ) have uncontrolled pituitary gland or hypothalamic problems have an underactive thyroid gland ( hypothyroidism ) have adrenal glands that are not working properly ( adrenocortical insufficiency ) have high prolactin levels in the blood ( hyperprolactinemia ) have any other medical conditions ( for example , diabetes , heart disease , or any other long - term disease ). if you are a woman : ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss ) your doctor will check the effects of the treatment regularly to be able to choose the correct dose of puregon from day to day . you may regularly have ultrasound scans of the ovaries . your doctor may also check blood hormone levels . this is very important since too high a dose of fsh may lead to rare but serious complications in which the ovaries are overly stimulated and the growing follicles become larger than normal . this serious medical condition is called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss ). in rare cases , severe ohss may be life - threatening . ohss causes fluid to build - up suddenly in your stomach and chest areas and can cause blood clots to form . call your doctor right away if you notice severe abdominal swelling , pain in the stomach area ( abdomen ), feeling sick ( nausea ), vomiting , sudden weight gain due to fluid build - up , diarrhoea , decreased urine output or trouble breathing ( see also section 4 on possible side effects ). regular monitoring of the response to fsh - treatment helps to prevent ovarian overstimulation . contact your doctor immediately if you are experiencing stomach pains , also if this occurs some days after the last injection has been given . multiple pregnancy or birth defects after treatment with gonadotrophin preparations , there is an increased chance of having multiple pregnancies , even when only one embryo is transferred into the uterus . multiple pregnancies carry an increased health risk for both the mother and her babies around the time of birth . furthermore , multiple pregnancies and characteristics of the patients undergoing fertility treatment ( e . g . age of the female , sperm characteristics , genetic background of both parents ) may be associated with an increased risk of birth defects . pregnancy complications there is a slightly increased risk of a pregnancy outside the uterus ( an ectopic pregnancy ). therefore , your doctor should perform an early ultrasound examination to exclude the possibility of pregnancy outside the uterus . in women undergoing fertility treatment there may be a slightly higher chance of a miscarriage . blood clot ( thrombosis ) treatment with puregon , just as pregnancy itself , may increase the risk of having a blood clot ( thrombosis ). thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot in a blood vessel . blood clots can lead to serious medical conditions , such as : blockage in your lungs ( pulmonary embolus ) stroke heart attack blood vessel problems ( thrombophlebitis ) a lack of blood flow ( deep venous thrombosis ) that may result in a loss of your arm or leg . please discuss this with your doctor , before starting treatment , especially : if you already know you have an increased chance of having thrombosis if you , or anyone in your immediate family , have ever had a thrombosis if you are severely overweight . ovarian torsion ovarian torsion has occurred after treatment with gonadotropins including puregon . ovarian torsion is the twisting of an ovary . twisting of the ovary could cause the blood flow to the ovary to be cut off . before starting to use this medicine , tell your doctor if you : have ever had ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ohss are pregnant or think that you may be pregnant have ever had stomach ( abdominal ) surgery have ever had a twisting of an ovary have past or current cysts in your ovary or ovaries . ovarian and other reproductive system tumours there have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system tumours in women who have had infertility treatment . it is not known if treatment with fertility medicines increases the risk of these tumours in infertile women . other medical conditions in addition , before starting to use this medicine , tell your doctor if you : have been told by a doctor that pregnancy would be dangerous for you . if you are a man : men with too much fsh in their blood increased fsh blood levels are a sign of damage to the testicles . puregon is usually not effective in such cases . to check the effects of treatment , your doctor may ask you for a semen sample to be analysed , four to six months after the start of treatment . children and adolescents there is no relevant use of puregon in children and adolescents . other medicines and puregon tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking , have recently taken or might take any other medicines . if puregon is used in a combination with clomifene citrate , the effect of puregon may be increased . if a gnrh agonist ( a medicine used to prevent early ovulation ) has been given , higher doses of puregon may be needed . pregnancy and breast - feeding ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine . you should not use puregon if you are already pregnant , or think you might be pregnant . puregon may affect milk production . it is unlikely that puregon is passed into breast milk . if you are breast - feeding , tell your doctor before using puregon . driving and using machines puregon is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines . puregon contains sodium this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per injection , that is to say essentially ' sodium - free '.
always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you . check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure . dosage in women your doctor will decide on your starting dose . this dose may be adjusted during your treatment period . further details on the treatment schedule are given below . there are large differences between women in the response of the ovaries to fsh , which makes it impossible to set a dosage schedule which is suitable for all patients . to find the right dosage , your doctor will check your follicle growth by means of ultrasound scanning , and measurement of the amount of oestradiol ( female sex hormone ) in the blood . * women who are not ovulating a starting dose is set by your doctor . this dose is continued for at least seven days . if there is no ovarian response , the daily dose will then be gradually increased until follicle growth and / or plasma oestradiol levels indicate a proper response . the daily dose is then maintained until a follicle of proper size is present . usually , 7 to 14 days of treatment are sufficient . puregon treatment is then stopped and ovulation will be induced by giving human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ). * medically assisted reproduction programs , for instance ivf a starting dose is set by your doctor . this dose is continued for at least the first four days . after this , your dose may be adjusted , based upon your ovarian response . when a sufficient number of follicles of proper size are present , the final phase of maturation of the follicles is induced by giving hcg . retrieval of the egg ( s ) is performed 34 - 35 hours later . dosage in men puregon is usually prescribed at a dose of 450 iu per week , mostly in 3 dosages of 150 iu , in combination with another hormone ( hcg ), for at least 3 to 4 months . the treatment period equals the development time of sperm and the time in which improvement can be expected . if your sperm production has not started after this period , your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months . how are the injections given the very first injection of puregon should only be given in the presence of a doctor or nurse . injections may be given slowly into a muscle ( for instance in the buttock , upper leg or upper arm ) or under the skin ( in the lower stomach , for example ). when given into a muscle the injection should be given by the doctor or nurse . when given under the skin the injection may , in some cases , be given by yourself or your partner . your doctor will tell you when and how to do this . if you inject yourself with puregon , follow the instructions for use in the next section , to give puregon properly and with minimal discomfort . instructions for use step 1 - preparing the syringe you should use sterile disposable syringes and needles for the administration of puregon . the volume of the syringe should be small enough so that the prescribed dose can be given with reasonable accuracy . puregon solution for injection comes in a glass vial . do not use the solution if it contains particles or is not clear . first , you should remove the flip - off cap of the vial . place a needle on a syringe and pierce the needle through the rubber stopper of the vial ( a ). draw the solution up into the syringe ( b ), and replace the needle with an injection needle ( c ). finally hold the syringe with the needle pointing upwards and gently tap the side to force any air bubbles up to the top ; then squeeze the plunger until all the air has been expelled , and only puregon solution is left in the syringe ( d ). if necessary , the plunger may be squeezed further , to adjust the volume to be administered . step 2 - the injection site the best site for an injection under the skin is in the lower stomach around the navel ( e ) where there is a lot of loose skin and layers of fatty tissue . you should vary the injection site a little with each injection . it is possible to inject in other areas . your doctor or nurse will tell you where to inject . step 3 - preparing the area a few taps at the injection site will stimulate tiny nerve endings and help reduce discomfort when the needle goes in . wash your hands and swab the injection site with disinfectant ( for example chlorohexidine 0 . 5 %) to remove any surface bacteria . clean about two inches around the point where the needle will go in and let the disinfectant dry for at least one minute before you proceed . step 4 - inserting the needle pinch the skin a little . with the other hand , insert the needle at an angle of 90 degrees into the skin ' s surface , as shown in the picture ( f ). step 5 - checking the correct needle position if the needle position is correct the plunger should be quite difficult to draw back . any blood sucked back into the syringe means that the needle tip has penetrated a vein or artery . if this happens pull out the syringe , cover the injection site with a swab containing disinfectant and apply pressure ; the site 74 will stop bleeding in a minute or two . do not use this solution . start again with step 1 using a new syringe , new needles and a new vial of puregon . step 6 - injecting the solution depress the plunger slowly and steadily , so the solution is correctly injected and the skin tissues are not damaged . step 7 - removing the syringe pull the syringe out quickly and apply pressure to the injection site with a swab containing disinfectant . a gentle massage of the site - while still maintaining pressure - helps disperse the puregon solution and relieve any discomfort . any remaining solution should be discarded . do not mix puregon with any other medicines . if you use more puregon than you should tell your doctor immediately . too high a dose of puregon may cause hyperstimulation of the ovaries ( ohss ). this may be noticed as pain in the stomach . if you are troubled by stomach pains , tell your doctor immediately . see also section 4 on possible side effects . if you forget to use puregon if you forget a dose do not use a double dose to make up for a missed dose . contact your doctor . if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine , ask your doctor .
like all medicines , this medicine can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them . serious side effects in women a complication with fsh treatment is hyperstimulation of the ovaries . ovarian overstimulation may develop into a medical condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss ), which can be a serious medical problem . the risk can be reduced by careful monitoring of follicular development during treatment . your doctor will do ultrasound scans of your ovaries to carefully monitor the number of maturing follicles . your doctor may also check blood hormone levels . pain in the stomach , feeling sick or diarrhoea are the first symptoms . in more severe cases symptoms may include enlargement of the ovaries , accumulation of fluid in the abdomen and / or chest ( which may cause sudden weight gain due to fluid buildup ) and the occurrence of blood clots in the circulation . see warnings and precautions in section 2 . contact your doctor immediately if you are experiencing stomach pains , or any of the other symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation , also if this occurs some days after the last injection . if you are a woman : common side effects ( may affect up to 1 in 10 people ): - headache - injection site reactions ( such as bruising , pain , redness , swelling and itching ) - ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss ) - pelvic pain - stomach pain and / or bloating uncommon side effects ( may affect up to 1 in 100 people ): - breast complaints ( including tenderness ) 75 - diarrhoea , constipation or stomach discomfort - enlargement of the uterus - feeling sick - hypersensitivity reactions ( such as rash , redness , hives and itching ) - ovarian cysts or enlargement of the ovaries - ovarian torsion ( twisting of the ovaries ) - vaginal bleeding rare side effects ( may affect up to 1 in 1 , 000 people ): - blood clots ( this may also occur in the absence of unwanted overstimulation of the ovaries , see warnings and precautions in section 2 ) pregnancy outside the uterus ( an ectopic pregnancy ), miscarriage and multiple pregnancies have also been reported . these side effects are not considered to be related to the use of puregon , but to assisted reproductive technology ( art ) or subsequent pregnancy . if you are a man : common side effects ( may affect up to 1 in 10 people ): - acne - injection site reactions ( such as hardening and pain ) - headache - rash - some breast development - testicular cyst reporting of side effects if you get any side effects , talk to your doctor or pharmacist . this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet . you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v . by reporting side effects , you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine .

efient , which contains the active substance prasugrel , belongs to a group of medicines called anti - platelet agents . platelets are very small cell particles that circulate in the blood . when a blood vessel is damaged , for example if it is cut , platelets clump together to help form a blood clot ( thrombus ). therefore , platelets are essential to help stop bleeding . if clots form within a hardened blood vessel such as an artery they can be very dangerous as they can cut off the blood supply , causing a heart attack ( myocardial infarction ), stroke or death . clots in arteries supplying blood to the heart may also reduce the blood supply , causing unstable angina ( a severe chest pain ). efient inhibits the clumping of platelets and so reduces the chance of a blood clot forming . you have been prescribed efient because you have already had a heart attack or unstable angina and you have been treated with a procedure to open blocked arteries in the heart . you may also have had one or more stents placed to keep open a blocked or narrowed artery supplying blood to the heart . efient reduces the chances of you having a further heart attack or stroke or of dying from one of these atherothrombotic events . your doctor will also give you acetylsalicylic acid ( e . g . aspirin ), another anti - platelet agent .

iga antibodies . signs or symptoms of these rare allergic reactions include : - feeling light - headed , dizzy or faint , - skin rash and itchiness , swelling in the mouth or throat , difficulty breathing , wheezing , - abnormal heart rate , chest pain , blueness of lips or fingers and toes , - blurred vision . your doctor or nurse will first infuse hyqvia slowly , and carefully monitor you throughout the first infusions so that any allergic reaction can be detected and treated immediately . if you notice any of these signs during the infusion , tell your doctor or nurse immediately . he or she will decide whether to slow down the infusion rate or stop the infusion completely . infusion speed it is very important to infuse the medicine at the correct speed . your doctor or nurse will advise you on the appropriate infusion speed to use when you are infusing hyqvia at home ( see section 3 , " how to use hyqvia "). monitoring during infusion certain side effects may occur more frequently if : -

careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded , and - the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of viruses / infections . manufacturers of these products also include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses . despite these measures , when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are used , the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded . this also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections . the measures taken for the manufacture of hyqvia are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ), hepatitis b virus and hepatitis c virus and for the non - enveloped hepatitis a virus and parvovirus b19 . immunoglobulins have not been associated with hepatitis a or parvovirus b19 infections possibly because the antibodies against these infections , which are contained in hyqvia , are protective . it is strongly recommended that every time you use hyqvia , the following data are recorded in your treatment diary : -

always use intrinsa exactly as your doctor has told you . you should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure of the instructions or if you want any more information . the usual dose is one patch twice weekly ( each 3 to 4 days ), see below ' how and when to change your patch '. the active substance is released from the patch constantly over 3 to 4 days ( corresponding to 300 micrograms per 24 hours ) and is absorbed through your skin . where to stick the patch - stick the patch onto your lower abdomen , below your waist . do not stick the patch on the breasts or bottom . make sure that your skin at the application site is : clean and dry ( free of lotions , moisturisers , and powders ) as smooth as possible ( no major creases or skin folds ) not cut or irritated ( free of rashes or other skin problems ) unlikely to be rubbed by clothing excessively preferably free from hair . - when changing your patch , stick the new patch on to a different area of the skin of your abdomen , otherwise you are more likely to cause skin irritation . - only one patch is to be worn at a time . - if you are also using estrogen patches , make sure that the intrinsa patch and the estrogen patch do not overlap . - for at least one week after removing a patch , do not place a new patch in the same area . how to stick on the patch step 1 tear open the sachet . do not use scissors as you may accidentally damage the patch . remove the patch . apply the patch immediately after removing it from the sachet . step 2 while holding the patch , remove half of the protective liner that covers the sticky part of the patch . avoid touching the sticky side of the patch with your fingers . step 3 apply the sticky side of the patch to the selected area onto your skin . press the sticky side of the patch firmly into place for about 10 seconds . step 4 fold back the patch and carefully remove the other half of the liner . press the entire patch firmly against your skin with the palm of your hand for about 10 seconds . use your fingers to make sure the edges of the patch stick to the skin . if an area of the patch lifts , apply pressure to that area . how and when to change your patch - you will need to change your patch every 3 to 4 days , which means using two patches each week . this will mean that you wear one patch for 3 days and the other for 4 days . decide which two days each week you are going to change your patch , and change the patch on the same two days each week . for example : if you decide to start treatment on a monday , then you have to change your patch always on a thursday and a monday . o sunday + wednesday monday + thursday o tuesday + friday o wednesday + saturday o thursday + sunday o friday + monday o saturday + tuesday as a reminder , mark on the outer carton your chosen patch - change days . - on the patch - change day , remove the used patch and immediately stick the new patch on to a different area of skin of your abdomen . continue your treatment for as long as your doctor advises . - fold the used patch in half , sticking the patch to itself , and discard it in a safe way in order to keep it away from children ( e . g . in a rubbish bin ). medicines should not be disposed of via wastewater ( do not flush it down the toilet ). ask your pharmacist how to dispose of medicines no longer required . these measures will help to protect the environment . what about showering , bathing and exercising ? you may shower , bath , swim and exercise as normal while wearing the patch . the patch is designed to remain in place during these times . however , do not scrub the area where the patch has been placed too hard . what about sunbathing ? always make sure your patch is covered by clothing . what if your patch becomes loose , lifts at the edges or falls off ? if a patch does begin to come off , you may be able to make it stick again by pressing on it firmly . if you cannot get the patch to stick successfully , remove the loose patch and use a new patch . then continue with your regular schedule of patch - change days , even if this means discarding a patch after you have worn it for less than 3 - 4 days . if you use more patches than you should if you have applied more than one patch at a time remove all the patches sticking on to your skin and consult your doctor or pharmacist for further information on how to continue treatment with intrinsa . overdosing with intrinsa is unlikely when used as directed , because once the patch is taken off testosterone is quickly removed by the body . if you forget to use a patch if you forget to change your patch change your patch as soon as you remember , and then continue with your regular schedule of patch - change days , even if this means discarding a patch after you have worn it for less than 3 - 4 days . returning to your regular schedule will help you remember when to change your patch . if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine , ask your doctor or pharmacist .
