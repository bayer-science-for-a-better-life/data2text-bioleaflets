PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nInhalation powder, hard capsule (inhalation powder). \n\n \n\nCapsules with green transparent cap and uncoloured transparent body containing a white powder, with \n\nthe product code \u201cIGM150-50-160\u201d printed in black above two black bars on the body and with the \n\nproduct logo printed in black and surrounded by a black bar on the cap. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nEnerzair Breezhaler is indicated as a maintenance treatment of asthma in adult patients not adequately \n\ncontrolled with a maintenance combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist and a high dose of an \n\ninhaled corticosteroid who experienced one or more asthma exacerbations in the previous year. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is one capsule to be inhaled once daily. \n\n \n\nThe maximum recommended dose is 114 mcg/46 mcg/136 mcg once daily. \n\n \n\nTreatment should be administered at the same time of the day each day. It can be administered \n\nirrespective of the time of the day. If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible. Patients \n\nshould be instructed not to take more than one dose in a day. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n3 \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly population \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (65 years of age or older) (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Caution should be \n\nobserved in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are \n\navailable for the use of the medicinal product in patients with severe hepatic impairment, therefore it \n\nshould be used in these patients only if the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Enerzair Breezhaler in paediatric patients below 18 years of age have not \n\nbeen established. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor inhalation use only. The capsules must not be swallowed. \n\n \n\nThe capsules must be administered only using the inhaler provided (see section 6.6) with each new \n\nprescription. \n\n \n\nPatients should be instructed on how to administer the medicinal product correctly. Patients who do \n\nnot experience improvement in breathing should be asked if they are swallowing the medicinal \n\nproduct rather than inhaling it. \n\n \n\nThe capsules must only be removed from the blister immediately before use. \n\n \n\nAfter inhalation, patients should rinse their mouth with water without swallowing (see sections 4.4 and \n\n6.6). \n\n \n\nFor instructions on use of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\nInformation for patients using a sensor for Enerzair Breezhaler \n\nThe pack may contain an electronic sensor to be attached to the base of the inhaler. \n\n \n\nThe sensor and App are not required for administration of the medicinal product to the patient. The \n\nsensor and App do not control or interfere with delivery of the medicinal product using the inhaler. \n\n \n\nThe prescribing physician may discuss with the patient whether the use of the sensor and App is \n\nappropriate. \n\n \n\nFor detailed instructions on how to use the sensor and the App, see the Instructions for Use provided \n\nin the sensor pack and the App. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nDeterioration of disease \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms, including acute episodes \n\nof bronchospasm, for which a short-acting bronchodilator is required. Increasing use of short-acting \n\nbronchodilators to relieve symptoms indicates deterioration of control and patients should be reviewed \n\nby a physician. \n\n \n\nPatients should not stop treatment without physician supervision since symptoms may recur after \n\ndiscontinuation. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that treatment with this medicinal product should not be stopped abruptly. If \n\npatients find the treatment ineffective, they should continue treatment but must seek medical attention. \n\nIncreasing use of reliever bronchodilators indicates a worsening of the underlying condition and \n\nwarrants a reassessment of the therapy. Sudden and progressive deterioration in the symptoms of \n\nasthma is potentially life-threatening and the patient should undergo urgent medical assessment. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity \n\n \n\nImmediate hypersensitivity reactions have been observed after administration of this medicinal \n\nproduct. If signs suggesting allergic reactions occur, in particular angioedema (including difficulties in \n\nbreathing or swallowing, swelling of the tongue, lips and face), urticaria or skin rash, treatment should \n\nbe discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. \n\n \n\nParadoxical bronchospasm \n\n \n\nAs with other inhalation therapy, administration of this medicinal product may result in paradoxical \n\nbronchospasm, which can be life-threatening. If this occurs, treatment should be discontinued \n\nimmediately and alternative therapy instituted. \n\n \n\nCardiovascular effects \n\n \n\nLike other medicinal products containing beta2-adrenergic agonists, this medicinal product may \n\nproduce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by increases in \n\npulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. If such effects occur, treatment may need to be \n\ndiscontinued. \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders \n\n(coronary artery disease, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension), convulsive \n\ndisorders or thyrotoxicosis, and in patients who are unusually responsive to beta2-adrenergic agonists. \n\n \n\nPatients with unstable ischaemic heart disease, a history of myocardial infarction in last 12 months, \n\nNew York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV left ventricular failure, arrhythmia, uncontrolled \n\nhypertension, cerebrovascular disease, history of long QT syndrome and patients being treated with \n\nmedicinal products known to prolong QTc were excluded from studies in the \n\nindacaterol/glycopyrronium/mometasone furoate clinical development programme. Thus safety \n\noutcomes in these populations are considered unknown. \n\n \n\nWhile beta2-adrenergic agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiographic (ECG) changes, \n\nsuch as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of QT interval and ST segment depression, the clinical \n\nsignificance of these findings is unknown. \n\n \n\nLong-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABA) or LABA-containing combination products such as \n\nEnerzair Breezhaler should therefore be used with caution in patients with known or suspected \n\nprolongation of the QT interval or who are being treated with medicinal products affecting the QT \n\ninterval. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nHypokalaemia with beta agonists \n\n \n\nBeta2-adrenergic agonists may produce significant hypokalaemia in some patients, which has the \n\npotential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serum potassium is usually \n\ntransient, not requiring supplementation. In patients with severe asthma, hypokalaemia may be \n\npotentiated by hypoxia and concomitant treatment, which may increase the susceptibility to cardiac \n\narrhythmias (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nClinically relevant hypokalaemia has not been observed in clinical studies of \n\nindacaterol/glycopyrronium/mometasone furoate at the recommended therapeutic dose. \n\n \n\nHyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nInhalation of high doses of beta2-adrenergic agonists and corticosteroids may produce increases in \n\nplasma glucose. Upon initiation of treatment, plasma glucose should be monitored more closely in \n\ndiabetic patients. \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product has not been investigated in patients with Type I diabetes mellitus or \n\nuncontrolled Type II diabetes mellitus. \n\n \n\nAnticholinergic effect related to glycopyrronium \n\n \n\nLike other anticholinergic medicinal products, this medicinal product should be used with caution in \n\npatients with narrow-angle glaucoma or urinary retention. \n\n \n\nPatients should be advised about signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma and should be \n\ninstructed to stop treatment and to contact their doctor immediately should any of these signs or \n\nsymptoms develop. \n\n \n\nPatients with severe renal impairment \n\n \n\nFor patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate below \n\n30 ml/min/1.73 m2), including those with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis, caution should be \n\nobserved (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nPrevention of oropharyngeal infections \n\n \n\nIn order to reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candida infection, patients should be advised to rinse their \n\nmouth or gargle with water without swallowing it or brush their teeth after inhaling the prescribed \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nSystemic effects of corticosteroids \n\n \n\nSystemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids may occur, particularly at high doses prescribed for \n\nprolonged periods. These effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids and may \n\nvary in individual patients and between different corticosteroid preparations. \n\n \n\nPossible systemic effects may include Cushing\u2019s syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, \n\ngrowth retardation in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataracts, glaucoma, \n\nand, more rarely, a range of psychological or behavioural effects including psychomotor hyperactivity, \n\nsleep disorders, anxiety, depression or aggression (particularly in children). It is therefore important \n\nthat the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of asthma \n\nis maintained. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nVisual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical (including intranasal, inhaled and \n\nintraocular) corticosteroid use. Patients presenting with symptoms such as blurred vision or other \n\nvisual disturbances should be considered for referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible \n\ncauses of visual disturbances, which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare diseases such as central \n\nserous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use of systemic and topical \n\ncorticosteroids. \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product should be administered with caution in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis or \n\nin patients with chronic or untreated infections. \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \n\nintolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal \n\nproduct. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nNo specific interaction studies were conducted with indacaterol/glycopyrronium/mometasone furoate. \n\nInformation on the potential for interactions is based on the potential for each of the monotherapy \n\ncomponents. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval \n\n \n\nLike other medicinal products containing a beta2-adrenergic agonist, this medicinal product should be \n\nadministered with caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic \n\nantidepressants, or medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval, as any effect of these on the \n\nQT interval may be potentiated. Medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval may increase \n\nthe risk of ventricular arrhythmia (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nHypokalaemic treatment \n\n \n\nConcomitant hypokalaemic treatment with methylxanthine derivatives, steroids, or \n\nnon-potassium-sparing diuretics may potentiate the possible hypokalaemic effect of beta2-adrenergic \n\nagonists (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nBeta-adrenergic blockers \n\n \n\nBeta-adrenergic blockers may weaken or antagonise the effect of beta2-adrenergic agonists. Therefore, \n\nthis medicinal product should not be given together with beta-adrenergic blockers unless there are \n\ncompelling reasons for their use. Where required, cardioselective beta-adrenergic blockers should be \n\npreferred, although they should be administered with caution. \n\n \n\nInteraction with CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitors \n\n \n\nInhibition of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) has no impact on the safety of therapeutic doses of \n\nEnerzair Breezhaler. \n\n \n\nInhibition of the key contributors of indacaterol clearance (CYP3A4 and P-gp) or mometasone furoate \n\nclearance (CYP3A4) raises the systemic exposure of indacaterol or mometasone furoate up to \n\ntwo-fold. \n\n \n\nDue to the very low plasma concentration achieved after inhaled dosing, clinically significant \n\ninteractions with mometasone furoate are unlikely. However, there may be a potential for increased \n\nsystemic exposure to mometasone furoate when strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, \n\nitraconazole, nelfinavir, ritonavir, cobicistat) are co-administered. \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nCimetidine or other inhibitors of organic cation transport \n\n \n\nIn a clinical study in healthy volunteers, cimetidine, an inhibitor of organic cation transport which is \n\nthought to contribute to the renal excretion of glycopyrronium, increased total exposure (AUC) to \n\nglycopyrronium by 22% and decreased renal clearance by 23%. Based on the magnitude of these \n\nchanges, no clinically relevant drug interaction is expected when glycopyrronium is co-administered \n\nwith cimetidine or other inhibitors of the organic cation transport. \n\n \n\nOther long-acting antimuscarinics and long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists \n\n \n\nThe co-administration of this medicinal product with other medicinal products containing long-acting \n\nmuscarinic antagonists or long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists has not been studied and is not \n\nrecommended as it may potentiate adverse reactions (see sections 4.8 and 4.9). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are insufficient data from the use of Enerzair Breezhaler or its individual components \n\n(indacaterol, glycopyrronium and mometasone furoate) in pregnant women to determine whether there \n\nis a risk. \n\n \n\nIndacaterol and glycopyrronium were not teratogenic in rats and rabbits following subcutaneous or \n\ninhalation administration, respectively (see section 5.3). In animal reproduction studies with pregnant \n\nmice, rats and rabbits, mometasone furoate caused increased foetal malformations and decreased foetal \n\nsurvival and growth. \n\n \n\nLike other medicinal products containing beta2-adrenergic agonists, indacaterol may inhibit labour due \n\nto a relaxant effect on uterine smooth muscle. \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product should only be used during pregnancy if the expected benefit to the patient \n\njustifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nThere is no information available on the presence of indacaterol, glycopyrronium or mometasone \n\nfuroate in human milk, on the effects on a breast-fed infant, or on the effects on milk production. \n\nOther inhaled corticosteroids similar to mometasone furoate are transferred into human milk. \n\nIndacaterol, glycopyrronium and mometasone furoate have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. \n\nGlycopyrronium reached up to 10-fold higher concentrations in the milk of lactating rats than in the \n\nblood of the dam after intravenous administration. \n\n \n\nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from therapy, \n\ntaking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nReproduction studies and other data in animals did not indicate a concern regarding fertility in either \n\nmales or females. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nThis medicinal product has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most common adverse reactions over 52 weeks were asthma (exacerbation) (41.8%), \n\nnasopharyngitis (10.9%), upper respiratory tract infection (5.6%) and headache (4.2%). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse drug reactions (ADRs) are listed by MedDRA system organ class (Table 1). The frequency of \n\nthe ADRs is based on the IRIDIUM study. Within each system organ class, the adverse drug reactions \n\nare ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. Within each frequency grouping, \n\nadverse drug reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In addition, the corresponding \n\nfrequency category for each adverse drug reaction is based on the following convention (CIOMS III): \n\nvery common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 \n\nto <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000). \n\n \n\nTable 1 Adverse reactions \n\n \n\nSystem organ class Adverse reactions Frequency \n\ncategory \n\nInfections and infestations \n\nNasopharyngitis Very common \n\nUpper respiratory tract \n\ninfection \n\nCommon \n\nCandidiasis*1 Common \n\nUrinary tract infection*2 Common \n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity*3 Common \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Hyperglycaemia*4 Uncommon \n\nNervous system disorders Headache*5 Common \n\nEye disorders Cataract Uncommon \n\nCardiac disorders Tachycardia*6 Common \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nAsthma (exacerbation) Very common \n\nOropharyngeal pain*7 Common \n\nCough Common \n\nDysphonia Common \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nGastroenteritis*8 Common \n\nDry mouth*9 Uncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nRash*10 Uncommon \n\nPruritus*11 Uncommon \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nMusculoskeletal pain*12 Common \n\nMuscle spasms Common \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Dysuria Uncommon \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \n\nconditions \n\nPyrexia Common \n\n* Indicates grouping of preferred terms (PTs): \n\n1 Oral candidiasis, oropharyngeal candidiasis. \n\n2 Asymptomatic bacteriuria, bacteriuria, cystitis, urethritis, urinary tract infection, urinary tract infection viral. \n\n3 Drug eruption, drug hypersensitivity, hypersensitivity, rash, rash pruritic, urticaria. \n\n4 Blood glucose increased, hyperglycaemia. \n\n5 Headache, tension headache. \n\n6 Sinus tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, tachycardia. \n\n7 Odynophagia, oropharyngeal discomfort, oropharyngeal pain, throat irritation. \n\n8 Chronic gastritis, enteritis, gastritis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal inflammation. \n\n9 Dry mouth, dry throat. \n\n10 Drug eruption, rash, rash papular, rash pruritic. \n\n11 Eye pruritus, pruritus, pruritus genital. \n\n12 Back pain, musculoskeletal chest pain, musculoskeletal pain, myalgia, neck pain. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nGeneral supportive measures and symptomatic treatment should be initiated in cases of suspected \n\noverdose. \n\n \n\nAn overdose will likely produce signs, symptoms or adverse effects associated with the \n\npharmacological actions of the individual components (e.g. tachycardia, tremor, palpitations, \n\nheadache, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, ventricular arrhythmias, metabolic acidosis, hypokalaemia, \n\nhyperglycaemia, increased intraocular pressure [causing pain, vision disturbances or reddening of the \n\neye], constipation or difficulties in voiding, suppression of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis \n\nfunction). \n\n \n\nUse of cardioselective beta blockers may be considered for treating beta2-adrenergic effects, but only \n\nunder the supervision of a physician and with extreme caution, since the use of beta2-adrenergic \n\nblockers may provoke bronchospasm. In serious cases, patients should be hospitalised. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, adrenergics in combination with \n\nanticholinergics incl. triple combinations with corticosteroids. ATC code: R03AL12 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product is a combination of indacaterol, a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist \n\n(LABA), glycopyrronium, a long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA) and mometasone \n\nfuroate, an inhaled synthetic corticosteroid (ICS). \n\n \n\nIndacaterol \n\nThe pharmacological effects of beta2-adrenoceptor agonists, including indacaterol, are at least in part \n\nattributable to increased cyclic-3\u2019, 5\u2019-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) levels, which cause \n\nrelaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. \n\n \n\nWhen inhaled, indacaterol acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. Indacaterol is a partial agonist \n\nat the human beta2-adrenergic receptor with nanomolar potency. In isolated human bronchus, \n\nindacaterol has a rapid onset of action and a long duration of action. \n\n \n\nAlthough beta2-adrenergic receptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth \n\nmuscle and beta1-receptors are the predominant receptors in the human heart, there are also \n\nbeta2-adrenergic receptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total adrenergic \n\nreceptors. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\nGlycopyrronium \n\nGlycopyrronium works by blocking the bronchoconstrictor action of acetylcholine on airway smooth \n\nmuscle cells, thereby dilating the airways. Glycopyrronium bromide is a high-affinity muscarinic \n\nreceptor antagonist. It demonstrated 4- to 5-fold selectivity for the human M3 and M1 receptors over \n\nthe human M2 receptor in competition binding studies. It has a rapid onset of action, as evidenced by \n\nobserved receptor association/dissociation kinetic parameters and by the onset of action after \n\ninhalation in clinical studies. The long duration of action can be partly attributed to sustained drug \n\nconcentrations in the lungs, as reflected by the prolonged terminal elimination half-life of \n\nglycopyrronium after inhalation via the inhaler in contrast to the half-life after intravenous \n\nadministration (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nMometasone furoate \n\nMometasone furoate is a synthetic corticosteroid with high affinity for glucocorticoid receptors and \n\nlocal anti-inflammatory properties. In vitro, mometasone furoate inhibits the release of leukotrienes \n\nfrom leukocytes of allergic patients. In cell culture, mometasone furoate demonstrated high potency in \n\ninhibition of synthesis and release of IL-1, IL-5, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. It is also a potent inhibitor of \n\nleukotriene production and of the production of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 from human CD4+ \n\nT-cells. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nThe pharmacodynamic response profile of this medicinal product is characterised by rapid onset of \n\naction within 5 minutes after dosing and sustained effect over the whole 24-hour dosing interval. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacodynamic response profile is further characterised by increased mean peak forced \n\nexpiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) of 172 ml following \n\nindacaterol/glycopyrronium/mometasone furoate 114 mcg/46 mcg/136 mcg once daily compared to \n\nsalmeterol/fluticasone 50 mcg/500 mcg twice daily. \n\n \n\nNo tachyphylaxis to the lung function benefits of Enerzair Breezhaler was observed over time. \n\n \n\nQTc interval \n\nThe effect of this medicinal product on the QTc interval has not been evaluated in a thorough QT \n\n(TQT) study. For mometasone furoate, no QTc prolonging properties are known. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n11 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Enerzair Breezhaler in adult patients with persistent asthma was evaluated \n\nin the phase III randomised, double-blind study (IRIDIUM). The IRIDIUM study was a 52-week study \n\nevaluating Enerzair Breezhaler 114 mcg/46 mcg/68 mcg once daily (N=620) and \n\n114 mcg/46 mcg/136 mcg once daily (N=619) compared to indacaterol/mometasone furoate \n\n125 mcg/127.5 mcg once daily (N=617) and 125 mcg/260 mcg once daily (N=618), respectively. A \n\nthird active control arm included subjects treated with salmeterol/fluticasone propionate \n\n50 mcg/500 mcg twice daily (N=618). All subjects were required to have symptomatic asthma \n\n(ACQ-7 score \u22651.5) and were on asthma maintenance therapy using a medium or high dose inhaled \n\nsynthetic corticosteroid (ICS) and LABA combination therapy for at least 3 months prior to study \n\nentry. The mean age was 52.2 years. At screening, 99.9% of patients reported a history of exacerbation \n\nin the past year. At study entry, the most common asthma medications reported were medium dose of \n\nICS in combination with a LABA (62.6%) and high dose of ICS in combination with a LABA \n\n(36.7%). \n\n \n\nThe primary objective of the study was to demonstrate superiority of either Enerzair Breezhaler \n\n114 mcg/46 mcg/68 mcg once daily over indacaterol/mometasone furoate 125 mcg/127.5 mcg once \n\ndaily or Enerzair Breezhaler 114 mcg/46 mcg/136 mcg once daily over indacaterol/mometasone \n\nfuroate 125 mcg/260 mcg once daily in terms of trough FEV1 at week 26. \n\n \n\nEnerzair Breezhaler 114 mcg/46 mcg/136 mcg once daily demonstrated statistically significant \n\nimprovements in trough FEV1 at week 26 compared to indacaterol/mometasone furoate at \n\ncorresponding dose. Clinically meaningful improvements in lung function (change from baseline \n\ntrough FEV1 at week 26, morning and evening peak expiratory flow) were also observed compared to \n\nsalmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50 mcg/500 mcg twice daily. Findings at week 52 were consistent \n\nwith week 26 (see Table 2). \n\n \n\nAll treatment groups showed clinically relevant improvements from baseline in ACQ-7 at week 26, \n\nhowever no statistically significant differences between groups were observed. The mean change from \n\nbaseline in ACQ-7 at week 26 (key secondary endpoint) and week 52 was around -1 for all treatment \n\ngroups. The ACQ-7 responder rates (defined as a change decrease in score of \u22650.5) at different time \n\npoints are described in Table 2. \n\n \n\nExacerbations were a secondary endpoint (not part of confirmatory testing strategy). Enerzair \n\nBreezhaler 114 mcg/46 mcg/136 mcg once daily demonstrated a reduction in the annual rate of \n\nexacerbations compared to salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50 mcg/500 mcg twice daily and \n\nindacaterol/mometasone furoate 125 mcg/260 mcg once daily (see Table 2). \n\n \n\nResults for the most clinically relevant endpoints are described in Table 2. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n12 \n\nTable 2 Results of primary and secondary endpoints in IRIDIUM study at weeks 26 and 52 \n\n \nEndpoint Time point/ \n\nDuration \n\nEnerzair Breezhaler1 vs \n\nIND/MF2 \n\nEnerzair Breezhaler1 vs \n\nSAL/FP3 \n\nLung function \n\nTrough FEV14 \n\nTreatment \n\ndifference \n\nP value \n\n(95% CI) \n\nWeek 26 \n\n(Primary \n\nendpoint) \n\n65 ml \n\n<0.001 \n\n(31, 99) \n\n119 ml \n\n<0.001 \n\n(85, 154) \n\nWeek 52 \n\n86 ml \n\n<0.001 \n\n(51, 120) \n\n145 ml \n\n<0.001 \n\n(111, 180) \n\nMean morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) \n\nTreatment \n\ndifference \n\n(95% CI) \n\nWeek 52* \n18.7 l/min \n\n(13.4, 24.1) \n\n34.8 l/min \n\n(29.5, 40.1) \n\nMean evening peak expiratory flow (PEF) \n\nTreatment \n\ndifference \n\n(95% CI) \n\nWeek 52* \n17.5 l/min \n\n(12.3, 22.8) \n\n29.5 l/min \n\n(24.2, 34.7) \n\nSymptoms \n\nACQ responders (percentage of patients achieving minimal clinical important difference (MCID) from \n\nbaseline with ACQ \u22650.5) \n\nPercentage Week 4 66% vs 63% 66% vs 53% \n\nOdds ratio \n\n(95% CI) \n\n1.21 \n\n(0.94, 1.54) \n\n1.72 \n\n(1.35, 2.20) \n\nPercentage Week 12 68% vs 67% 68% vs 61% \n\nOdds ratio \n\n(95% CI) \n\n1.11 \n\n(0.86, 1.42) \n\n1.35 \n\n(1.05, 1.73) \n\nPercentage Week 26 71% vs 74% 71% vs 67% \n\nOdds ratio \n\n(95% CI) \n\n0.92 \n\n(0.70, 1.20) \n\n1.21 \n\n(0.93, 1.57) \n\nPercentage Week 52 79% vs 78% 79% vs 73% \n\nOdds ratio \n\n(95% CI) \n\n1.10 \n\n(0.83, 1.47) \n\n1.41 \n\n(1.06, 1.86) \n\nAnnualised rate of asthma exacerbations \n\nModerate or severe exacerbations \n\nAR Week 52 0.46 vs 0.54 0.46 vs 0.72 \n\nRR** \n\n(95% CI) \n\nWeek 52 0.85 \n\n(0.68, 1.04) \n\n0.64 \n\n(0.52, 0.78) \n\nSevere exacerbations \n\nAR Week 52 0.26 vs 0.33 0.26 vs 0.45 \n\nRR** \n\n(95% CI) \n\nWeek 52 0.78 \n\n(0.61, 1.00) \n\n0.58 \n\n(0.45, 0.73) \n\n* Mean value for the treatment duration. \n\n** RR <1.00 favours indacaterol/glycopyrronium/mometasone furoate. \n1 Enerzair Breezhaler 114 mcg/46 mcg/136 mcg od. \n2 IND/MF: indacaterol/mometasone furoate high dose: 125 mcg/260 mcg od. \n\nMometasone furoate 136 mcg in Enerzair Breezhaler is comparable to mometasone furoate 260 mcg in \n\nindacaterol/mometasone furoate. \n3 SAL/FP: salmeterol/fluticasone propionate high dose: 50 mcg/500 mcg bid (content dose). \n4 Trough FEV1: the mean of the two FEV1 values measured at 23 hours 15 min and 23 hours 45 min \n\nafter the evening dose. \n\nPrimary endpoint (trough FEV1 at week 26) and key secondary endpoint (ACQ-7 score at week 26) were part \n\nof confirmatory testing strategy and thus controlled for multiplicity.

Steady-state plasma exposure to indacaterol, glycopyrronium and \n\nmometasone furoate after inhalation of the combination was similar to the systemic exposure after \n\ninhalation of indacaterol maleate, glycopyrronium or mometasone furoate as monotherapy products. \n\n \n\nFollowing inhalation of the combination, the absolute bioavailability was estimated to be about 45% \n\nfor indacaterol, 40% for glycopyrronium and less than 10% for mometasone furoate. \n\n \n\nIndacaterol \n\nIndacaterol concentrations increased with repeated once-daily administration. Steady-state was \n\nachieved within 12 to 14 days. The mean accumulation ratio of indacaterol, i.e. AUC over the 24-h \n\ndosing interval on day 14 compared to day 1, was in the range of 2.9 to 3.8 for once-daily inhaled \n\ndoses between 60 and 480 mcg (delivered dose). Systemic exposure results from a composite of \n\npulmonary and gastrointestinal absorption; about 75% of systemic exposure was from pulmonary \n\nabsorption and about 25% from gastrointestinal absorption. \n\n \n\nGlycopyrronium \n\nAbout 90% of systemic exposure following inhalation is due to lung absorption and 10% is due to \n\ngastrointestinal absorption. The absolute bioavailability of orally administered glycopyrronium was \n\nestimated to be about 5%. \n\n \n\nMometasone furoate \n\nMometasone furoate concentrations increased with repeated once-daily administration via the \n\nBreezhaler inhaler. Steady state was achieved after 12 days. The mean accumulation ratio of \n\nmometasone furoate, i.e. AUC over the 24-h dosing interval on day 14 compared to day 1, was in the \n\nrange of 1.28 to 1.40 for once-daily inhaled doses between 68 and 136 mcg as part of the \n\nindacaterol/glycopyrronium/mometasone furoate combination. \n\n \n\nFollowing oral administration of mometasone furoate, the absolute oral systemic bioavailability of \n\nmometasone furoate was estimated to be very low (<2%). \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nIndacaterol \n\nAfter intravenous infusion the volume of distribution (Vz) of indacaterol was 2361 to 2557 litres, \n\nindicating an extensive distribution. The in vitro human serum and plasma protein binding were 94.1 \n\nto 95.3% and 95.1 to 96.2%, respectively. \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nGlycopyrronium \n\nAfter intravenous dosing, the steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) of glycopyrronium was 83 litres \n\nand the volume of distribution in the terminal phase (Vz) was 376 litres. The apparent volume of \n\ndistribution in the terminal phase following inhalation (Vz/F) was 7,310 litres, which reflects the much \n\nslower elimination after inhalation. The in vitro human plasma protein binding of glycopyrronium was \n\n38% to 41% at concentrations of 1 to 10 ng/ml. These concentrations were at least 6-fold higher than \n\nthe steady-state mean peak levels achieved in plasma for a 44 mcg once-daily dosing regimen. \n\n \n\nMometasone furoate \n\nAfter intravenous bolus administration, the Vd is 332 litres. The in vitro protein binding for \n\nmometasone furoate is high, 98% to 99% in concentration range of 5 to 500 ng/ml. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nIndacaterol \n\nAfter oral administration of radiolabelled indacaterol in a human ADME (absorption, distribution, \n\nmetabolism, excretion) study, unchanged indacaterol was the main component in serum, accounting \n\nfor about one third of total drug-related AUC over 24 hours. A hydroxylated derivative was the most \n\nprominent metabolite in serum. Phenolic O-glucuronides of indacaterol and hydroxylated indacaterol \n\nwere further prominent metabolites. A diastereomer of the hydroxylated derivative, an N-glucuronide \n\nof indacaterol, and C- and N-dealkylated products were further metabolites identified. \n\n \n\nIn vitro investigations indicated that UGT1A1 was the only UGT isoform that metabolised indacaterol \n\nto the phenolic O-glucuronide. The oxidative metabolites were found in incubations with recombinant \n\nCYP1A1, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. CYP3A4 is concluded to be the predominant isoenzyme responsible \n\nfor hydroxylation of indacaterol. In vitro investigations further indicated that indacaterol is a \n\nlow-affinity substrate for the efflux pump P-gp. \n\n \n\nIn vitro the UGT1A1 isoform is a major contributor to the metabolic clearance of indacaterol. \n\nHowever, as shown in a clinical study in populations with different UGT1A1 genotypes, systemic \n\nexposure to indacaterol is not significantly affected by the UGT1A1-genotype. \n\n \n\nGlycopyrronium \n\nIn vitro metabolism studies showed consistent metabolic pathways for glycopyrronium bromide \n\nbetween animals and humans. No human-specific metabolites were found. Hydroxylation resulting in \n\na variety of mono- and bis-hydroxylated metabolites and direct hydrolysis resulting in the formation of \n\na carboxylic acid derivative (M9) were seen. \n\n \n\nIn vitro investigations showed that multiple CYP isoenzymes contribute to the oxidative \n\nbiotransformation of glycopyrronium. The hydrolysis to M9 is likely to be catalysed by members of \n\nthe cholinesterase family. \n\n \n\nAfter inhalation, systemic exposure to M9 was on average in the same order of magnitude as the \n\nexposure to the parent drug. Since in vitro studies did not show lung metabolism and M9 was of minor \n\nimportance in the circulation (about 4% of parent drug Cmax and AUC) after intravenous \n\nadministration, it is assumed that M9 is formed from the swallowed dose fraction of orally inhaled \n\nglycopyrronium bromide by pre-systemic hydrolysis and/or via first-pass metabolism. After inhalation \n\nas well as after intravenous administration, only minimal amounts of M9 were found in the urine (i.e. \n\n\u22640.5% of dose). Glucuronide and/or sulfate conjugates of glycopyrronium were found in urine of \n\nhumans after repeated inhalation, accounting for about 3% of the dose. \n\n \n\nIn vitro inhibition studies demonstrated that glycopyrronium bromide has no relevant capacity to \n\ninhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A4/5, the \n\nefflux transporters MDR1, MRP2 or MXR, and the uptake transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, \n\nOAT3, OCT1 or OCT2. In vitro enzyme induction studies did not indicate a clinically relevant \n\ninduction by glycopyrronium bromide for any of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes tested as well as \n\nfor UGT1A1 and the transporters MDR1 and MRP2. \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nMometasone furoate \n\nThe portion of an inhaled mometasone furoate dose that is swallowed and absorbed in the \n\ngastrointestinal tract undergoes extensive metabolism to multiple metabolites. There are no major \n\nmetabolites detectable in plasma. In human liver microsomes, mometasone furoate is metabolised by \n\nCYP3A4. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nIndacaterol \n\nIn clinical studies which included urine collection, the amount of indacaterol excreted unchanged via \n\nurine was generally lower than 2% of the dose. Renal clearance of indacaterol was, on average, \n\nbetween 0.46 and 1.20 litres/hour. Compared with the serum clearance of indacaterol of 18.8 to \n\n23.3 litres/hour, it is evident that renal clearance plays a minor role (about 2 to 6% of systemic \n\nclearance) in the elimination of systemically available indacaterol. \n\n \n\nIn a human ADME study in which indacaterol was given orally, the faecal route of excretion was \n\ndominant over the urinary route. Indacaterol was excreted into human faeces primarily as unchanged \n\nparent substance (54% of the dose) and, to a lesser extent, hydroxylated indacaterol metabolites (23% \n\nof the dose). Mass balance was complete, with \u226590% of the dose recovered in the excreta. \n\n \n\nIndacaterol serum concentrations declined in a multi-phasic manner with an average terminal half-life \n\nranging from 45.5 to 126 hours. The effective half-life, calculated from the accumulation of \n\nindacaterol after repeated dosing, ranged from 40 to 52 hours, which is consistent with the observed \n\ntime to steady state of approximately 12 to 14 days. \n\n \n\nGlycopyrronium \n\nAfter intravenous administration of [3H]-labelled glycopyrronium bromide to humans, the mean \n\nurinary excretion of radioactivity in 48 hours amounted to 85% of the dose. A further 5% of the dose \n\nwas found in the bile. Thus, mass balance was almost complete. \n\n \n\nRenal elimination of parent drug accounts for about 60 to 70% of total clearance of systemically \n\navailable glycopyrronium whereas non-renal clearance processes account for about 30 to 40%. Biliary \n\nclearance contributes to the non-renal clearance, but the majority of non-renal clearance is thought to \n\nbe due to metabolism. \n\n \n\nMean renal clearance of glycopyrronium was in the range of 17.4 and 24.4 litres/hour. Active tubular \n\nsecretion contributes to the renal elimination of glycopyrronium. Up to 20% of the dose was found in \n\nurine as parent drug. \n\n \n\nGlycopyrronium plasma concentrations declined in a multi-phasic manner. The mean terminal \n\nelimination half-life was much longer after inhalation (33 to 57 hours) than after intravenous \n\n(6.2 hours) and oral (2.8 hours) administration. The elimination pattern suggests a sustained lung \n\nabsorption and/or transfer of glycopyrronium into the systemic circulation at and beyond 24 h after \n\ninhalation. \n\n \n\nMometasone furoate \n\nAfter intravenous bolus administration, mometasone furoate has a terminal elimination T\u00bd of \n\napproximately 4.5 hours. A radiolabelled, orally inhaled dose is excreted mainly in the faeces (74%) \n\nand to a lesser extent in the urine (8%). \n\n \n\nInteractions \n\n \n\nConcomitant administration of orally inhaled indacaterol, glycopyrronium and mometasone furoate \n\nunder steady-state conditions did not affect the pharmacokinetics of any of the active substances. \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with asthma after inhalation of Enerzair Breezhaler \n\nindicated no significant effect of age, gender, body weight, smoking status, baseline estimated \n\nglomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and FEV1 at baseline on the systemic exposure to indacaterol, \n\nglycopyrronium or mometasone furoate. \n\n \n\nPatients with renal impairment \n\nThe effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of indacaterol, glycopyrronium and \n\nmometasone furoate has not been evaluated in dedicated studies with Enerzair Breezhaler. In a \n\npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was not a \n\nstatistically significant covariate for systemic exposure of indacaterol, glycopyrronium and \n\nmometasone furoate following administration of Enerzair Breezhaler in patients with asthma. \n\n \n\nDue to the very low contribution of the urinary pathway to the total body elimination of indacaterol \n\nand mometasone furoate, the effects of renal impairment on their systemic exposure have not been \n\ninvestigated (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment has an impact on the systemic exposure to glycopyrronium administered as a \n\nmonotherapy. A moderate mean increase in total systemic exposure (AUClast) of up to 1.4-fold was \n\nseen in subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment and up to 2.2-fold in subjects with severe \n\nrenal impairment and end-stage renal disease. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of \n\nglycopyrronium in asthma patients following Enerzair Breezhaler administration, AUC0-24h increased \n\nby 27% or decreased by 19% for patients with an absolute GFR of 58 or 143 ml/min, respectively, \n\ncompared to a patient with an absolute GFR of 93 ml/min. Based on a population pharmacokinetic \n\nanalysis of glycopyrronium in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with mild and moderate \n\nrenal impairment (eGFR \u226530 ml/min/1.73 m2), glycopyrronium can be used at the recommended dose. \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of indacaterol, glycopyrronium and \n\nmometasone furoate has not been evaluated in subjects with hepatic impairment following \n\nadministration of Enerzair Breezhaler. However, studies have been conducted with the monotherapy \n\ncomponents indacaterol and mometasone furoate (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nIndacaterol \n\nPatients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment showed no relevant changes in Cmax or AUC of \n\nindacaterol, nor did protein binding differ between mild and moderate hepatic impaired subjects and \n\ntheir healthy controls. Studies in subjects with severe hepatic impairment were not performed. \n\n \n\nGlycopyrronium \n\nClinical studies in patients with hepatic impairment have not been conducted. Glycopyrronium is \n\ncleared predominantly from the systemic circulation by renal excretion. Impairment of the hepatic \n\nmetabolism of glycopyrronium is not thought to result in a clinically relevant increase in systemic \n\nexposure. \n\n \n\nMometasone furoate \n\nA study evaluating the administration of a single inhaled dose of 400 mcg mometasone furoate by dry \n\npowder inhaler to subjects with mild (n=4), moderate (n=4), and severe (n=4) hepatic impairment \n\nresulted in only 1 or 2 subjects in each group having detectable peak plasma concentrations of \n\nmometasone furoate (ranging from 50 to 105 pcg/ml). The observed peak plasma concentrations \n\nappear to increase with severity of hepatic impairment; however, the numbers of detectable levels \n\n(assay lower limit of quantification was 50 pcg/ml) were few. \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nOther special populations \n\nThere were no major differences in total systemic exposure (AUC) for indacaterol, glycopyrronium or \n\nmometasone furoate between Japanese and Caucasian subjects. Insufficient pharmacokinetic data are \n\navailable for other ethnicities or races. Total systemic exposure (AUC) for glycopyrronium may be up \n\nto 1.8-fold higher in asthma patients with low body weight (35 kg) and up to 2.5-fold higher in asthma \n\npatients with low body weight (35 kg) and low absolute GFR (45 ml/min). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nNo animal studies were performed with the combination of indacaterol, glycopyrronium and \n\nmometasone furoate. The non-clinical assessments of each monotherapy and of \n\nindacaterol/mometasone and indacaterol/glycopyrronium combination products are presented below: \n\n \n\nIndacaterol \n\n \n\nEffects on the cardiovascular system attributable to the beta2-agonistic properties of indacaterol \n\nincluded tachycardia, arrhythmias and myocardial lesions in dogs. Mild irritation of the nasal cavity \n\nand larynx was seen in rodents. \n\n \n\nGenotoxicity studies did not reveal any mutagenic or clastogenic potential. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenicity was assessed in a two-year rat study and a six-month transgenic mouse study. \n\nIncreased incidences of benign ovarian leiomyoma and focal hyperplasia of ovarian smooth muscle in \n\nrats were consistent with similar findings reported for other beta2-adrenergic agonists. No evidence of \n\ncarcinogenicity was seen in mice. \n\n \n\nAll these findings occurred at exposures sufficiently in excess of those anticipated in humans. \n\n \n\nFollowing subcutaneous administration in a rabbit study, adverse effects of indacaterol with respect to \n\npregnancy and embryonal/foetal development could only be demonstrated at doses more than 500-fold \n\nthose achieved following daily inhalation of 150 mcg in humans (based on AUC0-24 h). \n\n \n\nAlthough indacaterol did not affect general reproductive performance in a rat fertility study, a decrease \n\nin the number of pregnant F1 offspring was observed in the peri- and post-natal developmental rat \n\nstudy at an exposure 14-fold higher than in humans treated with indacaterol. Indacaterol was not \n\nembryotoxic or teratogenic in rats or rabbits. \n\n \n\nGlycopyrronium \n\n \n\nEffects attributable to the muscarinic receptor antagonist properties of glycopyrronium included mild \n\nto moderate increases in heart rate in dogs, lens opacities in rats and reversible changes associated \n\nwith reduced glandular secretions in rats and dogs. Mild irritancy or adaptive changes in the \n\nrespiratory tract were seen in rats. All these findings occurred at exposures sufficiently in excess of \n\nthose anticipated in humans. \n\n \n\nGenotoxicity studies did not reveal any mutagenic or clastogenic potential for glycopyrronium. \n\nCarcinogenicity studies in transgenic mice using oral administration and in rats using inhalation \n\nadministration revealed no evidence of carcinogenicity. \n\n \n\nGlycopyrronium was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits following inhalation administration. \n\nGlycopyrronium and its metabolites did not significantly cross the placental barrier of pregnant mice, \n\nrabbits and dogs. Published data for glycopyrronium in animals do not indicate any reproductive \n\ntoxicity issues. Fertility and pre- and post-natal development were not affected in rats. \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nMometasone furoate \n\n \n\nAll observed effects are typical of the glucocorticoid class of compounds and are related to \n\nexaggerated pharmacological effects of glucocorticoids. \n\n \n\nMometasone furoate showed no genotoxic activity in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests. \n\n \n\nIn carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats, inhaled mometasone furoate demonstrated no statistically \n\nsignificant increase in the incidence of tumours. \n\n \n\nLike other glucocorticoids, mometasone furoate is a teratogen in rodents and rabbits. Effects noted \n\nwere umbilical hernia in rats, cleft palate in mice and gallbladder agenesis, umbilical hernia and flexed \n\nfront paws in rabbits. There were also reductions in maternal body weight gains, effects on foetal \n\ngrowth (lower foetal body weight and/or delayed ossification) in rats, rabbits and mice, and reduced \n\noffspring survival in mice. In studies of reproductive function, subcutaneous mometasone furoate at \n\n15 mcg/kg prolonged gestation and difficult labour occurred, with a reduction in offspring survival \n\nand body weight. \n\n \n\nIndacaterol and glycopyrronium combination \n\n \n\nFindings during the nonclinical safety studies of indacaterol/glycopyrronium were consistent with the \n\nknown pharmacological effects of the indacaterol or glycopyrronium monotherapy components. \n\n \n\nThe effect on heart rate for indacaterol/glycopyrronium was increased in magnitude and duration \n\ncompared with the changes observed for each monotherapy component alone. \n\n \n\nShortening of electrocardiograph intervals and decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure were \n\nalso apparent. Indacaterol administered to dogs alone or in the indacaterol/glycopyrronium \n\ncombination was associated with a similar incidence of myocardial lesions. \n\n \n\nIndacaterol and mometasone furoate combination \n\n \n\nThe findings during the 13-week inhalation toxicity studies were predominantly attributable to the \n\nmometasone furoate and were typical pharmacological effects of glucocorticoids. Increased heart rates \n\nassociated with indacaterol were apparent in dogs after administration of indacaterol/mometasone \n\nfuroate or indacaterol alone. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n19 \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\nInstructions for use of Enerzair Breezhaler inhaler \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Enerzair Breezhaler is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Enerzair Breezhaler is and how it works \n\nEnerzair Breezhaler contains three active substances: \n\n- indacaterol \n- glycopyrronium \n- mometasone furoate \n \n\nIndacaterol and glycopyrronium belong to a group of medicines called bronchodilators. They work in \n\ndifferent ways to relax the muscles of the small airways in the lungs. This helps to open the airways \n\nand makes it easier for air to get in and out of the lungs. When they are taken regularly, they help the \n\nsmall airways to remain open. \n\n \n\nMometasone furoate belongs to a group of medicines called corticosteroids (or steroids). \n\nCorticosteroids reduce the swelling and irritation (inflammation) in the small airways in the lungs and \n\nso gradually ease breathing problems. Corticosteroids also help to prevent attacks of asthma. \n\n \n\nWhat Enerzair Breezhaler is used for \n\nEnerzair Breezhaler is used regularly as treatment for asthma in adults. \n\n \n\nAsthma is a serious, long-term lung disease where the muscles around the smaller airways become \n\ntight (bronchoconstriction) and inflamed. Symptoms come and go and include shortness of breath, \n\nwheezing, chest tightness and cough. \n\n \n\nYou should use Enerzair Breezhaler every day and not only when you have breathing problems or \n\nother symptoms of asthma. This will ensure that it controls your asthma properly. Do not use this \n\nmedicine to relieve a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing. \n\n \n\nIf you have any questions about how Enerzair Breezhaler works or why this medicine has been \n\nprescribed for you, ask your doctor. \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Enerzair Breezhaler \n\n \n\nFollow all the doctor\u2019s instructions carefully. \n\n \n\nDo not use Enerzair Breezhaler \n\n- if you are allergic to indacaterol, glycopyrronium, mometasone furoate, or any of the other \ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

active substances: - indacaterol - glycopyrronium - mometasone furoate indacaterol and glycopyrronium belong to a group of medicines called bronchodilators. they work in different ways to relax the muscles of the small airways in the lungs. this helps to open the airways and makes it easier for air to get in and out of the lungs. when they are taken regularly, they help the small airways to remain open. mometasone furoate belongs to a group of medicines called corticosteroids (or steroids). corticosteroids reduce the swelling and irritation (inflammation) in the small airways in the lungs and so gradually ease breathing problems. corticosteroids also help to prevent attacks of asthma. what enerzair breezhaler is used for enerzair breezhaler is used regularly as treatment for asthma in adults. asthma is a serious, long-term lung disease where the muscles around the smaller airways become tight (bronchoconstriction) and inflamed. symptoms come and go and include shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness and cough. you should use enerzair breezhaler every day and not only when you have breathing problems or other symptoms of asthma. this will ensure that it controls your asthma properly. do not use this medicine to relieve a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing. if you have any questions about how enerzair breezhaler works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, ask your doctor.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "enerzair breezhaler", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 7, "BeginOffset": 101, "EndOffset":
