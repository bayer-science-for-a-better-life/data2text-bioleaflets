NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nPalonosetron Hospira250 micrograms solution for injection.\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach ml of solution contains 50 micrograms palonosetron (as hydrochloride). \nEach vial of 5 ml of solution contains 250 micrograms palonosetron (as hydrochloride). \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection. \nClear, colourless solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nPalonosetron Hospira is indicated in adults for: \n• the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, \n• the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. \n\nPalonosetron Hospira is indicated in paediatric patients 1 month of age and older for: \n• the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy \n\nand prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPalonosetron Hospira should be used only before chemotherapy administration. This medicinal product \nshould be administered by a healthcare professional under appropriate medical supervision. \n\nPosology\n\nAdults \n250 micrograms palonosetron administered as a single intravenous bolus approximately 30 minutes before \nthe start of chemotherapy. Palonosetron Hospira should be injected over 30 seconds. \n\nThe efficacy of Palonosetron Hospira in the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by highly \nemetogenic chemotherapy may be enhanced by the addition of a corticosteroid administered prior to \nchemotherapy. \n\nElderly population \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for the elderly. \n\n\n\n3\n\nPaediatric population \n\nChildren and Adolescents (aged 1 month to 17 years): \n\n20 micrograms/kg (the maximum total dose should not exceed 1500 micrograms) palonosetron administered \nas a single 15 minute intravenous infusion beginning approximately 30 minutes before the start of \nchemotherapy. \n\nThe safety and efficacy of palonosetron in children aged less than 1 month have not been established. No \ndata are available. There are limited data on the use of palonosetron in the prevention of nausea and \nvomiting in children under 2 years of age.\n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with impaired hepatic function.\n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with impaired renal function. \nNo data are available for patients with end stage renal disease undergoing haemodialysis.\n\nMethod of administration \n\nFor intravenous use.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nAs palonosetron may increase large bowel transit time, patients with a history of constipation or signs of \nsubacute intestinal obstruction should be monitored following administration. Two cases of constipation with \nfaecal impaction requiring hospitalisation have been reported in association with palonosetron \n750 micrograms. \n\nAt all dose levels tested, palonosetron did not induce clinically relevant prolongation of the QTc interval. A \nspecific thorough QT/QTc study was conducted in healthy volunteers for definitive data demonstrating the \neffect of palonosetron on QT/QTc (see section 5.1). \n\nHowever, as for other 5-HT3 antagonists, caution should be exercised in the use of palonosetron in patients \nwho have or are likely to develop prolongation of the QT interval. These conditions include patients with a \npersonal or family history of QT prolongation, electrolyte abnormalities, congestive heart failure, \nbradyarrhythmias, conduction disturbances and in patients taking anti-arrhythmic agents or other medicinal \nproducts that lead to QT prolongation or electrolyte abnormalities. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia \nshould be corrected prior to 5-HT3 -antagonist administration. \n\nThere have been reports of serotonin syndrome with the use of 5-HT3 antagonists either alone or in \ncombination with other serotonergic drugs (including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and \nserotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Appropriate observation of patients for serotonin\nsyndrome-like symptoms is advised. \n\nPalonosetron Hospira should not be used to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting in the days following \nchemotherapy if not associated with another chemotherapy administration. \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’.\n\n\n\n4\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPalonosetron is mainly metabolised by CYP2D6, with minor contribution by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 \nisoenzymes. Based on in vitro studies, palonosetron does not inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 isoenzyme \nat clinically relevant concentrations. \n\nChemotherapeutic agents \nIn preclinical studies, palonosetron did not inhibit the antitumour activity of the five chemotherapeutic agents \ntested (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin and mitomycin C). \n\nMetoclopramide \nIn a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction was shown between a single intravenous dose \nof palonosetron and steady state concentration of oral metoclopramide, which is a CYP2D6 inhibitor. \n\nCYP2D6 inducers and inhibitors.\nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis, it has been shown that there was no significant effect on \npalonosetron clearance when co-administered with CYP2D6 inducers (dexamethasone and rifampicin) and \ninhibitors (including amiodarone, celecoxib, chlorpromazine, cimetidine, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, \nhaloperidol, paroxetine, quinidine, ranitidine, ritonavir, sertraline or terbinafine). \n\nCorticosteroids \nPalonosetron has been administered safely with corticosteroids. \n\nSerotonergic Drugs (e.g. SSRIs and SNRIs) \nThere have been reports of serotonin syndrome following concomitant use of 5-HT3 antagonists and other \nserotonergic drugs (including SSRIs and SNRIs). \n\nOther medicinal products \nPalonosetron has been administered safely with analgesics, antiemetic/antinauseants, antispasmodics and \nanticholinergic medicinal products.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nFor palonosetron no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies do not indicate direct \nor indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal \ndevelopment. Only limited data from animal studies are available regarding the placental transfer (see \nsection 5.3). \n\nThere is no experience of palonosetron in human pregnancy. Therefore, palonosetron should not be used in \npregnant women unless it is considered essential by the physician. \n\nBreast-feeding \nAs there are no data concerning palonosetron excretion in breast milk, breast-feeding should be discontinued \nduring therapy. \n\nFertility \nThere are no data concerning the effect of palonosetron on fertility.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \nSince palonosetron may induce dizziness, somnolence or fatigue, patients should be cautioned when driving \nor operating machines.\n\n\n\n5\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nIn clinical studies in adults at a dose of 250 micrograms (total 633 patients) the most frequently observed \nadverse reactions, at least possibly related to palonosetron, were headache (9 %) and constipation (5 %). \n\nIn clinical studies the following adverse reactions (ARs) were observed as possibly or probably related to \npalonosetron. These were classified as common (≥1/100 to <1/10) or uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100). Very \nrare (<1/10,000) adverse reactions were reported post-marketing. \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented below in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nSystem organ class Common ARs \n(≥1/100 to<1/10) \n\nUncommon ARs \n(≥1/1,000 to <1/100) \n\nVery rare ARs°\n(<1/10,000)\n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity, \nanaphylaxis, anaphylactic/ \nanaphylactoid reactions and \nshock\n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nHyperkalaemia, metabolic \ndisorders, hypocalcaemia, \nhypokalaemia, anorexia, \nhyperglycaemia, appetite \ndecreased \n\nPsychiatric disorders Anxiety, euphoric mood \n\nNervous system disorders Headache \nDizziness \n\nSomnolence, insomnia, \nparaesthesia, hypersomnia, \nperipheral sensory \nneuropathy \n\nEye disorders Eye irritation, amblyopia \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders Motion sickness, tinnitus \n\nCardiac disorders Tachycardia, bradycardia, \nextrasystoles, myocardial \nischaemia, sinus tachycardia, \nsinus arrhythmia, \nsupraventricular extrasystoles \n\nVascular disorders Hypotension, hypertension, \nvein discolouration, vein \ndistended \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nHiccups \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Constipation \nDiarrhoea \n\nDyspepsia, abdominal pain, \nabdominal pain upper, dry \nmouth, flatulence \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Hyperbilirubinaemia \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nDermatitis allergic, pruritic \nrash \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nArthralgia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Urinary retention, glycosuria \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nAsthenia, pyrexia, fatigue, \nfeeling hot, influenza like \nillness \n\nInjection site reaction* \n\n\n\n6\n\nInvestigations Elevated transaminases-, \nelectrocardiogram QT \nprolonged \n\n° From post-marketing experience \n* Includes the following: burning, induration, discomfort and pain \n\nPaediatric population\n\nIn paediatric clinical trials for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by moderately or highly \nemetogenic chemotherapy, 402 patients received a single dose of palonosetron (3, 10 or 20 mcg/kg). The \nfollowing common or uncommon adverse reactions were reported for palonosetron, none were reported at a \nfrequency of >1%.\n\nSystem organ class Common ARs \n(≥1/100 to<1/10) \n\nUncommon ARs \n(≥1/1,000 to <1/100) \n\nNervous system disorders Headache Dizziness, dyskinesia\nCardiac disorders Electrocardiogram QT \n\nprolonged conduction disorder, \nsinus tachycardia \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nCough, dyspnoea, epistaxis \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nDermatitis allergic, pruritus, \nskin disorder, urticaria \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\nPyrexia, infusion site pain, \ninfusion site reaction, pain \n\nAdverse reactions were evaluated in paediatric patients receiving palonosetron for up to 4 chemotherapy \ncycles.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo case of overdose has been reported. \nDoses of up to 6 mg have been used in adult clinical studies. The highest dose group showed a similar \nincidence of adverse reactions compared to the other dose groups and no dose response effects were \nobserved. In the unlikely event of overdose with Palonosetron Hospira, this should be managed with \nsupportive care. Dialysis studies have not been performed, however, due to the large volume of distribution, \ndialysis is unlikely to be an effective treatment for Palonosetron Hospira overdose.\n\nPaediatric population\nNo case of overdose has been reported in paediatric clinical studies.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiemetics and antinauseants, serotonin (5HT3) antagonists, ATC code: \nA04AA05 \n\nPalonosetron is a selective high-affinity receptor antagonist of the 5HT3 receptor. \n\n\n\n7\n\nIn two randomised, double-blind studies with a total of 1,132 patients receiving moderately emetogenic \nchemotherapy that included cisplatin ≤50 mg/m2, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide ≤1,500 mg/m2 and \ndoxorubicin >25 mg/m2, palonosetron 250 micrograms and 750 micrograms were compared with \nondansetron 32 mg (half-life 4 hours) or dolasetron 100 mg (half-life 7.3 hours) administered intravenously \non Day 1, without dexamethasone. \n\nIn a randomised, double-blind study with a total of 667 patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy \nthat included cisplatin ≥60 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide >1,500 mg/m2 and dacarbazine, palonosetron \n250 micrograms and 750 micrograms were compared with ondansetron 32 mg administered intravenously on \nDay 1. Dexamethasone was administered prophylactically before chemotherapy in 67 % of patients. \n\nThe pivotal studies were not designed to assess efficacy of palonosetron in delayed onset nausea and \nvomiting. The antiemetic activity was observed during 0-24 hours, 24-120 hours and 0-120 hours. Results \nfor the studies on moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and for the study on highly emetogenic \nchemotherapy are summarised in the following tables. \n\nPalonosetron was non-inferior versus the comparators in the acute phase of emesis both in moderately and \nhighly emetogenic setting. \n\nAlthough comparative efficacy of palonosetron in multiple cycles has not been demonstrated in controlled \nclinical studies, 875 patients enrolled in the three phase 3 trials continued in an open label safety study and \nwere treated with palonosetron 750 micrograms for up to 9 additional cycles of chemotherapy.

Significance level at α=0.05.\n\nThe effect of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including QTc were \ncomparable to ondansetron and dolasetron in CINV clinical studies. In non-clinical studies palonosetron \n\n\n\n9\n\npossesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarisation and to prolong \naction potential duration.\n\nThe effect of palonosetron on QTc interval was evaluated in a double blind, randomised, parallel, placebo \nand positive (moxifloxacin) controlled trial in adult men and women. The objective was to evaluate the ECG \neffects of IV administered palonosetron at single doses of 0.25, 0.75 or 2.25 mg in 221 healthy subjects. The \nstudy demonstrated no effect on QT/QTc interval duration as well as any other ECG interval at doses up to \n2.25 mg. No clinically significant changes were shown on heart rate, atrioventricular (AV) conduction and \ncardiac repolarisation. \n\nPaediatric population \n\nPrevention of Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV): \n\nThe safety and efficacy of palonosetron intravenously at single doses of 3 μg/kg and 10 μg/kg was \ninvestigated in the first clinical study in 72 patients in the following age groups, >28 days to 23 months (12\npatients), 2 to 11 years (31 patients), and 12 to 17 years of age (29 patients), receiving highly or moderately \nemetogenic chemotherapy. No safety concerns were raised at either dose level. The primary efficacy variable \nwas the proportion of patients with a complete response (CR, defined as no emetic episode and no rescue \nmedication) during the first 24 hours after the start of chemotherapy administration. Efficacy after \npalonosetron 10 μg/kg compared to palonosetron 3 μg/kg was 54.1% and 37.1% respectively. \n\nThe efficacy of palonosetron for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in paediatric \ncancer patients was demonstrated in a second non-inferiority pivotal trial comparing a single intravenous \ninfusion of palonosetron versus an intravenous ondansetron regimen. A total of 493 paediatric patients, aged \n64 days to 16.9 years, receiving moderately (69.2%) or highly emetogenic chemotherapy (30.8%) were \ntreated with palonosetron 10 μg/kg (maximum 0.75 mg), palonosetron 20 μg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) or \nondansetron (3 x 0.15 mg/kg , maximum total dose 32 mg) 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic \nchemotherapy during Cycle 1. Most patients were non-naïve to chemotherapy (78.5%) across all treatment \ngroups. Emetogenic chemotherapies administered included doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (<1500 mg/m2), \nifosfamide, cisplatin, dactinomycin, carboplatin, and daunorubicin. Adjuvant corticosteroids, including \ndexamethasone, were administered with chemotherapy in 55% of patients. The primary efficacy endpoint \nwas Complete Response in the acute phase of the first cycle of chemotherapy, defined as no vomiting, no \nretching, and no rescue medication in the first 24 hours after starting chemotherapy. Efficacy was based on \ndemonstrating non-inferiority of intravenous palonosetron compared to intravenous ondansetron. Non-\ninferiority criteria were met if the lower bound of the 97.5% confidence interval for the difference in \nComplete Response rates of intravenous palonosetron minus intravenous ondansetron was larger than -15%. \nIn the palonosetron 10 μg/kg, 20 μg/kg and ondansetron groups, the proportion of patients with CR0-24h was \n54.2%, 59.4% and 58.6%. Since the 97.5% confidence interval (stratum adjusted Mantel-Haenszel test) of \nthe difference in CR0-24h between palonosetron 20 μg/kg and ondansetron was [-11.7%, 12.4%], the 20 μg/kg \npalonosetron dose demonstrated non-inferiority to ondansetron. \n\nWhile this study demonstrated that paediatric patients require a higher palonosetron dose than adults to \nprevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, the safety profile is consistent with the established \nprofile in adults (see section 4.8). Pharmacokinetic information is provided in section 5.2. \n\nPrevention of Post Operative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV): \n\nTwo paediatric trials were performed. The safety and efficacy of palonosetron intravenously at single doses \nof 1 μg/kg and 3 μg/kg was compared in the first clinical study in 150 patients in the following age groups, \n>28 days to 23 months (7 patients), 2 to 11 years (96 patients), and 12 to 16 years of age (47 patients) \nundergoing elective surgery. No safety concerns were raised in either treatment group. The proportion of \npatients without emesis during 0-72 hours post-operatively was similar after palonosetron 1 μg/kg or 3 μg/kg \n(88% vs 84%). \n\nThe second paediatric trial was a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, parallel group, \nactive control, single-dose non-inferiority study, comparing intravenous palonosetron (1 μg/kg, max \n\n\n\n10\n\n0.075 mg) versus intravenous ondansetron. A total of 670 paediatric surgical patients participated, age \n30 days to 16.9 years. The primary efficacy endpoint, Complete Response (CR: no vomiting, no retching, \nand no antiemetic rescue medication) during the first 24 hours postoperatively was achieved in 78.2% of \npatients in the palonosetron group and 82.7% in the ondansetron group. Given the pre-specified non-\ninferiority margin of -10%, the stratum adjusted Mantel-Haenszel statistical non-inferiority confidence \ninterval for the difference in the primary endpoint, complete response (CR), was [-10.5, 1.7%], therefore \nnon-inferiority was not demonstrated. No new safety concerns were raised in either treatment group. \n\nPlease see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption \nFollowing intravenous administration, an initial decline in plasma concentrations is followed by slow \nelimination from the body with a mean terminal elimination half-life of approximately 40 hours. Mean \nmaximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) are generally \ndose-proportional over the dose range of 0.3–90 μg/kg in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. \n\nFollowing intravenous administration of palonosetron 0.25 mg once every other day for 3 doses in \n11 testicular cancer patients, the mean (± SD) increase in plasma concentration from Day 1 to Day 5 was 42 \n± 34 %. After intravenous administration of palonosetron 0.25 mg once daily for 3 days in 12 healthy \nsubjects, the mean (± SD) increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 3 was 110 ± 45 \n%. \n\nPharmacokinetic simulations indicate that the overall exposure (AUC0-∞) of 0.25 mg intravenous \npalonosetron administered once daily for 3 consecutive days was similar to a single intravenous dose of \n0.75 mg, although Cmax of the 0.75 mg single dose was higher. \n\nDistribution \nPalonosetron at the recommended dose is widely distributed in the body with a volume of distribution of \napproximately 6.9 to 7.9 l/kg. Approximately 62 % of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins.\n\nBiotransformation \nPalonosetron is eliminated by dual route, about 40 % eliminated through the kidney and with approximately \n50 % metabolised to form two primary metabolites, which have less than 1 % of the 5HT3 receptor \nantagonist activity of palonosetron. In vitro metabolism studies have shown that CYP2D6 and to a lesser \nextent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 isoenzymes are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. However, \nclinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolisers \nof CYP2D6 substrates. Palonosetron does not inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at clinically \nrelevant concentrations. \n\nElimination \nAfter a single intravenous dose of 10 micrograms/kg [14C]-palonosetron, approximately 80 % of the dose \nwas recovered within 144 hours in the urine with palonosetron representing approximately 40 % of the \nadministered dose, as unchanged active substance. After a single intravenous bolus administration in healthy \nsubjects the total body clearance of palonosetron was 173 ± 73 ml/min and renal clearance was 53 ± \n29 ml/min. The low total body clearance and large volume of distribution resulted in a terminal elimination \nhalf-life in plasma of approximately 40 hours. Ten percent of patients have a mean terminal elimination half-\nlife greater than 100 hours.\n\nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n\nElderly population\nAge does not affect the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron. No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly \npatients. \n\n\n\n11\n\nGender \nGender does not affect the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron. No dosage adjustment is necessary based on \ngender. \n\nPaediatric population \nSingle-dose intravenous palonosetron pharmacokinetic data was obtained from a subset of paediatric cancer \npatients (n=280) that received 10 μg/kg or 20 μg/kg. When the dose was increased from 10 μg/kg to 20 μg/kg \na dose-proportional increase in mean AUC was observed. Following single dose intravenous infusion of \nPalonosetron 20 μg/kg, peak plasma concentrations (CT) reported at the end of the 15 minute infusion were \nhighly variable in all age groups and tended to be lower in patients < 6 years than in older paediatric patients. \nMedian half-life was 29.5 hours in overall age groups and ranged from about 20 to 30 hours across age \ngroups after administration of 20 μg/kg. \n\nThe total body clearance (L/h/kg) in patients 12 to 17 years old was similar to that in healthy adults. There \nare no apparent differences in volume of distribution when expressed as L/kg. \n\nTable 4: Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Paediatric Cancer Patients following intravenous infusion of \npalonosetron at 20 μg/kg over 15 min and in Adult Cancer Patients receiving 3 and 10 μg/kg \npalonosetron doses via intravenous bolus.\n\nPaediatric Cancer Patientsa Adults Cancer \nPatientsb\n\n<2 y 2 to <6 y 6 to <12 y 12 to \n<17 y\n\n3.0 \nμg/kg\n\n10 μg/kg\n\nN=3 N=5 N=7 N=10 N=6 N=5\n\nAUC0-∞, h·μg/L 69.0 \n(49.5)\n\n103.5 \n(40.4)\n\n98.7 \n(47.7)\n\n124.5 \n(19.1)\n\n35.8 \n(20.9)\n\n81.8 \n(23.9)\n\nt½, hours 24.0 28 23.3 30.5 56.4 \n(5.81)\n\n49.8 \n(14.4)\n\nN=6 N=14 N=13 N=19 N=6 N=5\n\nClearance c, L/h/kg 0.31 \n(34.7)\n\n0.23 \n(51.3)\n\n0.19 \n(46.8)\n\n0.16 \n(27.8)\n\n0.10 \n(0.04)\n\n0.13 \n(0.05)\n\nVolume of distribution c, d,\n\nL/kg\n6.08 \n\n(36.5)\n5.29 \n\n(57.8)\n6.26 \n\n(40.0)\n6.20 \n\n(29.0)\n7.91 \n\n(2.53)\n9.56 \n\n(4.21)\n\na PK parameters expressed as Geometric Mean (CV) except for T½ which is median. \nb PK parameters expressed as Arithmetic mean (SD) \nc Clearance and Volume of distribution in paediatric patients were calculated weight-adjusted from both 10 \nμg /kg and 20 μg /kg dose groups combined. In adults, different dose levels are indicated in column title. \nd Vss is reported for paediatric cancer patients, whereas Vz is reported for adult cancer patients.\n\nRenal impairment \nMild to moderate renal impairment does not significantly affect palonosetron pharmacokinetic parameters. \nSevere renal impairment reduces renal clearance, however total body clearance in these patients is similar to \nhealthy subjects. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency. No pharmacokinetic \ndata in haemodialysis patients are available. \n\n\n\n12\n\nHepatic impairment \nHepatic impairment does not significantly affect total body clearance of palonosetron compared to the \nhealthy subjects. While the terminal elimination half-life and mean systemic exposure of palonosetron is \nincreased in the subjects with severe hepatic impairment, this does not warrant dose reduction.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nEffects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the \nmaximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. \n\nNon-clinical studies indicate that palonosetron, only at very high concentrations, may block ion channels \ninvolved in ventricular de- and re-polarisation and prolong action potential duration.\n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal\ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. Only limited data from animal studies are available \nregarding the placental transfer (see section 4.6). \n\nPalonosetron is not mutagenic. High doses of palonosetron (each dose causing at least 30 times the human \ntherapeutic exposure) applied daily for two years caused an increased rate of liver tumours, endocrine \nneoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal medulla) and skin tumours in rats but not in mice. The \nunderlying mechanisms are not fully understood, but because of the high doses employed and since \nPalonosetron Hospira is intended for single application in humans, these findings are not considered relevant \nfor clinical use.\n\n6.
