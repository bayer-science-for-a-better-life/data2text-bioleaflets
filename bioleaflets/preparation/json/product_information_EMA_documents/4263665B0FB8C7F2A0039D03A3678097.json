NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nOnsenal 200 mg hard capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach capsule contains 200 mg of celecoxib.  \nExcipients: Lactose Monohydrate 49.8 mg For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule. \nWhite, opaque capsules with two gold bands marked 7767 and 200. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nOnsenal is indicated for the reduction of the number of adenomatous intestinal polyps in familial \nadenomatous polyposis (FAP), as an adjunct to surgery and further endoscopic surveillance (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThe effect of Onsenal-induced reduction of polyp burden on the risk of intestinal cancer has not been \ndemonstrated (see sections 4.4 and 5.1) \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe recommended oral dose is two 200 mg capsules twice per day, taken with food (see section 5.2). \n \nUsual medical care for FAP patients should be continued while on celecoxib. The maximum \nrecommended daily dose is 800 mg. \n \nHepatic impairment: In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (serum albumin of 25-35 g/l), the \ndaily recommended dose of celecoxib should be reduced by 50% (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). Caution \nshould be used as there is no experience in such patients at doses higher than 200 mg. \n \nRenal impairment: Experience with celecoxib in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is \nlimited, therefore such patients should be treated with caution (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric patients: Experience with celecoxib in FAP patients below the age of 18 years is limited to \na single pilot study in a very small population, in which patients were treated with celecoxib at doses \nup to 16 mg/kg daily, which corresponds to the recommended adult FAP dose of 800 mg daily (see \nsection 5.1).   \n \nCYP2C9 Poor Metabolizers:  Patients who are known or suspected to be CYP2C9 poor \nmetabolizers based on genotyping or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 \nsubstrates should be administered celecoxib with caution, as the risk of dose-dependent adverse \neffects is increased.  \nPatients with the CYP2C9*3 allele, and, in particular those with  CYP2C9*3*3 homozygous \ngenotype, may be exposed to celecoxib levels that are higher than those for which safety has \nbeen studied in clinical trials. Therefore, the risk for high celecoxib exposure in poor \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nmetabolizers should be considered carefully when treating FAP patients. Consider starting \ntreatment at a reduced dose (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly: The dose for elderly FAP patients has not been established. Special care should be used in \nsuch patients (see section 5.2).  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1). \n• Known hypersensitivity to sulphonamides. \n• Active peptic ulceration or gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. \n• Patients who have experienced asthma, acute rhinitis, nasal polyps, angioneurotic oedema, \n\nurticaria or other allergic-type reactions after taking acetylsalicylic acid or non steroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including COX-2 (cyclooxigenase-2) selective inhibitors. \n\n• In pregnancy and in women who can become pregnant unless using an effective method of \ncontraception (see sections 4.5, 4.6 and 5.3)  \n\n• Breast feeding (see sections 4.6 and 5.3) \n• Severe hepatic dysfunction (serum albumin <25 g/l or Child-Pugh score >10) (Class C). \n• Patients with renal insufficiency with estimated creatinine clearance <30 ml/ min. \n• Inflammatory bowel disease. \n• Congestive heart failure (NYHA II-IV). \n• Established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease and/or cerebrovascular disease \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTreatment with celecoxib in FAP has been studied for up to 6 months and has not been shown to \nreduce the risk of gastrointestinal or other form of cancer or the need for surgery. Therefore, the usual \ncare of FAP patients should not be altered because of the concurrent administration of celecoxib. In \nparticular, the frequency of routine endoscopic surveillance should not be decreased and FAP-related \nsurgery should not be delayed. \n \nGastro-intestinal disorder \nUpper gastrointestinal complications [perforations, ulcers or bleeds (PUBs)], some of them resulting in \nfatal outcome, have occurred in patients treated with celecoxib.  Caution is advised with treatment of \npatients most at risk of developing a gastrointestinal complication with NSAIDs: the elderly, patients \nusing any other NSAID or acetylsalicylic acid concomitantly or patients with a prior history of \ngastrointestinal disease, such as ulceration and GI bleeding. \n \nThere is further increase in the risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects (gastrointestinal ulceration or \nother gastrointestinal complications) when celecoxib is taken concomitantly with acetylsalicylic acid \n(even at low doses). A significant difference in GI safety between selective COX-2 inhibitors + \nacetylsalicylic acid vs. NSAIDs + acetylsalicylic acid has not been demonstrated in long-term clinical \ntrials (see 5.1).The concomitant use of celecoxib and a non-aspirin NSAID should be avoided. \n \nFAP patients carrying an ileorectal anastomosis or ileo pouch-anal anastomosis can develop \nanastomotic ulcerations. If an anastomotic ulcer is present, patients should not receive concomitant \ntreatment with anticoagulants or acetyl salicylic acid. \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorder / Cardio-vascular disorder \nIncreased number of serious cardiovascular events, mainly myocardial infarction, has been found in a \nlong-term placebo-controlled study in subjects with sporadic adenomatous polyps treated with \ncelecoxib at doses of 200 mg BID and 400 mg BID compared to placebo (see section 5.1).  \n \nAs the cardiovascular risks of celecoxib were increased with the 400 mg twice daily dose in the APC \ntrial (section 5.1), the response of the FAP patient to celecoxib should be re-examined periodically in \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\norder to avoid unnecessary exposure in FAP patients for whom celecoxib is not effective (sections 4.2, \n4.3, 4.8 and 5.1) \n \nPatients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, \ndiabetes mellitus, smoking) should only be treated with celecoxib after careful consideration (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nCOX-2 selective inhibitors are not a substitute for acetylsalicylic acid for prophylaxis of \ncardiovascular thrombo-embolic diseases because of their lack of antiplatelet effect. Therefore, \nantiplatelet therapies should not be discontinued (see section 5.1). \n \nAs with other medicinal products known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, fluid retention and oedema \nhave been observed in patients taking celecoxib. Therefore, celecoxib should be used with caution in \npatients with history of cardiac failure, left ventricular dysfunction or hypertension, and in patients \nwith pre-existing oedema from any other reason, since prostaglandin inhibition may result in \ndeterioration of renal function and fluid retention. Caution is also required in patients taking diuretic \ntreatment or otherwise at risk of hypovolaemia. \n \nAs with all NSAIDS, celecoxib can lead to the onset of new hypertension or worsening of pre-existing \nhypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of cardiovascular events. \nTherefore, blood pressure should be monitored closely during the initiation of therapy with celecoxib \nand throughout the course of therapy.   \n \nIn the event of elderly patients with mild to moderate cardiac dysfunction requiring therapy, special \ncare and follow up is warranted.  Compromised renal or hepatic function and especially cardiac \ndysfunction are more likely in the elderly and therefore medically appropriate supervision should be \nmaintained. \n \nRenal and hepatic disorders \nNSAIDs, including celecoxib, may cause renal toxicity. Clinical trials with celecoxib have shown \nrenal effects similar to those observed with comparator NSAIDs. Patients at greatest risk for renal \ntoxicity are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, and the elderly. Such \npatients should be carefully monitored while receiving treatment with celecoxib.  \nExperience with celecoxib in patients with mild or moderate renal or hepatic impairment is limited, \ntherefore such patients should be treated with caution (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nIf during treatment, patients deteriorate in any of the organ system functions described above, \nappropriate measures should be taken and discontinuation of celecoxib therapy should be considered. \n \nSkin Reactions \nSerious skin reactions, some of them fatal, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, have been reported very rarely in association with the use \nof celecoxib (see section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the \ncourse of therapy; the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first month of \ntreatment. Serious hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis and angioedema) have been reported in \npatients receiving celecoxib (see section 4.8). Patients with a history of sulphonamide allergy or any \ndrug allergy may be at greater risk of serious skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (see section \n4.3). Celecoxib should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash, mucosal lesions, or any \nother sign of hypersensitivity. \n \nOther \nPatients known to be CYP2C9 poor metabolisers should be treated with caution (see section 5.2). \n \nCelecoxib may mask fever and other signs of inflammation. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nIn patients on concurrent therapy with warfarin, serious bleeding events have been reported. Caution \nshould be exercised when combining celecoxib with warfarin and other oral anticoagulants (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nOnsenal 200 mg capsules contain lactose (49.8 mg). Patients with rare hereditary problems of \ngalactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take \nthis medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPharmacodynamic interactions \nThe majority of the interaction studies have been performed with celecoxib doses of 200 mg BID (i.e. \nthose used for osteoarthritis/rheumatoid arthritis). A more pronounced effect at 400 mg BID therefore \ncannot be excluded. \n \nAnticoagulant activity should be monitored in patients taking warfarin or other anticoagulants, \nparticularly in the first few days after initiating or changing the dose of celecoxib, since these patients \nhave an increased risk of bleeding complications. Therefore, patients receiving oral anticoagulants \nshould be closely monitored for their prothrombin time INR. Bleeding events in association with \nincreases in prothrombin time have been reported in arthritis patients (mainly elderly) receiving \ncelecoxib concurrently with warfarin, some of them fatal (see section 4.4). \n \nNSAIDs may reduce the effect of diuretics and antihypertensive medicinal products. As for NSAIDs, \nthe risk of acute renal insufficiency, which is usually reversible, may be increased in some patients \nwith compromised renal function (e.g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients) when ACE inhibitors or \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists are combined with NSAIDs, including celecoxib. Therefore, the \ncombination should be administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be \nadequately hydrated and consideration should be given to monitoring of renal function after initiation \nof concomitant therapy, and periodically thereafter. \n \nIn a 28-day clinical study in patients with lisinopril-controlled Stage I and II hypertension, \nadministration of celecoxib 200 mg BID resulted in no clinically significant increases, when compared \nto placebo treatment, in mean daily systolic or diastolic blood pressure as determined using 24-hour \nambulatory blood pressure monitoring.  Among patients treated with celecoxib 200 mg BID, \n48% were considered unresponsive to lisinopril at the final clinic visit (defined as either cuff diastolic \nblood pressure >90 mmHg or cuff diastolic blood pressure increased >10% compared to baseline), \ncompared to 27% of patients treated with placebo; this difference was statistically significant. \n \nCo-administration of NSAIDs and ciclosporin D derivatives or tacrolimus have been suggested to \nincrease the nephrotoxic effect of cyclosporin and tacrolimus. Renal function should be monitored \nwhen celecoxib and any of these medicinal products are combined. \n \nCelecoxib can be used with low dose acetylsalicylic acid, however it cannot be considered a substitute \nfor acetylsalicylic acid for cardiovascular prophylaxis. As with other NSAIDs, an increased risk of \ngastrointestinal ulceration or other gastrointestinal complications compared to use of celecoxib alone \nwas shown for concomitant administration of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (see section 5.1). \n\n \nPharmacokinetic interactions \n \nEffects of celecoxib on other medicinal products \nCelecoxib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. During celecoxib treatment, the mean plasma \nconcentrations of the CYP2D6 substrate dextromethorphan were increased by 136%. The plasma \nconcentrations of medicinal products that are substrates of this enzyme may be increased when \ncelecoxib is used concomitantly. Examples of medicines which are metabolised by CYP2D6 are \nantidepressants (tricyclics and SSRIs), neuroleptics, anti-arrhythmics, etc. The dose of individually \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\ndose-titrated CYP2D6 substrates may need to be reduced when treatment with celecoxib is initiated or \nincreased if treatment with celecoxib is terminated. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown some potential for celecoxib to inhibit CYP2C19 catalysed metabolism. \nThe clinical significance of this in vitro finding is unknown. Examples of medicinal products which \nare metabolised by CYP2C19 are diazepam, citalopram and imipramine. \n \nIn an interaction study, celecoxib had no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of oral \ncontraceptives (1 mg norethistherone /35 microg ethinylestradiol). \n \nCelecoxib does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide (CYP2C9 substrate), or glibenclamide \nto a clinically relevant extent. \n \nIn patients with rheumatoid arthritis celecoxib had no statistically significant effect on the \npharmacokinetics (plasma or renal clearance) of methotrexate (in rheumatologic doses). However, \nadequate monitoring for methotrexate-related toxicity should be considered when combining these two \ndrugs. \n \nIn healthy subjects, co-administration of celecoxib 200 mg twice daily with 450 mg twice daily of \nlithium resulted in a mean increase in Cmax of 16% and in AUC of 18% of lithium. Therefore, patients \non lithium treatment should be closely monitored when celecoxib is introduced or withdrawn. \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on celecoxib \n \nIn individuals who are CYP2C9 poor metabolisers and demonstrate increased systemic exposure to \ncelecoxib, concomitant treatment with CYP2C9 inhibitors (eg. fluconazole, amiodarone) could result \nin further increases in celecoxib exposure. Such combinations should be avoided in known CYP2C9 \npoor metabolisers (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nSince celecoxib is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C9 it should be used at half the recommended \ndose in patients receiving fluconazole. Concomitant use of 200 mg single dose of celecoxib and 200 \nmg once daily of fluconazole, a potent CYP2C9 inhibitor, resulted in a mean increase in celecoxib \nCmax of 60% and in AUC of 130% (analogous studies have not been performed with amiodarone or \nother known CYP2C9 inhibitors). Concomitant use of inducers of CYP2C9 such as rifampicin, \ncarbamazepine and barbiturates may reduce plasma concentrations of celecoxib. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor celecoxib no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Studies in animals (rats and \nrabbits) have shown reproductive toxicity (see sections 4.3 and 5.3). The potential risk for humans is \nunknown. Celecoxib, as with other medicinal products inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, may cause \nuterine inertia and premature closure of the ductus arteriosus during the last trimester. Celecoxib is \ncontraindicated in pregnancy and in women who can become pregnant unless using an effective \nmethod of contraception (see section 4.3). If a woman becomes pregnant during treatment, celecoxib \nshould be discontinued. \n \nCelecoxib is excreted in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations similar to those in plasma. \nAdministration of celecoxib to a limited number of lactating women has shown a very low transfer of \ncelecoxib into breast milk. Women who take celecoxib should not breastfeed. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \npatients who experience dizziness, vertigo or somnolence while taking celecoxib should refrain from \ndriving or operating machinery. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nAdverse reactions are listed by system organ class and ranked by frequency in Table 1, reflecting data \nfrom the following sources: \n- Adverse reactions reported in osteoarthritis patients and rheumatoid arthritis patients at incidence \n\nrates greater than 0.01% and greater than those reported for placebo during 12 placebo- and/or \nactive-controlled clinical trials of duration up to 12 weeks at celecoxib daily doses from 100 mg up \nto 800 mg.  In additional studies using non-selective NSAID comparators, approximately \n7400 arthritis patients have been treated with celecoxib at daily doses up to 800 mg, including \napproximately 2300 patients treated for 1 year or longer.  The adverse reactions observed with \ncelecoxib in these additional studies were consistent with those for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid \narthritis patients listed in Table 1. \n\n \n- Adverse drug reactions from post-marketing surveillance as spontaneously reported during a period \n\nin which an estimated >70 million patients were treated with celecoxib (various doses, durations, \nand indications).  Because not all adverse drug reactions are reported to the MAH and included in \nthe safety database, the frequencies of these reactions cannot be reliably determined. \n\n \n\nTABLE 1 Common (≥1/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon \n\n(≥1/1000 to <1/100) \nRare \n\n(≥1/10,000 to \n<1/1000) \n\nFrequency Not \nKnown \n\n(Post-marketing \nexperience)1 \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nSinusitis, upper \nrespiratory tract \ninfection, urinary \ntract infection \n\n   \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n Anemia Leucopenia, \nthrombocytopenia \n\nPancytopenia \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\nAllergy \naggravated \n\n  Serious allergic \nreactions, \nanaphylactic \nshock, \nanaphylaxis \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\nInsomnia Anxiety, depression, \ntiredness \n\nConfusion Hallucinations \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \n\n Hyperkaelemia  \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nDizziness, \nhypertonia \n\nParaesthesia, \nsomnolence \n\nAtaxia, taste \nalteration \n\nHeadache, \naggravated \nepilepsy, \nmeningitis \naseptic, ageusia , \nanosmia, fatal \nintracranial \nhaemorrhage \n\nEye disorders  Blurred vision  Conjunctivitis, \nocular \nhaemorrhage, \nretinal artery or \nvein occlusion \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n Tinnitus  Decreased \nhearing \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n Heart failure, \npalpitations, \ntachycardia \n\nMyocardial \ninfarction2 \n\nArrhythmia \n\nVascular \ndisorders  \n\n Hypertension, \nhypertension aggravated\n\n Flushing, \nvasculitis, \npulmonary \nembolism \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic, \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nPharyngitis, \nrhinitis, cough \n\nDyspnoea  Bronchospasm \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nAbdominal pain, \ndiarrhoea, \ndyspepsia, \nflatulence \n\nConstipation, \neructation, gastritis, \nstomatitis, vomiting, \naggravation of \ngastrointestinal \ninflammation \n\nDuodenal, gastric, \noesophageal, \nintestinal, and \ncolonic ulceration; \ndysphagia, \nintestinal \nperforation; \noesophagitis, \nmelaena; \npancreatitis \n\nNausea, acute \npancreatitis, \ngastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage, \ncolitis/colitis \naggravated \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n Abnormal hepatic \nfunction, increased \nSGOT and SGPT  \n\nElevation of \nhepatic enzymes \n\nHepatitis, \nhepatic failure \njaundice \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nRash, pruritus Urticaria Alopecia, \nphotosensitivity \n\nEcchymosis, \nbullous eruption, \nexfoliative \ndermatitis, \nerythema \nmultiforme, \nStevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, toxic \nepidermal \nnecrolysis, \nangioedema \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n Leg cramps  Arthralgia, \nmyositis \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n Increased creatinine, \nBUN increased \n\n Acute renal \nfailure, \ninterstitial \nnephritis, \nhyponatraemia \n\nReproductive \nsystem \nand breast \ndisorders \n\n   Menstrual \ndisorder \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nFlu-like \nsymptoms, \nperipheral oedema/ \nfluid retention \n\n  Chest pain \n\n 1  Adverse drug reactions spontaneously reported to the safety surveillance database over a period in which an \nestimated >70 million patients were treated with celecoxib (various doses, durations, and indications).

Single doses up to 1200 mg and multiple \ndoses up to 1200 mg twice daily have been administered to healthy subjects for nine days without \nclinically significant adverse events. In the event of suspected overdose, appropriate supportive \nmedical care should be provided e.g. by eliminating the gastric contents, clinical supervision and, if \nnecessary, the institution of symptomatic treatment. Dialysis is unlikely to be an efficient method of \nmedicinal product removal due to high protein binding. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic, ATC code: L01XX33 \n \nCelecoxib is a diaryl-substituted pyrazole, chemically similar to other non-arylamine sulfonamides \n(e.g. thiazides, furosemide) but differing from arylamine sulfonamides (e.g. sulfamethoxizole and \nother sulfonamide antibiotics). \n \nCelecoxib is an oral, selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor. No statistically significant \ninhibition of COX-1 (assessed as ex vivo inhibition of thromboxane B2 [TxB2] formation) was \nobserved in healthy volunteers at the FAP therapeutic dose of 400 mg BID. \n \nCyclooxygenase is responsible for generation of prostaglandins. Two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2, \nhave been identified. COX-2 is the isoform of the enzyme that has been shown to be induced by pro-\ninflammatory stimuli and has been postulated to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of \nprostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation and fever. Elevated levels of COX-2 are found in many \npre-malignant lesions (such as adenomatous colorectal polyps) and epithelial cancers. Familial \nAdenomatous Polyposis (FAP) is a genetic disease resulting from an autosomal dominant genetic \nalteration of a tumor suppressor gene, the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Polyps with the \nAPC mutation overexpress COX-2 and left untreated, these polyps continue to form and enlarge in the \ncolon or rectum resulting in essentially a 100% chance of developing colorectal cancer. COX-2 is also \ninvolved in ovulation, implantation and closure of the ductus arteriosus, regulation of renal function, \nand central nervous system functions (fever induction, pain perception and cognitive function). It may \nalso play a role in ulcer healing. COX-2 has been identified in tissue around gastric ulcers in man but \nits relevance to ulcer healing has not been established. \n \nThe difference in antiplatelet activity between some COX-1 inhibiting NSAIDs and COX-2 selective \ninhibitors may be of clinical significance in patients at risk of thrombo-embolic reactions. COX-2 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n\ninhibitors reduce the formation of systemic (and therefore possibly endothelial) prostacyclin without \naffecting platelet thromboxane. \n \nA dose-dependent effect on TxB2 formation has been observed after high doses of celecoxib. \nHowever, in small multiple dose studies in healthy subjects with 600 mg BID celecoxib had no effect \non platelet aggregation and bleeding time compared to placebo. \n \nExperimental evidence shows that the mechanism(s) of action by which celecoxib leads to tumour \ndeath may be related to induction of apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis. Inhibition of COX-2 \nmay have consequences on tumour viability that are unrelated to inflammation. \n \nCelecoxib inhibits tumour formation in preclinical models of colon cancer, which overexpress COX-2, \nwhether induced by chemical (rat AOM model) or genetic (MIN mouse model) mutation.  \n \nCelecoxib has been shown to reduce the number and size of adenomatous colorectal polyps. A \nrandomized double-blind placebo controlled study was conducted in 83 patients with FAP. The study \npopulation included 58 patients with a prior subtotal or total colectomy and 25 patients with an intact \ncolon. Thirteen patients had the attenuated FAP phenotype. The mean reduction in the number of \ncolorectal polyps following six months of treatment was 28% (SD + 24%) for celecoxib 400 mg BID \nwhich was statistically superior to placebo (mean 5%, SD +16%). A meaningful reduction in duodenal \nadenoma area was also observed compared with placebo (14.5% celecoxib 400 mg BID versus 1.4% \nplacebo), which however was not statistically significant. \n \nPilot Study in Juvenile FAP Patients: A total of 18 children 10 to 14 years of age who had genotype or \nphenotype positive FAP were treated with celecoxib 4 mg/kg/day (4 patients, compared to 2 patients \ntreated with placebo), celecoxib 8 mg/kg/day (4 patients, compared to 2 patients treated with placebo), \nor celecoxib 16 mg/kg/day (4 patients, compared to 2 patients treated with placebo).  Results \ndemonstrated a statistically significant reduction in polyp burden in all celecoxib treatment groups \ncompared to the corresponding placebo treatment groups.  The greatest reduction was observed in \npatients treated with celecoxib 16 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to the recommended adult FAP dose \nof 800 mg daily.  Safety data were reviewed in detail by a Data Safety Monitoring Committee, which \nconcluded that celecoxib 16 mg/kg/day was a safe dose to recommend for further studies in juvenile \nFAP patients. \n \nThe long-term cardiovascular toxicity in children exposed to celecoxib has not been evaluated and it is \nunknown if the long-term risk may be similar to that seen in adults exposed to celecoxib or other \nCOX-2 selective and non-selective NSAIDs (see section 4.4; cardiovascular effects.). \n\nCardiovascular Safety – Long-Term Studies Involving Subjects With Sporadic Adenomatous Polyps:  \nTwo studies involving subjects with sporadic adenomatous polyps were conducted with celecoxib i.e., \nthe APC trial (Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib) and the PreSAP trial (Prevention of Spontaneous \nAdenomatous Polyps).  In theAPC trial, there was a dose-related increase in the composite endpoint of \ncardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (adjudicated) with celecoxib compared to \nplacebo over 3 years of treatment.   The PreSAP trial did not demonstrate a statistically significant \nincreased risk for the same composite endpoint. \n \nIn the APC trial, the relative risks compared to placebo for a composite endpoint (adjudicated) of \ncardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke were 3.4 (95% CI 1.4 - 8.5) with celecoxib \n400 mg twice daily and 2.8 (95% CI 1.1 - 7.2) with celecoxib 200 mg twice daily.  Cumulative rates \nfor this composite endpoint over 3 years were 3.0% (20/671 subjects) and 2.5% (17/685 subjects), \nrespectively, compared to 0.9% (6/679 subjects) for placebo.  The increases for both celecoxib dose \ngroups versus placebo were mainly due to an increased incidence of myocardial infarction.   \n \nIn the PreSAP trial, the relative risk compared to placebo for this same composite endpoint \n(adjudicated) was 1.2 (95% CI 0.6 - 2.4) with celecoxib 400 mg once daily compared to placebo.  \nCumulative rates for this composite endpoint over 3 years were 2.3% (21/933 subjects) and 1.9% \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n12 \n\n(12/628 subjects), respectively. The incidence of myocardial infarction (adjudicated) was 1.0% with \n(9/933 subjects) with celecoxib 400 mg once daily and 0.6% (4/628 subjects) with placebo.   \n \nData from a third long-term study, ADAPT (The Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention \nTrial), did not show a significantly increased cardiovascular risk with celecoxib 200mg BID compared \nto placebo. The relative risk compared to placebo for a similar composite endpoint (CV death, MI, \nstroke) was 1.14 (95% CI 0.61 - 2.12) with celecoxib 200 mg twice daily.  The incidence of \nmyocardial infarction was 1.1% (8/717 patients) with celecoxib 200 mg twice daily and 1.2% \n(13/1070 patients) with placebo. \n \nData from pooled analysis of controlled randomized trials also suggest that cardiovascular risk may be \nassociated with the use of celecoxib compared to placebo, with evidence for differences in risk based \non celecoxib dose. \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under “Exceptional Circumstances”. This means that due \nto the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal \nproduct. \nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) will review any new information which may become \navailable every year and this SPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nCelecoxib is well absorbed reaching peak plasma concentrations after approximately 2-3 hours. \nDosing with food (high fat meal) delays absorption by about 1 hour with an increase in total \nabsorption (AUC) of 10 to 20%. \n \nCelecoxib is mainly eliminated by metabolism. Less than 1% of the dose is excreted unchanged in \nurine. The inter-subject variability in the exposure of celecoxib is about 10-fold. Celecoxib exhibits \ndose- and time-independent pharmacokinetics in the therapeutic dose range. Plasma protein binding is \nabout 97% at therapeutic plasma concentrations and celecoxib is not preferentially bound to \nerythrocytes. Elimination half-life is 8-12 hours. Steady state plasma concentrations are reached within \n5 days of treatment. Pharmacological activity resides in the parent substance. The main metabolites \nfound in the circulation have no detectable COX-1 or COX-2 activity. \n \nCelecoxib metabolism is primarily mediated via cytochrome P450 CYP2C9. Three metabolites, \ninactive as COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitors, have been identified in human plasma i.e., a primary alcohol, \nthe corresponding carboxylic acid and its glucuronide conjugate.  Cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 activity \nis reduced in individuals with genetic polymorphisms that lead to reduced enzyme activity, such as \nthose homozygous for the CYP2C9*3 polymorphism. \n  \nIn a pharmacokinetic study of celecoxib 200 mg administered once daily in healthy volunteers, \ngenotyped as either CYP2C9*1/*1, CYP2C9*1/*3, or CYP2C9*3/*3, the median Cmax and AUC 0-\n24 of celecoxib on day 7 were approximately 4-fold and 7-fold, respectively, in subjects genotyped as \nCYP2C9*3/*3 compared to other genotypes. In three separate single dose studies, involving a total of \n5 subjects genotyped as CYP2C9*3/*3, single-dose AUC 0-24 increased by approximately 3-fold \ncompared to normal metabolizers.  It is estimated that the frequency of the homozygous *3/*3 \ngenotype is 0.3-1.0% among different ethnic groups.   \n\n \nPatients who are known or suspected to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers based on previous \nhistory/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates should be administered celecoxib with caution (see \nSection 4.2). \n \nNo clinically significant differences were found in pharmacokinetic parameters of celecoxib between \nAfrican-Americans and Caucasians. The plasma concentration of celecoxib is approximately 100% \nincreased in elderly women (>65 years). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n13 \n\n \nCompared to subjects with normal hepatic function, patients with mild hepatic impairment had a mean \nincrease in Cmax of 53% and in AUC of 26% of celecoxib. When dosed at 200 mg per day the \ncorresponding values in patients with moderate hepatic impairment were 41% and 146% respectively. \nThe metabolic capacity in patients with mild to moderate impairment was best correlated to their \nalbumin values. In FAP patients with moderate hepatic impairment (serum albumin of 25-35 g/l), the \ndaily recommended dose of celecoxib should be reduced by 50%. Patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (serum albumin <25 g/l) have not been studied and celecoxib is contraindicated in this \npatient group.  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of celecoxib has not been studied in patients with renal impairment but is \nunlikely to be markedly changed in these patients since it is mainly eliminated by hepatic metabolism. \nThere is little experience of celecoxib in renal impairment and therefore caution is advised when \ntreating patients with renal impairment. Severe renal impairment is a contraindication to use.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nConventional embryo-foetal toxicity studies resulted in dose dependent occurrences of diaphragmatic \nhernia in rat foetuses and of cardiovascular malformations in rabbit foetuses at systemic exposures to \nfree celecoxib approximately 3 times (rat) and 2 times (rabbit) higher than those achieved at the \nrecommended daily human dose (800 mg). Diaphragmatic hernia was also seen in a peri-post natal \ntoxicity study in rats, which included exposure during the organogenetic period. In the latter study, at \nthe lowest systemic exposure where this anomaly occurred in a single animal, the estimated margin \nrelative to the recommended daily human dose was 2 times more than the recommended daily human \ndose (800 mg). \n \nIn animals, exposure to celecoxib during early embryonic development resulted in pre-implantation \nand post-implantation losses. These effects are expected following inhibition of prostaglandin \nsynthesis. \n \nCelecoxib was excreted in rat milk. In a peri-post natal study in rats, pup toxicity was observed. \n \nIn a two-year toxicity study an increase in nonadrenal thrombosis was observed in male rat at high \ndoses.  \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule. \nWhite, opaque capsules with two green bands marked 7767 and 400. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nOnsenal is indicated for the reduction of the number of adenomatous intestinal polyps in familial \nadenomatous polyposis (FAP), as an adjunct to surgery and further endoscopic surveillance (see \nsection 4.4).   \n \nThe effect of Onsenal-induced reduction of polyp burden on the risk of intestinal cancer has not been \ndemonstrated (see sections 4.4 and 5.1) \n \n4.2  Posology and method of administration \n \nThe recommended oral dose is one 400 mg capsule twice per day, taken with food (see section 5.2). \n \nUsual medical care for FAP patients should be continued while on celecoxib. The maximum \nrecommended daily dose is 800 mg. \n \nHepatic impairment: In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (serum albumin of 25-35 g/l), the \ndaily recommended dose of celecoxib should be reduced by 50% (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). Caution \nshould be used as there is no experience in such patients at doses higher than 400 mg. \n \nRenal impairment: Experience with celecoxib in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is \nlimited, therefore such patients should be treated with caution (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric patients: Experience with celecoxib in FAP patients below the age of 18 years is limited to \na single pilot study in a very small population, in which patients were treated with celecoxib at doses \nup to 16 mg/kg daily, which corresponds to the recommended adult FAP dose of 800 mg daily (see \nsection 5.1).  \n \nCYP2C9 Poor Metabolizers:  Patients who are known or suspected to be CYP2C9 poor \nmetabolizers based on genotyping or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 \nsubstrates should be administered celecoxib with caution, as the risk of dose-dependent adverse \neffects is increased.   \n \nPatients with the CYP2C9*3 allele, and, in particular those with  CYP2C9*3*3 homozygous \ngenotype, may be exposed to celecoxib levels that are higher than those for which safety has \nbeen studied in clinical trials. Therefore, the risk for high celecoxib exposure in poor \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n16 \n\nmetabolizers should be considered carefully when treating FAP patients. Consider starting \ntreatment at a reduced dose (see section 5.2). \n \n \nElderly: The dose for elderly FAP patients has not been established. Special care should be used in \nsuch patients (see section 5.2).  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1). \n• Known hypersensitivity to sulphonamides. \n• Active peptic ulceration or gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. \n• Patients who have experienced asthma, acute rhinitis, nasal polyps, angioneurotic oedema, \n\nurticaria or other allergic-type reactions after taking acetylsalicylic acid or non steroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including COX-2 (cyclooxigenase-2) selective inhibitors. \n\n• In pregnancy and in women who can become pregnant unless using an effective method of \ncontraception (see sections 4.5, 4.6 and 5.3)  \n\n• Breast feeding (see sections 4.6 and 5.3) \n• Severe hepatic dysfunction (serum albumin <25 g/l or Child-Pugh score >10) (Class C). \n• Patients with renal insufficiency with estimated creatinine clearance <30 ml/ min. \n• Inflammatory bowel disease. \n• Congestive heart failure (NYHA II-IV). \n• Established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease and/or cerebrovascular disease \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTreatment with celecoxib in FAP has been studied for up to 6 months and has not been shown to \nreduce the risk of gastrointestinal or other form of cancer or the need for surgery. Therefore, the usual \ncare of FAP patients should not be altered because of the concurrent administration of celecoxib. In \nparticular, the frequency of routine endoscopic surveillance should not be decreased and FAP-related \nsurgery should not be delayed. \n \nGastro-intestinal disorder \nUpper gastrointestinal complications [perforations, ulcers or bleeds (PUBs)], some of them resulting in \nfatal outcome, have occurred in patients treated with celecoxib. Caution is advised with treatment of \npatients most at risk of developing a gastrointestinal complication with NSAIDs: the elderly, patients \nusing any other NSAID or acetylsalicylic acid concomitantly or patients with a prior history of \ngastrointestinal disease, such as ulceration and GI bleeding.  \n \nThere is further increase in the risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects (gastrointestinal ulceration or \nother gastrointestinal complications) when celecoxib is taken concomitantly with acetylsalicylic acid \n(even at low doses). A significant difference in GI safety between selective COX-2 inhibitors + \nacetylsalicylic acid vs. NSAIDs + acetylsalicylic acid has not been demonstrated in long-term clinical \ntrials (see 5.1). \n \nThe concomitant use of celecoxib and a non-aspirin NSAID should be avoided. \n \nFAP patients carrying an ileorectal anastomosis or ileo pouch-anal anastomosis can develop \nanastomotic ulcerations. If an anastomotic ulcer is present, patients should not receive concomitant \ntreatment with anticoagulants or acetyl salicylic acid. \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorder / Cardio-vascular disorder \nIncreased number of serious cardiovascular events, mainly myocardial infarction, has been found in a \nlong-term placebo-controlled study in subjects with sporadic adenomatous polyps treated with \ncelecoxib at doses of 200 mg BID and 400 mg BID compared to placebo (see section 5.1).  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n17 \n\nAs the cardiovascular risks of celecoxib were increased with the 400 mg twice daily dose in the APC \ntrial (section 5.1), the response of the FAP patient to celecoxib should be re-examined periodically in \norder to avoid unnecessary exposure in FAP patients for whom celecoxib is not effective (sections 4.2, \n4.3, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nPatients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, \ndiabetes mellitus, smoking) should only be treated with celecoxib after careful consideration (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nCOX-2 selective inhibitors are not a substitute for acetylsalicylic acid for prophylaxis of \ncardiovascular thrombo-embolic diseases because of their lack of antiplatelet effect. Therefore, \nantiplatelet therapies should not be discontinued (see section 5.1). \n \nAs with other medicinal products known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, fluid retention and oedema \nhave been observed in patients taking celecoxib. Therefore, celecoxib should be used with caution in \npatients with history of cardiac failure, left ventricular dysfunction or hypertension, and in patients \nwith pre-existing oedema from any other reason, since prostaglandin inhibition may result in \ndeterioration of renal function and fluid retention. Caution is also required in patients taking diuretic \ntreatment or otherwise at risk of hypovolaemia. \n \nAs with all NSAIDS, celecoxib can lead to the onset of new hypertension or worsening of pre-existing \nhypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of cardiovascular events. \nTherefore, blood pressure should be monitored closely during the initiation of therapy with celecoxib \nand throughout the course of therapy. \n \nIn the event of elderly patients with mild to moderate cardiac dysfunction requiring therapy, special \ncare and follow up is warranted. Compromised renal or hepatic function and especially cardiac \ndysfunction are more likely in the elderly and therefore medically appropriate supervision should be \nmaintained. \n \nRenal and hepatic disorders \nNSAIDs, including celecoxib, may cause renal toxicity. Clinical trials with celecoxib have shown \nrenal effects similar to those observed with comparator NSAIDs. Patients at greatest risk for renal \ntoxicity are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, and the elderly. Such \npatients should be carefully monitored while receiving treatment with celecoxib.  \n \nExperience with celecoxib in patients with mild or moderate renal or hepatic impairment is limited, \ntherefore such patients should be treated with caution (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nIf during treatment, patients deteriorate in any of the organ system functions described above, \nappropriate measures should be taken and discontinuation of celecoxib therapy should be considered. \n \nSkin Reactions \nSerious skin reactions, some of them fatal, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, have been reported very rarely in association with the use \nof celecoxib (see section 4.8). Patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the \ncourse of therapy; the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first month of \ntreatment. Serious hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis and angioedema) have been reported in \npatients receiving celecoxib (see section 4.8). Patients with a history of sulphonamide allergy or any \ndrug allergy may be at greater risk of serious skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (see section \n4.3). Celecoxib should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash, mucosal lesions, or any \nother sign of hypersensitivity. \n \nOther \nPatients known to be CYP2C9 poor metabolisers should be treated with caution (see section 5.2). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n18 \n\nCelecoxib may mask fever and other signs of inflammation. \n \nIn patients on concurrent therapy with warfarin, serious bleeding events have been reported. Caution \nshould be exercised when combining celecoxib with warfarin and other oral anticoagulants (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nOnsenal 400 mg capsules contain lactose (99.6 mg). Patients with rare hereditary problems of \ngalactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take \nthis medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPharmacodynamic interactions \nThe majority of the interaction studies have been performed with celecoxib doses of 200 mg BID (i.e. \nthose used for osteoarthritis/rheumatoid arthritis). A more pronounced effect at 400 mg BID therefore \ncannot be excluded. \n \nAnticoagulant activity should be monitored in patients taking warfarin or other anticoagulants, \nparticularly in the first few days after initiating or changing the dose of celecoxib, since these patients \nhave an increased risk of bleeding complications. Therefore, patients receiving oral anticoagulants \nshould be closely monitored for their prothrombin time INR. Bleeding events in association with \nincreases in prothrombin time have been reported in arthritis patients (mainly elderly) receiving \ncelecoxib concurrently with warfarin, some of them fatal (see section 4.4). \n \nNSAIDs may reduce the effect of diuretics and antihypertensive medicinal products. As for NSAIDs, \nthe risk of acute renal insufficiency, which is usually reversible, may be increased in some patients \nwith compromised renal function (e.g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients) when ACE inhibitors or \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists are combined with NSAIDs, including celecoxib. Therefore, the \ncombination should be administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be \nadequately hydrated and consideration should be given to monitoring of renal function after initiation \nof concomitant therapy, and periodically thereafter. \n \nIn a 28-day clinical study in patients with lisinopril-controlled Stage I and II hypertension, \nadministration of celecoxib 200 mg BID resulted in no clinically significant increases, when compared \nto placebo treatment, in mean daily systolic or diastolic blood pressure as determined using 24-hour \nambulatory blood pressure monitoring.  Among patients treated with celecoxib 200 mg BID, \n48% were considered unresponsive to lisinopril at the final clinic visit (defined as either cuff diastolic \nblood pressure >90 mmHg or cuff diastolic blood pressure increased >10% compared to baseline), \ncompared to 27% of patients treated with placebo; this difference was statistically significant. \n \nCo-administration of NSAIDs and cyclosporine D derivatives or tacrolimus have been suggested to \nincrease the nephrotoxic effect of cyclosporin and tacrolimus. Renal function should be monitored \nwhen celecoxib and any of these medicinal products are combined. \n \nCelecoxib can be used with low dose acetylsalicylic acid, however it cannot be considered a substitute \nfor acetylsalicylic acid for cardiovascular prophylaxis. As with other NSAIDs, an increased risk of \ngastrointestinal ulceration or other gastrointestinal complications compared to use of celecoxib alone \nwas shown for concomitant administration of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (see section 5.1). \n\n \nPharmacokinetic interactions \n \nEffects of celecoxib on other medicinal products \nCelecoxib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. During celecoxib treatment, the mean plasma \nconcentrations of the CYP2D6 substrate dextromethorphan were increased by 136%. The plasma \nconcentrations of medicinal products that are substrates of this enzyme may be increased when \ncelecoxib is used concomitantly. Examples of medicines which are metabolised by CYP2D6 are \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n19 \n\nantidepressants (tricyclics and SSRIs), neuroleptics, anti-arrhythmics, etc. The dose of individually \ndose-titrated CYP2D6 substrates may need to be reduced when treatment with celecoxib is initiated or \nincreased if treatment with celecoxib is terminated. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown some potential for celecoxib to inhibit CYP2C19 catalysed metabolism. \nThe clinical significance of this in vitro finding is unknown. Examples of medicinal products which \nare metabolised by CYP2C19 are diazepam, citalopram and imipramine. \n \nIn an interaction study, celecoxib had no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of oral \ncontraceptives (1 mg norethistherone /35 microg ethinylestradiol). \n \nCelecoxib does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide (CYP2C9 substrate), or glibenclamide \nto a clinically relevant extent. \n \nIn patients with rheumatoid arthritis celecoxib had no statistically significant effect on the \npharmacokinetics (plasma or renal clearance) of methotrexate (in rheumatologic doses). However, \nadequate monitoring for methotrexate-related toxicity should be considered when combining these two \ndrugs. \n \nIn healthy subjects, co-administration of celecoxib 200 mg twice daily with 450 mg twice daily of \nlithium resulted in a mean increase in Cmax of 16% and in AUC of 18% of lithium. Therefore, patients \non lithium treatment should be closely monitored when celecoxib is introduced or withdrawn. \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on celecoxib \n \nIn individuals who are CYP2C9 poor metabolisers and demonstrate increased systemic exposure to \ncelecoxib, concomitant treatment with CYP2C9 inhibitors (eg. fluconazole, amiodarone) could result \nin further increases in celecoxib exposure. Such combinations should be avoided in known CYP2C9 \npoor metabolisers (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nSince celecoxib is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C9 it should be used at half the recommended \ndose in patients receiving fluconazole. Concomitant use of 200 mg single dose of celecoxib and 200 \nmg once daily of fluconazole, a potent CYP2C9 inhibitor, resulted in a mean increase in celecoxib \nCmax of 60% and in AUC of 130% (analogous studies have not been performed with amiodarone or \nother known CYP2C9 inhibitors). Concomitant use of inducers of CYP2C9 such as rifampicin, \ncarbamazepine and barbiturates may reduce plasma concentrations of celecoxib. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor celecoxib no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Studies in animals (rats and \nrabbits) have shown reproductive toxicity (see sections 4.3 and 5.3). The potential risk for humans is \nunknown. Celecoxib, as with other medicinal products inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, may cause \nuterine inertia and premature closure of the ductus arteriosus during the last trimester. Celecoxib is \ncontraindicated in pregnancy and in women who can become pregnant unless using an effective \nmethod of contraception (see section 4.3). If a woman becomes pregnant during treatment, celecoxib \nshould be discontinued. \n \nCelecoxib is excreted in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations similar to those in plasma. \nAdministration of celecoxib to a limited number of lactating women has shown a very low transfer of \ncelecoxib into breast milk. Women who take celecoxib should not breastfeed. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \npatients who experience dizziness, vertigo or somnolence while taking celecoxib should refrain from \ndriving or operating machinery. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nAdverse reactions are listed by system organ class and ranked by frequency in Table 1, reflecting data \nfrom the following sources: \n- Adverse reactions reported in osteoarthritis patients and rheumatoid arthritis patients at incidence \n\nrates greater than 0.01% and greater than those reported for placebo during 12 placebo- and/or \nactive-controlled clinical trials of duration up to 12 weeks at celecoxib daily doses from 100 mg up \nto 800 mg.  In additional studies using non-selective NSAID comparators, approximately \n7400 arthritis patients have been treated with celecoxib at daily doses up to 800 mg, including \napproximately 2300 patients treated for 1 year or longer.  The adverse reactions observed with \ncelecoxib in these additional studies were consistent with those for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid \narthritis patients listed in Table 1. \n\n- Adverse drug reactions from post-marketing surveillance as spontaneously reported during a period \nin which an estimated >70 million patients were treated with celecoxib (various doses, durations, \nand indications).

Single doses up to 1400 mg and multiple \ndoses up to 1400 mg twice daily have been administered to healthy subjects for nine days without \nclinically significant adverse events. In the event of suspected overdose, appropriate supportive \nmedical care should be provided e.g. by eliminating the gastric contents, clinical supervision and, if \nnecessary, the institution of symptomatic treatment. Dialysis is unlikely to be an efficient method of \nmedicinal product removal due to high protein binding. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic, ATC code: L01XX33 \n \nCelecoxib is a diaryl-substituted pyrazole, chemically similar to other non-arylamine sulfonamides \n(e.g. thiazides, furosemide) but differing from arylamine sulfonamides (e.g. sulfamethoxizole and \nother sulfonamide antibiotics). \n \nCelecoxib is an oral, selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor. No statistically significant \ninhibition of COX-1 (assessed as ex vivo inhibition of thromboxane B2 [TxB2] formation) was \nobserved in healthy volunteers at the FAP therapeutic dose of 400 mg BID. \n \nCyclooxygenase is responsible for generation of prostaglandins. Two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2, \nhave been identified. COX-2 is the isoform of the enzyme that has been shown to be induced by pro-\ninflammatory stimuli and has been postulated to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of \nprostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation and fever. Elevated levels of COX-2 are found in many \npre-malignant lesions (such as adenomatous colorectal polyps) and epithelial cancers. Familial \nAdenomatous Polyposis (FAP) is a genetic disease resulting from an autosomal dominant genetic \nalteration of a tumor suppressor gene, the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Polyps with the \nAPC mutation overexpress COX-2 and left untreated, these polyps continue to form and enlarge in the \ncolon or rectum resulting in essentially a 100% chance of developing colorectal cancer. COX-2 is also \ninvolved in ovulation, implantation and closure of the ductus arteriosus, regulation of renal function, \nand central nervous system functions (fever induction, pain perception and cognitive function). It may \nalso play a role in ulcer healing. COX-2 has been identified in tissue around gastric ulcers in man but \nits relevance to ulcer healing has not been established. \n \nThe difference in antiplatelet activity between some COX-1 inhibiting NSAIDs and COX-2 selective \ninhibitors may be of clinical significance in patients at risk of thrombo-embolic reactions. COX-2 \ninhibitors reduce the formation of systemic (and therefore possibly endothelial) prostacyclin without \naffecting platelet thromboxane. \n \nA dose-dependent effect on TxB2 formation has been observed after high doses of celecoxib. \nHowever, in small multiple dose studies in healthy subjects with 600 mg BID celecoxib had no effect \non platelet aggregation and bleeding time compared to placebo. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n24 \n\nExperimental evidence shows that the mechanism(s) of action by which celecoxib leads to tumour \ndeath may be related to induction of apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis. Inhibition of COX-2 \nmay have consequences on tumour viability that are unrelated to inflammation. \n \nCelecoxib inhibits tumour formation in preclinical models of colon cancer, which overexpress COX-2, \nwhether induced by chemical (rat AOM model) or genetic (MIN mouse model) mutation.  \n \nCelecoxib has been shown to reduce the number and size of adenomatous colorectal polyps. A \nrandomized double-blind placebo controlled study was conducted in 83 patients with FAP. The study \npopulation included 58 patients with a prior subtotal or total colectomy and 25 patients with an intact \ncolon. Thirteen patients had the attenuated FAP phenotype. The mean reduction in the number of \ncolorectal polyps following six months of treatment was 28% (SD + 24%) for celecoxib 400 mg BID \nwhich was statistically superior to placebo (mean 5%, SD +16%). A meaningful reduction in duodenal \nadenoma area was also observed compared with placebo (14.5% celecoxib 400 mg BID versus 1.4% \nplacebo), which however was not statistically significant. \n \nPilot Study in Juvenile FAP Patients: A total of 18 children 10 to 14 years of age who had genotype or \nphenotype positive FAP were treated with celecoxib 4 mg/kg/day (4 patients, compared to 2 patients \ntreated with placebo), celecoxib 8 mg/kg/day (4 patients, compared to 2 patients treated with placebo), \nor celecoxib 16 mg/kg/day (4 patients, compared to 2 patients treated with placebo).  Results \ndemonstrated a statistically significant reduction in polyp burden in all celecoxib treatment groups \ncompared to the corresponding placebo treatment groups.  The greatest reduction was observed in \npatients treated with celecoxib 16 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to the recommended adult FAP dose \nof 800 mg daily.  Safety data were reviewed in detail by a Data Safety Monitoring Committee, which \nconcluded that celecoxib 16 mg/kg/day was a safe dose to recommend for further studies in juvenile \nFAP patients. \n \nThe long-term cardiovascular toxicity in children exposed to celecoxib has not been evaluated and it is \nunknown if the long-term risk may be similar to that seen in adults exposed to celecoxib or other \nCOX-2 selective and non-selective NSAIDs (see section 4.4; cardiovascular effects). \n\nCardiovascular Safety – Long-Term Studies Involving Subjects With Sporadic Adenomatous Polyps:  \nTwo studies involving subjects with sporadic adenomatous polyps were conducted with celecoxib i.e., \nthe APC trial (Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib) and the PreSAP trial (Prevention of Spontaneous \nAdenomatous Polyps).  In the APC trial, there was a dose-related increase in the composite endpoint \nof cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (adjudicated) with celecoxib compared to \nplacebo over 3 years of treatment.   The PreSAP trial did not demonstrate a statistically significant \nincreased risk for the same composite endpoint. \n \nIn the APC trial, the relative risks compared to placebo for a composite endpoint (adjudicated) of \ncardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke were 3.4 (95% CI 1.4 - 8.5) with celecoxib \n400 mg twice daily and 2.8 (95% CI 1.1 - 7.2) with celecoxib 200 mg twice daily.  Cumulative rates \nfor this composite endpoint over 3 years were 3.0% (20/671 subjects) and 2.5% (17/685 subjects), \nrespectively, compared to 0.9% (6/679 subjects) for placebo.  The increases for both celecoxib dose \ngroups versus placebo were mainly due to an increased incidence of myocardial infarction.   \n \nIn the PreSAP trial, the relative risk compared to placebo for this same composite endpoint \n(adjudicated) was 1.2 (95% CI 0.6 - 2.4) with celecoxib 400 mg once daily compared to placebo.  \nCumulative rates for this composite endpoint over 3 years were 2.3% (21/933 subjects) and 1.9% \n(12/628 subjects), respectively. The incidence of myocardial infarction (adjudicated) was 1.0% with \n(9/933 subjects) with celecoxib 400 mg once daily and 0.6% (4/628 subjects) with placebo.   \n \nData from a third long-term study, ADAPT (The Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention \nTrial), did not show a significantly increased cardiovascular risk with celecoxib 200mg BID compared \nto placebo. The relative risk compared to placebo for a similar composite endpoint (CV death, MI, \nstroke) was 1.14 (95% CI 0.61 - 2.12) with celecoxib 200 mg twice daily.  The incidence of \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n25 \n\nmyocardial infarction was 1.1% (8/717 patients) with celecoxib 200 mg twice daily and 1.2% \n(13/1070 patients) with placebo. \n \nData from pooled analysis of controlled randomized trials also suggest that cardiovascular risk may be \nassociated with the use of celecoxib compared to placebo, with evidence for differences in risk based \non celecoxib dose. \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under “Exceptional Circumstances”. This means that due \nto the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal \nproduct. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) will review any new information which may \nbecome available every year and this SPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nCelecoxib is well absorbed reaching peak plasma concentrations after approximately 2-3 hours. \nDosing with food (high fat meal) delays absorption by about 1 hour with an increase in total \nabsorption (AUC) of 10 to 20%. \n \nCelecoxib is mainly eliminated by metabolism. Less than 1% of the dose is excreted unchanged in \nurine. The inter-subject variability in the exposure of celecoxib is about 10-fold. Celecoxib exhibits \ndose- and time-independent pharmacokinetics in the therapeutic dose range. Plasma protein binding is \nabout 97% at therapeutic plasma concentrations and celecoxib is not preferentially bound to \nerythrocytes. Elimination half-life is 8-12 hours. Steady state plasma concentrations are reached within \n5 days of treatment. Pharmacological activity resides in the parent substance. The main metabolites \nfound in the circulation have no detectable COX-1 or COX-2 activity. \n \nCelecoxib metabolism is primarily mediated via cytochrome P450 2C9. Three metabolites, inactive as \nCOX-1 or COX-2 inhibitors, have been identified in human plasma i.e., a primary alcohol, the \ncorresponding carboxylic acid and its glucuronide conjugate.  Cytochrome P450 2C9 activity is \nreduced in individuals with genetic polymorphisms that lead to reduced enzyme activity, such as those \nhomozygous for the CYP2C9*3 polymorphism. \n  \nIn a pharmacokinetic study of celecoxib 400 mg administered once daily in healthy volunteers, \ngenotyped as either CYP2C9*1/*1, CYP2C9*1/*3, or CYP2C9*3/*3, the median Cmax and AUC 0-\n24 of celecoxib on day 7 were approximately 4-fold and 7-fold, respectively, in subjects genotyped as \nCYP2C9*3/*3 compared to other genotypes. In three separate single dose studies, involving a total of \n5 subjects genotyped as CYP2C9*3/*3, single-dose AUC 0-24 increased by approximately 3-fold \ncompared to normal metabolizers.  It is estimated that the frequency of the homozygous *3/*3 \ngenotype is 0.3-1.0% among different ethnic groups.   \n\n \nPatients who are known or suspected to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers based on previous \nhistory/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates should be administered celecoxib with caution (see \nSection 4.2). \n \nNo clinically significant differences were found in pharmacokinetic parameters of celecoxib between \nAfrican-Americans and Caucasians. The plasma concentration of celecoxib is approximately 100% \nincreased in elderly women (>65 years). \n \nCompared to subjects with normal hepatic function, patients with mild hepatic impairment had a mean \nincrease in Cmax of 53% and in AUC of 26% of celecoxib. When dosed at 200 mg per day the \ncorresponding values in patients with moderate hepatic impairment were 41% and 146% respectively. \nThe metabolic capacity in patients with mild to moderate impairment was best correlated to their \nalbumin values. In FAP patients with moderate hepatic impairment (serum albumin of 25-35 g/l), the \ndaily recommended dose of celecoxib should be reduced by 50%. Patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (serum albumin <25 g/l) have not been studied and celecoxib is contraindicated in this \npatient group.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n26 \n\n \nThe pharmacokinetics of celecoxib has not been studied in patients with renal impairment but is \nunlikely to be markedly changed in these patients since it is mainly eliminated by hepatic metabolism. \nThere is little experience of celecoxib in renal impairment and therefore caution is advised when \ntreating patients with renal impairment. Severe renal impairment is a contraindication to use.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nConventional embryo-foetal toxicity studies resulted in dose dependent occurrences of diaphragmatic \nhernia in rat foetuses and of cardiovascular malformations in rabbit foetuses at systemic exposures to \nfree celecoxib approximately 3 times (rat) and 2 times (rabbit) higher than those achieved at the \nrecommended daily human dose (800 mg). Diaphragmatic hernia was also seen in a peri-post natal \ntoxicity study in rats, which included exposure during the organogenetic period. In the latter study, at \nthe lowest systemic exposure where this anomaly occurred in a single animal, the estimated margin \nrelative to the recommended daily human dose was 2 times more than the recommended daily human \ndose (800 mg). \n \nIn animals, exposure to celecoxib during early embryonic development resulted in pre-implantation \nand post-implantation losses. These effects are expected following inhibition of prostaglandin \nsynthesis. \n \nCelecoxib was excreted in rat milk. In a peri-post natal study in rats, pup toxicity was observed. \n \nIn a two-year toxicity study an increase in nonadrenal thrombosis was observed in male rat at high \ndoses.  \n \n \n6.

WHAT ONSENAL IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nOnsenal belongs to a group of medicines called cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors.  \nCyclo-oxygenase-2 is an enzyme that increases at inflammatory sites and in abnormally growing cells. \nOnsenal works by inhibiting COX-2, to which such dividing cells are sensitive. As a consequence the \ncells die. \n \nOnsenal is used to reduce the number of gastrointestinal polyps in patients with Familial Adenomatous \nPolyposis (FAP). FAP is an inherited disorder in which the rectum and colon are covered with many \npolyps that might develop colorectal cancer. Onsenal should be used along with the usual care for FAP \npatients such as surgery and endoscopic surveillance. \n \n \n2.

WHAT ONSENAL IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nOnsenal belongs to a group of medicines called cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors.  \nCyclo-oxygenase-2 is an enzyme that increases at inflammatory sites and in abnormally growing cells. \nOnsenal works by inhibiting COX-2, to which such dividing cells are sensitive. As a consequence the \ncells die. \n \nOnsenal is used to reduce the number of gastrointestinal polyps in patients with Familial Adenomatous \nPolyposis (FAP). FAP is an inherited disorder in which the rectum and colon are covered with many \npolyps that might develop colorectal cancer. Onsenal should be used along with the usual care for FAP \npatients such as surgery and endoscopic surveillance. \n \n \n2.
