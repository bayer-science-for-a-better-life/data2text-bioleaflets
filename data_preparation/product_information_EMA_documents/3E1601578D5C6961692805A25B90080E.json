NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNovoThirteen 2500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne vial contains catridecacog (recombinant coagulation factor XIII) (rDNA): 2500 IU per 3 ml, after \nreconstitution corresponding to a concentration of 833 IU/ml. The specific activity of NovoThirteen is \napproximately 165 IU/mg protein. \n \nThe active substance is produced in yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) by recombinant DNA \ntechnology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nThe powder is white and the solvent is clear and colourless. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nLong term prophylactic treatment of bleeding in patients with congenital factor XIII A-subunit \ndeficiency. NovoThirteen can be used for all age groups. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a doctor experienced in the treatment of rare \nbleeding disorders. The congenital factor XIII A-subunit deficiency should be confirmed by \nappropriate diagnostic procedures including factor XIII activity and immunoassay and if applicable \ngenotyping. \n \nPosology \nThe potency of this medicinal product is expressed in international units (IU). \nAlthough expressed in the same unit (IU), the posology of NovoThirteen is different from the dosing \nschedule of the other FXIII containing products (see section 4.4). \n \nThe recommended dose is 35 IU/kg body weight (bw) once monthly (every 28 days Â± 2 days), \nadministered as an intravenous bolus injection. \nBased on the actual concentration of NovoThirteen, the volume (in millilitres) to be administered to \npatients weighing at least 24 kg can be calculated from the formula below: \n \nDose volume in ml = 0.042 x subject bw (kg) \n \nDose adjustment can be considered necessary by the physician in certain situations where the \nprevention of bleeding is not appropriately covered by the recommended 35 IU/kg/month dose.  \nThis dose adjustment should be based on FXIII activity levels. \n \nMonitoring NovoThirteen activity levels using a standard FXIII activity assay is recommended. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric population \nNo dose adjustment is required when NovoThirteen is used in paediatric patients and the dose of \n35 IU/kg body weight should be used (see section 5.2 â€˜Paediatric populationâ€™).  \n \nHowever, if the paediatric patient weighs less than 24 kg, the reconstituted NovoThirteen should be \nfurther diluted with 6 ml of sodium chloride 0.9%, solution for injection to handle the dosing of small \nchildren (see section 6.6 â€˜Special precautions for disposal and other handling â€“ Use in the paediatric \npopulationâ€™). \n \nThe dose volume for small children can then be calculated by using the below formula: \n \nDose volume in ml = 0.117 x body weight in kilograms. \n \nThe calculation of the correction factor 0.117 is related to the exact quantity of the product and not \nthe nominal value of the product. \n \nCurrently available data are described in section 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2. \n \nMethod of administration \nIntravenous use. \n \nThe preparation should be administered as a slow bolus intravenous injection at a rate not higher than \n2 ml/minute. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product prior to administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nConsidering that the posology and the FXIII concentration in NovoThirteen are different from those \nof the other FXIII containing products, careful attention should be paid to the calculation of the \nappropriate dose for the individual patient (see dose volume formula provided in section 4.2). \n \nCongenital FXIII B-subunit deficiency \nIn patients with FXIII deficiency, NovoThirteen is not effective if used for monthly prophylactic \ntreatment of bleeding in patients with congenital FXIII B-subunit deficiency. FXIII B-subunit \ndeficiency is associated with a much reduced half-life of the administered pharmacologically active \nA-subunit. The subunit deficiency of patients should be determined prior to treatment by appropriate \ndiagnostic procedures including factor XIII activity and immunoassay and if applicable genotyping. \n \nOn-demand treatment \nThe on-demand treatment of acute bleeds or breakthrough bleeds with NovoThirteen was allowed per \nprotocol in the late phase clinical development programme. One patient was treated on demand in a \nphase 3b extension study (F13CD-3720). Also, on-demand treatment is followed in a non-\ninterventional post-authorisation safety study (NN1841-3868). Until further results are available, \nalternative treatment should be considered in such situations. \n \nAllergic reactions \nAs NovoThirteen contains a recombinant protein it may cause allergic reactions including \nanaphylactic reactions. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions \n(including hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension) and \nanaphylaxis. If allergic or anaphylactic-type reactions occur, the administration should be \nimmediately discontinued and further treatment with NovoThirteen should not be given. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nInhibitor formation: \nInhibitor formation to NovoThirteen therapy has not been detected in clinical trials. Inhibitors may be \nsuspected in the event of lack of therapeutic response which is observed as bleeding or demonstrated \nby laboratory findings including FXIII activity that fails to reach expected levels. In the event that \ninhibitors are suspected analysis for antibodies should be performed. \n \nPatients known to have neutralising antibodies to FXIII should not be treated with NovoThirteen \nwithout close monitoring. \n \nThromboembolic risk: \nThe reconstituted product must be handled in accordance with section 6.3.  \nIncorrect storage of the product after reconstitution must be avoided as it may result in loss of sterility \nand in increased levels of non-proteolytically activated NovoThirteen. Increased levels of activated \nNovoThirteen may increase the risk of thrombosis. \n \nIn case of predisposition to conditions of thrombosis, caution should be exercised due to the fibrin-\nstabilising effect of NovoThirteen. A stabilisation of the thrombus might occur, resulting in increased \nrisk of vessel occlusions. \n \nHepatic impairment \nPatients with hepatic impairment have not been studied. NovoThirteen may not be effective in \npatients with hepatic impairment if the hepatic impairment is severe enough to result in decreased \nlevels of FXIII B-subunits. FXIII activity levels should be monitored in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment. \n \nElderly patients \nThere is limited clinical experience in administering NovoThirteen to elderly patients with congenital \nFXIII deficiency. \n \nRenal insufficiency \nPatients with renal insufficiency requiring dialysis have not been studied in clinical trials. \n \nSodium content \nThe medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, indicating that it is \nessentially â€˜sodium freeâ€™. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThere are no clinical data available on interaction between NovoThirteen and other medicinal \nproducts. \n \nBased on the non-clinical study (see section 5.3) it is not recommended to combine NovoThirteen and \nrecombinant activated FVII (rFVIIa). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no clinical data on the use of NovoThirteen in pregnant women. Animal studies are \ninsufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3) as NovoThirteen has not been \nstudied in pregnant animals. The risk to humans is not known. However, based on the therapeutic \nneed the use of NovoThirteen may be considered during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether rFXIII is excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of rFXIII in milk has \nnot been studied in animals. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to \n\n\n\n5 \n\ncontinue/discontinue therapy with NovoThirteen should be made taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding to the child and the benefit of NovoThirteen therapy to the mother. \n \nFertility \nNo effects on reproductive organs have been seen in non-clinical studies. There are no human data on \npotential effects on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNovoThirteen has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequent adverse reaction is â€˜headacheâ€™ reported in 37% of patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nIn clinical trials, NovoThirteen has been administered to 82 patients with congenital factor XIII A- \nsubunit deficiency (3112 doses of NovoThirteen).  \n \nFrequency descriptions of all adverse reactions identified from 82 patients with congenital FXIII \ndeficiency exposed in clinical trials are presented in the below table by system organ class. \n \nFrequency categories are defined according to the following convention: very common (â‰¥ 1/10), \ncommon (â‰¥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (â‰¥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (â‰¥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n \nCommon (â‰¥ 1/100 to < 1/10) \n\n \n \nLeucopenia and aggravated neutropenia \n\nNervous system disorders \n \nCommon (â‰¥ 1/100 to < 1/10) \n\n \n \nHeadache \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n \nCommon (â‰¥ 1/100 to < 1/10) \n\n \n \nPain in extremity \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n \nCommon (â‰¥ 1/100 to < 1/10) \n\n \n \n \nInjection site pain \n\nInvestigations \n \nCommon (â‰¥ 1/100 to < 1/10) \n \nCommon (â‰¥ 1/100 to < 1/10) \n\n \n \nNon-neutralising antibodies \n \nFibrin D-dimer increased \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nOne patient with pre-existing neutropenia experienced a mild aggravation of neutropenia and \nleucopenia during treatment with NovoThirteen. Following discontinuation of NovoThirteen the \npatientâ€™s neutrophil count returned to levels similar to those prior to treatment with NovoThirteen. \n \nNon-neutralising antibodies have been seen in 4 of the 82 exposed patients with congenital FXIII \ndeficiency. The four events of non-neutralising antibodies occurred in patients below the age of 18 \n(age 8, 8, 14 and 16). These antibodies were seen at the start of treatment with NovoThirteen. All \n\n\n\n6 \n\n4 patients received at least 2 doses of NovoThirteen. 3 of the patients discontinued the study and \nreturned to their previous treatment. One continued to receive rFXIII and the antibodies decreased \nbelow detection limit. The antibodies had no inhibitory action and the patients did not experience any \nadverse events or bleeding in association with these antibodies. Antibodies were transient in all \npatients. \n \nOne healthy subject developed low-titer, transient non-neutralising antibodies after receiving the first \ndose of NovoThirteen. The antibodies had no inhibitory activity, and the subject did not experience \nany adverse events or bleeding in association with these antibodies. The antibodies disappeared in the \n6-month follow up. \n \nIn all cases, the non-neutralising antibodies were found to be of no clinical significance. \n \nIn a post-authorisation safety study transient non-neutralising antibodies were seen in a child with \ncongenital FXIII deficiency after several years of treatment with NovoThirteen. No clinical findings \nwere associated with these antibodies. \n \nPaediatric population \n21 patients were between the age of 6 to less than 18 years old and 6 patients were less than 6 years \nold (total of 986 exposures of NovoThirteen in paediatric subjects (less than 18 years old). \nIn clinical studies, adverse reactions were more frequently reported in patients aged from 6 to less \nthan 18 years old than in adults. 3 patients (14%) aged between 6 and 18 years experienced serious \nadverse reactions in comparison to 0 patients over 18 years that experienced serious adverse reactions. \nFour cases of non-neutralising antibodies were reported at the start of the treatment in patients from 6 \nto 18 years of age. 3 of these patients discontinued the study due to the adverse reaction. \nIn patients below 6 years, no anti-rFXIII antibodies, no thromboembolic adverse events or other safety \nissues were reported. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn the reported cases of NovoThirteen overdose up to 2.3 times, no clinical symptoms have been \nobserved. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antihaemorrhagics, Blood Coagulation factor, ATC code: B02BD11. \n \nMechanism of action \nIn plasma, FXIII circulates as a heterotetramer [A2B2] composed of 2 FXIII A-subunits and 2 FXIII B-\nsubunits held together by strong non-covalent interactions. The FXIII B-subunit acts as a carrier \nmolecule for the FXIII A-subunit in circulation, and is present in excess in plasma. When the FXIII A-\nsubunit is bound to the FXIII B-subunit [A2B2], the half-life of the FXIII A-subunit [A2] is prolonged. \nFXIII is a pro-enzyme (pro-transglutaminase), which is activated by thrombin in the presence of Ca2+. \nThe enzymatic activity resides with the FXIII A-subunit. Upon activation, the FXIII A-subunit \ndissociates from the FXIII B-subunit and thereby exposes the active site of the FXIII A-subunit. The \nactive transglutaminase cross-links fibrin and other proteins resulting in increased mechanical \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\nstrength and resistance to fibrinolysis of the fibrin clot and contributes to enhanced platelet and clot \nadhesion to the injured tissue. \n \nNovoThirteen is a recombinant coagulation factor XIII A-subunit produced in yeast cells \n(Saccharomyces cerevisiae) by recombinant DNA technology. It is structurally identical to the human \nFXIII A-subunit [A2]. NovoThirteen (A-subunit) binds to free human FXIII B-subunit resulting in a \nheterotetramer [rA2B2] with a similar half-life to endogenous [A2B2].  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nAt present there are no markers that can quantitatively assess the in vivo pharmacodynamics of FXIII. \nThe results of standard coagulation tests are normal, as it is the quality of the clot that is affected. A \nclot solubility assay is widely used as an indicator of FXIII deficiency, but the assay is qualitative, and \nwhen performed correctly the test is positive only when the FXIII activity in the sample is close to \nzero. \n \nNovoThirteen has been shown to have the same pharmacodynamic properties in plasma as \nendogenous FXIII. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nA pivotal prospective, open-label, single-arm phase 3 trial (F13CD-1725) including 41 patients with \nFXIII A-subunit deficiency was conducted to investigate the haemostatic efficacy of rFXIII in patients \nwith congenital FXIII deficiency as reflected by the rate of bleeding episodes requiring treatment with \na FXIII-containing product. The dosing scheme used was 35 IU/kg/month (every 28 days Â± 2 days). \nFive bleeding episodes requiring treatment with a FXIII-containing product have been observed in \nfour patients during treatment with rFXIII in the trial. \n \nThe mean rate of treatment-requiring bleeds was determined to 0.138 per subject year. In the primary \nendpoint analysis covering the referred period, the age-adjusted rate (number per subject year) of \ntreatment-requiring bleeds during the rFXIII treatment period was 0.048/year (95% CI: 0.009 - 0.250; \nmodel-based estimate corresponding to the mean age of 26.4 years for the 41 patients). \n \nIn the F13CD-1725 extension trial F13CD-3720, the age-adjusted rate of bleeds that required \ntreatment with a FXIII-containing product was estimated to be 0.021 bleeds per subject year with a \n95% CI of [0.0062; 0.073] (model-based estimate corresponding to a mean age of the trial population \nof 31.0 years).  \n \nThe crude bleeding rates in the two trials, F13CD-1725 and F13CD-3720, not adjusted for age, were \n0.138 and 0.043 respectively, corresponding to a total of 13 bleeds over 223 subject-years and a \npooled rate of 0.058.  \n \nPaediatric population \nAnalyses of data from paediatric patients included in clinical trials have not identified differences in \ntreatment response according to age. \n \nTwenty-one children between the age of 6 to less than 18 years old and six children less than 6 years \nold have been treated with NovoThirteen for a total of 986 exposures.  \nChildren above 6 years were investigated through the pivotal phase 3 trial (F13CD-1725) and the  \nextension study (F13CD-3720) assessing the safety of monthly replacement therapy with \nNovoThirteen. \n \nThe 6 patients below 6 years were investigated through a single dose pharmacokinetic phase 3b trial \n(F13CD-3760) and then, included in the long-term follow-up trial (F13CD-3835) assessing the safety \nand the efficacy of monthly replacement therapy with NovoThirteen. No treatment requiring bleeding \nepisodes have been detected in patients below 6 years during 17 years of cumulative follow-up, \nrepresenting a total of 214 doses. The suggested dose of 35 IU/kg has shown to be appropriate to \nprovide haemostatic coverage in this young population. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe half-life of NovoThirteen was assessed in the F13CD-1725 trial from a limited blood sampling \nscheme at 1 hour, 14 and 28 days post dose. Based on FXIII activity measured by the Berichrom assay \nin patients with congenital FXIII deficiency, a geometric mean half-life of 11.8 days was estimated. \nThis is in agreement with the elimination pharmacokinetics estimated from a clinical pharmacology \ntrial in healthy subjects, which determined the half-life to be 11.8 days. In this trial the mean volume \nof distribution at steady state was 47 ml/kg, mean residence time was 15.5 days and mean clearance \nwas 0.13 ml/kg. \n \nPaediatric population \nIn a pharmacokinetic trial 6 children (age 1 to less than 6 years old) with congenital FXIII A-subunit \ndeficiency were exposed to one single i.v. dose of NovoThirteen 35 IU/kg. The mean tÂ½ of FXIII was \napproximately 15 days (range: 10 to 25 days). In this trial, the mean clearance in children was \n0.15 ml/h/kg.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology and \nrepeated dose toxicity. All findings in the non-clinical safety programme have been related to \nexpected exaggerated pharmacology (general thrombosis, ischaemic necrosis and ultimately \nmortality) of rFXIII and non-proteolytically activated recombinant FXIII at dose levels in excess \n(>48 fold) of the maximum recommended clinical dose of 35 IU/kg. \n \nA potential synergistic effect of combined treatment with rFXIII and rFVIIa in an advanced \ncardiovascular model in cynomolgus monkey resulted in exaggerated pharmacology (thrombosis and \ndeath) at a lower dose level than when administering the individual compounds. \n \nAnimal reproductive or developmental toxicity studies have not been performed. No effects on \nreproductive organs were noted in the repeated dose toxicity studies. \nGenotoxic potential or carcinogenicity has not been studied since rFXIII is an endogenous protein. \n \n \n6.

Before starting, the hands should be washed. Bring the powder and \nsolvent vials to a temperature not above 25Â°C by holding them in the hands. Clean the rubber stoppers \non the vials with alcohol swabs and allow them to dry before use. \n \nThe product is reconstituted using the vial adapter included. \nAttach the vial adapter to the solvent vial (water for injections). Take care not to touch the spike on \nthe vial adapter. \n \nPull the plunger to draw in a volume of air equal to the total amount of solvent in the solvent vial. \n \nScrew the syringe tightly onto the vial adapter on the solvent vial. Inject air into the vial by pushing \nthe plunger until you feel a clear resistance. \n \nHold the syringe with the solvent vial upside down. Pull the plunger to draw the solvent into the \nsyringe. \n \nRemove the empty solvent vial by tipping the syringe with the vial adapter. \n \nClick the vial adapter, still attached to the syringe onto the powder vial. Push the plunger slowly to \ninject the solvent into the powder vial. Make sure not to aim the stream of solvent directly at the \npowder as this will cause foaming. \n \nGently swirl the vial until all the powder is dissolved. Do not shake the vial as this will cause \nfoaming. NovoThirteen should be inspected visually for extraneous (for any foreign) particulate \nmatter and discoloration prior to administration. In the event of either being observed, discard the \nmedicinal product.  \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nReconstituted NovoThirteen is a clear, colourless solution. \n \nIf a larger dose is needed, repeat the procedure in a separate syringe until the required dose is reached. \n \nIf the patient weighs less than 24 kg, the reconstituted NovoThirteen should be diluted with 6 ml of \nsodium chloride 0.9%, solution for injection (refer to the section Use in the paediatric population for \nfurther detailed instructions on the dilution step).  \n \nImportant information \n \nOnce prepared, NovoThirteen for injection should be used immediately. \n \nInjecting the solution \n \nEnsure that the plunger is pushed all the way in before turning the syringe upside down (it may have \nbeen pushed out by the pressure in the vial). Hold the syringe with the vial upside down and pull the \nplunger to draw up the amount calculated for the injection. \n \nUnscrew the vial adapter with the vial. \n \nThe product is now ready for injection. \n \nSafely dispose of the syringe, vial adapter, infusion set and vials. Any unused medicinal product or \nwaste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \nUse in the paediatric population \n \nDilution of the reconstituted product with sodium chloride 0.9%, solution for injection \n \nIf the paediatric patient weighs less than 24 kg, the reconstituted NovoThirteen should be diluted with \n6 ml of sodium chloride 0.9%, solution for injection to be able to handle the dosing of small children \n(see section 4.2 â€˜Posology and method of administration â€“ Paediatric populationâ€™). \n \nTo dilute the reconstituted NovoThirteen the following tools are needed: a vial containing sodium \nchloride 0.9%, solution for injection, a 10 ml syringe and alcohol swabs. \n \nGeneral instructions for dilution \nThe dilution should be performed in accordance with aseptic rules.  \nCarefully draw exactly 6 ml sodium chloride 0.9%, solution for injection, into the 10 ml syringe. \nSlowly inject the 6 ml sodium chloride 0.9%, solution for injection, into the reconstituted \nNovoThirteen vial. \nGently swirl the vial to mix the solution. \nThe diluted solution is a clear, colourless solution. Check the injection solution for particulate matter \nand for discolouration. If either is noticed, please discard. \n \nAfter dilution proceed to the step â€˜Injecting the solutionâ€™. \n \nAny residual material of the diluted product has to be discarded immediately. \n \n \n7.

You may need to read it again. \nâ€“ If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \nâ€“ This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \nâ€“ If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What NovoThirteen is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use NovoThirteen \n3. How to use NovoThirteen \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store NovoThirteen \n6. Contents of the pack and other information. \n \n \n1. What NovoThirteen is and what it is used for \n \nWhat NovoThirteen is \nNovoThirteen contains the active substance catridecacog, which is identical to human coagulation \nfactor XIII, an enzyme necessary for blood clotting. NovoThirteen replaces the missing factor XIII \nand helps to stabilise the initial blood clot by producing a mesh around the clot. \n \nWhat NovoThirteen is used for \nNovoThirteen is used to prevent bleeding in patients who do not have enough or are missing part of \nfactor XIII (that is called A-subunit). \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use NovoThirteen \n \nDo not use NovoThirteen \nâ€¢ If you are allergic to catridecacog or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nIf you are not sure, ask your doctor before using this medicine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before using NovoThirteen: \nâ€¢ If you have or have ever had a higher risk of blood clots forming (thrombosis), as NovoThirteen \n\nmay increase the severity of a pre-existing blood clot. \nâ€¢ If you have or have ever had liver damage. \n \nContact your doctor immediately: \nâ€¢ If you experience bleeding during your treatment with NovoThirteen occurring spontaneously \n\nand/or requiring treatment. In this last case your doctor will prescribe an alternative treatment \nto treat the bleeding. \n\n\n\n23 \n\nâ€¢ If you experience an allergic reaction to NovoThirteen. The signs may include: hives, itching, \nswelling, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure (signs include paleness and coldness of skin, \nrapid heartbeat), feeling dizzy and sweating. \n\n \nOther medicines and NovoThirteen \nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \nIt is not recommended to use NovoThirteen and recombinant coagulation factor VIIa (another blood \nclotting factor) together. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a \nbaby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nNovoThirteen contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per injection, i.e. essentially â€˜sodium-freeâ€™. \n \n \n3. How to use NovoThirteen \n \nYour treatment with NovoThirteen should be initiated by a doctor experienced in the treatment of rare \nbleeding disorders. \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \nBefore you can use NovoThirteen for injection you need to reconstitute the product. Please see \nNovoThirteen user instructions. \n \nNovoThirteen is given as an injection into a vein. Your dose will depend on your body weight. The \nusual dose is 35 IU for each kilogram of body weight. The injections are given once a month (every \n28 Â± 2 days).  \nNovoThirteen should be injected at a rate not higher than 2 ml/minute. \n \nBased on the concentration of NovoThirteen solution, the dose volume to be injected (in millilitres) \ncan be calculated from this formula:  \nDose volume in millilitres = 0.042 x your body weight in kilograms. \n \nYou should only use the prescribed dose calculated by your doctor from this formula considering that \nthe usual dose and the concentration of NovoThirteen are different from those of the other products \nwhich contain factor XIII.  \nYour doctor may adapt the dose if this is deemed necessary. \n \nUse in small children \nFor children weighing less than 24 kg the reconstituted NovoThirteen should be further diluted with \n6 ml of sodium chloride 0.9%, solution for injection to be able to handle the dosing of small children. \nFor more information see section â€˜NovoThirteen user instructions â€“ Instructions of how to dilute the \nreconstituted NovoThirteenâ€™. \n \nThe dose volume for the reconstituted NovoThirteen diluted with 6 ml sodium chloride 0.9%, solution \nfor injection can be calculated from this formula: \n \nDose volume in millilitres = 0.117 x body weight in kilograms. \n \nUse in children and adolescents (weighing more than 24 kg) \nNovoThirteen can be used in children and adolescents in the same way as in adults. \n \nIf you use more NovoThirteen than you should \n\n\n\n24 \n\nThere is limited information on overdose with NovoThirteen. None of the reported cases have shown \nany signs of illness. Contact your doctor if you have injected more NovoThirteen than you have been \ninstructed. \n \nIf you forget to use NovoThirteen \nIf you forget an injection of NovoThirteen, talk to your doctor. Do not take a double dose to make up \nfor a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using NovoThirteen \nIf you stop using NovoThirteen, you are not protected against bleeding. Do not stop using \nNovoThirteen without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will explain what might happen if you stop \ntreatment and discuss other options with you. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSide effects include: \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \nâ€¢ Headache (most common side effect) \nâ€¢ Pain where the injection is given \nâ€¢ Pain in the legs and arms \nâ€¢ Increased amount of small protein fragments caused by break down of blood clots \nâ€¢ A drop in the number of some types of white blood cells. This means your body may be more \n\nprone to infections \nâ€¢ Development of antibodies against factor XIII which have no influence on the effect of the \n\ndrug. \n \nSide effects in children: \nThe side effects observed in children are the same as also observed in adults but the side effects may \nbe more common in children than in adults. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store NovoThirteen \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the outer carton after \nâ€˜EXP.â€™. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \nStore in a refrigerator (2Â°Câ€“8Â°C). \nDo not freeze. \n \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \n \nOnce prepared, NovoThirteen for injection should be used immediately. \n \nThe solution is clear and colourless. Do not use this medicine if there are particles in it or it is \ndiscoloured when reconstituted. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n25 \n\n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n \n6.

Clean the rubber stoppers on the vials with alcohol swabs and allow them to dry before use. \n \n\n \n \nThe product is reconstituted using the vial adapter included. \nRemove the protective paper from the vial adapter without taking the vial adapter out of the protective \ncap. Attach the vial adapter to the solvent vial (water for injections). Take care not to touch the spike \non the vial adapter. \n \nOnce attached, remove the protective cap from the vial adapter. \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n \nPull the plunger to draw in a volume of air equal to the total amount of solvent in the solvent vial. \n \n\n \n \nScrew the syringe tightly onto the vial adapter on the solvent vial. Inject air into the vial by pushing the \nplunger until you feel a clear resistance. \n \n\n \n \nHold the syringe with the solvent vial upside down. Pull the plunger to draw the solvent into the \nsyringe. \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n \nRemove the empty solvent vial by tipping the syringe with the vial adapter. \n \n\n \n \nClick the vial adapter, still attached to the syringe onto the powder vial. Hold the syringe slightly \ntilted with the vial facing downwards. Push the plunger slowly to inject the solvent into the powder \nvial. Make sure not to aim the stream of solvent directly at the powder as this will cause foaming. \n \n\n \n \nGently swirl the vial until all the powder is dissolved. Do not shake the vial as this will cause \nfoaming. \n \nNovoThirteen should be inspected visually for extraneous (for any foreign) particulate matter and \ndiscoloration prior to administration. In the event of either being observed, discard the medicinal \nproduct. \n \nReconstituted NovoThirteen is a clear, colourless solution. \nIf a larger dose is needed, repeat the procedure in a separate syringe until the required dose is reached. \n \nImportant information \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \nOnce prepared, NovoThirteen for injection should be used immediately. \n \nIn case a dilution of the reconstituted NovoThirteen is needed proceed to the section â€˜Dilution of the \nreconstituted product with sodium chloride 0.9%, solution for injectionâ€™.  \n \n\n \n \nEnsure that the plunger is pushed all the way in before turning the syringe upside down (it may have \nbeen pushed out by the pressure in the vial). Hold the syringe with the vial upside down and pull the \nplunger to draw up the amount calculated for the injection. \n \n\n \n \nUnscrew the vial adapter with the vial. \n \nThe product is now ready for injection in the vein. Follow the injection procedure as instructed by \nyour doctor. \n \nAfter the injection \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nSafely dispose of the syringe, vial adapter, infusion set and vials. Any unused medicinal product or \nwaste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \nInstructions of how to dilute the reconstituted NovoThirteen \n \nTo dilute the reconstituted NovoThirteen the following tools are needed: a vial containing sodium \nchloride 0.9%, solution for injection, a 10 ml syringe and alcohol swabs. \n \nGeneral instructions for dilution \n \nThe dilution should be performed in accordance with aseptic rules.  \nCarefully draw exactly 6 ml sodium chloride 0.9%, solution for injection, into the 10 ml syringe. \nSlowly inject the 6 ml sodium chloride 0.9%, solution for injection, into the reconstituted \nNovoThirteen vial. \nGently swirl the vial to mix the solution. \nThe diluted solution is a clear, colourless solution. Check the injection solution for particulate matter \nand for discolouration. If either is noticed, please discard. \n \nAfter dilution proceed to step H. \n \nAny residual material of the diluted product has to be discarded immediately. \n \nIn case of any questions ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
