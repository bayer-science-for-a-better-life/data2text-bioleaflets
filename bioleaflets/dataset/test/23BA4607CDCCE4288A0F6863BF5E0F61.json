NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nECALTA 100 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach vial contains 100 mg anidulafungin.\nThe reconstituted solution contains 3.33 mg/mL anidulafungin and the diluted solution contains \n0.77 mg/mL anidulafungin.\n\nExcipient with known effect: Fructose 102.5 mg per vial\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion. \nWhite to off-white solid. \nThe reconstituted solution has a pH of 3.5 to 5.5. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTreatment of invasive candidiasis in adults and paediatric patients aged 1 month to < 18 years (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with ECALTA should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of \ninvasive fungal infections.\n\nPosology\n\nSpecimens for fungal culture should be obtained prior to therapy. Therapy may be initiated before \nculture results are known and can be adjusted accordingly once they are available.\n\nAdult population (dosing and treatment duration)\nA single 200 mg loading dose should be administered on Day 1, followed by 100 mg daily thereafter. \nDuration of treatment should be based on the patient\u2019s clinical response.\n\nIn general, antifungal therapy should continue for at least 14 days after the last positive culture.\n\nThere are insufficient data to support the 100 mg dose for longer than 35 days of treatment.\n\nPatients with renal and hepatic impairment\nNo dosing adjustments are required for patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment. No \ndosing adjustments are required for patients with any degree of renal insufficiency, including those on \ndialysis. ECALTA can be given without regard to the timing of haemodialysis (see section 5.2).\n\nOther special populations\nNo dosing adjustments are required for adult patients based on gender, weight, ethnicity, HIV \npositivity, or elderly (see section 5.2).\n\n\n\n3\n\nPaediatric population (1 month to < 18 years) (dosing and treatment duration)\nA single loading dose of 3.0 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg) should be administered on Day 1 followed \nby a daily maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg) thereafter.\n\nDuration of treatment should be based on the patient\u2019s clinical response.\n\nIn general, antifungal therapy should continue for at least 14 days after the last positive culture.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of ECALTA have not been established in neonates (< 1 month old) (see \nsection 4.4). \n\nMethod of administration\n\nFor intravenous use only.\n\nECALTA should be reconstituted with water for injection to a concentration of 3.33 mg/mL and \nsubsequently diluted to a concentration of 0.77 mg/mL for the final infusion solution. For a paediatric \npatient, the volume of infusion solution required to deliver the dose will vary depending on the weight \nof the child. For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration (see \nsection 6.6).\n\nIt is recommended that ECALTA be administered at a rate of infusion that does not exceed\n1.1 mg/min (equivalent to 1.4 mL/min when reconstituted and diluted per instructions). Infusion \nassociated reactions are infrequent when the rate of anidulafungin infusion does not exceed \n1.1 mg/min (see section 4.4).\n\nECALTA must not be administered as a bolus injection.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nHypersensitivity to other medicinal products of the echinocandin class.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nECALTA has not been studied in patients with Candida endocarditis, osteomyelitis or meningitis.\n\nThe efficacy of ECALTA has only been evaluated in a limited number of neutropenic patients (see \nsection 5.1).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nTreatment with ECALTA in neonates (< 1 month old) is not recommended. Treating neonates requires \nconsideration for coverage of disseminated candidiasis including central nervous system (CNS); \nnonclinical infection models indicate that higher doses of anidulafungin are needed to achieve \nadequate CNS penetration (see section 5.3), resulting in higher doses of polysorbate 80, a formulation \nexcipient. High doses of polysorbates have been associated with potentially life-threatening toxicities \nin neonates as reported in the literature.\n\nThere is no clinical data to support the efficacy and safety of higher doses of anidulafungin than \nrecommended in 4.2.\n\nHepatic effects\n\nIncreased levels of hepatic enzymes have been seen in healthy subjects and patients treated with \nanidulafungin. In some patients with serious underlying medical conditions who were receiving \n\n\n\n4\n\nmultiple concomitant medicines along with anidulafungin, clinically significant hepatic abnormalities \nhave occurred. Cases of significant hepatic dysfunction, hepatitis, and hepatic failure were uncommon \nin clinical trials. Patients with increased hepatic enzymes during anidulafungin therapy should be \nmonitored for evidence of worsening hepatic function and evaluated for risk/benefit of continuing \nanidulafungin therapy.\n\nAnaphylactic reactions\n\nAnaphylactic reactions, including shock, were reported with the use of anidulafungin. If these \nreactions occur, anidulafungin should be discontinued and appropriate treatment administered.\n\nInfusion-related reactions\n\nInfusion-related adverse events have been reported with anidulafungin, including rash, urticaria, \nflushing, pruritus, dyspnoea, bronchospasm and hypotension. Infusion-related adverse events are \ninfrequent when the rate of anidulafungin infusion does not exceed 1.1 mg/min (see section 4.8).\n\nExacerbation of infusion-related reactions by co-administration of anaesthetics has been seen in a non-\nclinical (rat) study (see section 5.3). The clinical relevance of this is unknown. Nevertheless, care \nshould be taken when co-administering anidulafungin and anaesthetic agents.\n\nFructose content\n\nPatients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) should not be given this medicine unless strictly \nnecessary.\n\nBabies and young children (below 2 years of age) may not yet be diagnosed with HFI. Medicines \n(containing fructose) given intravenously may be life-threatening and should not be administered in \nthis population unless there is an overwhelming clinical need and no alternatives are available. A\ndetailed history with regard to HFI symptoms has to be taken of each patient prior to being given this \nmedicinal product.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nAnidulafungin is not a clinically relevant substrate, inducer, or inhibitor of cytochrome P450 \nisoenzymes (1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A). Of note, in vitro studies do not fully exclude \npossible in vivo interactions. \n\nDrug interaction studies were performed with anidulafungin and other medicinal products likely to be \nco-administered. No dosage adjustment of either medicinal product is recommended when \nanidulafungin is co-administered with ciclosporin, voriconazole or tacrolimus, and no dosage \nadjustment for anidulafungin is recommended when co-administered with amphotericin B or \nrifampicin.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data from the use of anidulafungin in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\n\nECALTA is not recommended during pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the \npotential risk to the foetus.\n\n\n\n5\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether anidulafungin is excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of anidulafungin in milk.\n\nA risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from ECALTA therapy taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\n\nFor anidulafungin, there were no effects on fertility in studies conducted in male and female rats (see \nsection 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNot relevant.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nInfusion-related adverse reactions have been reported with anidulafungin in clinical studies, including\nrash, pruritus, dyspnoea, bronchospasm, hypotension (common events), flushing, hot flush, and \nurticaria (uncommon events), summarized in Table 1 (see section 4.4).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe following table includes, the all-causality adverse reactions (MedDRA terms) from 840 subjects \nreceiving 100 mg anidulafungin with frequency corresponding to very common (\u22651/10), common \n(\uf0b31/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\uf0b31/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare \n(<1/10,000) and from spontaneous reports with frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 1.

The frequencies \nof certain hepatobiliary adverse events, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased and \naspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased appeared at a higher frequency (7-10%) in these paediatric \npatients than has been observed in adults (2%). Although chance or differences in underlying disease \nseverity may have contributed, it cannot be excluded that hepatobiliary adverse reactions occur more \nfrequently in paediatric patients compared to adults.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nAs with any overdose, general supportive measures should be utilised as necessary. In case of \noverdose, adverse reactions may occur as mentioned in section 4.8.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7\n\nDuring clinical trials, a single 400 mg dose of anidulafungin was inadvertently administered as a \nloading dose. No clinical adverse reactions were reported. No dose limiting toxicity was observed in a \nstudy of 10 healthy subjects administered a loading dose of 260 mg followed by 130 mg daily; 3 of the \n10 subjects experienced transient, asymptomatic transaminase elevations (\uf0a3 3 x Upper Limit of \nNormal (ULN)).\n\nDuring a paediatric clinical trial, one subject received two doses of anidulafungin that were 143% of \nthe expected dose. No clinical adverse reactions were reported.\n\nECALTA is not dialysable.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: \u2013 Antimycotics for systemic use, other antimycotics for systemic use.\nATC code: JO2AX06\n\nMechanism of action\n\nAnidulafungin is a semi-synthetic echinocandin, a lipopeptide synthesised from a fermentation product \nof Aspergillus nidulans.\n\nAnidulafungin selectively inhibits 1,3-\u03b2-D glucan synthase, an enzyme present in fungal, but not \nmammalian cells. This results in inhibition of the formation of 1,3-\uf062-D-glucan, an essential component \nof the fungal cell wall. Anidulafungin has shown fungicidal activity against Candida species and \nactivity against regions of active cell growth of the hyphae of Aspergillus fumigatus.\n\nActivity in vitro\n\nAnidulafungin exhibited in-vitro activity against C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei \nand C. tropicalis. For the clinical relevance of these findings see \u201cClinical efficacy and safety.\u201d \n\nIsolates with mutations in the hot spot regions of the target gene have been associated with clinical \nfailures or breakthrough infections. Most clinical cases involve caspofungin treatment. However, in \nanimal experiments these mutations confer cross resistance to all three echinocandins and therefore \nsuch isolates are classified as echinocandin resistant until further clinical experience are obtained \nconcerning anidulafungin.\n\nThe in vitro activity of anidulafungin against Candida species is not uniform. Specifically, for C. \nparapsilosis, the MICs of anidulafungin are higher than are those of other Candida species. A \nstandardized technique for testing the susceptibility of Candida species to anidulafungin as well as the \nrespective interpretative breakpoints has been established by European Committee on Antimicrobial \nSusceptibility Testing (EUCAST).\n\n\n\n8\n\nTable 2. EUCAST Breakpoints\nCandida Species MIC breakpoint (mg/L)\n\n\u2264S (Susceptible) >R (Resistant)\nCandida albicans 0.03 0.03\nCandida glabrata 0.06 0.06\nCandida tropicalis 0.06 0.06\nCandida krusei 0.06 0.06\nCandida parapsilosis 4 4\nOther Candida spp.1 Insufficient evidence\n1 Non-species related breakpoints have been determined mainly on the \nbasis of PK/PD data and are independent of MIC distributions of specific \nCandida species. They are for use only for organisms that do not have \nspecific breakpoints\n\nActivity in vivo\n\nParenterally administered anidulafungin was effective against Candida species in immunocompetent \nand immunocompromised mouse and rabbit models. Anidulafungin treatment prolonged survival and \nalso reduced the organ burden of Candida species, when determined at intervals from 24 to 96 hours \nafter the last treatment.\n\nExperimental infections included disseminated C. albicans infection in neutropenic rabbits, \noesophageal/oropharyngeal infection of neutropenic rabbits with fluconazole-resistant C. albicans and \ndisseminated infection of neutropenic mice with fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nCandidaemia and other forms of Invasive Candidiasis\nThe safety and efficacy of anidulafungin were evaluated in a pivotal Phase 3, randomised, double-\nblind, multicentre, multinational study of primarily non-neutropenic patients with candidaemia and a \nlimited number of patients with deep tissue Candida infections or with abscess-forming disease. \nPatients with Candida endocarditis, osteomyelitis or meningitis, or those with infection due to \nC. krusei, were specifically excluded from the study. Patients were randomised to receive either \nanidulafungin (200 mg intravenous loading dose followed by 100 mg intravenous daily) or \nfluconazole (800 mg intravenous loading dose followed by 400 mg intravenous daily), and were \nstratified by APACHE II score (\u226420 and >20) and the presence or absence of neutropenia. Treatment \nwas administered for at least 14 and not more than 42 days. Patients in both study arms were permitted \nto switch to oral fluconazole after at least 10 days of intravenous therapy, provided that they were able \nto tolerate oral medicinal products and were afebrile for at least 24 hours, and that the most recent \nblood cultures were negative for Candida species.\n\nPatients who received at least one dose of study medicinal products and who had a positive culture for \nCandida species from a normally sterile site before study entry were included in the modified intent-\nto-treat (MITT) population. In the primary efficacy analysis, global response in the MITT populations \nat the end of intravenous therapy, anidulafungin was compared to fluconazole in a pre-specified two-\nstep statistical comparison (non-inferiority followed by superiority). A successful global response \nrequired clinical improvement and microbiological eradication. Patients were followed for six weeks \nbeyond the end of all therapy.\n\nTwo hundred and fifty-six patients, ranging from 16 to 91 years in age, were randomised to treatment \nand received at least one dose of study medication. The most frequent species isolated at baseline were \nC. albicans (63.8% anidulafungin, 59.3% fluconazole), followed by C. glabrata (15.7%, 25.4%), \nC. parapsilosis (10.2%, 13.6%) and C. tropicalis (11.8%, 9.3%) - with 20, 13 and 15 isolates of the \nlast 3 species, respectively, in the anidulafungin group. The majority of patients had Apache II scores \n\u2264 20 and very few were neutropenic.\n\n\n\n9\n\nEfficacy data, both overall and by various subgroups, are presented below in Table 3.\n\nTable 3.

Patients were treated for at \nleast 14 days. In clinically stable patients, a switch to oral azole therapy was permitted after at least 5 \nto 10 days of treatment with anidulafungin. A total of 46 patients were included in the analysis. The \nmajority of patients had candidaemia only (84.8%; 39/46). The most common pathogens isolated at \nbaseline were C. tropicalis (34.8%; 16/46), C. krusei (19.6%; 9/46), C. parapsilosis (17.4%; 8/46), C.\nalbicans (15.2%; 7/46), and C. glabrata (15.2%; 7/46). The successful global response rate at End of \nIntravenous Treatment (primary endpoint) was 26/46 (56.5%) and End of All Treatment was 24/46 \n(52.2%). All-cause mortality up to the end of the study (6 Week Follow-up Visit) was 21/46 (45.7%).\n\n\n\n10\n\nThe efficacy of anidulafungin in adult neutropenic patients (defined as absolute neutrophil count \u2264 \n500 cells/mm3 at baseline) with invasive candidiasis was assessed in a prospective, double-blind, \nrandomized, controlled trial. Eligible patients received either anidulafungin (200 mg intravenous \nloading dose followed by 100 mg intravenous daily) or caspofungin (70 mg intravenous loading dose \nfollowed by 50 mg intravenous daily) (2:1 randomization). Patients were treated for at least 14 days. \nIn clinically stable patients, a switch to oral azole therapy was permitted after at least 10 days of study \ntreatment. A total of 14 neutropenic patients with microbiologically confirmed invasive candidiasis \n(MITT population) were enrolled in the study (11 anidulafungin; 3 caspofungin). The majority of \npatients had candidaemia only. The most common pathogens isolated at baseline were C. tropicalis \n(4 anidulafungin, 0 caspofungin), C. parapsilosis (2 anidulafungin, 1 caspofungin), C. krusei\n(2 anidulafungin, 1 caspofungin), and C. ciferrii (2 anidulafungin, 0 caspofungin). The successful \nglobal response rate at the End of Intravenous Treatment (primary endpoint) was 8/11 (72.7%) for \nanidulafungin and 3/3 (100.0%) for caspofungin (difference -27.3, 95% CI -80.9, 40.3); the successful \nglobal response rate at the End of All Treatment was 8/11 (72.7%) for anidulafungin and 3/3 (100.0%) \nfor caspofungin (difference -27.3, 95% CI -80.9, 40.3). All-cause mortality up to the 6 Week Follow-\nUp visit for anidulafungin (MITT population) was 4/11 (36.4%) and 2/3 (66.7%) for caspofungin.\n\nPatients with microbiologically confirmed invasive candidiasis (MITT population) and neutropenia \nwere identified in an analysis of pooled data from 4 similarly designed prospective, open-label, non-\ncomparative studies. The efficacy of anidulafungin (200 mg intravenous loading dose followed by \n100 mg intravenous daily) was assessed in 35 adult neutropenic patients defined as absolute neutrophil \ncount \u2264 500 cells/mm3 or WBC \u2264 500 cells/mm3 in 22 patients or classified by the investigator as \nneutropenic at baseline in 13 patients. All patients were treated for at least 14 days. In clinically stable \npatients, a switch to oral azole therapy was permitted after at least 5 to 10 days of treatment with \nanidulafungin. The majority of patients had candidaemia only (85.7%). The most common pathogens \nisolated at baseline were C. tropicalis (12 patients), C. albicans (7 patients), C. glabrata (7 patients), \nC. krusei (7 patients), and C. parapsilosis (6 patients). The successful global response rate at the End \nof Intravenous Treatment (primary endpoint) was 18/35 (51.4%) and 16/35 (45.7%) at the End of All \nTreatment. All-cause mortality by Day 28 was 10/35 (28.6%). The successful global response rate at\nEnd of Intravenous Treatment and End of All Treatment were both 7/13 (53.8%) in the 13 patients \nwith neutropenia assessed by investigators at baseline.\n\nAdditional Data in Patients with Deep Tissue Infections\n\nThe efficacy of anidulafungin (200 mg intravenous loading dose followed by 100 mg intravenous \ndaily) in adult patients with microbiologically confirmed deep tissue candidiasis was assessed in an \nanalysis of pooled data from 5 prospective studies (1 comparative and 4 open-label). Patients were\ntreated for at least 14 days. In the 4 open-label studies, a switch to oral azole therapy was permitted \nafter at least 5 to 10 days of treatment with anidulafungin. A total of 129 patients were included in the \nanalysis. Twenty one (16.3%) had concomitant candidaemia. The mean APACHE II score was 14.9 \n(range, 2 \u2013 44). The most common sites of infection included the peritoneal cavity (54.3%; 70 of 129), \nhepatobiliary tract (7.0%; 9 of 129), pleural cavity (5.4%; 7 of 129) and kidney (3.1%; 4 of 129). The \nmost common pathogens isolated from a deep tissue site at baseline were C. albicans (64.3%; 83 of \n129), C. glabrata (31.0%; 40 of 129), C. tropicalis (11.6%; 15 of 129), and C. krusei (5.4%; 7 of \n129). The successful global response rate at the end of intravenous treatment (primary endpoint) and \nend of all treatment and all-cause mortality up to the 6 week follow-up visit is shown in Table 5.\n\n\n\n11\n\nTable 5.

Patients were stratified by age (1 month to < 2 years, 2 to < 5 years, and 5 to\n< 18 years) and received once daily intravenous anidulafungin (3.0 mg/kg loading dose on Day 1, and \n1.5 mg/kg daily maintenance dose thereafter) for up to 35 days followed by an optional switch to oral \nfluconazole (6-12 mg/kg/day, maximum 800 mg/day). Patients were followed at 2 and 6 weeks after \nEOT. \n\nAmong 68 patients who received anidulafungin, 64 had microbiologically confirmed Candida\ninfection and were evaluated for efficacy in the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population. Overall, \n61 patients (92.2%) had Candida isolated from blood only. The most commonly isolated pathogens \nwere Candida albicans (25 [39.1%] patients), followed by Candida parapsilosis (17 [26.6%] patients), \nand Candida tropicalis (9 [14.1%] patients). A successful global response was defined as having both \na clinical response of success (cure or improvement) and a microbiological response of success \n(eradication or presumed eradication). The overall rates of successful global response in the MITT \npopulation are presented in Table 6.\n\nTable 6.

A low intersubject variability in systemic exposure (coefficient of variation \n~25%) was observed. The steady state was achieved on the first day after a loading dose (twice the \ndaily maintenance dose).\n\nDistribution\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin are characterised by a rapid distribution half-life (0.5-1 hour) \nand a volume of distribution, 30-50 l, which is similar to total body fluid volume. Anidulafungin is \nextensively bound (>99%) to human plasma proteins. No specific tissue distribution studies of \nanidulafungin have been done in humans. Therefore, no information is available about the penetration \nof anidulafungin into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or across the blood-brain barrier.  \n\nBiotransformation \n\nHepatic metabolism of anidulafungin has not been observed. Anidulafungin is not a clinically relevant \nsubstrate, inducer, or inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. It is unlikely that anidulafungin will \nhave clinically relevant effects on the metabolism of drugs metabolised by cytochrome P450 \nisoenzymes.\n\nAnidulafungin undergoes slow chemical degradation at physiologic temperature and pH to a ring-\nopened peptide that lacks antifungal activity. The in vitro degradation half-life of anidulafungin under \nphysiologic conditions is approximately 24 hours. In vivo, the ring-opened product is subsequently\nconverted to peptidic degradants and eliminated mainly through biliary excretion.\n\nElimination\n\nThe clearance of anidulafungin is about 1 l/h. Anidulafungin has a predominant elimination half-life of \napproximately 24 hours that characterizes the majority of the plasma concentration-time profile, and a \nterminal half-life of 40-50 hours that characterises the terminal elimination phase of the profile.\n\nIn a single-dose clinical study, radiolabeled (14C) anidulafungin (~88 mg) was administered to healthy \nsubjects. Approximately 30% of the administered radioactive dose was eliminated in the faeces over 9 \ndays, of which less than 10% was intact drug. Less than 1% of the administered radioactive dose was \nexcreted in the urine, indicating negligible renal clearance. Anidulafungin concentrations fell below \nthe lower limits of quantitation 6 days post-dose. Negligible amounts of drug-derived radioactivity \nwere recovered in blood, urine, and faeces 8 weeks post-dose.\n\nLinearity\n\nAnidulafungin displays linear pharmacokinetics across a wide range of once daily doses (15-130 mg).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPatients with fungal infections  \nThe pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin in patients with fungal infections are similar to those \nobserved in healthy subjects based on population pharmacokinetic analyses. With the 200/100 mg \ndaily dose regimen at an infusion rate of 1.1 mg/min, the steady state Cmax and trough \nconcentrations (Cmin) could reach approximately 7 and 3 mg/l, respectively, with an average \nsteady state AUC of approximately 110 mg\uf0d7h/l. \n\n\n\n13\n\nWeight\nAlthough weight was identified as a source of variability in clearance in the population \npharmacokinetic analysis, weight has little clinical relevance on the pharmacokinetics of \nanidulafungin.\n\nGender\nPlasma concentrations of anidulafungin in healthy men and women were similar. In multiple-dose \npatient studies, drug clearance was slightly faster (approximately 22%) in men.  \n\nElderly\nThe population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that median clearance differed slightly between the \nelderly group (patients \u2265 65, median CL = 1.07 l/h) and the non-elderly group (patients < 65, median \nCL = 1.22 l/h), however the range of clearance was similar.\n\nEthnicity\nAnidulafungin pharmacokinetics were similar among Caucasians, Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics.  \n\nHIV positivity\nDosage adjustments are not required based on HIV positivity, irrespective of concomitant anti-\nretroviral therapy.\n\nHepatic insufficiency \nAnidulafungin is not hepatically metabolised. Anidulafungin pharmacokinetics were examined in \nsubjects with Child-Pugh class A, B or C hepatic insufficiency. Anidulafungin concentrations were not \nincreased in subjects with any degree of hepatic insufficiency. Although a slight decrease in AUC was \nobserved in patients with Child-Pugh C hepatic insufficiency, the decrease was within the range of \npopulation estimates noted for healthy subjects.  \n\nRenal insufficiency\nAnidulafungin has negligible renal clearance (<1%). In a clinical study of subjects with mild, \nmoderate, severe or end stage (dialysis-dependent) renal insufficiency, anidulafungin \npharmacokinetics were similar to those observed in subjects with normal renal function. \nAnidulafungin is not dialysable and may be administered without regard to the timing of \nhemodialysis.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin after at least 5 daily doses were investigated in 24 \nimmunocompromised paediatric (2 to 11 years old) and adolescent (12 to 17 years old) patients with \nneutropenia. Steady state was achieved on the first day after a loading dose (twice the maintenance \ndose), and steady state Cmax and AUCss increase in a dose-proportional manner. Systemic exposure \nfollowing daily maintenance dose of 0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg/day in this population were comparable to \nthose observed in adults following 50 and 100 mg/day, respectively. Both regimens were well-\ntolerated by these patients. \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin was investigated in 66 paediatric patients (1 month to \n< 18 years) with ICC in a prospective, open-label, non-comparative paediatric study following \nadministration of 3.0 mg/kg loading dose and 1.5 mg/kg/day maintenance dose (see section 5.1).\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis of combined data from adult and paediatric patients \nwith ICC, the mean exposure parameters (AUC0-24,ss and Cmin,ss) at steady state in the overall paediatric \npatients across age groups (1 month to < 2 years, 2 to < 5 years, and 5 to < 18 years) were comparable \nto those in adults receiving 200 mg loading dose and 100 mg/day maintenance dose. Body weight \nadjusted CL (L/h/kg) and volume of distribution at steady state (L/kg) were similar across the age \ngroups.\n\n\n\n14\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIn 3 month studies, evidence of liver toxicity, including elevated enzymes and morphologic \nalterations, was observed in both rats and monkeys at doses 4- to 6-fold higher than the anticipated \nclinical therapeutic exposure. In vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies with anidulafungin provided no \nevidence of genotoxic potential. Long-term studies in animals have not been conducted to evaluate the \ncarcinogenic potential of anidulafungin.\n\nAdministration of anidulafungin to rats did not indicate any effects on reproduction, including male \nand female fertility.\n\nAnidulafungin crossed the placental barrier in rats and was detected in foetal plasma. \n\nEmbryo-foetal development studies were conducted with doses between 0.2- and 2-fold (rats) and \nbetween 1- and 4-fold (rabbits) the proposed therapeutic maintenance dose of 100 mg/day. \nAnidulafungin did not produce any drug-related developmental toxicity in rats at the highest dose \ntested. Developmental effects observed in rabbits (slightly reduced foetal weights) occurred only at the \nhighest dose tested, a dose that also produced maternal toxicity.\n\nThe concentration of anidulafungin in the brain was low (brain to plasma ratio of approximately 0.2) \nin uninfected adult and neonatal rats after a single dose. However, brain concentrations increased in \nuninfected neonatal rats after five daily doses (brain to plasma ratio of approximately 0.7). In multiple \ndose studies in rabbits with disseminated candidiasis and in mice with central nervous system (CNS)\nCandida infection, anidulafungin has been shown to reduce fungal burden in the brain. Results of \npharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies in rabbit models of disseminated candidiasis and \nhematogenous Candida meningoencephalitis indicated that higher doses of anidulafungin were needed \nto optimally treat infections of CNS tissues relative to non-CNS tissues (see section 4.4).\n\nRats were dosed with anidulafungin at three dose levels and anaesthetised within one hour using a \ncombination of ketamine and xylazine. Rats in the high dose group experienced infusion-related \nreactions that were exacerbated by anaesthesia. Some rats in the mid dose group experienced similar \nreactions but only after administration of anaesthesia. There were no adverse reactions in the low-dose \nanimals in the presence or absence of anaesthesia, and no infusion-related reactions in the mid-dose \ngroup in the absence of anaesthesia. \n\nStudies conducted in juvenile rats did not indicate a greater susceptibility to anidulafungin \nhepatotoxicity compared to adult animals.\n\n6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS\n\n6.1 List of excipients\n\nFructose \nMannitol \nPolysorbate 80\nTartaric acid \nSodium hydroxide (for pH-adjustment)\nHydrochloric acid (for pH-adjustment)\n\n6.2 Incompatibilities\n\nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products or electrolytes except those \nmentioned in section 6.6.\n\n\n\n15\n\n6.3 Shelf life\n\n3 years\n\nExcursions for 96 hours up to 25\u00baC are permitted, and the powder can be returned to refrigerated \nstorage.\n\nReconstituted solution\n\nThe reconstituted solution may be stored at up to 25\u00b0C for up to 24 hours.\n\nChemical and physical in-use stability of the reconstituted solution has been demonstrated for 24 hours\nat 25\u00baC.\n\nFrom a microbiological point of view, following good aseptic practices, the reconstituted solution can \nbe utilized for up to 24 hours when stored at 25\u00baC.\n\nInfusion solution\n\nThe infusion solution may be stored at 25\u00baC for 48 hours.\n\nDo not freeze.\n\nChemical and physical in-use stability of the infusion solution has been demonstrated for 48 hours at \n25\u00baC.\n\nFrom a microbiological point of view, following good aseptic practices, the infusion solution can be\nutilized for up to 48 hours from preparation when stored at 25\u00baC.\n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage\n\nStore in a refrigerator (2\uf0b0C \u2013 8\uf0b0C).\n\nFor storage conditions after reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3.\n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container\n\n30 mL Type 1 glass vial with an elastomeric stopper (butyl rubber with an inert polymer coating on \nthe product contact surface and lubricant on the top surface for easier machinability, or alternatively \nbromobutyl rubber with a lubricant) and aluminium seal with flip-off cap.\n\nPack size of 1 vial.\n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling\n\nThere are no special requirements for disposal.\n\nECALTA must be reconstituted with water for injection and subsequently diluted with ONLY sodium \nchloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose for infusion.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse.\n- If you or your child get any side effects, talk to your doctor, or pharmacist or nurse. This\n\nincludes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet: \n\n1. What ECALTA is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you or your child use ECALTA\n3. How to use ECALTA\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store ECALTA \n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What ECALTA is and what it is used for\n\nECALTA contains the active substance anidulafungin and is prescribed in adults and in paediatric \npatients aged 1 month to less than 18 years to treat a type of fungal infection of the blood or other \ninternal organs called invasive candidiasis. The infection is caused by fungal cells (yeasts) called \nCandida.\n\nECALTA belongs to a group of medicines called echinocandins. These medicines are used to treat \nserious fungal infections.\n\nECALTA prevents normal development of fungal cell walls. In the presence of ECALTA, fungal cells \nhave incomplete or defective cell walls, making them fragile or unable to grow.\n\n2. What you need to know before you or your child use ECALTA\n\nDo not use ECALTA\n- if you are allergic to anidulafungin, other echinocandins (e.g. caspofungin acetate), or any of the \n\nother ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse before using ECALTA.\n\nYour doctor may decide to monitor you\n- for liver function more closely if you develop liver problems during your treatment\n- if you are given anaesthetics during your treatment with ECALTA for signs of an allergic \n\nreaction such as itching, wheezing, blotchy skin\n- for signs of an infusion\u2013related reaction which could include a rash, hives, itching, redness\n- for shortness of breath/breathing difficulties, dizziness or lightheadedness\n\nChildren and adolescents\n\nECALTA should not be given to patients under 1 month of age.\n\n\n\n27\n\nOther medicines and ECALTA\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take any \nother medicines.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\nThe effect of ECALTA in pregnant women is not known. Therefore ECALTA is not recommended \nduring pregnancy. Effective contraception should be used in women of childbearing age. Contact your\ndoctor immediately if you become pregnant while taking ECALTA.\n\nThe effect of ECALTA in breast-feeding women is not known. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for \nadvice before taking ECALTA while breast-feeding.\n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicines.\n\nECALTA contains fructose\n\nThis medicine contains fructose (a type of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have \nan intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. \n\nIf you (or your child) have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic disorder, you (or your \nchild) must not receive this medicine. Patients with HFI cannot break down fructose in this medicine, \nwhich may cause serious side effects.\n\nYou must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you (or your child) have HFI or if your \nchild can no longer take sweet foods or drinks because they feel sick, vomit or get unpleasant effects \nsuch as bloating, stomach cramps or diarrhoea.\n\n3. How to use ECALTA\n\nECALTA will always be prepared and given to you or your child by a doctor or a healthcare \nprofessional (there is more information about the method of preparation at the end of the leaflet in the \nsection for medical and healthcare professionals only).\n\nFor use in adults, the treatment starts with 200 mg on the first day (loading dose). This will be \nfollowed by a daily dose of 100 mg (maintenance dose).  \n\nFor use in children and adolescents (age from 1 month to less than 18 years), the treatment starts with \n3.0 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg) on the first day (loading dose). This will be followed by a daily dose \nof 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg) (maintenance dose). The dose that is given depends on the \npatient\u2019s weight.\n\nECALTA should be given to you once a day, by slow infusion (a drip) into your vein. For adults, this\nwill take at least 1.5 hours for the maintenance dose and 3 hours for the loading dose. For children and \nadolescents, the infusion may take less time depending on the patient\u2019s weight.\n\nYour doctor will determine the duration of your treatment and how much ECALTA you will receive \neach day and will monitor your response and condition.\n\nIn general, your treatment should continue for at least 14 days after the last day Candida was found in \nyour blood.\n\n\n\n28\n\nIf you receive more ECALTA than you should\n\nIf you are concerned that you may have been given too much ECALTA, tell your doctor or another \nhealthcare professional immediately.\n\nIf you forgot to use ECALTA\n\nAs you will be given this medicine under close medical supervision, it is unlikely that a dose would be \nmissed.

adults, the treatment starts with 200 mg on the first day (loading dose). this will be followed by a daily dose of 100 mg (maintenance dose). for use in children and adolescents (age from 1 month to less than 18 years), the treatment starts with 3.0 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg) on the first day (loading dose). this will be followed by a daily dose of 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg) (maintenance dose). the dose that is given depends on the patient's weight. ecalta should be given to you once a day, by slow infusion (a drip) into your vein. for adults, this will take at least 1.5 hours for the maintenance dose and 3 hours for the loading dose. for children and adolescents, the infusion may take less time depending on the patient's weight. your doctor will determine the duration of your treatment and how much ecalta you will receive each day and will monitor your response and condition. in general, your treatment should continue for at least 14 days after the last day candida was found in your blood. if you receive more ecalta than you should if you are concerned that you may have been given too much ecalta, tell your doctor or another healthcare professional immediately. if you forgot to use ecalta as you will be given this medicine under close medical supervision, it is unlikely that a dose would be missed. however tell your doctor or pharmacist if you think that a dose has been forgotten. you should not be given a double dose by doctor. if you stop using ecalta you should not experience any effects from ecalta if your doctor stops ecalta treatment. your doctor may prescribe another medicine following your treatment with ecalta to continue treating your fungal infection or prevent it from returning. if your original symptoms come back, tell your doctor or another healthcare professional immediately. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, or pharmacist or nurse.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "ecalta", "Type":
