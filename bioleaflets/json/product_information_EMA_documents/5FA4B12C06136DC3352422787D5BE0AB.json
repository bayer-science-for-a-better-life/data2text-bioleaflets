This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nErelzi 25 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe. \n \nErelzi 50 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe. \n \nErelzi 50 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nErelzi 25 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 25 mg of etanercept. \n \nErelzi 50 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 50 mg of etanercept. \n \nErelzi 50 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen \nEach pre-filled pen contains 50 mg of etanercept. \n \nEtanercept is a human tumour necrosis factor receptor p75 Fc fusion protein produced by recombinant \nDNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian expression system. Etanercept is a \ndimer of a chimeric protein genetically engineered by fusing the extracellular ligand binding domain of \nhuman tumour necrosis factor receptor-2 (TNFR2/p75) to the Fc domain of human IgG1. This Fc \ncomponent contains the hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions, but not the CH1 region of IgG1. Etanercept \ncontains 934 amino acids and has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 150 kilodaltons. The \nspecific activity of etanercept is 1.7 x 106 units/mg. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) \n \nThe solution is clear or slightly opalescent, colourless to slightly yellowish. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRheumatoid arthritis  \nErelzi in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active \nrheumatoid arthritis in adults when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including \nmethotrexate (unless contraindicated), has been inadequate. \n \nErelzi can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment \nwith methotrexate is inappropriate. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n \n\nErelzi is also indicated in the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults \nnot previously treated with methotrexate. \n \nEtanercept, alone or in combination with methotrexate, has been shown to reduce the rate of progression \nof joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function. \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \nTreatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in \nchildren and adolescents from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have \nproved intolerant of, methotrexate. \n \nTreatment of psoriatic arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate \nresponse to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. \n \nTreatment of enthesitis-related arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an \ninadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, conventional therapy. \n \nEtanercept has not been studied in children aged less than 2 years. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \nTreatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous \ndisease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. Etanercept has been shown to \nimprove physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to reduce the rate of progression of \nperipheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the \ndisease. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) \nTreatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to \nconventional therapy. \n \nNon-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \nTreatment of adults with severe non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of \ninflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging \n(MRI) evidence, who have had an inadequate response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \n(NSAIDs). \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nTreatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who failed to respond to, or who have a \ncontraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy, including ciclosporin, methotrexate or \npsoralen and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA) (see section 5.1). \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \nTreatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years who \nare inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nErelzi treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis \nand treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing \nspondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis or paediatric plaque psoriasis. \nPatients treated with Erelzi should be given the Patient Card. \n \nErelzi is available in strengths of 25 mg and 50 mg. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n \n\nPosology \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n25 mg etanercept administered twice weekly is the recommended dose. Alternatively, 50 mg \nadministered once weekly has been shown to be safe and effective (see section 5.1). \n \nPsoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \nThe recommended dose is 25 mg etanercept administered twice weekly, or 50 mg administered once \nweekly. \n \nFor all of the above indications, available data suggest that a clinical response is usually achieved within \n12 weeks of treatment. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding \nwithin this time period. \n \nPlaque psoriasis \nThe recommended dose of etanercept is 25 mg administered twice weekly or 50 mg administered once \nweekly. Alternatively, 50 mg given twice weekly may be used for up to 12 weeks followed, if \nnecessary, by a dose of 25 mg twice weekly or 50 mg once weekly. Treatment with etanercept should \ncontinue until remission is achieved, for up to 24 weeks. Continuous therapy beyond 24 weeks may be \nappropriate for some adult patients (see section 5.1). Treatment should be discontinued in patients who \nshow no response after 12 weeks. If re-treatment with etanercept is indicated, the same guidance on \ntreatment duration should be followed. The dose should be 25 mg twice weekly or 50 mg once weekly. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required. \n \nElderly  \nNo dose adjustment is required. Posology and administration are the same as for adults 18–64 years of \nage. \n \nPaediatric population \nErelzi is only available as 25 mg pre-filled syringe and 50 mg pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen. \nThus, it is not possible to administer Erelzi to paediatric patients that require less than a full 25 mg or \n50 mg dose. Paediatric patients who require a dose other than a full 25 mg or 50 mg should not receive \nErelzi. If an alternate dose is required, other etanercept products offering such an option should be used. \nThe dosage of etanercept is based on body weight for paediatric patients. Patients weighing less than \n62.5 kg should be accurately dosed on a mg/kg basis using the powder and solvent for solution for \ninjection presentations or the powder for solution for injection presentations (see below for dosing for \nspecific indications). Patients weighing 62.5 kg or more may be dosed using a fixed-dose pre-filled \nsyringe or pre-filled pen. \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \nThe recommended dose is 0.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 25 mg per dose), given twice weekly as a \nsubcutaneous injection with an interval of 3–4 days between doses or 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of \n50 mg per dose) given once weekly. Discontinuation of treatment should be considered in patients who \nshow no response after 4 months. \n \nA 10 mg vial strength may be more appropriate for administration to children with JIA below the \nweight of 25 kg. \n \nNo formal clinical trials have been conducted in children aged 2 to 3 years. However, limited safety \ndata from a patient registry suggest that the safety profile in children from 2 to 3 years of age is similar \nto that seen in adults and children aged 4 years and older, when dosed every week with 0.8 mg/kg \nsubcutaneously (see section 5.1). \n\n\n\n5 \n \n \n\n \nThere is generally no applicable use of etanercept in children aged below 2 years in the indication \njuvenile idiopathic arthritis. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis (age 6 years and above) \nThe recommended dose is 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly for up to \n24 weeks. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who show no response after 12 weeks. \n \nIf re-treatment with etanercept is indicated, the above guidance on treatment duration should be \nfollowed. The dose should be 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly. \n \nThere is generally no applicable use of etanercept in children aged below 6 years in the indication \nplaque psoriasis. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nErelzi is administered by subcutaneous injection (see section 6.6). \n \nComprehensive instructions for administration are given in the package leaflet, section 7, \"Instructions \nfor use of the Erelzi pre-filled syringe” or “Instructions for use of the Erelzi SensoReady pen”. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nSepsis or risk of sepsis. \n \nTreatment with Erelzi should not be initiated in patients with active infections, including chronic or \nlocalised infections. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nInfections \nPatients should be evaluated for infections before, during, and after treatment with Erelzi, taking into \nconsideration that the mean elimination half-life of etanercept is approximately 70 hours (range 7 to \n300 hours). \n \nSerious infections, sepsis, tuberculosis, and opportunistic infections, including invasive fungal \ninfections, listeriosis and legionellosis, have been reported with the use of etanercept (see section 4.8). \nThese infections were due to bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites (including protozoa). \nIn some cases, particular fungal and other opportunistic infections have not been recognised, resulting in \ndelay of appropriate treatment and sometimes death. In evaluating patients for infections, the patient’s \nrisk for relevant opportunistic infections (e.g., exposure to endemic mycoses) should be considered. \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Erelzi should be monitored \nclosely. Administration of Erelzi should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. The \nsafety and efficacy of etanercept in patients with chronic infections have not been evaluated. Physicians \nshould exercise caution when considering the use of Erelzi in patients with a history of recurring or \nchronic infections or with underlying conditions that may predispose patients to infections, such as \nadvanced or poorly controlled diabetes. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n \n\nTuberculosis \nCases of active tuberculosis, including miliary tuberculosis and tuberculosis with extra-pulmonary \nlocation, have been reported in patients treated with etanercept. \n \nBefore starting treatment with Erelzi, all patients must be evaluated for both active and inactive \n(‘latent’) tuberculosis. This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with personal history of \ntuberculosis or possible previous contact with tuberculosis and previous and/or current \nimmunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests, i.e., tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray, \nshould be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is recommended that the \nconduct of these tests should be recorded in the Patient Card. Prescribers are reminded of the risk of \nfalse negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or \nimmunocompromised. \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Erelzi therapy must not be initiated. If inactive (‘latent’) tuberculosis \nis diagnosed, treatment for latent tuberculosis must be started with anti-tuberculosis therapy before the \ninitiation of Erelzi, and in accordance with local recommendations. In this situation, the benefit/risk \nbalance of Erelzi therapy should be very carefully considered. \n \nAll patients should be informed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis \n(e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low-grade fever) appear during or after Erelzi treatment. \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \nReactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were previously infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) \nand had received concomitant TNF-antagonists, including etanercept, has been reported. This includes \nreports of reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were anti-HBc positive but HBsAg negative. \nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Erelzi. For patients who test \npositive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B \nis recommended. Caution should be exercised when administering Erelzi in patients previously infected \nwith HBV. These patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection \nthroughout therapy and for several weeks following termination of therapy. Adequate data from treating \npatients infected with HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy are not \navailable. In patients who develop HBV infection, Erelzi should be stopped and effective anti-viral \ntherapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. \n \nWorsening of hepatitis C \nThere have been reports of worsening of hepatitis C in patients receiving etanercept. Erelzi should be \nused with caution in patients with a history of hepatitis C. \n \nConcurrent treatment with anakinra \nConcurrent administration of etanercept and anakinra has been associated with an increased risk of \nserious infections and neutropenia compared to etanercept alone. This combination has not \ndemonstrated increased clinical benefit. Thus, the combined use of Erelzi and anakinra is not \nrecommended (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nConcurrent treatment with abatacept \nIn clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and etanercept resulted in increased \nincidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit; \nsuch use is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nAllergic reactions \nAllergic reactions associated with etanercept administration have been reported commonly. Allergic \nreactions have included angioedema and urticaria; serious reactions have occurred. If any serious \nallergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, Erelzi therapy should be discontinued immediately and \nappropriate therapy initiated. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n \n \n\nImmunosuppression \nThe possibility exists for TNF-antagonists, including Erelzi, to affect host defences against infections \nand malignancies since TNF mediates inflammation and modulates cellular immune responses. In a \nstudy of 49 adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with etanercept, there was no evidence of \ndepression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or change in \nenumeration of effector cell populations. \n \nTwo juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients developed varicella infection and signs and symptoms of \naseptic meningitis, which resolved without sequelae. Patients with a significant exposure to varicella \nvirus should temporarily discontinue Erelzi therapy and be considered for prophylactic treatment with \nVaricella Zoster Immune Globulin. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of etanercept in patients with immunosuppression have not been evaluated.  \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nSolid and haematopoietic malignancies (excluding skin cancers) \n \nReports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have been \nreceived in the post-marketing period (see section 4.8). \n \nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of lymphoma have been \nobserved among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients. However, the \noccurrence was rare, and the follow-up period of placebo patients was shorter than for patients receiving \nTNF-antagonist therapy. In the post-marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been reported in \npatients treated with TNF-antagonists. There is an increased background risk for lymphoma and \nleukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, \nwhich complicates risk estimation. \n \nBased on current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia or other \nhaematopoietic or solid malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. \nCaution should be exercised when considering TNF-antagonist therapy for patients with a history of \nmalignancy or when considering continuing treatment in patients who develop a malignancy. \n \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including \netanercept, in the post-marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other \ncases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies typically associated \nwith immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents \ntreated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded. \n \nSkin cancers \nMelanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) have been reported in patients treated with \nTNF-antagonists, including etanercept. Post-marketing cases of Merkel cell carcinoma have been \nreported very infrequently in patients treated with etanercept. Periodic skin examination is \nrecommended for all patients, particularly those with risk factors for skin cancer. \n \nCombining the results of controlled clinical trials, more cases of NMSC were observed in patients \nreceiving etanercept compared with control patients, particularly in patients with psoriasis. \n \nVaccinations \nLive vaccines should not be given concurrently with Erelzi. No data are available on the secondary \ntransmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving etanercept. In a double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled, randomised clinical study in adult patients with psoriatic arthritis, 184 patients also \nreceived a multivalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at week 4. In this study, most psoriatic \narthritis patients receiving etanercept were able to mount effective B-cell immune response to \n\n\n\n8 \n \n \n\npneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, but titres in aggregate were moderately lower, and few patients \nhad two-fold rises in titres compared to patients not receiving etanercept. The clinical significance of \nthis is unknown. \n \nAutoantibody formation \nTreatment with Erelzi may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies (see section 4.8). \n \nHaematologic reactions \nRare cases of pancytopenia and very rare cases of aplastic anaemia, some with fatal outcome, have been \nreported in patients treated with etanercept. Caution should be exercised in patients being treated with \nErelzi who have a previous history of blood dyscrasias. All patients and parents/caregivers should be \nadvised that if the patient develops signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infections \n(e.g., persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding, paleness) whilst on Erelzi, they should seek \nimmediate medical advice. Such patients should be investigated urgently, including full blood count; if \nblood dyscrasias are confirmed, Erelzi should be discontinued. \n \nNeurological disorders \nThere have been rare reports of CNS demyelinating disorders in patients treated with etanercept (see \nsection 4.8). Additionally, there have been rare reports of peripheral demyelinating polyneuropathies \n(including Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, \ndemyelinating polyneuropathy, and multifocal motor neuropathy). Although no clinical trials have been \nperformed evaluating etanercept therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis, clinical trials of other TNF \nantagonists in patients with multiple sclerosis have shown increases in disease activity. A careful \nrisk/benefit evaluation, including a neurologic assessment, is recommended when prescribing Erelzi to \npatients with pre-existing or recent onset of demyelinating disease, or to those who are considered to \nhave an increased risk of developing demyelinating disease. \n \nCombination therapy \nIn a controlled clinical trial of two years duration in rheumatoid arthritis patients, the combination of \netanercept and methotrexate did not result in unexpected safety findings, and the safety profile of \netanercept when given in combination with methotrexate was similar to the profiles reported in studies \nof etanercept and methotrexate alone. Long-term studies to assess the safety of the combination are \nongoing. The long-term safety of etanercept in combination with other disease-modifying antirheumatic \ndrugs (DMARD) has not been established. \n \nThe use of etanercept in combination with other systemic therapies or phototherapy for the treatment of \npsoriasis has not been studied. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nBased on pharmacokinetic data (see section 5.2), no dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal or \nhepatic impairment; clinical experience in such patients is limited. \n \nCongestive heart failure (Cardiac failure congestive) \nPhysicians should use caution when using Erelzi in patients who have congestive heart failure (CHF). \nThere have been post-marketing reports of worsening of CHF, with and without identifiable \nprecipitating factors, in patients taking etanercept. There have also been rare (< 0.1%) reports of new \nonset CHF, including CHF in patients without known pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Some of \nthese patients have been under 50 years of age. Two large clinical trials evaluating the use of etanercept \nin the treatment of CHF were terminated early due to lack of efficacy. Although not conclusive, data \nfrom one of these trials suggest a possible tendency toward worsening CHF in those patients assigned to \netanercept treatment. \n \nAlcoholic hepatitis \nIn a phase II randomised placebo-controlled study of 48 hospitalised patients treated with etanercept or \nplacebo for moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis, etanercept was not efficacious, and the mortality rate \nin patients treated with etanercept was significantly higher after 6 months. Consequently, Erelzi should \n\n\n\n9 \n \n \n\nnot be used in patients for the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. Physicians should use caution when using \nErelzi in patients who also have moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis. \n \nWegener's granulomatosis \nA placebo-controlled trial, in which 89 adult patients were treated with etanercept in addition to \nstandard therapy (including cyclophosphamide or methotrexate, and glucocorticoids) for a median \nduration of 25 months, has not shown etanercept to be an effective treatment for Wegener’s \ngranulomatosis. The incidence of non-cutaneous malignancies of various types was significantly higher \nin patients treated with etanercept than in the control group. Erelzi is not recommended for the treatment \nof Wegener’s granulomatosis. \n \nHypoglycaemia in patients treated for diabetes \nThere have been reports of hypoglycaemia following initiation of etanercept in patients receiving \nmedicinal product for diabetes, necessitating a reduction in anti-diabetic medicinal products in some of \nthese patients. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly  \n \nIn the Phase 3 studies in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, no overall \ndifferences in adverse events, serious adverse events, and serious infections in patients age 65 or older \nwho received etanercept were observed compared with younger patients. However, caution should be \nexercised when treating the elderly and particular attention paid with respect to occurrence of infections. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nVaccinations \nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating Erelzi therapy (see Vaccinations, \nabove). \n \nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and uveitis in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) \nThere have been reports of IBD and uveitis in JIA patients being treated with etanercept (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nErelzi contains sodium \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 25mg or 50 mg, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcurrent treatment with anakinra \nAdult patients treated with etanercept and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious \ninfection when compared with patients treated with either etanercept or anakinra alone (historical data). \n \nIn addition, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients receiving background \nmethotrexate, patients treated with etanercept and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of \nserious infections (7%) and neutropenia than patients treated with etanercept (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \nThe combination etanercept and anakinra has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit, and is \ntherefore not recommended. \n \nConcurrent treatment with abatacept \nIn clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and etanercept resulted in increased \nincidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit; \nsuch use is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n10 \n \n \n\n \nConcurrent treatment with sulfasalazine \nIn a clinical study of adult patients who were receiving established doses of sulfasalazine, to which \netanercept was added, patients in the combination group experienced a statistically significant decrease \nin mean white blood cell counts in comparison to groups treated with etanercept or sulfasalazine alone. \nThe clinical significance of this interaction is unknown. Physicians should use caution when considering \ncombination therapy with sulfasalazine. \n \nNon-interactions \nIn clinical trials, no interactions have been observed when etanercept was administered with \nglucocorticoids, salicylates (except sulfasalazine), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), \nanalgesics, or methotrexate. See section 4.4 for vaccination advice. \n \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions were observed in studies with \nmethotrexate, digoxin or warfarin. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of appropriate contraception to avoid \nbecoming pregnant during Erelzi therapy and for three weeks after discontinuation of therapy. \n \nPregnancy \nDevelopmental toxicity studies performed in rats and rabbits have revealed no evidence of harm to the \nfoetus or neonatal rat due to etanercept. The effects of etanercept on pregnancy outcomes have been \ninvestigated in two observational cohort studies. A higher rate of major birth defects was observed in \none observational study comparing pregnancies exposed to etanercept (n = 370) during the first \ntrimester with pregnancies not exposed to etanercept or other TNF-antagonists (n = 164) (adjusted odds \nratio 2.4, 95% CI: 1.0 - 5.5). The types of major birth defects were consistent with those most \ncommonly reported in the general population and no particular pattern of abnormalities was identified. \nNo change in the rate of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or minor malformations was observed. In \nanother observational multi-country registry study comparing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in \nwomen exposed to etanercept during the first 90 days of pregnancy (n = 425) to those exposed to non-\nbiologic drugs (n = 3497), there was no observed increased risk of major birth defects (crude odds ratio \n[OR] = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.79 - 1.90; adjusted OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.58 - 1.60 after adjusting for country, \nmaternal disease, parity, maternal age and smoking in early pregnancy). This study also showed no \nincreased risks of minor birth defects, preterm birth, stillbirth, or infections in the first year of life for \ninfants born to women exposed to etanercept during pregnancy.  Erelzi should only be used during \npregnancy if clearly needed. \n \nEtanercept crosses the placenta and has been detected in the serum of infants born to female patients \ntreated with etanercept during pregnancy. The clinical impact of this is unknown, however, infants may \nbe at increased risk of infection. Administration of live vaccines to infants for 16 weeks after the \nmother’s last dose of Erelzi is generally not recommended. \n \nBreast-feeding \nEtanercept has been reported to be excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration. In \nlactating rats following subcutaneous administration, etanercept was excreted in the milk and detected \nin the serum of pups. Because immunoglobulins, in common with many medicinal products, can be \nexcreted in human milk, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \ndiscontinue Erelzi therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit \nof therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \nPreclinical data about peri- and postnatal toxicity of etanercept and of effects of etanercept on fertility \nand general reproductive performance are not available. \n\n\n\n11 \n \n \n\n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are injection site reactions (such as pain, swelling, \nitching, reddening and bleeding at the puncture site), infections (such as upper respiratory infections, \nbronchitis, bladder infections and skin infections), allergic reactions, development of autoantibodies, \nitching, and fever. \n \nSerious adverse reactions have also been reported for etanercept. TNF-antagonists, such as etanercept, \naffect the immune system and their use may affect the body’s defences against infection and cancer. \nSerious infections affect fewer than 1 in 100 patients treated with etanercept. Reports have included \nfatal and life-threatening infections and sepsis. Various malignancies have also been reported with use \nof etanercept, including cancers of the breast, lung, skin and lymph glands (lymphoma). \n \nSerious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These include \nrare reports of pancytopenia and very rare reports of aplastic anaemia. Central and peripheral \ndemyelinating events have been seen rarely and very rarely, respectively, with etanercept use. There \nhave been rare reports of lupus, lupus-related conditions, and vasculitis. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials in adults and on \npost-marketing experience. \n \nWithin the system organ classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of \npatients expected to experience the reaction), using the following categories: very common (≥ 1/10);

The observed rates and incidences in these clinical trials were similar to those \nexpected for the population studied. A total of 2 malignancies were reported in clinical studies of \napproximately 2 years duration involving 240 etanercept-treated psoriatic arthritis patients. In clinical \nstudies conducted for more than 2 years with 351 ankylosing spondylitis patients, 6 malignancies were \nreported in etanercept-treated patients. In a group of 2,711 plaque psoriasis patients treated with \netanercept in double-blind and open-label studies of up to 2.5 years, 30 malignancies and \n43 non-melanoma skin cancers were reported. \n \nIn a group of 7,416 patients treated with etanercept in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing \nspondylitis and psoriasis clinical trials, 18 lymphomas were reported. \n \nReports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have also been \nreceived in the post-marketing period (see section 4.4). \n \nInjection site reactions \n\n\n\n14 \n \n \n\nCompared to placebo, patients with rheumatic diseases treated with etanercept had a significantly higher \nincidence of injection site reactions (36% vs. 9%). Injection site reactions usually occurred in the first \nmonth. Mean duration was approximately 3 to 5 days. No treatment was given for the majority of \ninjection site reactions in the etanercept treatment groups, and the majority of patients who were given \ntreatment received topical preparations, such as corticosteroids, or oral antihistamines. Additionally, \nsome patients developed recall injection site reactions characterised by a skin reaction at the most recent \nsite of injection, along with the simultaneous appearance of injection site reactions at previous injection \nsites. These reactions were generally transient and did not recur with treatment. \n \nIn controlled trials in patients with plaque psoriasis, approximately 13.6% of patients treated with \netanercept developed injection site reactions compared with 3.4% of placebo-treated patients during the \nfirst 12 weeks of treatment. \n \nSerious infections \nIn placebo-controlled trials, no increase in the incidence of serious infections (fatal, life-threatening, or \nrequiring hospitalisation or intravenous antibiotics) was observed. Serious infections occurred in 6.3% \nof rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with etanercept for up to 48 months. These included abscess (at \nvarious sites), bacteraemia, bronchitis, bursitis, cellulitis, cholecystitis, diarrhoea, diverticulitis, \nendocarditis (suspected), gastroenteritis, hepatitis B, herpes zoster, leg ulcer, mouth infection, \nosteomyelitis, otitis, peritonitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, sepsis, septic arthritis, sinusitis, skin \ninfection, skin ulcer, urinary tract infection, vasculitis, and wound infection. In a 2-year \nactive-controlled study where patients were treated with either etanercept alone, methotrexate alone or \netanercept in combination with methotrexate, the rates of serious infections were similar among the \ntreatment groups. However, it cannot be excluded that the combination of etanercept with methotrexate \ncould be associated with an increase in the rate of infections. \n \nThere were no differences in rates of infection among patients treated with etanercept and those treated \nwith placebo for plaque psoriasis in placebo-controlled trials of up to 24 weeks duration. Serious \ninfections experienced by etanercept-treated patients included cellulitis, gastroenteritis, pneumonia, \ncholecystitis, osteomyelitis, gastritis, appendicitis, Streptococcal fasciitis, myositis, septic shock, \ndiverticulitis and abscess. In the double-blind and open-label psoriatic arthritis trials, 1 patient reported \na serious infection (pneumonia). \n \nSerious and fatal infections have been reported during use of etanercept; reported pathogens include \nbacteria, mycobacteria (including tuberculosis), viruses and fungi. Some have occurred within a few \nweeks after initiating treatment with etanercept in patients who have underlying conditions (e.g., \ndiabetes, congestive heart failure, history of active or chronic infections) in addition to their rheumatoid \narthritis (see section 4.4). Etanercept treatment may increase mortality in patients with established \nsepsis. \n \nOpportunistic infections have been reported in association with etanercept, including invasive fungal, \nparasitic (including protozoal), viral (including herpes zoster), bacterial (including Listeria and \nLegionella), and atypical mycobacterial infections. In a pooled data set of clinical trials, the overall \nincidence of opportunistic infections was 0.09% for the 15,402 subjects who received etanercept. The \nexposure-adjusted rate was 0.06 events per 100 patient-years. In post-marketing experience, \napproximately half of all of the case reports of opportunistic infections worldwide were invasive fungal \ninfections. The most commonly reported invasive fungal infections included Candida, Pneumocystis, \nAspergillus and Histoplasma. Invasive fungal infections accounted for more than half of the fatalities \namongst patients who developed opportunistic infections. The majority of the reports with a fatal \noutcome were in patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia, unspecified systemic fungal infections, and \naspergillosis (see section 4.4). \n \nAutoantibodies \nAdult patients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple timepoints. Of the rheumatoid \narthritis patients evaluated for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), the percentage of patients who developed \nnew positive ANA (≥ 1:40) was higher in patients treated with etanercept (11%) than in placebo-treated \n\n\n\n15 \n \n \n\npatients (5%). The percentage of patients who developed new positive anti-double-stranded DNA \nantibodies was also higher by radioimmunoassay (15% of patients treated with etanercept compared to \n4% of placebo-treated patients) and by Crithidia luciliae assay (3% of patients treated with etanercept \ncompared to none of placebo-treated patients). The proportion of patients treated with etanercept who \ndeveloped anticardiolipin antibodies was similarly increased compared to placebo-treated patients. The \nimpact of long-term treatment with etanercept on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. \n \nThere have been rare reports of patients, including rheumatoid factor positive patients, who have \ndeveloped other autoantibodies in conjunction with a lupus-like syndrome or rashes that are compatible \nwith subacute cutaneous lupus or discoid lupus by clinical presentation and biopsy. \n \nPancytopenia and aplastic anaemia \nThere have been post-marketing reports of pancytopenia and aplastic anaemia, some of which had fatal \noutcomes (see section 4.4). \n \nInterstitial lung disease \nIn controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of \ninterstitial lung disease in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.06% \n(frequency rare). In the controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept and \nmethotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of interstitial lung disease was 0.47% (frequency \nuncommon). There have been post-marketing reports of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis \nand pulmonary fibrosis), some of which had fatal outcomes. \n \nConcurrent treatment with anakinra \nIn studies when adult patients received concurrent treatment with etanercept plus anakinra, a higher rate \nof serious infections compared to etanercept alone was observed and 2% of patients (3/139) developed \nneutropenia (absolute neutrophil count ˂ 1,000/mm3). While neutropenic, one patient developed \ncellulitis that resolved after hospitalisation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nElevated liver enzymes \nIn the double-blind periods of controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency \n(incidence proportion) of adverse events of elevated liver enzymes in patients receiving etanercept \nwithout concomitant methotrexate was 0.54% (frequency uncommon). In the double-blind periods of \ncontrolled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept and methotrexate, the \nfrequency (incidence proportion) of adverse events of elevated liver enzymes was 4.18% (frequency \ncommon). \n \nAutoimmune hepatitis \nIn controlled clinical trials of etanercept across all indications, the frequency (incidence proportion) of \nautoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving etanercept without concomitant methotrexate was 0.02% \n(frequency rare). In the controlled clinical trials that allowed concomitant treatment with etanercept and \nmethotrexate, the frequency (incidence proportion) of autoimmune hepatitis was 0.24% (frequency \nuncommon).  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nUndesirable effects in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis  \nIn general, the adverse events in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis were similar in \nfrequency and type to those seen in adult patients. Differences from adults and other special \nconsiderations are discussed in the following paragraphs. \n \nThe types of infections seen in clinical trials in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients aged 2 to 18 years \nwere generally mild to moderate and consistent with those commonly seen in outpatient paediatric \npopulations. Severe adverse events reported included varicella with signs and symptoms of aseptic \nmeningitis, which resolved without sequelae (see also section 4.4), appendicitis, gastroenteritis, \n\n\n\n16 \n \n \n\ndepression/personality disorder, cutaneous ulcer, oesophagitis/gastritis, group A streptococcal septic \nshock, type I diabetes mellitus, and soft tissue and post-operative wound infection. \n \nIn one study in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis aged 4 to 17 years, 43 of 69 (62%) children \nexperienced an infection while receiving etanercept during 3 months of the study (part 1, open-label), \nand the frequency and severity of infections was similar in 58 patients completing 12 months of \nopen-label extension therapy. The types and proportion of adverse events in juvenile idiopathic arthritis \npatients were similar to those seen in trials of etanercept in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and \nthe majority were mild. Several adverse events were reported more commonly in 69 juvenile idiopathic \narthritis patients receiving 3 months of etanercept compared to the 349 adult rheumatoid arthritis \npatients. These included headache (19% of patients, 1.7 events per patient year), nausea (9%, 1.0 event \nper patient year), abdominal pain (19%, 0.74 events per patient year), and vomiting (13%, 0.74 events \nper patient year). \n \nThere were 4 reports of macrophage activation syndrome in juvenile idiopathic arthritis clinical trials.  \n \nThere have been reports of inflammatory bowel disease and uveitis in JIA patients being treated with \netanercept from post-marketing sources, including a very small number of cases indicating a positive \nrechallenge (see section 4.4). \n \nUndesirable effects in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis  \nIn a 48-week study in 211 children aged 4 to 17 years with paediatric plaque psoriasis, the adverse \nevents reported were similar to those seen in previous studies in adults with plaque psoriasis. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed \nin Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo dose-limiting toxicities were observed during clinical trials of rheumatoid arthritis patients. The \nhighest dose level evaluated has been an intravenous loading dose of 32 mg/m2 followed by \nsubcutaneous doses of 16 mg/m2 administered twice weekly. One rheumatoid arthritis patient \nmistakenly self-administered 62 mg etanercept subcutaneously twice weekly for 3 weeks without \nexperiencing undesirable effects. There is no known antidote to etanercept. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors, \nATC code: L04AB01 \n \nErelzi is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nTumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a dominant cytokine in the inflammatory process of rheumatoid \narthritis. Elevated levels of TNF are also found in the synovium and psoriatic plaques of patients with \npsoriatic arthritis and in serum and synovial tissue of patients with ankylosing spondylitis. In plaque \npsoriasis, infiltration by inflammatory cells, including T-cells, leads to increased TNF levels in psoriatic \nlesions compared with levels in uninvolved skin. Etanercept is a competitive inhibitor of TNF binding \nto its cell surface receptors, and thereby inhibits the biological activity of TNF. TNF and lymphotoxin \nare pro-inflammatory cytokines that bind to two distinct cell surface receptors: the 55-kilodalton (p55) \n\n\n\n17 \n \n \n\nand 75-kilodalton (p75) tumour necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs). Both TNFRs exist naturally in \nmembrane-bound and soluble forms. Soluble TNFRs are thought to regulate TNF biological activity. \n \nTNF and lymphotoxin exist predominantly as homotrimers, with their biological activity dependent on \ncross-linking of cell surface TNFRs. Dimeric soluble receptors, such as etanercept, possess a higher \naffinity for TNF than monomeric receptors and are considerably more potent competitive inhibitors of \nTNF binding to its cellular receptors. In addition, use of an immunoglobulin Fc region as a fusion \nelement in the construction of a dimeric receptor imparts a longer serum half-life. \n \nMechanism of action \nMuch of the joint pathology in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and skin pathology in \nplaque psoriasis is mediated by pro-inflammatory molecules that are linked in a network controlled by \nTNF. The mechanism of action of etanercept is thought to be its competitive inhibition of TNF binding \nto cell surface TNFR, preventing TNF-mediated cellular responses by rendering TNF biologically \ninactive. Etanercept may also modulate biologic responses controlled by additional downstream \nmolecules (e.g., cytokines, adhesion molecules, or proteinases) that are induced or regulated by TNF. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThis section presents data from four randomised controlled trials in adults with rheumatoid arthritis, one \nstudy in adults with psoriatic arthritis, one study in adults with ankylosing spondylitis, one study in \nadults with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, four studies in adults with plaque psoriasis, three \nstudies in juvenile idiopathic arthritis and one study in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis. \n \nAdult patients with rheumatoid arthritis \nThe efficacy of etanercept was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The \nstudy evaluated 234 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who had failed therapy with at least \none but no more than four disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Doses of 10 mg or \n25 mg etanercept or placebo were administered subcutaneously twice a week for 6 consecutive months. \nThe results of this controlled trial were expressed in percentage improvement in rheumatoid arthritis \nusing American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria. \n \nACR 20 and 50 responses were higher in patients treated with etanercept at 3 and 6 months than in \npatients treated with placebo (ACR 20: etanercept 62% and 59%, placebo 23% and 11% at 3 and \n6 months, respectively: ACR 50: etanercept 41% and 40%, placebo 8% and 5% at months 3 and 6, \nrespectively; p < 0.01 etanercept vs. placebo at all timepoints for both ACR 20 and ACR 50 responses). \n \nApproximately 15% of subjects who received etanercept achieved an ACR 70 response at month 3 and \nmonth 6 compared to fewer than 5% of subjects in the placebo arm. Among patients receiving \netanercept, the clinical responses generally appeared within 1 to 2 weeks after initiation of therapy and \nnearly always occurred by 3 months. A dose response was seen; results with 10 mg were intermediate \nbetween placebo and 25 mg. Etanercept was significantly better than placebo in all components of the \nACR criteria, as well as other measures of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity not included in the ACR \nresponse criteria, such as morning stiffness. A Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), which \nincluded disability, vitality, mental health, general health status, and arthritis-associated health status \nsubdomains, was administered every 3 months during the trial. All subdomains of the HAQ were \nimproved in patients treated with etanercept compared to controls at 3 and 6 months. \n \nAfter discontinuation of etanercept, symptoms of arthritis generally returned within a month. \nRe-introduction of treatment with etanercept after discontinuation of up to 24 months resulted in the \nsame magnitudes of responses as patients who received etanercept without interruption of therapy based \non results of open-label studies. Continued durable responses have been seen for up to 10 years in \nopen-label extension treatment trials when patients received etanercept without interruption. \n \nThe efficacy of etanercept was compared to methotrexate in a randomised, active-controlled study with \nblinded radiographic evaluations as a primary endpoint in 632 adult patients with active rheumatoid \narthritis (< 3 years duration) who had never received treatment with methotrexate. Doses of 10 mg or \n\n\n\n18 \n \n \n\n25 mg etanercept were administered subcutaneously (SC) twice a week for up to 24 months. \nMethotrexate doses were escalated from 7.5 mg/week to a maximum of 20 mg/week over the first \n8 weeks of the trial and continued for up to 24 months. Clinical improvement, including onset of action \nwithin 2 weeks with etanercept 25 mg, was similar to that seen in the previous trials and was maintained \nfor up to 24 months. At baseline, patients had a moderate degree of disability, with mean HAQ scores of \n1.4 to 1.5. Treatment with etanercept 25 mg resulted in substantial improvement at 12 months, with \nabout 44% of patients achieving a normal HAQ score (less than 0.5). This benefit was maintained in \nYear 2 of this study. \n \nIn this study, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in Total \nSharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score. \nRadiographs of hands/wrists and feet were read at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months. The 10 mg \netanercept dose had consistently less effect on structural damage than the 25 mg dose. Etanercept 25 mg \nwas significantly superior to methotrexate for erosion scores at both 12 and 24 months. The differences \nin TSS and JSN were not statistically significant between methotrexate and etanercept 25 mg. The \nresults are shown in the figure below. \n \nRadiographic progression: comparison of etanercept vs. methotrexate in patients with RA of < 3 \nyears duration \n \n\n \n \nIn another active-controlled, double-blind, randomised study, clinical efficacy, safety, and radiographic \nprogression in RA patients treated with etanercept alone (25 mg twice weekly), methotrexate alone (7.5 \nto 20 mg weekly, median dose 20 mg), and the combination of etanercept and methotrexate initiated \nconcurrently were compared in 682 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis of 6 months to \n20 years duration (median 5 years) who had a less than satisfactory response to at least 1 \ndisease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) other than methotrexate. \n \nPatients in the etanercept in combination with methotrexate therapy group had significantly higher \nACR 20, ACR 50, ACR 70 responses and improvement for DAS and HAQ scores at both 24 and \n52 weeks than patients in either of the single therapy groups (results shown in table below). Significant \nadvantages for etanercept in combination with methotrexate compared with etanercept monotherapy and \nmethotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n \n \n\n Clinical efficacy results at 12 months: comparison of etanercept vs. methotrexate vs. etanercept in \ncombination with methotrexate in patients with RA of 6 months to 20 years duration \n \n\nEndpoint \n \n\nMethotrexate \n(n = 228) \n\nEtanercept \n(n = 223) \n\nEtanercept + \nMethotrexate \n\n(n = 231) \nACR Responsesa  ACR 20 58.8% 65.5% 74.5% †,ϕ \n\n ACR 50 36.4% 43.0% 63.2% †, ϕ \n ACR 70 16.7% 22.0% 39.8% †, ϕ \n\nDAS  Baseline scoreb 5.5 5.7 5.5 \n Week 52 scoreb 3.0 3.0 2.3 †, ϕ \n Remissionc 14% 18% 37% †, ϕ \n\nHAQ  Baseline 1.7 1.7 1.8 \n Week 52 1.1 1.0 0.8 †, ϕ \n\n a: Patients who did not complete 12 months in the study were considered to be non-responders. \nb: Values for Disease Activity Score (DAS) are means. \nc: Remission is defined as DAS < 1.6. \nPairwise comparison p-values: † = p < 0.05 for comparisons of etanercept + methotrexate vs. \nmethotrexate and ϕ = p < 0.05 for comparisons of etanercept + methotrexate vs. etanercept. \n \nRadiographic progression at 12 months was significantly less in the etanercept group than in the \nmethotrexate group, while the combination was significantly better than either monotherapy at slowing \nradiographic progression (see figure below). \n \nRadiographic progression: comparison of etanercept vs. methotrexate vs. etanercept in \ncombination with methotrexate in patients with RA of 6 months to 20 years duration (12 month \nresults) \n\n \nPairwise comparison p-values: * = p < 0.05 for comparisons of etanercept vs. methotrexate, † = p < 0.05 \nfor comparisons of etanercept + methotrexate vs. methotrexate and ϕ = p < 0.05 for comparisons of \netanercept + methotrexate vs. etanercept. \n\n \nSignificant advantages for etanercept in combination with methotrexate compared with etanercept \nmonotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy were also observed after 24 months. Similarly, the \nsignificant advantages for etanercept monotherapy compared with methotrexate monotherapy were also \nobserved after 24 months. \n \n\n\n\n20 \n \n \n\nIn an analysis in which all patients who dropped out of the study for any reason were considered to have \nprogressed, the percentage of patients without progression (TSS change ≤ 0.5) at 24 months was higher \nin the etanercept in combination with methotrexate group compared with the etanercept alone and \nmethotrexate alone groups (62%, 50%, and 36%, respectively; p < 0.05). The difference between \netanercept alone and methotrexate alone was also significant (p < 0.05). Among patients who completed \na full 24 months of therapy in the study, the non-progression rates were 78%, 70%, and 61%, \nrespectively. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of 50 mg etanercept (two 25 mg SC injections) administered once weekly were \nevaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 420 patients with active RA. In this study, \n53 patients received placebo, 214 patients received 50 mg etanercept once weekly and 153 patients \nreceived 25 mg etanercept twice weekly. The safety and efficacy profiles of the two etanercept \ntreatment regimens were comparable at week 8 in their effect on signs and symptoms of RA; data at \nweek 16 did not show comparability (non-inferiority) between the two regimens. A single 50 mg/ml \ninjection of etanercept was found to be bioequivalent to two simultaneous injections of 25 mg/ml. \n \nAdult patients with psoriatic arthritis \nThe efficacy of etanercept was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in \n205 patients with psoriatic arthritis. Patients were between 18 and 70 years of age and had active \npsoriatic arthritis (≥ 3 swollen joints and ≥ 3 tender joints) in at least one of the following forms: (1) \ndistal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement; (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules and \npresence of psoriasis); (3) arthritis mutilans; (4) asymmetric psoriatic arthritis; or (5) spondylitis-like \nankylosis. Patients also had plaque psoriasis with a qualifying target lesion ≥ 2 cm in diameter. Patients \nhad previously been treated with NSAIDs (86%), DMARDs (80%), and corticosteroids (24%). Patients \ncurrently on methotrexate therapy (stable for ≥ 2 months) could continue at a stable dose of \n≤ 25 mg/week methotrexate. Doses of 25 mg of etanercept (based on dose-finding studies in patients \nwith rheumatoid arthritis) or placebo were administered SC twice a week for 6 months. At the end of \nthe double-blind study, patients could enter a long-term open-label extension study for a total duration \nof up to 2 years. \n \nClinical responses were expressed as percentages of patients achieving the ACR 20, 50, and 70 response \nand percentages with improvement in Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC).

Etanercept was \nsignificantly better than placebo in all measures of disease activity (p < 0.001), and responses were \nsimilar with and without concomitant methotrexate therapy. Quality of life in psoriatic arthritis patients \nwas assessed at every timepoint using the disability index of the HAQ. The disability index score was \n\n\n\n21 \n \n \n\nsignificantly improved at all timepoints in psoriatic arthritis patients treated with etanercept, relative to \nplacebo (p < 0.001). \n \nRadiographic changes were assessed in the psoriatic arthritis study. Radiographs of hands and wrists \nwere obtained at baseline and months 6, 12, and 24. The modified TSS at 12 months is presented in the \ntable below. In an analysis in which all patients who dropped out of the study for any reason were \nconsidered to have progressed, the percentage of patients without progression (TSS change ≤ 0.5) at \n12 months was higher in the etanercept group compared with the placebo group (73% vs. 47%, \nrespectively, p ≤ 0.001). The effect of etanercept on radiographic progression was maintained in \npatients who continued on treatment during the second year.

Evidence of efficacy for the once-weekly dosing regimen in this patient population has been \nbased on data from the study in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. \n \nAdult patients with ankylosing spondylitis \nThe efficacy of etanercept in ankylosing spondylitis was assessed in 3 randomised, double-blind studies \ncomparing twice-weekly administration of 25 mg etanercept with placebo. A total of 401 patients were \nenrolled, from which 203 were treated with etanercept. The largest of these trials (n = 277) enrolled \npatients who were between 18 and 70 years of age and had active ankylosing spondylitis defined as \nvisual analog scale (VAS) scores of ≥ 30 for average of duration and intensity of morning stiffness plus \nVAS scores of ≥ 30 for at least 2 of the following 3 parameters: patient global assessment; average of \nVAS values for nocturnal back pain and total back pain; average of 10 questions on the Bath \nAnkylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI). Patients receiving DMARDs, NSAIDS, or \ncorticosteroids could continue them on stable doses. Patients with complete ankylosis of the spine were \nnot included in the study. Doses of 25 mg of etanercept (based on dose-finding studies in patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis) or placebo were administered subcutaneously twice a week for 6 months in \n138 patients. \n \nThe primary measure of efficacy (ASAS 20) was a ≥ 20% improvement in at least 3 of the 4 \nAssessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) domains (patient global assessments, back pain, BASFI, \nand inflammation) and absence of deterioration in the remaining domain. ASAS 50 and 70 responses \nused the same criteria with a 50% improvement or a 70% improvement, respectively. \n \nCompared to placebo, treatment with etanercept resulted in significant improvements in the ASAS 20, \nASAS 50 and ASAS 70 as early as 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n \n \n\nResponses of patients with ankylosing spondylitis in \na placebo-controlled trial \n\n Percent of Patients \nAnkylosing Spondylitis \nResponse \n\nPlacebo \nN = 139 \n\nEtanercept \nN = 138 \n\nASAS 20   \n2 weeks 22 46a \n3 months 27 60a \n6 months 23 58a \n   \n\nASAS 50   \n2 weeks 7 24a \n3 months 13 45a \n6 months 10 42a \n   \n\nASAS 70   \n2 weeks 2 12b \n3 months 7 29b \n6 months 5 28b \n   \n\na: p < 0.001, etanercept vs. placebo \nb: p = 0.002, etanercept vs. placebo \n\n \nAmong patients with ankylosing spondylitis who received etanercept, the clinical responses were \napparent at the time of the first visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 6 months of therapy. \nResponses were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant therapies at baseline. \n \nSimilar results were obtained in the 2 smaller ankylosing spondylitis trials. \n \nIn a fourth study, the safety and efficacy of 50 mg etanercept (two 25 mg SC injections) administered \nonce weekly vs. 25 mg etanercept administered twice weekly were evaluated in a double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled study of 356 patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. The safety and efficacy \nprofiles of the 50 mg once-weekly and 25 mg twice-weekly regimens were similar. \n \nAdult patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \nThe efficacy of etanercept in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-AxSpa) was \nassessed in a randomised, 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study evaluated \n215 adult patients (modified intent-to-treat population) with active nr-AxSpa (18 to 49 years of age), \ndefined as those patients meeting the ASAS classification criteria of axial spondyloarthritis but did not \nmeet the modified New York criteria for AS. Patients were also required to have an inadequate response \nor intolerance to two or more NSAIDs. In the double-blind period, patients received etanercept 50 mg \nweekly or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary measure of efficacy (ASAS 40) was a 40% improvement \nin at least three of the four ASAS domains and absence of deterioration in the remaining domain. The \ndouble-blind period was followed by an open-label period during which all patients received etanercept \n50 mg weekly for up to an additional 92 weeks. MRIs of the sacroiliac joint and spine were obtained to \nassess inflammation at baseline and at weeks 12 and 104.  \n \nCompared to placebo, treatment with etanercept resulted in statistically significant improvement in the \nASAS 40, ASAS 20 and ASAS 5/6. Significant improvement was also observed for the ASAS partial \nremission and BASDAI 50. Week 12 results are shown in the table below. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n \n \n\nEfficacy response in placebo-controlled nr-AxSpa study: percent of patients achieving \nendpoints \n\nDouble-Blind Clinical  \nResponses at Week 12 \n\nPlacebo \nN = 106 to 109* \n\nEtanercept \nN = 103 to 105* \n\nASAS** 40 15.7 32.4b \nASAS 20 36.1 52.4c \nASAS 5/6 10.4 33.0a \nASAS partial remission 11.9 24.8c \nBASDAI*** 50 23.9 43.8b \n*Some patients did not provide complete data for each endpoint \n**ASAS = Assessments in Spondyloarthritis International Society \n***Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index \na: p < 0.001, b:< 0.01 and c:< 0.05, respectively between etanercept and placebo \n \nAt week 12, there was a statistically significant improvement in the SPARCC (Spondyloarthritis \nResearch Consortium of Canada) score for the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) as measured by MRI for patients \nreceiving etanercept. Adjusted mean change from baseline was 3.8 for etanercept treated (n = 95) versus \n0.8 for placebo treated (n = 105) patients (p < 0.001). At week 104, the mean change from baseline in \nthe SPARCC score measured on MRI for all etanercept-treated subjects was 4.64 for the SIJ (n = 153) \nand 1.40 the spine (n = 154). \n \nEtanercept showed statistically significantly greater improvement from baseline to week 12 compared to \nplacebo in most health-related quality of life and physical function assessments, including BASFI (Bath \nAnkylosing Spondylitis Functional Index), EuroQol 5D Overall Health State Score and SF-36 Physical \nComponent Score. \n \nClinical responses among nr-AxSpa patients who received etanercept were apparent at the time of the \nfirst visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 2 years of therapy. Improvements in health-related \nquality of life and physical function were also maintained through 2 years of therapy. The 2 year data \ndid not reveal any new safety findings. At week 104, 8 subjects had progressed to a score of bilateral \nGrade 2 on spinal X-ray according to the modified New York Radiological Grade, indicative of axial \nspondyloarthropathy. \n \nAdult patients with plaque psoriasis \nEtanercept is recommended for use in patients as defined in section 4.1. Patients who “failed to respond \nto” in the target population is defined by insufficient response (PASI < 50 or PGA less than good), or \nworsening of the disease while on treatment, and who were adequately dosed for a sufficiently long \nduration to assess response with at least each of the three major systemic therapies as available. \n \nThe efficacy of etanercept versus other systemic therapies in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis \n(responsive to other systemic therapies) has not been evaluated in studies directly comparing etanercept \nwith other systemic therapies. Instead, the safety and efficacy of etanercept were assessed in four \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The primary efficacy endpoint in all four studies \nwas the proportion of patients in each treatment group who achieved the PASI 75 (i.e., at least a 75% \nimprovement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score from baseline) at 12 weeks. \n \nStudy 1 was a Phase 2 study in patients with active, but clinically stable, plaque psoriasis involving \n≥ 10% of the body surface area who were ≥ 18 years old. One hundred and twelve (112) patients were \nrandomised to receive a dose of 25 mg of etanercept (n = 57) or placebo (n = 55) twice a week for \n24 weeks. \n \nStudy 2 evaluated 652 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis using the same inclusion criteria as study 1 \nwith the addition of a minimum psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) of 10 at screening. Etanercept \nwas administered at doses of 25 mg once a week, 25 mg twice a week or 50 mg twice a week for 6 \nconsecutive months. During the first 12 weeks of the double-blind treatment period, patients received \n\n\n\n24 \n \n \n\nplacebo or one of the above three etanercept doses. After 12 weeks of treatment, patients in the placebo \ngroup began treatment with blinded etanercept (25 mg twice a week); patients in the active treatment \ngroups continued to week 24 on the dose to which they were originally randomised. \n \nStudy 3 evaluated 583 patients and had the same inclusion criteria as study 2. Patients in this study \nreceived a dose of 25 mg or 50 mg etanercept, or placebo twice a week for 12 weeks and then all \npatients received open-label 25 mg etanercept twice weekly for an additional 24 weeks. \n \nStudy 4 evaluated 142 patients and had similar inclusion criteria to studies 2 and 3. Patients in this study \nreceived a dose of 50 mg etanercept or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks and then all patients received \nopen-label 50 mg etanercept once weekly for an additional 12 weeks. \n \nIn study 1, the etanercept-treated group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a PASI 75 \nresponse at week 12 (30%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p < 0.0001). At 24 weeks, \n56% of patients in the etanercept-treated group had achieved the PASI 75 compared to 5% of \nplacebo-treated patients.

Clear or almost clear defined as 0 or 1 on a 0 to 5 scale. \n\n \nAmong patients with plaque psoriasis who received etanercept, significant responses relative to placebo \nwere apparent at the time of the first visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 24 weeks of therapy. \n \nStudy 2 also had a drug withdrawal period during which patients who achieved a PASI improvement of \nat least 50% at week 24 had treatment stopped. Patients were observed off treatment for the occurrence \nof rebound (PASI ≥ 150% of baseline) and for the time to relapse (defined as a loss of at least half of the \nimprovement achieved between baseline and week 24). During the withdrawal period, symptoms of \npsoriasis gradually returned, with a median time to disease relapse of 3 months. No rebound flare of \ndisease and no psoriasis-related serious adverse events were observed. There was some evidence to \nsupport a benefit of re-treatment with etanercept in patients initially responding to treatment. \n \nIn study 3, the majority of patients (77%) who were initially randomised to 50 mg twice weekly and had \ntheir etanercept dose decreased at week 12 to 25 mg twice weekly maintained their PASI 75 response \nthrough week 36. For patients who received 25 mg twice weekly throughout the study, the PASI 75 \nresponse continued to improve between weeks 12 and 36. \n \nIn study 4, the etanercept-treated group had a higher proportion of patients with PASI 75 at week 12 \n(38%) compared to the placebo-treated group (2%) (p < 0.0001). For patients who received 50 mg once \n\n\n\n25 \n \n \n\nweekly throughout the study, the efficacy responses continued to improve with 71% achieving PASI 75 \nat week 24. \n \nIn long-term (up to 34 months) open-label studies where etanercept was given without interruption, \nclinical responses were sustained and safety was comparable to shorter-term studies. \n \nAn analysis of clinical trial data did not reveal any baseline disease characteristics that would assist \nclinicians in selecting the most appropriate dosing option (intermittent or continuous). Consequently, \nthe choice of intermittent or continuous therapy should be based upon physician judgment and \nindividual patient needs. \n \nAntibodies to etanercept \n \nAntibodies to etanercept have been detected in the sera of some subjects treated with etanercept. These \nantibodies have all been non-neutralising and are generally transient. There appears to be no correlation \nbetween antibody development and clinical response or adverse events. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPaediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nThe safety and efficacy of etanercept were assessed in a two-part study in 69 children with \npolyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis who had a variety of juvenile idiopathic arthritis onset \ntypes (polyarthritis, pauciarthritis, systemic onset). Patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderately to \nseverely active polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis refractory to, or intolerant of, \nmethotrexate were enrolled; patients remained on a stable dose of a single non-steroidal \nanti-inflammatory drug and/or prednisone (< 0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg maximum). In part 1, all patients \nreceived 0.4 mg/kg (maximum 25 mg per dose) etanercept subcutaneously twice weekly. In part 2, \npatients with a clinical response at day 90 were randomised to remain on etanercept or receive placebo \nfor four months and assessed for disease flare. Responses were measured using the ACR Pedi 30, \ndefined as ≥ 30% improvement in at least three of six and ≥ 30% worsening in no more than one of six \nJRA core set criteria, including active joint count, limitation of motion, physician and patient/parent \nglobal assessments, functional assessment, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Disease flare was \ndefined as a ≥ 30% worsening in three of six JRA core set criteria and ≥ 30% improvement in not more \nthan one of the six JRA core set criteria and a minimum of two active joints. \n \nIn part 1 of the study, 51 of 69 (74%) patients demonstrated a clinical response and entered part 2. In \npart 2, 6 of 25 (24%) patients remaining on etanercept experienced a disease flare compared to 20 of 26 \n(77%) patients receiving placebo (p = 0.007). From the start of part 2, the median time to flare was \n≥ 116 days for patients who received etanercept and 28 days for patients who received placebo. Of \npatients who demonstrated a clinical response at 90 days and entered part 2 of the study, some of the \npatients remaining on etanercept continued to improve from month 3 through month 7, while those who \nreceived placebo did not improve. \n \nIn an open-label, safety extension study, 58 paediatric patients from the above study (from the age of \n4 years at time of enrolment) continued to receive etanercept for up to 10 years. Rates of serious adverse \nevents and serious infections did not increase with long-term exposure. \n \nLong-term safety of etanercept monotherapy (n = 103), etanercept plus methotrexate (n = 294), or \nmethotrexate monotherapy (n = 197) were assessed for up to 3 years in a registry of 594 children aged 2 \nto 18 years with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 39 of whom were 2 to 3 years of age. Overall, infections \nwere more commonly reported in patients treated with etanercept compared to methotrexate alone (3.8 \nversus 2%), and the infections associated with etanercept use were of a more severe nature. \n \nIn another open-label single-arm study, 60 patients with extended oligoarthritis (15 patients aged 2 to 4, \n23 patients aged 5 to 11 and 22 patients aged 12 to 17 years old), 38 patients with enthesitis-related \narthritis (12 to 17 years old), and 29 patients with psoriatic arthritis (12 to 17 years old) were treated \n\n\n\n26 \n \n \n\nwith etanercept at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) administered weekly for \n12 weeks. In each of the JIA subtypes, the majority of patients met ACR Pedi 30 criteria and \ndemonstrated clinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as number of tender joints and \nphysician global assessment. The safety profile was consistent with that observed in other JIA studies. \n \nStudies have not been done in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis to assess the effects of continued \netanercept therapy in patients who do not respond within 3 months of initiating etanercept therapy. \nAdditionally, studies have not been conducted to assess the effects of discontinuing or reducing the \nrecommended dose of etanercept following its long-term use in patients with JIA. \n \nPaediatric patients with plaque psoriasis \nThe efficacy of etanercept was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in \n211 paediatric patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (as defined by an \nsPGA score ≥ 3, involving ≥ 10% of the BSA, and PASI ≥ 12). Eligible patients had a history of \nreceiving phototherapy or systemic therapy, or were inadequately controlled on topical therapy. \n \nPatients received etanercept 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) or placebo once weekly for 12 weeks. At week 12, \nmore patients randomised to etanercept had positive efficacy responses (e.g., PASI 75) than those \nrandomised to placebo. \n \n\nPaediatric plaque psoriasis outcomes at 12 weeks \n Etanercept \n\n0.8 mg/kg Once Weekly \n(N = 106) \n\nPlacebo \n(N = 105) \n\nPASI 75, n (%) 60 (57%)a 12 (11%) \nPASI 50, n (%) 79 (75%)a 24 (23%) \n   \nsPGA “clear” or “minimal”, n (%) 56 (53%)a 14 (13%) \nAbbreviation: sPGA-static Physician Global Assessment \na. p < 0.0001 compared with placebo \n\n \nAfter the 12-week double-blind treatment period, all patients received etanercept 0.8 mg/kg (up to \n50 mg) once weekly for additional 24 weeks. Responses observed during the open-label period were \nsimilar to those observed in the double-blind period. \n \nDuring a randomised withdrawal period, significantly more patients re-randomised to placebo \nexperienced disease relapse (loss of PASI 75 response) compared with patients re-randomised to \netanercept. With continued therapy, responses were maintained up to 48 weeks. \n \nThe long-term safety and effectiveness of etanercept 0.8 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) once weekly was assessed \nin an open-label extension study of 181 paediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis for up to 2 years \nbeyond the 48 week study discussed above. Long-term experience with etanercept was generally \ncomparable to the original 48-week study and did not reveal any new safety findings. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nEtanercept serum values were determined by an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) \nmethod, which may detect ELISA-reactive degradation products, as well as the parent compound. \n \nAbsorption \n \nEtanercept is slowly absorbed from the site of subcutaneous injection, reaching maximum concentration \napproximately 48 hours after a single dose. The absolute bioavailability is 76%. With twice-weekly \ndoses, it is anticipated that steady-state concentrations are approximately twice as high as those \nobserved after single doses. After a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg etanercept, the average \n\n\n\n27 \n \n \n\nmaximum serum concentration observed in healthy volunteers was 1.65 ± 0.66 µg/ml, and the area \nunder the curve was 235 ± 96.6 µg•hr/ml. \n \nMean serum concentration profiles at steady state in treated RA patients were Cmax of 2.4 mg/l vs. \n2.6 mg/l, Cmin of 1.2 mg/l vs. 1.4 mg/l, and partial AUC of 297 mg•hr/l vs. 316 mg•hr/l for 50 mg \netanercept once weekly (n = 21) vs. 25 mg etanercept twice weekly (n = 16), respectively. In an \nopen-label, single-dose, two-treatment, crossover study in healthy volunteers, etanercept administered \nas a single 50 mg/ml injection was found to be bioequivalent to two simultaneous injections of \n25 mg/ml. \n \nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis in ankylosing spondylitis patients, the etanercept steady state \nAUCs were 466 µg•hr/ml and 474 µg•hr/ml for 50 mg etanercept once weekly (N = 154) and 25 mg \ntwice weekly (N = 148), respectively. \n \nDistribution \n \nA biexponential curve is required to describe the concentration time curve of etanercept. The central \nvolume of distribution of etanercept is 7.6 l, while the volume of distribution at steady-state is 10.4 l. \n \nElimination \n \nEtanercept is cleared slowly from the body. The half-life is long, approximately 70 hours. Clearance is \napproximately 0.066 l/hr in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, somewhat lower than the value of \n0.11 l/hr observed in healthy volunteers. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of etanercept in rheumatoid \narthritis patients, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis patients are similar. \n \nThere is no apparent pharmacokinetic difference between males and females.  \n \nLinearity \n \nDose proportionality has not been formally evaluated, but there is no apparent saturation of clearance \nacross the dosing range. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \n \nAlthough there is elimination of radioactivity in urine after administration of radiolabelled etanercept to \npatients and volunteers, increased etanercept concentrations were not observed in patients with acute \nrenal failure. The presence of renal impairment should not require a change in dosage. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIncreased etanercept concentrations were not observed in patients with acute hepatic failure. The \npresence of hepatic impairment should not require a change in dosage. \n \nElderly  \n \nThe impact of advanced age was studied in the population pharmacokinetic analysis of etanercept serum \nconcentrations. Clearance and volume estimates in patients aged 65 to 87 years were similar to \nestimates in patients less than 65 years of age. \n \n\n\n\n28 \n \n \n\nPaediatric population \n \nPaediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nIn a polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis trial with etanercept, 69 patients (aged 4 to \n17 years) were administered 0.4 mg etanercept/kg twice weekly for three months. Serum concentration \nprofiles were similar to those seen in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients. The youngest children (4 years \nof age) had reduced clearance (increased clearance when normalised by weight) compared with older \nchildren (12 years of age) and adults. Simulation of dosing suggests that while older children (10–\n17 years of age) will have serum levels close to those seen in adults, younger children will have \nappreciably lower levels. \n \nPaediatric patients with plaque psoriasis \nPatients with paediatric plaque psoriasis (aged 4 to 17 years) were administered 0.8 mg/kg (up to a \nmaximum dose of 50 mg per week) of etanercept once weekly for up to 48 weeks. The mean serum \nsteady-state trough concentrations ranged from 1.6 to 2.1 mcg/ml at weeks 12, 24, and 48. These mean \nconcentrations in patients with paediatric plaque psoriasis were similar to the concentrations observed in \npatients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (treated with 0.4 mg/kg etanercept twice weekly, up to \nmaximum dose of 50 mg per week). These mean concentrations were similar to those seen in adult \npatients with plaque psoriasis treated with 25 mg etanercept twice-weekly. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn the toxicological studies with etanercept, no dose-limiting or target organ toxicity was evident. \nEtanercept was considered to be non-genotoxic from a battery of in vitro and in vivo studies. \nCarcinogenicity studies, and standard assessments of fertility and postnatal toxicity, were not performed \nwith etanercept due to the development of neutralising antibodies in rodents. \n \nEtanercept did not induce lethality or notable signs of toxicity in mice or rats following a single \nsubcutaneous dose of 2,000 mg/kg or a single intravenous dose of 1,000 mg/kg. Etanercept did not elicit \ndose-limiting or target organ toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys following twice weekly subcutaneous \nadministration for 4 or 26 consecutive weeks at a dose (15 mg/kg) that resulted in AUC-based serum \ndrug concentrations that were over 27-fold higher than that obtained in humans at the recommended \ndose of 25 mg. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new safety \ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to \nreport side effects. \n \nRead all (both sides) of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it \ncontains important information for you. \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• Your doctor will also give you a Patient Card, which contains important safety information that \n\nyou need to be aware of before and during treatment with Erelzi. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you or a child in your care. Do not pass it on to others. It \n\nmay harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours or those of the child you are \ncaring for. \n\n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n \n1. What Erelzi is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Erelzi \n3. How to use Erelzi \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Erelzi \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n7. Instructions for Use of the Erelzi pre-filled syringe (see overleaf) \n \n \n1. What Erelzi is and what it is used for \n \nErelzi is a medicine that is made from two human proteins. It blocks the activity of another protein in \nthe body that causes inflammation. Erelzi works by reducing the inflammation associated with certain \ndiseases. \n \nIn adults (aged 18 and over), Erelzi can be used for moderate or severe rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic \narthritis, severe axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis, and moderate or severe \npsoriasis – in each case usually when other widely used treatments have not worked well enough or are \nnot suitable for you. \n \nFor rheumatoid arthritis, Erelzi is usually used in combination with methotrexate, although it may \nalso be used alone if treatment with methotrexate is unsuitable for you. Whether used alone or in \ncombination with methotrexate, Erelzi can slow down the damage to your joints caused by the \nrheumatoid arthritis and improve your ability to do normal daily activities. \n \nFor psoriatic arthritis patients with multiple joint involvement, Erelzi can improve your ability to do \nnormal daily activities.  \n \n\n\n\n65 \n \n \n\nFor patients with multiple symmetrical painful or swollen joints (e.g., hands, wrists and feet), Erelzi \ncan slow down the structural damage to those joints caused by the disease. \n \nErelzi is also prescribed for the treatment of the following diseases in children and adolescents: \n• For the following types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis when treatment with methotrexate has not \n\nworked well enough or is not suitable for them: \n• Polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in patients \n\nfrom the age of 2 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more. \n• Psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more. \n\n• For enthesitis-related arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more \nwhen other widely used treatments have not worked well enough or are not suitable for them. \n\n• Severe psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more who have had \nan inadequate response to (or are unable to take) phototherapies or other systemic therapies. \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Erelzi \n \nDo not use Erelzi \n \n• if you, or the child you are caring for, are allergic to etanercept or any of the other ingredients \n\nof Erelzi (listed in section 6). If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as chest \ntightness, wheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more Erelzi, and contact your doctor \nimmediately. \n\n• if you or the child have, or are at risk of developing a serious blood infection called sepsis. If \nyou are not sure, please contact your doctor. \n\n• if you or the child have an infection of any kind. If you are not sure, please talk to your doctor. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Erelzi. \n \n• Allergic reactions: If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, \n\nwheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more Erelzi, and contact your doctor immediately. \n• Infections/surgery: If you or the child develop a new infection, or are about to have any major \n\nsurgery, your doctor may wish to monitor the treatment with Erelzi. \n• Infections/diabetes: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of recurrent infections or \n\nsuffer from diabetes or other conditions that increase the risk of infection. \n• Infections/monitoring: Tell your doctor of any recent travel outside the European region. If you \n\nor the child develop symptoms of an infection such as fever, chills or cough, notify your doctor \nimmediately. Your doctor may decide to continue to monitor you or the child for the presence of \ninfections after you or the child stop using Erelzi. \n\n• Tuberculosis: As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Erelzi, your \ndoctor will check for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Erelzi. This may include \na thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test. The conduct of these tests should \nbe recorded on the Patient Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you or the child \nhave ever had tuberculosis, or have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. \nIf symptoms of tuberculosis (such as persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or \nany other infection appear during or after therapy, tell your doctor immediately. \n\n• Hepatitis B: Tell your doctor if you or the child have or have ever had hepatitis B. Your doctor \nshould test for the presence of hepatitis B infection before you or the child begin treatment with \nErelzi. Treatment with Erelzi may result in reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who have \npreviously been infected with the hepatitis B virus. If this occurs, you should stop using Erelzi. \n\n• Hepatitis C: Tell your doctor if you or the child have hepatitis C. Your doctor may wish to \nmonitor the treatment with Erelzi in case the infection worsens. \n\n\n\n66 \n \n \n\n• Blood disorders: Seek medical advice immediately if you or the child have any signs or \nsymptoms such as persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding or paleness. Such symptoms \nmay point to the existence of potentially life-threatening blood disorders, which may require \ndiscontinuation of Erelzi. \n\n• Nervous system and eye disorders: Tell your doctor if you or the child have multiple sclerosis, \noptic neuritis (inflammation of the nerves of the eyes) or transverse myelitis (inflammation of the \nspinal cord). Your doctor will determine if Erelzi is an appropriate treatment. \n\n• Congestive heart failure: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of congestive heart \nfailure, because Erelzi needs to be used with caution under these circumstances. \n\n• Cancer: Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) or any \nother cancer before you are given Erelzi. \nPatients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who have had the disease for a long time, may be at \nhigher than average risk of developing lymphoma. \nChildren and adults taking Erelzi may have an increased risk of developing lymphoma or another \ncancer. \nSome children and teenage patients who have received Erelzi or other medicines that work the \nsame way as Erelzi have developed cancers, including unusual types, which sometimes resulted \nin death. \nSome patients receiving Erelzi have developed skin cancers. Tell your doctor if you or the child \ndevelop any change in the appearance of the skin or growths on the skin. \n\n• Chickenpox: Tell your doctor if you or the child are exposed to chickenpox when using Erelzi. \nYour doctor will determine if preventive treatment for chickenpox is appropriate. \n\n• Alcohol abuse: Erelzi should not be used for the treatment of hepatitis related to alcohol abuse. \nPlease tell your doctor if you or the child in your care have a history of alcohol abuse. \n\n• Wegener’s granulomatosis: Erelzi is not recommended for the treatment of Wegener’s \ngranulomatosis, a rare inflammatory disease. If you or the child in your care have Wegener’s \ngranulomatosis, talk to your doctor. \n\n• Anti-diabetic medicines: Tell your doctor if you or the child have diabetes or are taking \nmedicines to treat diabetes. Your doctor may decide if you or the child need less anti-diabetic \nmedicine while using Erelzi. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nErelzi is not indicated for use in children and adolescents who weigh less than 62.5 kg. \n \n• Vaccinations: If possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using Erelzi. \n\nSome vaccines, such as oral polio vaccine, should not be given while using Erelzi. Please consult \nyour doctor before you or the child receive any vaccines. \n\n• Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): There have been cases of IBD in patients with juvenile \nidiopathic arthritis (JIA) treated with Erelzi. Tell the doctor if the child develops any abdominal \ncramps and pain, diarrhoea, weight loss or blood in the stool. \n \n\nErelzi should not normally be used in children with polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis below the \nage of 2 years or weighing less than 62.5 kg, or in children with enthesitis-related arthritis or psoriatic \narthritis below the age of 12 years or weighing less than 62.5 kg, or in children with psoriasis below the \nage of 6 years or weighing less than 62.5 kg. \n \nOther medicines and Erelzi \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines (including anakinra, abatacept or sulfasalazine), even those not prescribed by the doctor.  \n \nYou or the child should not use Erelzi with medicines that contain the active substance anakinra or \nabatacept. \n \n\n\n\n67 \n \n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nErelzi should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. You should consult your doctor if you \nbecome pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby. \n \nIf you received Erelzi during pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk of getting an infection. In \naddition, one study found more birth defects when the mother had received etanercept in pregnancy, \ncompared with mothers who had not received etanercept or other similar medicines (TNF-antagonists), \nbut there was no particular kind of birth defect reported. Another study found no increased risk of birth \ndefects when the mother had received etanercept in pregnancy. Your doctor will help you to decide \nwhether the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk to your baby. It is important that you tell \nthe baby’s doctors and other healthcare professionals about the use of Erelzi during pregnancy before \nthe baby receives any vaccine (for more information see section 2, “Vaccinations”). \n \nWomen using Erelzi should not breast-feed, since Erelzi passes into human breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nThe use of Erelzi is not expected to affect the ability to drive or use machines. \n \nErelzi contains sodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 25 mg or 50 mg, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to use Erelzi \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n \nIf you feel that the effect of Erelzi is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nErelzi is available as 25 mg strength and 50 mg strength.  \n \nUse in adult patients (aged 18 years or over) \n \nRheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis \n \nThe usual dose is 25 mg given twice a week or 50 mg once a week as an injection under the skin. \nHowever, your doctor may determine an alternative frequency at which to inject Erelzi. \n \nPlaque psoriasis \n \nThe usual dose is 25 mg twice a week or 50 mg once a week. \n \nAlternatively, 50 mg may be given twice a week for up to 12 weeks, followed by 25 mg twice a week or \n50 mg once a week. \n \nYour doctor will decide how long you should use Erelzi and whether retreatment is needed based on \nyour response. If Erelzi has no effect on your condition after 12 weeks, your doctor may tell you to stop \nusing this medicine. \n \n\n\n\n68 \n \n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n \nThe appropriate dose and frequency of dosing for the child or adolescent will depend on body weight \nand disease. Your doctor will determine the correct dose for the child and will prescribe an appropriate \nstrength of etanercept. Paediatric patients weighing 62.5 kg or more can be dosed 25 mg given twice a \nweek or 50 mg given once a week using a fixed-dose pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen. \n \nOther etanercept products with appropriate dosage forms for children are available. \n \nFor polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis in patients from the age of 2 years and weighing 62.5 kg or \nmore, or enthesitis-related arthritis or psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years and \nweighing 62.5 kg or more, the usual dose is 25 mg given twice a week or 50 mg given once a week. \n \nFor psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more, the usual dose is 50 mg \nand should be given once weekly. If Erelzi has no effect on the child’s condition after 12 weeks, your \ndoctor may tell you to stop using this medicine. \n \nThe doctor will provide you with detailed directions for preparing and measuring the appropriate dose. \n \nMethod and route of administration \n \nErelzi is administered by an injection under the skin (by subcutaneous injection). \n \nErelzi can be taken with or without food or drink. \n \nDetailed instructions on how to inject Erelzi are provided in section 7, “Instructions for use of the \nErelzi pre-filled syringe”.  \n \nDo not mix the Erelzi solution with any other medicine. \n \nTo help you remember, it may be helpful to write in a diary which day(s) of the week Erelzi should be \nused. \n \nIf you use more Erelzi than you should \n \nIf you have used more Erelzi than you should (either by injecting too much on a single occasion or by \nusing it too frequently), talk to a doctor or pharmacist immediately. Always have the outer carton of \nthe medicine with you, even if it is empty. \n \nIf you forget to inject Erelzi \n \nIf you forget a dose, you should inject it as soon as you remember, unless the next scheduled dose is the \nnext day; in which case you should skip the missed dose. Then continue to inject the medicine on the \nusual day(s). If you do not remember until the day that the next injection is due, do not take a double \ndose (two doses on the same day) to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Erelzi \n \nYour symptoms may return upon discontinuation. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n\n\n69 \n \n \n\n \nAllergic reactions \n \nIf any of the following happen, do not inject more Erelzi. Tell your doctor immediately, or go to the \ncasualty department at your nearest hospital. \n \n• Trouble swallowing or breathing \n• Swelling of the face, throat, hands, or feet \n• Feeling nervous or anxious, throbbing sensations, sudden reddening of the skin and/or a warm \n\nfeeling \n• Severe rash, itching, or hives (elevated patches of red or pale skin that often itch) \n \nSerious allergic reactions are rare. However, any of the above symptoms may indicate an allergic \nreaction to Erelzi, so you should seek immediate medical attention. \n \nSerious side effects \n \nIf you notice any of the following, you or the child may need urgent medical attention. \n \n• Signs of serious infections such as high fever that may be accompanied by cough, shortness of \n\nbreath, chills, weakness, or a hot, red, tender, sore area on the skin or joints; \n• Signs of blood disorders, such as bleeding, bruising, or paleness; \n• Signs of nerve disorders, such as numbness or tingling, changes in vision, eye pain, or onset of \n\nweakness in an arm or leg; \n• Signs of heart failure or worsening heart failure, such as fatigue or shortness of breath with \n\nactivity, swelling in the ankles, a feeling of fullness in the neck or abdomen, night-time shortness \nof breath or coughing, bluish colour of the nails or the lips; \n\n• Signs of cancers: cancers may affect any part of the body including the skin and blood, and \npossible signs will depend on the type and location of the cancer.

Instructions for Use of the Erelzi SensoReady pen  \n \n \n1. What Erelzi is and what it is used for \n \nErelzi is a medicine that is made from two human proteins. It blocks the activity of another protein in \nthe body that causes inflammation. Erelzi works by reducing the inflammation associated with certain \ndiseases. \n \nIn adults (aged 18 and over), Erelzi can be used for moderate or severe rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic \narthritis, severe axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis, and moderate or severe \npsoriasis – in each case usually when other widely used treatments have not worked well enough or are \nnot suitable for you. \n \nFor rheumatoid arthritis, Erelzi is usually used in combination with methotrexate, although it may \nalso be used alone if treatment with methotrexate is unsuitable for you. Whether used alone or in \ncombination with methotrexate, Erelzi can slow down the damage to your joints caused by the \nrheumatoid arthritis and improve your ability to do normal daily activities. \n \nFor psoriatic arthritis patients with multiple joint involvement, Erelzi can improve your ability to do \nnormal daily activities.  \n \nFor patients with multiple symmetrical painful or swollen joints (e.g., hands, wrists and feet), Erelzi \ncan slow down the structural damage to those joints caused by the disease. \n \n\n\n\n77 \n \n \n\nErelzi is also prescribed for the treatment of the following diseases in children and adolescents: \n• For the following types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis when treatment with methotrexate \n\nhas not worked well enough or is not suitable for them: \n• Polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in \n\npatients from the age of 2 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more. \n• Psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more. \n\n• For enthesitis-related arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years and weighing 62.5 kg or \nmore when other widely used treatments have not worked well enough or are not suitable \nfor them. \n\n• Severe psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more who \nhave had an inadequate response to (or are unable to take) phototherapies or other systemic \ntherapies. \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Erelzi \n \nDo not use Erelzi \n \n• if you, or the child you are caring for, are allergic to etanercept or any of the other ingredients \n\nof Erelzi (listed in section 6). If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as chest \ntightness, wheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more Erelzi, and contact your doctor \nimmediately. \n\n• if you or the child have, or are at risk of developing a serious blood infection called sepsis. If \nyou are not sure, please contact your doctor. \n\n• if you or the child have an infection of any kind. If you are not sure, please talk to your doctor. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Erelzi. \n \n• Allergic reactions: If you or the child experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, \n\nwheezing, dizziness or rash, do not inject more Erelzi, and contact your doctor immediately. \n• Infections/surgery: If you or the child develop a new infection, or are about to have any major \n\nsurgery, your doctor may wish to monitor the treatment with Erelzi. \n• Infections/diabetes: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of recurrent infections or \n\nsuffer from diabetes or other conditions that increase the risk of infection. \n• Infections/monitoring: Tell your doctor of any recent travel outside the European region. If you \n\nor the child develop symptoms of an infection such as fever, chills or cough, notify your doctor \nimmediately. Your doctor may decide to continue to monitor you or the child for the presence of \ninfections after you or the child stop using Erelzi. \n\n• Tuberculosis: As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Erelzi, your \ndoctor will check for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Erelzi. This may include \na thorough medical history, a chest X-ray and a tuberculin test. The conduct of these tests should \nbe recorded on the Patient Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you or the child \nhave ever had tuberculosis, or have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. \nIf symptoms of tuberculosis (such as persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or \nany other infection appear during or after therapy, tell your doctor immediately. \n\n• Hepatitis B: Tell your doctor if you or the child have or have ever had hepatitis B. Your doctor \nshould test for the presence of hepatitis B infection before you or the child begin treatment with \nErelzi. Treatment with Erelzi may result in reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who have \npreviously been infected with the hepatitis B virus. If this occurs, you should stop using Erelzi. \n\n• Hepatitis C: Tell your doctor if you or the child have hepatitis C. Your doctor may wish to \nmonitor the treatment with Erelzi in case the infection worsens. \n\n• Blood disorders: Seek medical advice immediately if you or the child have any signs or \nsymptoms such as persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding or paleness. Such symptoms \n\n\n\n78 \n \n \n\nmay point to the existence of potentially life-threatening blood disorders, which may require \ndiscontinuation of Erelzi. \n\n• Nervous system and eye disorders: Tell your doctor if you or the child have multiple sclerosis, \noptic neuritis (inflammation of the nerves of the eyes) or transverse myelitis (inflammation of the \nspinal cord). Your doctor will determine if Erelzi is an appropriate treatment. \n\n• Congestive heart failure: Tell your doctor if you or the child have a history of congestive heart \nfailure, because Erelzi needs to be used with caution under these circumstances. \n\n• Cancer: Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) or any \nother cancer before you are given Erelzi.  \nPatients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who have had the disease for a long time, may be at \nhigher than average risk of developing lymphoma. \nChildren and adults taking Erelzi may have an increased risk of developing lymphoma or another \ncancer. \nSome children and teenage patients who have received Erelzi or other medicines that work the \nsame way as Erelzi have developed cancers, including unusual types, which sometimes resulted \nin death. \nSome patients receiving Erelzi have developed skin cancers. Tell your doctor if you or the child \ndevelop any change in the appearance of the skin or growths on the skin. \n\n• Chickenpox: Tell your doctor if you or the child are exposed to chickenpox when using Erelzi. \nYour doctor will determine if preventive treatment for chickenpox is appropriate. \n\n• Alcohol abuse: Erelzi should not be used for the treatment of hepatitis related to alcohol abuse. \nPlease tell your doctor if you or the child in your care have a history of alcohol abuse. \n\n• Wegener’s granulomatosis: Erelzi is not recommended for the treatment of Wegener’s \ngranulomatosis, a rare inflammatory disease. If you or the child in your care have Wegener’s \ngranulomatosis, talk to your doctor. \n\n• Anti-diabetic medicines: Tell your doctor if you or the child have diabetes or are taking \nmedicines to treat diabetes. Your doctor may decide if you or the child need less anti-diabetic \nmedicine while using Erelzi. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nErelzi is not indicated for use in children and adolescents who weigh less than 62.5 kg. \n \n• Vaccinations: If possible, children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using Erelzi. \n\nSome vaccines, such as oral polio vaccine, should not be given while using Erelzi. Please consult \nyour doctor before you or the child receive any vaccines. \n\n• Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): There have been cases of IBD in patients with juvenile \nidiopathic arthritis (JIA) treated with Erelzi. Tell the doctor if the child develops any abdominal \ncramps and pain, diarrhoea, weight loss or blood in the stool. \n\n \nErelzi should not normally be used in children with polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis below the \nage of 2 years or weighing less than 62.5 kg, or in children with enthesitis-related arthritis or psoriatic \narthritis below the age of 12 years or weighing less than 62.5 kg, or in children with psoriasis below the \nage of 6 years or weighing less than 62.5 kg. \n \nOther medicines and Erelzi \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you or the child are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines (including anakinra, abatacept or sulfasalazine), even those not prescribed by the doctor.  \n \nYou or the child should not use Erelzi with medicines that contain the active substance anakinra or \nabatacept. \n \n\n\n\n79 \n \n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nErelzi should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. You should consult your doctor if you \nbecome pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby. \n \nIf you received Erelzi during pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk of getting an infection. In \naddition, one study found more birth defects when the mother had received etanercept in pregnancy, \ncompared with mothers who had not received etanercept or other similar medicines (TNF-antagonists), \nbut there was no particular kind of birth defect reported. Another study found no increased risk of birth \ndefects when the mother had received etanercept in pregnancy. Your doctor will help you to decide \nwhether the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk to your baby. It is important that you tell \nthe baby’s doctors and other healthcare professionals about the use of Erelzi during pregnancy before \nthe baby receives any vaccine (for more information see section 2, “Vaccinations”). \n \nWomen using Erelzi should not breast-feed, since Erelzi passes into human breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nThe use of Erelzi is not expected to affect the ability to drive or use machines. \n \nErelzi contains sodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 50 mg, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to use Erelzi \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n \nIf you feel that the effect of Erelzi is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nYou have been prescribed a 50 mg strength of Erelzi. A 25 mg strength of Erelzi is available for doses \nof 25 mg. \n \nUse in adult patients (aged 18 years or over) \n \nRheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis \n \nThe usual dose is 25 mg given twice a week or 50 mg once a week as an injection under the skin. \nHowever, your doctor may determine an alternative frequency at which to inject Erelzi. \n \nPlaque psoriasis \n \nThe usual dose is 25 mg twice a week or 50 mg once a week. \n \nAlternatively, 50 mg may be given twice a week for up to 12 weeks, followed by 25 mg twice a week or \n50 mg once a week. \n \nYour doctor will decide how long you should use Erelzi and whether retreatment is needed based on \nyour response. If Erelzi has no effect on your condition after 12 weeks, your doctor may tell you to stop \nusing this medicine. \n \n\n\n\n80 \n \n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n \nThe appropriate dose and frequency of dosing for the child or adolescent will depend on body weight \nand disease. Your doctor will determine the correct dose for the child and will prescribe an appropriate \nstrength of etanercept. Paediatric patients weighing 62.5 kg or more can be dosed 25 mg given twice a \nweek or 50 mg given once a week using a fixed-dose pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen. \n \nOther etanercept products with appropriate dosage forms for children are available. \n \nFor polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis in patients from the age of 2 years and weighing 62.5 kg or \nmore, or enthesitis-related arthritis or psoriatic arthritis in patients from the age of 12 years and \nweighing 62.5 kg or more, the usual dose is 25 mg given twice a week or 50 mg given once a week. \n \nFor psoriasis in patients from the age of 6 years and weighing 62.5 kg or more, the usual dose is 50 mg \nand should be given once weekly. If Erelzi has no effect on the child’s condition after 12 weeks, your \ndoctor may tell you to stop using this medicine. \n \nThe doctor will provide you with detailed directions for preparing and measuring the appropriate dose. \n \nMethod and route of administration \n \nErelzi is administered by an injection under the skin (by subcutaneous injection). \n \nErelzi can be taken with or without food or drink. \n \nDetailed instructions on how to inject Erelzi are provided in section 7, “Instructions for use of the \nErelzi SensoReady pen”.  \n \nDo not mix the Erelzi solution with any other medicine. \n \nTo help you remember, it may be helpful to write in a diary which day(s) of the week Erelzi should be \nused. \n \nIf you use more Erelzi than you should \n \nIf you have used more Erelzi than you should (either by injecting too much on a single occasion or by \nusing it too frequently), talk to a doctor or pharmacist immediately. Always have the outer carton of \nthe medicine with you, even if it is empty. \n \nIf you forget to inject Erelzi \n \nIf you forget a dose, you should inject it as soon as you remember, unless the next scheduled dose is the \nnext day; in which case you should skip the missed dose. Then continue to inject the medicine on the \nusual day(s). If you do not remember until the day that the next injection is due, do not take a double \ndose (two doses on the same day) to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Erelzi \n \nYour symptoms may return upon discontinuation. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n\n\n81 \n \n \n\n \nAllergic reactions \n \nIf any of the following happen, do not inject more Erelzi.
