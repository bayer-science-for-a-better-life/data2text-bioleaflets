This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nBrimica Genuair 340 micrograms /12 micrograms inhalation powder\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach delivered dose (the dose leaving the mouthpiece) contains 396 micrograms of aclidinium \nbromide (equivalent to 340 micrograms of aclidinium) and 11.8 micrograms of formoterol fumarate \ndihydrate. This corresponds to a metered dose of 400 micrograms of aclidinium bromide (equivalent \nto 343 micrograms of aclidinium) and a metered dose of 12 micrograms of formoterol fumarate \ndihydrate.\n\nExcipients with known effect\n\nEach delivered dose contains approximately 11 mg lactose (as monohydrate).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nInhalation powder.\n\nWhite or almost white powder in a white inhaler with an integral dose indicator and an orange dosage \nbutton.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nBrimica Genuair is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adult \npatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended dose is one inhalation twice daily.\n\nIf a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible and the next dose should be taken at the \nusual time. A double dose should not be taken to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustments are required in elderly patients (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustments are required in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\n\n\n\n3\n\nNo dose adjustments are required in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).\nPaediatric population\nThere is no relevant use of Brimica Genuair in children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) for the \nindication of COPD.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nFor inhalation use.\n\nPatients should be instructed on how to administer the product correctly as the Genuair inhaler may \nwork differently from inhalers the patients may have used previously. It is important to instruct the \npatients to read the Instructions for Use in the Package Leaflet.\nBefore first use, the sealed bag should be teared open, and the inhaler removed. The bag and the \ndesiccant should be thrown away.\nFor instructions for use, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to the excipient listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nAsthma\n\nBrimica Genuair should not be used in asthma; clinical studies of Brimica Genuair in asthma have not \nbeen conducted.\n\nParadoxical bronchospasm\n\nIn clinical studies, paradoxical bronchospasm was not observed with Brimica Genuair at its \nrecommended dose. However, paradoxical bronchospasm has been observed with other inhalation \ntherapies. If this occurs, medicinal product should be stopped and other treatment will be considered.\n\nNot for acute use\n\nBrimica Genuair is not indicated for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm.\n\nCardiovascular effects\n\nPatients with a myocardial infarction during the previous 6 months, unstable angina, newly diagnosed \narrhythmia within the previous 3 months, QTc (Bazett’s method) above 470 msec, or hospitalisation \nwithin the previous 12 months for heart failure functional classes III and IV as per the “New York \nHeart Association” were excluded from the clinical studies, therefore Brimica Genuair should be used \nwith caution in these patients groups.\n\nβ2-adrenergic agonists may produce increases in pulse rate and blood pressure, electrocardiogram \n(ECG) changes such as T wave flattening, ST segment depression and prolongation of the QTc-\ninterval in some patients. In case such effects occur, treatment may need to be discontinued. Long-\nacting β2-adrenergic agonists should be used with caution in patients with history of or known \nprolongation of the QTc-interval or treated with medicinal products affecting the QTc interval (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nSystemic effects\n\nBrimica Genuair should be used with caution in patients with severe cardiovascular disorders, \nconvulsive disorders, thyrotoxicosis and phaeochromocytoma.\n\n\n\n4\n\nMetabolic effects of hyperglycaemia and hypokalaemia may be observed with high doses of \nβ2-adrenergic agonists. In Phase III clinical studies, the frequency of notable increases in blood \nglucose with Brimica Genuair was low (0.1%) and similar to placebo. Hypokalaemia is usually \ntransient, not requiring supplementation. In patients with severe COPD, hypokalaemia may be \npotentiated by hypoxia and concomitant treatment (see section 4.5). Hypokalaemia increases\nsusceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias.\n\nDue to its anticholinergic activity, Brimica Genuair should be used with caution in patients with \nsymptomatic prostatic hyperplasia, urinary retention or narrow-angle glaucoma (even though direct \ncontact of the product with the eyes is very unlikely). Dry mouth, which has been observed with \nanticholinergic treatment, may in the long term be associated with dental caries.\n\nLactose content\n\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-\ngalactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nCOPD medicinal products\n\nCo-administration of Brimica Genuair with other anticholinergic and/or long-acting β2-adrenergic \nagonist containing medicinal products has not been studied and is not recommended.\n\nAlthough no formal in vivo drug interaction studies have been performed with Brimica Genuair, it has \nbeen used concomitantly with other COPD medicinal products including short-acting β2-adrenergic \nbronchodilators, methylxanthines, and oral and inhaled steroids without clinical evidence of drug \ninteractions.\n\nHypokalaemic treatment\n\nConcomitant treatment with methylxanthine derivatives, steroids, or non-potassium-sparing diuretics\nmay potentiate the possible hypokalaemic effect of β2-adrenergic agonists, therefore caution is advised \nin their concomitant use (see section 4.4).\n\nβ-adrenergic blockers\n\nβ-adrenergic blockers may weaken or antagonise the effect of β2-adrenergic agonists. If β-adrenergic \nblockers are required (including eye drops), cardioselective beta-adrenergic blockers are preferred, \nalthough they should also be administered with caution.\n\nOther pharmacodynamic interactions\n\nBrimica Genuair should be administered with caution to patients being treated with medicinal products \nknown to prolong the QTc interval such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, \nantihistamines or macrolides because the action of formoterol, a component of Brimica Genuair, on \nthe cardiovascular system may be potentiated by these medicinal products. Medicinal products that are \nknown to prolong the QTc interval are associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias.\n\nMetabolic interactions\n\nIn vitro studies have shown that aclidinium or its metabolites at the therapeutic dose are not expected \nto cause interactions with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate drugs or drugs metabolised by cytochrome \nP450 (CYP450) enzymes and esterases. Formoterol does not inhibit the CYP450 enzymes at \ntherapeutically relevant concentrations (see section 5.2).\n\n\n\n5\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data available on the use of Brimica Genuair in pregnant women.\n\nStudies in animals have shown foetotoxicity only at dose levels much higher than the maximum \nhuman exposure to aclidinium and adverse effects in reproduction studies with formoterol at very high \nsystemic exposure levels (see section 5.3).\nBrimica Genuair should only be used during pregnancy if the expected benefits outweigh the potential \nrisks.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether aclidinium (and/or its metabolites) or formoterol are excreted in human milk. \nAs studies in rats have shown excretion of small amounts of aclidinium (and/or its metabolites) and \nformoterol into milk, the use of Brimica Genuair by breast-feeding women should only be considered \nif the expected benefit to the woman is greater than any possible risk to the infant.\n\nFertility\n\nStudies in rats have shown slight reductions in fertility only at dose levels much higher than the \nmaximum human exposure to aclidinium and formoterol (see section 5.3). Nevertheless, it is \nconsidered unlikely that Brimica Genuair administered at the recommended dose will affect fertility in \nhumans.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nBrimica Genuair has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. The \noccurrence of blurred vision or dizziness may influence the ability to drive or to use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nThe presentation of the safety profile is based on the experience with Brimica Genuair and the \nindividual components.\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe safety experience with Brimica Genuair comprised exposure in clinical trials at the recommended \ntherapeutic dose for up to 12 months, and in post-marketing experience.\n\nAdverse reactions associated with Brimica Genuair were similar to those of the individual \ncomponents. As Brimica Genuair contains aclidinium and formoterol, the type and severity of adverse \nreactions associated with each of the components may be expected with Brimica Genuair.\n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions with Brimica Genuair were nasopharyngitis (7.9%)\nand headache (6.8%).\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\n\nThe Brimica Genuair clinical development programme was conducted in patients with moderate or \nsevere COPD. A total of 1222 patients were treated with Brimica Genuair 340 micrograms \n/12 micrograms. The frequencies assigned to the adverse reactions are based on crude incidence rates \nobserved with Brimica Genuair 340 micrograms /12 micrograms in the pooled analysis of randomised, \nplacebo-controlled Phase III clinical studies of at least six months duration, or on experience with \nindividual components.\n\n\n\n6\n\nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); \ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data).\n\nSystem organ class Preferred term Frequency\n\nInfectious and infestations\n\nNasopharyngitis\nUrinary tract infection\nSinusitis\nTooth abscess\n\nCommon\n\nImmune system disorders\nHypersensitivity Rare\nAngioedema\nAnaphylactic reaction\n\nNot known\n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders\n\nHypokalaemia Uncommon\n\nHyperglycaemia Uncommon\n\nPsychiatric disorders\n\nInsomnia\nAnxiety\n\nCommon\n\nAgitation Uncommon\n\nNervous system disorders\n\nHeadache\nDizziness\nTremor\n\nCommon\n\nDysgeusia Uncommon\nEye disorders Blurred vision Uncommon\n\nCardiac disorders\n\nTachycardia\nElectrocardiogram QTc prolonged\nPalpitations\nAngina pectoris\n\nUncommon\n\nRespiratory, Thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\n\nCough Common\nDysphonia\nThroat irritation\n\nUncommon\n\nBronchospasm, including paradoxical Rare\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\n\nDiarrhoea\nNausea\nDry mouth\n\nCommon\n\nStomatitis Uncommon\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nRash\nPruritus\n\nUncommon\n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders\n\nMyalgia\nMuscle spasms\n\nCommon\n\nRenal and urinary disorders Urinary retention Uncommon\n\nInvestigations\n\nBlood creatine phosphokinase \nincreased\n\nCommon\n\nBlood pressure increased Uncommon\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n7\n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is limited evidence on the management of overdose with Brimica Genuair. High doses of \nBrimica Genuair may lead to exaggerated anticholinergic and/or β2-adrenergic signs and symptoms; \nthe most frequent of which include blurred vision, dry mouth, nausea, muscle spasm, tremor, \nheadache, palpitations and hypertension.\n\nBrimica Genuair should be discontinued in case of overdose. Supportive and symptomatic treatment is \nindicated.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, adrenergics in combination with \nanticholinergics, ATC code: R03AL05\n\nMechanism of action\n\nBrimica Genuair contains two bronchodilators: aclidinium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (also \nknown as an anticholinergic) and formoterol is a long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist. The combination \nof these substances with different mechanisms of action results in additive efficacy compared to that \nachieved with either component alone. As a consequence of the differential density of muscarinic \nreceptors and β2-adrenoceptors in the central and peripheral airways of the lung, muscarinic \nantagonists should be more effective in relaxing central airways and β2-adrenergic agonists should be \nmore effective in relaxing peripheral airways; relaxation of both central and peripheral airways with \ncombination treatment may contribute to its beneficial effects on lung function. Further information\nregarding these two substances is provided below.\n\nAclidinium is a competitive, selective muscarinic receptor antagonist, with a longer residence time at \nthe M3 receptors than the M2 receptors. M3 receptors mediate contraction of airway smooth muscle. \nInhaled aclidinium bromide acts locally in the lungs to antagonise M3 receptors of airway smooth \nmuscle and induce bronchodilation. Aclidinium has also been shown to provide benefits to patients \nwith COPD in terms of symptoms reduction, improvement in disease-specific health status, reduction \nin exacerbation rates and improvements in exercise tolerance. Since aclidinium bromide is quickly \nbroken down in plasma, the level of systemic anticholinergic undesirable effects is low.\n\nFormoterol is a potent selective β2-adrenoceptor agonist. Bronchodilation is induced by causing direct \nrelaxation of airway smooth muscle as a consequence of the increase in cyclic AMP through activation \nof adenylate cyclase. In addition to improving pulmonary function, formoterol has been shown to \nimprove symptoms and quality of life in patients with COPD.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nClinical efficacy studies showed that Brimica Genuair provides clinically meaningful improvements in \nlung function (as measured by the forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]) over 12 hours \nfollowing administration.\n\nBrimica Genuair demonstrated a rapid onset of action within 5 minutes of the first inhalation relative \nto placebo (p<0.0001). The onset of action of Brimica Genuair was comparable to the effect of the \nfast-acting β2-agonist formoterol 12 micrograms. Maximal bronchodilator effects (peak FEV1) relative \nto baseline were evident from day one (304 ml) and were maintained over the 6-month treatment \nperiod (326 ml).\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8\n\nCardiac electrophysiology\nNo clinically relevant effects of Brimica Genuair on ECG parameters (including QT-interval) \ncompared with aclidinium, formoterol and placebo were seen in Phase III studies of 6 to 12 months \nduration conducted in approximately 4,000 patients with COPD. No clinically significant effects of \nBrimica Genuair on cardiac rhythm were observed on 24-hour Holter monitoring in a subset of \n551 patients, of whom 114 received Brimica Genuair twice daily.\n\nClinical Efficacy and Safety\n\nThe Phase III clinical development programme included approximately 4,000 patients with a clinical \ndiagnosis of COPD and comprised two 6-month randomised, placebo- and active-controlled studies \n(ACLIFORM-COPD and AUGMENT), a 6-month extension of the AUGMENT study and a further \n12-month randomised controlled study. During these studies, patients were permitted to continue their \nstable treatment with inhaled corticosteroids, low doses of oral corticosteroids, oxygen therapy (if less \nthan 15h/day) or methylxanthines and to use salbutamol as rescue medication.\n\nEfficacy was assessed by measures of lung function, symptomatic outcomes, disease-specific health \nstatus, rescue medication use, and exacerbations. In long-term safety studies, Brimica Genuair was \nassociated with sustained efficacy when administered over a one-year treatment period with no \nevidence of tachyphylaxis.\n\nEffects on lung function\nBrimica Genuair 340/12 micrograms twice daily consistently provided clinically meaningful \nimprovements in lung function (as assessed by FEV1, forced vital capacity and inspiratory capacity)\ncompared with placebo. In Phase III studies, clinically meaningful bronchodilator effects were seen \nwithin 5 minutes of the first dose and were maintained over the dosing interval. There was a sustained\neffect over time in the six-months and one-year Phase III studies.\n\nFEV1 at 1 hour post-dose and trough FEV1 (compared to aclidinium 400 micrograms and formoterol \n12 micrograms, respectively) were defined as co-primary endpoints in both 6-month pivotal Phase III \nstudies to demonstrate the bronchodilator contributions of formoterol and aclidinium in Brimica\nGenuair, respectively.\n\nIn study ACLIFORM-COPD, Brimica Genuair showed improvements in FEV1 at 1 hour post-dose \nrelative to placebo and aclidinium of 299 ml and 125 ml, respectively (both p<0.0001) and \nimprovements in trough FEV1 relative to placebo and formoterol of 143 ml and 85 ml, respectively \n(both p<0.0001). In study AUGMENT, Brimica Genuair showed improvements in FEV1 at 1 hour \npost-dose relative to placebo and aclidinium of 284 ml and 108 ml (both p<0.0001), respectively, and \nimprovements in trough FEV1 relative to placebo and formoterol of 130 ml (p<0.0001) and 45 ml \n(p=0.01), respectively.\n\nSymptom relief and disease-specific health status benefits\n\nBreathlessness and other symptomatic outcomes:\nBrimica Genuair provided a clinically meaningful improvement in breathlessness (assessed by the \nTransition Dyspnoea Index [TDI]) with an improvement in the TDI focal score at 6 months compared \nto placebo of 1.29 units in study ACLIFORM-COPD (p<0.0001) and 1.44 units in study AUGMENT \n(p<0.0001). The percentages of patients with clinically meaningful improvements in TDI focal score \n(defined as an increase of at least 1 unit) were higher with Brimica Genuair than with placebo in \nACLIFORM-COPD (64.8% compared to 45.5%; p<0.001) and AUGMENT (58.1% compared to \n36.6%; p<0.0001).\n\nThe pooled analysis of these two studies showed Brimica Genuair to be associated with statistically \nsignificantly greater improvements in TDI focal score compared to aclidinium (0.4 units, p=0.016) or \nformoterol (0.5 units, p=0.009). In addition, a higher percentage of patients receiving Brimica Genuair \nresponded with a clinically meaningful improvement in TDI focal score compared to either aclidinium \n\n\n\n9\n\nor formoterol (61.9% compared to 55.7% and 57.0%, respectively; p=0.056 and p=0.100, \nrespectively).\n\nBrimica Genuair improved daily symptoms of COPD such as ‘breathlessness’, ‘chest symptoms’, \n‘cough and sputum’ (assessed by E-RS total score) as well as overall night-time symptoms, overall \nearly morning symptoms and symptoms limiting early morning activities compared to placebo, \naclidinium and formoterol but the improvements were not always statistically significant. \nAclidinium/formoterol did not statistically significantly reduce the average number of night-time \nawakenings due to COPD compared with placebo or formoterol.\n\nHealth-related quality of life:\nBrimica Genuair provided a clinically meaningful improvement in disease-specific health status (as \nassessed by the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ]) in study AUGMENT, with an \nimprovement in the SGRQ total score compared to placebo of -4.35 units (p<0.0001). The percentage \nof patients in AUGMENT who achieved a clinically meaningful improvement from baseline in SGRQ \ntotal score (defined as a decrease of at least 4 units) was higher with Brimica Genuair than with \nplacebo (58.2% compared to 38.7%, respectively; p<0.001). In study ACLIFORM-COPD, only a \nsmall decrease in SGRQ total score compared to placebo was observed due to an unexpectedly large \nplacebo response (p=0.598) and the percentages of patients who achieved clinically meaningful \nimprovements from baseline were 55.3% with Brimica Genuair and 53.2% with placebo (p=0.669).\n\nIn the pooled analysis of these two studies, Brimica Genuair showed greater improvements in SGRQ \ntotal score compared to formoterol (-1.7 units; p=0.018) or aclidinium (-0.79 units, p=0.273). In \naddition, a higher percentage of patients receiving Brimica Genuair responded with a clinically \nmeaningful improvement in SGRQ total score compared to aclidinium and formoterol (56.6% \ncompared to 53.9% and 52.2%, respectively; p=0.603 and p=0.270, respectively).\n\nCOPD exacerbation reductions\nPooled efficacy analysis of the two 6-month Phase III studies demonstrated a statistically significant \nreduction of 29% in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations (requiring treatment with antibiotics \nor corticosteroids or resulting in hospitalisations) with Brimica Genuair compared to placebo (rates per \npatient per year: 0.29 vs. 0.42, respectively; p=0.036).\n\nIn addition, Brimica Genuair statistically significantly delayed the time to first moderate or severe \nexacerbation compared to placebo (hazard ratio=0.70; p=0.027).\n\nUse of rescue medication\nBrimica Genuair reduced the use of rescue medication over 6 months compared to placebo (by\n0.9 puffs per day [p<0.0001]), aclidinium (by 0.4 puffs/day [p<0.001]) and formoterol (by \n0.2 puffs/day [p=0.062]).\n\nLung volumes, exercise endurance and physical activity\nThe effect of Brimica Genuair on lung volumes, exercise endurance and physical activity was\ninvestigated in an 8-week parallel, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical study in COPD patients \nwith hyperinflation (functional residual capacity [FRC] >120%).\n\nAfter 4 weeks of treatment Brimica Genuair implied improvement versus placebo in change from \nbaseline in morning pre-dose (trough) FRC, the primary endpoint, but the difference was not \nstatistically significant (-0.125 L; 95% CI=(-0.259, 0.010); p=0.069*). Brimica Genuair showed \nimprovements compared to placebo in lung volumes at 2-3h post dose (FRC=-0.366 L [95% CI=-\n0.515, -0.216; p<0.0001]; residual volume [RV]=-0.465 L [95% CI=-0.648, -0.281; p<0.0001] and \ninspiratory capacity [IC]=0.293 L [95% CI=0.208, 0.378; p<0.0001]).\n\nBrimica Genuair also showed improvements in exercise endurance time compared to placebo after 8 \nweeks of treatment (55 seconds [95% CI=5.6, 104.8; p=0.0292]; baseline value: 456 seconds).\n\n\n\n10\n\nAfter 4 weeks of treatment, Brimica Genuair improved the number of steps per day compared to \nplacebo (731 steps/day; 95% CI=279, 1181; p=0.0016) and reduced the percentage of inactive patients \n(<6000 steps per day) [40.8% compared to 54.5%; p<0.0001]. Improvements in the PROactive total \nscore were observed in patients treated with Brimica Genuair compared with placebo (p=0.0002).\n\nA behavioural intervention program was added to both treatment groups for an additional 4 weeks. \nThe number of steps/day in the Brimica Genuair treatment group was maintained resulting in a \ntreatment effect compared to placebo of 510 steps/day (p=0.1588) and a reduction versus placebo in \nthe percentage of inactive patients (<6000 steps per day) (41.5% compared to 50.4%; p=0.1134).\n\n*As the primary endpoint did not achieve statistical significance, all p-values for secondary endpoints\nare tested at a nominal significance level of 0.05, and no formal statistical inference can be drawn.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nBrimica Genuair in all subsets of the paediatric population in COPD (see section 4.2 for information \non paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nWhen aclidinium and formoterol were administered in combination by the inhaled route, the \npharmacokinetics of each component showed no relevant differences from those observed when the \nmedicinal products were administered separately.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing inhalation of a single dose of Brimica Genuair 340/12 micrograms, aclidinium and \nformoterol were rapidly absorbed into plasma, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 minutes \nof inhalation in healthy subjects and within 24 minutes of inhalation in patients with COPD. The peak \nplasma concentrations at steady state of aclidinium and formoterol observed in patients with COPD \ntreated with Brimica Genuair twice daily for 5 days were reached within 5 minutes post-inhalation and \nwere 128 pg/ml and 17 pg/ml, respectively.\n\nDistribution\n\nWhole lung deposition of inhaled aclidinium via Genuair averaged approximately 30% of the metered \ndose. The plasma protein binding of aclidinium determined in vitro most likely corresponded to the \nprotein binding of the metabolites due to the rapid hydrolysis of aclidinium in plasma; plasma protein \nbinding was 87% for the carboxylic acid metabolite and 15% for the alcohol metabolite. The main \nplasma protein that binds aclidinium is albumin.\n\nThe plasma protein binding of formoterol is 61% to 64% (34% primarily to albumin). There is no \nsaturation of binding sites in the concentration range reached with therapeutic doses.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nAclidinium is rapidly and extensively hydrolysed to its pharmacologically inactive alcohol- and \ncarboxylic acid-derivatives. Plasma levels of the acid metabolite are approximately 100-fold greater \nthan those of the alcohol metabolite and the unchanged active substance following inhalation. The \nhydrolysis occurs both chemically (non-enzymatically) and enzymatically by esterases, \nbutyrylcholinesterase being the main human esterase involved in the hydrolysis. The low absolute \nbioavailability of inhaled aclidinium (<5%) is because aclidinium undergoes extensive systemic and \npre-systemic hydrolysis whether deposited in the lung or swallowed.  Biotransformation via CYP450 \nenzymes plays a minor role in the total metabolic clearance of aclidinium. In vitro studies have shown \nthat aclidinium at the therapeutic dose or its metabolites do not inhibit or induce any of the cytochrome \nP450 (CYP450) enzymes and do not inhibit esterases (carboxylesterase, acetylcholinesterase and \n\n\n\n11\n\nbutyrylcholinesterase). In vitro studies have shown that aclidinium or its metabolites are not substrates \nor inhibitors of P-glycoprotein.\n\nFormoterol is eliminated primarily by metabolism. The prominent pathway involves direct \nglucuronidation, with O-demethylation followed by glucuronide conjugation being a further metabolic \npathway. Cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP2A6 are involved in \nthe O-demethylation of formoterol. Formoterol does not inhibit CYP450 enzymes at therapeutically \nrelevant concentrations.\n\nElimination\n\nFollowing inhalation of Brimica Genuair 340/12 micrograms, with plasma sampling up to 24 hours \npost-dose, the terminal elimination half-life observed for aclidinium bromide ranged from 11-33 hours \nand for formoterol from 12-18 hours.\n\nMean effective half-lives* observed for both aclidinium and formoterol (based on the accumulation \nratio) are approximately 10 hours.\n*Half-life consistent with product accumulation based on a known dose regimen.\n\nFollowing intravenous administration of radiolabelled aclidinium 400 micrograms to healthy subjects, \napproximately 1% of the dose was excreted as unchanged aclidinium bromide in the urine. Up to 65% \nof the dose was eliminated as metabolites in the urine and up to 33% as metabolites in the faeces.\nFollowing inhalation of aclidinium 200 micrograms and 400 micrograms by healthy subjects or \npatients with COPD, the urinary excretion of unchanged aclidinium was very low at about 0.1% of the \nadministered dose, indicating that renal clearance plays a minor role in the total aclidinium clearance \nfrom plasma.\n\nThe major part of a dose of formoterol is transformed by liver metabolism followed by renal \nelimination. After inhalation, 6% to 9% of the delivered dose of formoterol is excreted in the urine \nunchanged or as direct conjugates of formoterol.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly patients\nNo pharmacokinetics studies have been performed with aclidinium/formoterol in elderly subjects. \nSince no dosage adjustments are needed for either aclidinium or formoterol medicinal products in \nelderly patients, no dosage adjustment is warranted for aclidinium/formoterol in geriatric patients.\n\nRenally and hepatically impaired patients\nThere are no data regarding the specific use of aclidinium/formoterol in patients with renal or hepatic \nimpairment. Since no dosage adjustments are needed for either aclidinium or formoterol medicinal \nproducts in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, no dosage adjustment is warranted for \naclidinium/formoterol.\n\nRace\nFollowing repeated inhalations of Brimica Genuair 340/12 micrograms, the systemic exposure of \naclidinium and formoterol, as measured by AUC, is similar in Japanese and Caucasian patients.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans with aclidinium and formoterol based on \nconventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic \npotential and toxicity to reproduction and development.\n\nEffects of aclidinium in nonclinical studies with respect to reproductive toxicity (foetotoxic effects)\nand fertility (slight decreases in conception rate, number of corpora lutea, and pre- and post-\n\n\n\n12\n\nimplantation losses) were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the \nmaximum human exposure indication to be of little relevance to clinical use.\n\nFormoterol showed reduced fertility (implantation losses) in rats, as well as decreased early postnatal \nsurvival and birth weight with high systemic exposure to formoterol. A slight increase in the incidence \nof uterine leiomyomas has been observed in rats and mice; an effect which is considered to be a class-\neffect in rodents after long-term exposure to high doses of β2-adrenoreceptor agonists.\n\nNonclinical studies investigating the effects of aclidinium/formoterol on cardiovascular parameters \nshowed increased heart rates and arrhythmias at exposures sufficiently in excess of the maximum \nhuman exposure indication to be of little relevance to clinical use. These effects are known \nexaggerated pharmacological responses observed with β2-agonists.\n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information\n\nInstructions for Use\n\n1. What Brimica Genuair is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Brimica Genuair is\nThis medicine contains two active ingredients called aclidinium and formoterol fumarate dihydrate. \nBoth belong to a group of medicines called bronchodilators. Bronchodilators relax the muscles in your \nairways, which allows the airways to open more widely and helps you to breathe more easily. The \nGenuair inhaler delivers the active ingredients directly into your lungs as you breathe in.\n\nWhat Brimica Genuair is used for\nBrimica Genuair is used for adult patients who have breathing difficulties due to a lung disease called \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in which the airways and air sacs in the lungs become \ndamaged or blocked. By opening the airways, the medicine helps relieve symptoms such as shortness \nof breath. Taking Brimica Genuair regularly will reduce the effects of COPD on your everyday life.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Brimica Genuair\n\nDo not use Brimica Genuair:\n- if you are allergic to aclidinium, formoterol fumarate dihydrate or to the other ingredient of this \n\nmedicine (listed in Section 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Brimica Genuair, if you have any of the \nfollowing conditions/symptoms:\n- If you have asthma.

See section 4.\n\nBrimica Genuair is used as a maintenance (long-term) treatment for COPD. You should not use this \nmedicine to treat a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing.\n\nIf your usual COPD symptoms (breathlessness, wheezing, cough) do not improve or get worse while \nyou are using Brimica Genuair you should continue to use it, but go to see your doctor as soon as \npossible because you may need another medicine.\n\nIf you see halos around lights or coloured images, have eye pain or discomfort or suffer temporary \nblurring of vision, go to see your doctor for advice as soon as possible.\n\nDry mouth has been observed with medicines like Brimica Genuair. In the long-term, dry mouth can\nbe associated with tooth decay, so it is important to pay attention to oral hygiene.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nBrimica Genuair is not for use in children or adolescents below 18 years of age.\n\nOther medicines and Brimica Genuair\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.

These include medicines for the \ntreatment of:\n\no depression (such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants),\no bacterial infections (such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin),\no allergic reactions (anti-histamines).\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. You should not use Brimica\nGenuair if you are pregnant or are breast-feeding unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\nDriving and using machines\nBrimica Genuair is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines.

It is important that you read this \ninformation as the Genuair may work differently from inhalers you have used previously. A video \ndemonstration on how to use the Genuair inhaler is also available on www.genuair.com and through \nthe code below. If you have any questions about how to use your inhaler, please ask your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse for assistance.\n\nThe Instructions for Use is divided into the following sections:\n\n- Getting started\n- Step 1: Prepare your dose\n- Step 2: Inhale your medicine\n- Additional information\n\nGetting Started\n\nRead these Instructions for Use before you start using the medicine.\n\nBecome familiar with the parts of your Genuair inhaler.\n\nhttp://www.genuair.com/\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n37\n\nProtective\nCap\n\nFigure A\n\nBefore use:\n\na.Before first use, tear open the sealed bag and remove the inhaler. Throw away the bag and the \ndesiccant.\n\nb. Do not press the orange button until you are ready to take a dose.\nc. Pull off the cap by lightly squeezing the arrows marked on each side (Figure B).\n\nFigure B\n\nSTEP 1: Prepare your dose\n\n1.1 Look in the opening of the mouthpiece and make sure nothing is blocking it (Figure C).\n\n1.2 Look at the control window (should be red, Figure C).\n\nSqueeze here \nand pull\n\nControl window\nRed = confirms correct inhalation\n\nControl window\nGreen = inhaler ready to use\n\nMouthpiece\n\nOrange button\n\nDose\nindicator\n\n\n\n38\n\nFigure C\n\n1.3 Hold the inhaler horizontally with the mouthpiece facing you and the orange button on top \n\n(Figure D).\n\nFigure D\n\n1.4 Press the orange button all the way down to load your dose (Figure E).\n\nWhen you press the button all the way down, the control window changes from red to green.\n\nMake sure the orange button is on top. Do not tilt.\n\n1.5 Release the orange button (Figure F).  \n\nMake sure you release the button so the inhaler can work correctly.\n\nFigure E    Figure F\n\nRED\n\nCheck\nmouthpiece opening\n\n\n\n39\n\nStop and Check:\n\n1.6 Make sure the control window is now green (Figure G).\n\nYour medicine is ready to be inhaled.\n\nGo to ‘STEP 2: Inhale your medicine’.\n\nFigure G\n\nWhat to do if the control window is still red after pressing the button (Figure H).\n\nFigure H\n\nThe dose is not prepared. Go back to ‘STEP 1 Prepare your dose’ and repeat steps 1.1 to 1.6.\n\nSTEP 2: Inhale your medicine\n\nRead steps 2.1 to 2.7 fully before use. Do not tilt.\n\n2.1 Hold the inhaler away from your mouth, and breathe out completely. Never breathe out into\n\nthe inhaler (Figure I).\n\nFigure I\n\nGREEN\n\n\n\n40\n\n2.2 Hold your head upright, put the mouthpiece between your lips, and close your lips\n\ntightly around it (Figure J).\n\nDo not hold the orange button down while inhaling.\n\nFigure J\n\n2.3 Take a strong, deep breath through your mouth. Keep breathing in for as long as possible.\n\nA ‘click’ will let you know that you are inhaling correctly. Keep breathing in as long as possible \nafter you hear the ‘click’. Some patients may not hear the ‘click’. Use the control window to ensure \nyou have inhaled correctly.\n\n2.4 Take the inhaler out of your mouth.\n\n2.5 Hold your breath for as long as possible.\n\n2.6 Slowly breathe out away from the inhaler.\n\nSome patients may experience a grainy sensation in their mouth, or a slightly sweet or bitter taste. Do \nnot take an extra dose even if you do not taste or feel anything after inhaling.\n\nStop and Check:\n\n2.7 Make sure the control window is now red (Figure K). This means you have inhaled your \nmedicine correctly.\n\nFigure K\n\nRED\n\n\n\n41\n\nWhat to do if the control window is still green after inhalation (Figure L).\n\nFigure L\n\nThis means you have not inhaled your medicine correctly. Go back to ‘STEP 2 Inhale your medicine’\n\nand repeat steps 2.1 to 2.7.\n\nIf the control window still does not change to red, you may have forgotten to release the orange button\nbefore inhaling, or you may not have inhaled strongly enough. If this happens, try again. Make sure you\nhave released the orange button, and you have breathed out completely. Then take a strong, deep breath\nthrough the mouthpiece.\n\nPlease contact your doctor if the control window is still green after repeated attempts.\n\nPush the protective cap back onto the mouthpiece after each use (Figure M), to prevent contamination \nof the inhaler with dust or other materials. You should discard your inhaler if you lose the cap.\n\nFigure M\n\nAdditional information\n\nWhat should you do if you accidently prepare a dose?\n\nStore your inhaler with the protective cap in place until it is time to inhale your medicine, then remove \nthe cap and start at Step 1.6.\n\nHow does the dose indicator work?\n\n The dose indicator shows the total number of doses left in the inhaler (Figure N).\n On first use, every inhaler contains at least 60 doses, or at least 30 doses, depending on the \n\npack size.\n Each time you load a dose by pressing the orange button, the dose indicator moves by a small \n\namount towards the next number (50, 40, 30, 20, 10, or 0).\n\nWhen should you get a new inhaler?\n\nYou should get a new inhaler:\n\n\n\n42\n\n If your inhaler appears to be damaged or if you lose the cap, or\n When a red band appears in the dose indicator, this means you are nearing your last dose \n\n(Figure N), or\n If your inhaler is empty (Figure O).\n\nFigure N\n\nDose indicator moves slowly from 60 \nto 0: 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 0.\n\nRed bandDose\nindicator\n\n\n\n43\n\nHow do you know that your inhaler is empty?\n\nWhen the orange button will not return to its full upper position and is locked in a middle position, you \nhave reached the last dose (Figure O). Even though the orange button is locked, your last dose may \nstill be inhaled. After that, the inhaler cannot be used again and you should start using a new inhaler.\n\nFigure O\n\nHow should you clean the inhaler?\n\nNEVER use water to clean the inhaler, as this may damage your medicine.\n\nIf you wish to clean your inhaler, just wipe the outside of the mouthpiece with a dry tissue or paper \ntowel.\n\nLocked\n\n\n\n44\n\nAnnex IV\n\nScientific conclusions and grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing \n\nauthorisation(s)\n\n\n\n45\n\nScientific conclusions\n\nTaking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for aclidinium bromide / \n\nformoterol fumarate dihydrate, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows: \n\nDuring the reporting period of the PSUR, study D6560C00002 was completed and showed that the \n\nproportion of patients with an adverse event of ‘peripheral oedema’ was numerically lower in the \n\naclidinium group than in the placebo group. Similarly, in pooled clinical studies with Duaklir \n\nGenuair/Brimica Genuair and its mono-component, ‘peripheral oedema’ was numerically less \n\ncommon on the active treatment than on placebo. Moreover, post-marketing reports of ‘peripheral \n\noedema’ did not show positive re-challenge. Based on the above mentioned data, the PRAC \n\nconsidered that ‘peripheral oedema’ should be removed from the list of adverse drug reactions in \n\nsection 4.8 of the SmPC and ‘Swelling of hands, ankles or feet’ should be deleted in section 4 of the \n\nPackage Leaflet.\n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.\n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)\n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for aclidinium bromide / formoterol fumarate dihydrate \n\nthe CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing \n\naclidinium bromide / formoterol fumarate dihydrate is unchanged subject to the proposed changes \n\nto the product information\n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
