NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nLamivudine Teva 100 mg film-coated tablets  \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 100 mg lamivudine  \nFor the full list of excipients see section 6.1.  \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet  \n \nOrange, capsule shaped, biconvex film-coated tablet – engraved with “L 100” on one side and plain \non the other. \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nLamivudine Teva is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults with:  \n \n• compensated liver disease with evidence of active viral replication, persistently elevated serum \n\nalanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and histological evidence of active liver inflammation and \n/ or fibrosis. Initiation of lamivudine treatment should only be considered when the use of an \nalternative antiviral agent with a higher genetic barrier is not available or appropriate (see section \n5.1). \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy with Lamivudine Teva should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of \nchronic hepatitis B.  \n \nPosology \n \nAdults  \nThe recommended dosage of Lamivudine Teva is 100 mg once daily. \n \nDuration of treatment  \nThe optimal duration of treatment is unknown. \n \n• In patients with HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) without cirrhosis, treatment should be \n\nadministered for at least 6-12 months after HBeAg seroconversion (HBeAg and HBV DNA loss \nwith HBeAb detection) is confirmed, to limit the risk of virological relapse, or until HBsAg \nseroconversion or there is loss of efficacy (see section 4.4). Serum ALT and HBV DNA levels \nshould be followed regularly after treatment discontinuation to detect any late virological relapse.  \n\n• In patients with HBeAg negative CHB (pre-core mutant) without cirrhosis, treatment should be \nadministered at least until HBs seroconversion or there is evidence of loss of efficacy. With \nprolonged treatment, regular reassessment is recommended to confirm that continuation of the \nselected therapy remains appropriate for the patient.  \n\n• In patients with cirrhosis and in liver transplant recipients, treatment cessation is not \nrecommended (see section 5.1).  \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nIf lamivudine is discontinued, patients should be periodically monitored for evidence of recurrent \nhepatitis (see section 4.4).  \n \nClinical resistance  \nIn patients with either HBeAg positive or HBeAg negative CHB, the development of YMDD \n(tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate) mutant HBV may result in a diminished therapeutic \nresponse to lamivudine, indicated by a rise in HBV DNA and ALT from previous on-treatment levels. \nIn order to reduce the risk of resistance in patients receiving lamivudine monotherapy, a switch to or \naddition of an alternative agent without cross-resistance to lamivudine based on therapeutic guidelines \nshould be considered if serum HBV DNA remains detectable at or beyond 24 weeks of treatment (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nFor the treatment of patients who are co-infected with HIV and are currently receiving or plan to \nreceive treatment with lamivudine or the combination lamivudine-zidovudine, the dose of lamivudine \nprescribed for HIV infection (usually 150 mg/twice daily in combination with other antiretrovirals) \nshould be maintained. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment  \nLamivudine serum concentrations (AUC) are increased in patients with moderate to severe renal \nimpairment due to decreased renal clearance. The dosage should therefore be reduced for patients \nwith a creatinine clearance of < 50 ml/minute. Lamivudine Teva is not suitable for patients who \nrequire doses below 100 mg. \n \nData available in patients undergoing intermittent haemodialysis (for less than or equal to 4 hrs \ndialysis 2-3 times weekly), indicate that following the initial dosage reduction of lamivudine to correct \nfor the patient’s creatinine clearance, no further dosage adjustments are required while undergoing \ndialysis.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nData obtained in patients with hepatic impairment, including those with end-stage liver disease \nawaiting transplant, show that lamivudine pharmacokinetics are not significantly affected by hepatic \ndysfunction. Based on these data, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with hepatic impairment \nunless accompanied by renal impairment.  \n \nElderly \nIn elderly patients, normal ageing with accompanying renal decline has no clinically significant effect \non lamivudine exposure, except in patients with creatinine clearance of < 50 ml/min. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Lamivudine Teva in infants, children and adolescents aged below 18 years \nhave not been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.4 and 5.1 but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \nOral use.  \nLamivudine Teva can be taken with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nLactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nOccurrences of lactic acidosis (in the absence of hypoxaemia), sometimes fatal, usually associated \nwith severe hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis, have been reported with the use of nucleoside \nanalogues. As lamivudine is a nucleoside analogue, this risk cannot be excluded. Treatment with \nnucleoside analogues should be discontinued when rapidly elevating aminotransferase levels, \nprogressive hepatomegaly or metabolic/lactic acidosis of unknown aetiology occur. Benign digestive \nsymptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, might be indicative of lactic acidosis \ndevelopment. Severe cases, sometimes with fatal outcome, were associated with pancreatitis, liver \nfailure/hepatic steatosis, renal failure and higher levels of serum lactate. Caution should be exercised \nwhen prescribing nucleoside analogues to any patient (particularly obese women) with hepatomegaly, \nhepatitis or other known risk factors for liver disease and hepatic steatosis (including certain \nmedicinal products and alcohol). Patients co-infected with hepatitis C and treated with alpha \ninterferon and ribivirin may constitute a special risk. These patients should be followed closely. \n \nExacerbations of hepatitis \n \nExacerbations on treatment \nSpontaneous exacerbations in chronic hepatitis B are relatively common and are characterised by \ntransient increases in serum ALT. After initiating antiviral therapy, serum ALT may increase in some \npatients as serum HBV DNA levels decline. In patients with compensated liver disease, these \nincreases in serum ALT were generally not accompanied by an increase in serum bilirubin \nconcentrations or signs of hepatic decompensation. \n \nHBV viral subpopulations with reduced susceptibility to lamivudine (YMDD mutant HBV) have been \nidentified with extended therapy. In some patients the development of YMDD mutant HBV can lead \nto exacerbation of hepatitis, primarily detected by serum ALT elevations and re-emergence of HBV \nDNA (see section 4.2). In patients who have YMDD mutant HBV, a switch to or addition of an \nalternative agent without cross resistance to lamivudine based on therapeutic guidelines should be \nconsidered (see section 5.1). \n \nExacerbations after treatment discontinuation \nAcute exacerbation of hepatitis has been observed in patients who have discontinued hepatitis B \ntherapy and is usually detected by serum ALT elevations and re-emergence of HBV DNA. In the \ncontrolled Phase III trials with no-active-treatment follow-up, the incidence of post-treatment ALT \nelevations (more than 3 times baseline) was higher in lamivudine-treated patients (21%) compared \nwith those receiving placebo (8%). However, the proportion of patients who had post-treatment \nelevations associated with bilirubin elevations was low and similar in both treatment arms (see Table \n3 in section 5.1). For lamivudine-treated patients, the majority of post-treatment ALT elevations \noccurred between 8 and 12 weeks post-treatment. Most events have been self-limiting, however some \nfatalities have been observed. If Lamivudine Teva is discontinued, patients should be periodically \nmonitored both clinically and by assessment of serum liver function tests (ALT and bilirubin levels), \nfor at least four months, and then as clinically indicated.  \n \nTransplantation recipients are at greater risk from active viral replication. Due to the marginal liver \nfunction in these patients, hepatitis reactivation at discontinuation of lamivudine or loss of efficacy \nduring treatment may induce severe and even fatal decompensation. These patients should be \nmonitored for clinical, virological and serological parameters associated with hepatitis B, liver and \nrenal function, and antiviral response during treatment (at least every month), and, if treatment is \ndiscontinued for any reason, for at least 6 months after treatment. Laboratory parameters to be \nmonitored should include (as a minimum) serum ALT, bilirubin, albumin, blood urea nitrogen, \ncreatinine, and virological status: HBV antigen/antibody, and serum HBV DNA concentrations when \npossible. Patients experiencing signs of hepatic insufficiency during or post-treatment should be \nmonitored more frequently as appropriate. \n \nFor patients who develop evidence of recurrent hepatitis post-treatment, there are insufficient data on \nthe benefits of re-initiation of lamivudine treatment. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nMitochondrial dysfunction \nNucleoside and nucleotide analogues have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo to cause a variable \ndegree of mitochondrial damage. There have been reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in infants \nexposed in utero and/or post-natally to nucleoside analogues. The main adverse events reported are \nhaematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia), metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, \nhyperlipasemia). Some late-onset neurological disorders have been reported (hypertonia, convulsion, \nabnormal behaviour). The neurological disorders might be transient or permanent. Any child exposed \nin utero to nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, should have clinical and laboratory follow-up and \nshould be fully investigated for possible mitochondrial dysfunction in cases which have relevant signs \nor symptoms. \n \nPaediatric patients \nLamivudine has been administered to children (2 years and above) and adolescents with compensated \nchronic hepatitis B. However, due to limitations of the data, the administration of lamivudine to this \npatient population is not currently recommended (see section 5.1).  \n \nDelta hepatitis or hepatitis C \nThe efficacy of lamivudine in patients co-infected with Delta hepatitis or hepatitis C has not been \nestablished and caution is advised.  \n \nImmunosuppressive treatments \nData are limited on the use of lamivudine in HBeAg negative (pre-core mutant) patients and in those \nreceiving concurrent immunosuppressive regimes, including cancer chemotherapy. Lamivudine \nshould be used with caution in these patients. \n \nMonitoring \nDuring treatment with Lamivudine Teva patients should be monitored regularly. Serum ALT and \nHBV DNA levels should be monitored at 3 month intervals and in HBeAg positive patients HBeAg \nshould be assessed every 6 months.  \n \nHIV co-infection \nFor the treatment of patients who are co-infected with HIV and are currently receiving or plan to \nreceive treatment with lamivudine or the combination lamivudine-zidovudine, the dose of lamivudine \nprescribed for HIV infection (usually 150 mg/twice daily in combination with other antiretrovirals) \nshould be maintained. For HIV co-infected patients not requiring anti-retroviral therapy, there is a risk \nof HIV mutation when using lamivudine alone for treating chronic hepatitis B. \n \nTransmission of hepatitis B  \nThere is no information available on maternal-foetal transmission of hepatitis B virus in pregnant \nwomen receiving treatment with lamivudine. The standard recommended procedures for hepatitis B \nvirus immunisation in infants should be followed.  \n \nPatients should be advised that therapy with lamivudine has not been proven to reduce the risk of \ntransmission of hepatitis B virus to others and therefore, appropriate precautions should still be taken.  \n \nInteractions with other medicinal products \nLamivudine Teva should not be taken with any other medicinal products containing lamivudine or \nmedicinal products containing emtricitabine (see section 4.5). \n \nThe combination of lamivudine with cladribine is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nExcipient(s) \n \nSodium \n\n\n\n6 \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say \nessentially “sodium-free”. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.  \n \nThe likelihood of metabolic interactions is low due to limited metabolism and plasma protein binding \nand almost complete renal elimination of unchanged substance.  \n \nLamivudine is predominantly eliminated by active organic cationic secretion. The possibility of \ninteractions with other medicinal products administered concurrently should be considered, \nparticularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic \ntransport system e.g. trimethoprim. Other medicinal products (e.g. ranitidine, cimetidine) are \neliminated only in part by this mechanism and were shown not to interact with lamivudine.  \n \nSubstances shown to be predominately excreted either via the active organic anionic pathway, or by \nglomerular filtration are unlikely to yield clinically significant interactions with lamivudine.  \nAdministration of trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole 160 mg/800 mg increased lamivudine exposure by \nabout 40 %. Lamivudine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim or \nsulphamethoxazole. However, unless the patient has renal impairment, no dosage adjustment of \nlamivudine is necessary.  \n \nA modest increase in Cmax (28 %) was observed for zidovudine when administered with lamivudine, \nhowever overall exposure (AUC) was not significantly altered. Zidovudine had no effect on the \npharmacokinetics of lamivudine (see section 5.2).  \n \nLamivudine has no pharmacokinetic interaction with alpha-interferon when the two medicinal \nproducts are concurrently administered. There were no observed clinically significant adverse \ninteractions in patients taking lamivudine concurrently with commonly used immunosuppressant \nmedicinal products (e.g. cyclosporin A). However, formal interaction studies have not been \nperformed.  \n \nEmtricitabine \nDue to similarities, Lamivudine Teva should not be administered concomitantly with other cytidine \nanalogues, such as emtricitabine. Moreover, Lamivudine Teva should not be taken with any other \nmedicinal products containing lamivudine (see section 4.4). \n \nCladribine  \nIn vitro lamivudine inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of cladribine leading to a potential risk \nof cladribine loss of efficacy in case of combination in the clinical setting. Some clinical findings also \nsupport a possible interaction between lamivudine and cladribine. Therefore, the concomitant use of \nlamivudine with cladribine is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nSorbitol \nCo-administration of sorbitol solution (3.2 g, 10.2 g, 13.4 g) with a single 300 mg dose (Adult HIV \ndaily dose) of lamivudine oral solution resulted in dose-dependent decreases of 14%, 32%, and 36% \nin lamivudine exposure (AUC∞) and 28%, 52%, and 55% in the Cmax of lamivudine in adults. When \npossible, avoid chronic co-administration of Lamivudine Teva with medicinal products containing \nsorbitol or other osmotic acting poly-alcohols or monosaccharide alcohols (e.g. xylitol, mannitol, \nlactitol, maltitol). Consider more frequent monitoring of HBV viral load when chronic co-\nadministration cannot be avoided.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n\n\n\n7 \n\nA large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1000 exposed outcomes) indicate no \nmalformative toxicity. Lamivudine Teva can be used during pregnancy if clinically needed.  \n \nFor patients who are being treated with lamivudine and subsequently become pregnant consideration \nshould be given to the possibility of a recurrence of hepatitis on discontinuation of lamivudine. \n \nBreast-feeding \nBased on more than 200 mother/child pairs treated for HIV, serum concentrations of lamivudine in \nbreastfed infants of mothers treated for HIV are very low ( less than 4% of maternal serum \nconcentrations) and progressively decrease to undetectable levels when breastfed infants reach 24 \nweeks of age. The total amount of lamivudine ingested by a breastfed infant is very low and is \ntherefore likely to result in exposures exerting a sub-optimal antiviral effect. Maternal hepatitis B is \nnot a contraindication to breast-feeding if the newborn is adequately managed for hepatitis B \nprevention at birth, and there is no evidence that the low concentration of lamivudine in human milk \nleads to adverse reactions in breastfed infants. Therefore breastfeeding may be considered in breast- \nfeeding mothers being treated with lamivudine for HBV taking into account the benefit of breast \nfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. Where there is maternal transmission \nof HBV, despite adequate prophylaxis, consideration should be given to discontinuing breastfeeding \nto reduce the risk of the emergence of lamivudine resistant mutants in the infant.  \n \nFertility \nReproductive studies in animals have shown no effect on male or female fertility (see section 5.3). \n \nMitochondrial dysfunction:  \nNucleoside and nucleotide analogues have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo to cause a variable \ndegree of mitochondrial damage. There have been reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in infants \nexposed in utero and/or post-natally to nucleoside analogues (see section 4.4). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients should be informed that malaise and fatigue have been reported during treatment with \nlamivudine. The clinical status of the patient and the adverse reaction profile of lamivudine should be \nborne in mind when considering the patient's ability to drive or operate machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe incidence of adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities (with the exception of elevations of \nALT and CPK, see below) were similar between placebo and lamivudine treated patients). The most \ncommon adverse reactions reported were malaise and fatigue, respiratory tract infections, throat and \ntonsil discomfort, headache, abdominal discomfort and pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \nAdverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency. Frequency categories are \nonly assigned to those adverse reactions considered to be at least possibly causally related to \nlamivudine. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), \nuncommon (≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1000),very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nThe frequency categories assigned to the adverse reactions are mainly based on experience from \nclinical trials including a total of 1,171 patients with chronic hepatitis B receiving lamivudine at \n100 mg. \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nNot known Thrombocytopenia \nImmune system disorders: \n\n\n\n8 \n\nRare Angioedema \nHepatobiliary disorders \nVery common ALT elevations (see section 4.4) \nExacerbations of hepatitis, primarily detected by serum ALT elevations, have been reported ‘on-\ntreatment’ and following lamivudine withdrawal. Most events have been self-limited, however \nfatalities have been observed very rarely (see section 4.4). \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon Rash, pruritus \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon Elevations of CPK \n Common Muscle disorders, including myalgia and cramps*  \n\n \nNot known Rhabdomyolysis \n* In Phase III studies frequency observed in the lamivudine treatment group was not greater than \nobserved in the placebo group \n \nPaediatric population  \nBased on limited data in children aged 2 to 17 years, there were no new safety issues identified \ncompared to adults. \n \nOther special populations \n \nIn patients with HIV infection, cases of pancreatitis and peripheral neuropathy (or paresthesia) have \nbeen reported. In patients with chronic hepatitis B there was no observed difference in incidence of \nthese events between placebo and lamivudine treated patients.  \n \nCases of lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, usually associated with severe hepatomegaly and hepatic  \nsteatosis, have been reported with the use of combination nucleoside analogue therapy in patients with  \nHIV. There have been rare reports of lactic acidosis in patients receiving lamivudine for hepatitis B.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAdministration of lamivudine at very high dose levels in acute animal studies did not result in any \norgan toxicity. Limited data are available on the consequences of ingestion of acute overdoses in \nhumans. No fatalities occurred, and the patients recovered. No specific signs or symptoms have been \nidentified following such overdose.  \n \nIf overdose occurs the patient should be monitored and standard supportive treatment applied as \nrequired. Since lamivudine is dialysable, continuous haemodialysis could be used in the treatment of \noverdose, although this has not been studied.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group - Antivirals for systemic use, nucleoside and nucleotide reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors,ATC Code: J05AF05.  \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nLamivudine is an antiviral agent which is active against hepatitis B virus in all cell lines tested and in \nexperimentally infected animals.  \n \nLamivudine is metabolised by both infected and uninfected cells to the triphosphate (TP) derivative \nwhich is the active form of the parent compound. The intracellular half life of the triphosphate in \nhepatocytes is 17-19 hours in vitro. Lamivudine-TP acts as a substrate for the HBV viral polymerase. \n \nThe formation of further viral DNA is blocked by incorporation of lamivudine-TP into the chain and \nsubsequent chain termination.  \nLamivudine-TP does not interfere with normal cellular deoxynucleotide metabolism. It is also only a \nweak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases alpha and beta. Furthermore, lamivudine-TP has \nlittle effect on mammalian cell DNA content.  \n \nIn assays relating to potential substance effects on mitochondrial structure and DNA content and \nfunction, lamivudine lacked appreciable toxic effects. It has a very low potential to decrease \nmitochondrial DNA content, is not permanently incorporated into mitochondrial DNA, and does not \nact as an inhibitor of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma.  \n \nClinical experience  \n \nExperience in patients with HBeAg positive CHB and compensated liver disease  \nIn controlled studies, 1 year of lamivudine therapy significantly suppressed HBV DNA replication \n[34-57 % of patients were below the assay detection limits (Abbott Genostics solution hybridization \nassay, LLOD < 1.6 pg/ml)}, normalised ALT level (40-72 % of patients), induced HBeAg \nseroconversion (HBeAg loss and HBeAb detection with HBV DNA loss [by conventional assay], \n16-18 % of patients), improved histology (38-52 % of patients had a ≥ 2 point decrease in the Knodell \nHistologic Activity Index [HAI]) and reduced progression of fibrosis (in 3-17 % of patients) and \nprogression to cirrhosis. \n \nContinued lamivudine treatment for an additional 2 years in patients who had failed to achieve \nHBeAg seroconversion in the initial 1 year controlled studies resulted in further improvement in \nbridging fibrosis. In patients with YMDD mutant HBV, 41/82 (50 %) patients had improvement in \nliver inflammation and 40/56 (71 %) patients without YMDD mutant HBV had improvement. \nImprovement in bridging fibrosis occurred in 19/30 (63 %) patients without YMDD mutant and 22/44 \n(50 %) patients with the mutant. Five percent (3/56) of patients without the YMDD mutant and 13 % \n(11/82) of patients with YMDD mutant showed worsening in liver inflammation compared to pre-\ntreatment. Progression to cirrhosis occurred in 4/68 (6 %) patients with the YMDD mutant, whereas \nno patients without the mutant progressed to cirrhosis.  \n \nIn an extended treatment study in Asian patients (NUCB3018) the HBeAg seroconversion rate and \nALT normalisation rate at the end of the 5 year treatment period was 48 % (28/58) and 47 % (15/32), \nrespectively. HBeAg seroconversion was increased in patients with elevated ALT levels; 77 % \n(20/26) of patients with pre-treatment ALT > 2 x ULN seroconverted. At the end of 5 years, all \npatients had HBV DNA levels that were undetectable or lower than pre-treatment levels.  \n \nFurther results from the trial by YMDD mutant status are summarised in Table 1.  \n \nTable 1: Efficacy results 5 years by YMDD status (Asian Study) NUCB3018  \n \n\n Subjects, % (no.) \nYMDD mutant HBV status YMDD1 Non-YMDD1 \n\nHBeAg seroconversion \n \n\n- All patients  \n- Baseline ALT ≤ 1 x ULN2  \n\n \n \n38  (15/40) \n9     (1/11) \n\n \n \n72    (13/18) \n33      (2/6) \n\n\n\n10 \n\n- Baseline ALT > 2 x ULN \n \n\nUndetectable HBV DNA  \n \n\n- Baseline3  \n \n\n- Week 2604 \n   negative  \n   positive < baseline  \n   positive > baseline \n \n\nALT normalisation \n \n- Baseline  \n  normal  \n  above normal  \n \n- Week 260  \n  normal     \n  above normal < baseline     \n  above normal > baseline \n \n\n60   (9/15) \n \n \n \n5 (2/40) \n \n \n8       (2/25) \n92   (23/25) \n0 \n \n \n \n \n28   (11/40) \n73   (29/40) \n \n \n46   (13/28) \n21    (6/28) \n32    (9/28) \n\n100  (11/11) \n \n \n \n6 (1/18) \n \n \n0 \n100    (4/4) \n0 \n \n \n \n \n33     (6/18) \n67    (12/18) \n \n \n50      (2/4) \n0 \n50      (2/4) \n\n \n1 Patients designated as YMDD mutant were those with ≥5 % YMDD mutant HBV at any annual time-point during the 5-year period. \nPatients categorised as non-YMDD mutant were those with > 95 % wild-type HBV at all annual time-points during the 5-year study period  \n2 Upper limit of normal  \n3 Abbott Genostics solution hybridisation assay (LLOD < 1.6 pg/ml  \n4 Chiron Quantiplex assay (LLOD 0.7 Meq/ml)  \n \nComparative data according to YMDD status were also available for histological assessment but only \nup to three years. In patients with YMDD mutant HBV, 18/39 (46 %) had improvements in \nnecroinflammatory activity and 9/39 (23 %) had worsening. In patients without the mutant, 20/27 \n(74 %) had improvements in necroinflammatory activity and 2/27 (7 %) had worsening.  \n \nFollowing HBeAg seroconversion, serologic response and clinical remission are generally durable \nafter stopping lamivudine. However, relapse following seroconversion can occur. In a long-term \nfollow-up study of patients who had previously seroconverted and discontinued lamivudine, late \nvirological relapse occurred in 39 % of the subjects. Therefore, following HBeAg seroconversion, \npatients should be periodically monitored to determine that serologic and clinical responses are being \nmaintained. In patients who do not maintain a sustained serological response, consideration should be \ngiven to retreatment with either lamivudine or an alternative antiviral agent for resumption of clinical \ncontrol of HBV.  \n \nIn patients followed for up to 16 weeks after discontinuation of treatment at one year, post-treatment \nALT elevations were observed more frequently in patients who had received lamivudine than in \npatients who had received placebo. A comparison of post-treatment ALT elevations between weeks 52 \nand 68 in patients who discontinued lamivudine at week 52 and patients in the same studies who \nreceived placebo throughout the treatment course is shown in Table 2. The proportion of patients who \nhad post-treatment ALT elevations in association with an increase in bilirubin levels was low and \nsimilar in patients receiving either lamivudine or placebo.  \n \nTable 2: Post-treatment ALT Elevations in 2 Placebo-Controlled Studies in Adults  \n \n\nAbnormal Value  \n\nPatients with ALT Elevation/  \nPatients with Observations* \n\nLamivudine Placebo \nALT ≥ 2 x baseline value  37/137 (27 %) 22/116 (19 %)  \n\n\n\n11 \n\nALT ≥ 3 x baseline value†  29/137 (21 %) 9/116 (8 %) \nALT ≥ 2 x baseline value and absolute ALT > 500 \nIU/l  21/137 (15 %) 8/116 (7 %) \nALT ≥2 x baseline value; and bilirubin >2 x ULN \nand ≥2 x baseline value  1/137 (0.7 %) 1/116 (0.9 %) \n \n*Each patient may be represented in one or more category. †\nComparable to a Grade 3 toxicity in accordance with modified WHO criteria.  \n\nULN = Upper limit of normal.  \n \nExperience in patients with HBeAg negative CHB:  \nInitial data indicate the efficacy of lamivudine in patients with HBeAg negative CHB is similar to \npatients with HBeAg positive CHB, with 71 % of patients having HBV DNA suppressed below the \ndetection limit of the assay, 67 % ALT normalisation and 38 % with improvement in HAI after one \nyear of treatment. When lamivudine was discontinued, the majority of patients (70 %) had a return of \nviral replication. Data is available from an extended treatment study in HBeAg negative patients \n(NUCAB3017) treated with lamivudine. After two years of treatment in this study, ALT normalisation \nand undetectable HBV DNA occurred in 30/69 (43 %) and 32/68 (47 %) patients respectively and \nimprovement in necroinflammatory score in 18/49 (37 %) patients. In patients without YMDD mutant \nHBV, 14/22 (64 %) showed improvement in necroinflammatory score and 1/22 (5 %) patients \nworsened compared to pre-treatment. In patients with the mutant, 4/26 (15 %) patients showed \nimprovement in necroinflammatory score and 8/26 (31 %) patients worsened compared to pre-\ntreatment. No patients in either group progressed to cirrhosis.  \n \nFrequency of emergence of YMDD mutant HBV and impact on the treatment response:  \nLamivudine monotherapy results in the selection of YMDD mutant HBV in approximately 24 % of \npatients following one year of therapy, increasing to 69 % following 5 years of therapy. Development \nof YMDD mutant HBV is associated with reduced treatment response in some patients, as evidenced \nby increased HBV DNA levels and ALT elevations from previous on-therapy levels, progression of \nsigns and symptoms of hepatitis disease and/or worsening of hepatic necroinflammatory findings. \nGiven the risk of YMDD mutant HBV, maintenance of lamivudine monotherapy is not appropriate in \npatients with detectable serum HBV DNA at or beyond 24 weeks of treatment (see section 4.4).  \n \nIn a retrospective study to determine the factors associated with HBV DNA breakthrough, 159 Asian \nHBeAg-positive patients were treated with lamivudine and followed up for a median period of almost \n30 months. Those with HBV DNA levels greater than 200 copies/mL at 6 months (24 weeks) of \nlamivudine therapy had a 60 % chance of developing the YMDD mutant compared with 8 % of those \nwith HBV DNA levels less than 200 copies/mL at 24 weeks of lamivudine therapy. The risk for \ndeveloping YMDD mutant was 63% versus 13% with a cut off of 1000 copies/ml (NUCB3009 and \nNUCB3018). \n \nExperience in patients with decompensated liver disease:  \nPlacebo controlled studies have been regarded as inappropriate in patients with decompensated liver \ndisease, and have not been undertaken. In non-controlled studies, where lamivudine was administered \nprior to and during transplantation, effective HBV DNA suppression and ALT normalisation was \ndemonstrated. When lamivudine therapy was continued post transplantation there was reduced graft \nre-infection by HBV, increased HBsAg loss and on one-year survival rate of 76-100 %.  \n \nAs anticipated due to the concomitant immunosuppression, the rate of emergence of YMDD mutant \nHBV after 52 weeks treatment was higher (36 %-64 %) in the liver transplant population than in the \nimmunocompetent CHB patients (14 %-32 %). \n \nExperience in CHB patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis:  \nIn a placebo-controlled study in 651 patients with clinically compensated chronic hepatitis B and \nhistologically confirmed fibrosis or cirrhosis, lamivudine treatment (median duration 32 months) \n\n\n\n12 \n\nsignificantly reduced the rate of overall disease progression (34/436, 7.8 % for lamivudine versus \n38/215, 17.7 % for placebo, p=0.001), demonstrated by a significant reduction in the proportion of \npatients having increased Child-Pugh scores (15/436, 3.4 % versus 19/215, 8.8 %, p=0.023) or \ndeveloping hepatocellular carcinoma (17/436, 3.9 % versus 16/215, 7.4 %, p=0.047). The rate of \noverall disease progression in the lamivudine group was higher for subjects with detectable YMDD \nmutant HBV DNA (23/209, 11 %) compared to those without detectable YMDD mutant HBV \n(11/221, 5 %). However, disease progression in YMDD subjects in the lamivudine group was lower \nthan the disease progression in the placebo group (23/209, 11 % versus 38/214, 18 % respectively). \nConfirmed HBeAg seroconversion occurred in 47 % (118/252) of subjects treated with lamivudine \nand 93 % (320/345) of subjects receiving lamivudine became HBV DNA negative (VERSANT \n[version 1], bDNA assay, LLOD < 0.7 MEq/ml) during the study.  \n \nExperience in children and adolescents:  \nLamivudine has been administered to children and adolescents with compensated CHB in a placebo \ncontrolled study of 286 patients aged 2 to 17 years. This population primarily consisted of children \nwith minimal hepatitis B. A dose of 3 mg/kg once daily (up to a maximum of 100 mg daily) was used \nin children aged 2 to 11 years and a dose of 100 mg once daily in adolescents aged 12 years and \nabove. This dose needs to be further substantiated. The difference in the HBeAg seroconversion rates \n(HBeAg and HBV DNA loss with HBeAb detection) between placebo and lamivudine was not \nstatistically significant in this population (rates after one year were 13 % (12/95) for placebo versus \n22 % (42/191) for lamivudine; p=0.057). The incidence of YMDD mutant HBV was similar to that \nobserved in adults, ranging from 19 % at week 52 up to 45 % in patients treated continuously for 24 \nmonths. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption  \n \nLamivudine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and the bioavailability of oral lamivudine \nin adults is normally between 80 and 85 %. Following oral administration, the mean time (tmax) to \nmaximal serum concentrations (Cmax) is about an hour. At therapeutic dose levels i.e. 100 mg once \ndaily, Cmax is in the order of 1.1-1.5 µg/ml and trough levels were 0.015-0.020 µg/ml.  \n \nCo-administration of lamivudine with food resulted in a delay of tmax and a lower Cmax (decreased by \nup to 47 %). However, the extent (based on the AUC) of lamivudine absorbed was not influenced, \ntherefore lamivudine can be administered with or without food.  \n \nDistribution  \n \nFrom intravenous studies the mean volume of distribution is 1.3 l/kg. Lamivudine exhibits linear \npharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range and displays low plasma protein binding to albumin.  \nLimited data shows lamivudine penetrates the central nervous system and reaches the cerebro-spinal \nfluid (CSF). The mean lamivudine CSF/serum concentration ratio 2-4 hours after oral administration \nwas approximately 0.12.  \n \nBiotransformation  \n \nLamivudine is predominately cleared by renal excretion of unchanged substance. The likelihood of \nmetabolic substance interactions with lamivudine is low due to the small (5-10 %) extent of hepatic \nmetabolism and the low plasma protein binding.  \n \nElimination  \n \nThe mean systemic clearance of lamivudine is approximately 0.3 l/h/kg. The observed half-life of \nelimination is 5 to 7 hours. The majority of lamivudine is excreted unchanged in the urine via \n\n\n\n13 \n\nglomerular filtration and active secretion (organic cationic transport system). Renal clearance \naccounts for about 70 % of lamivudine elimination.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nStudies in patients with renal impairment show lamivudine elimination is affected by renal \ndysfunction. Dose reduction in patients with a creatinine clearance of < 50 ml/min is necessary (see \nsection 4.2).  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of lamivudine are unaffected by hepatic impairment. Limited data in patients \nundergoing liver transplantation show that impairment of hepatic function does not impact \nsignificantly on the pharmacokinetics of lamivudine unless accompanied by renal dysfunction.  \n \nIn elderly patients the pharmacokinetic profile of lamivudine suggests that normal ageing with \naccompanying renal decline has no clinically significant effect on lamivudine exposure, except in \npatients with creatinine clearance of < 50 ml/min (see section 4.2).  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdministration of lamivudine in animal toxicity studies at high doses was not associated with any \nmajor organ toxicity. At the highest dosage levels, minor effects on indicators of liver and kidney \nfunction were seen together with occasional reduction in liver weights. Reduction of erythrocytes and \nneutrophil counts were identified as the effects most likely to be of clinical relevance. These events \nwere seen infrequently in clinical studies.  \n \nLamivudine was not mutagenic in bacterial tests but, like many nucleoside analogues showed activity \nin an in vitro cytogenetic assay and the mouse lymphoma assay. Lamivudine was not genotoxic in \nvivo at doses that gave plasma concentrations around 60-70 times higher than the anticipated clinical \nplasma levels. As the in vitro mutagenic activity of lamivudine could not be confirmed by in vivo \ntests, it is concluded that lamivudine should not represent a genotoxic hazard to patients undergoing \ntreatment.  \n \nReproductive studies in animals have not shown evidence of teratogenicity and showed no effect on \nmale or female fertility. Lamivudine induces early embryolethality when administered to pregnant \nrabbits at exposure levels comparable to those achieved in man, but not in the rat even at very high \nsystemic exposures.  \n \nThe results of long term carcinogenicity studies with lamivudine in rats and mice did not shown any \ncarcinogenic potential.  \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nLamivudine Teva 100 mg film-coated tablets \nlamivudine \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any of the side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What Lamivudine Teva is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Lamivudine Teva \n3. How to take Lamivudine Teva \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Lamivudine Teva \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Lamivudine Teva is and what it is used for \n \nThe active ingredient in Lamivudine Teva is lamivudine. \n \nLamivudine Teva is used to treat long term (chronic) hepatitis B infection in adults. \n \nLamivudine Teva is an antiviral medicine that suppresses the hepatitis B virus and belongs to a group \nof medicines called nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). \n \nHepatitis B is a virus that infects the liver causes long term (chronic) infection, and can lead to liver \ndamage. Lamivudine Teva can be used in people whose liver is damaged but still functions normally \n(compensated liver disease). \n \nTreatment with Lamivudine Teva can reduce the amount of hepatitis B virus in your body. This should \nlead to a reduction in liver damage and an improvement in your liver function. Not everyone responds \nto treatment with Lamivudine Teva in the same way. Your doctor will monitor the effectiveness of \nyour treatment with regular blood tests. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Lamivudine Teva \n \nDo not take Lamivudine Teva \n \n• if you are allergic to lamivudine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in Section \n\n6). \n Check with your doctor if you think this applies to you. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n\n\n\n28 \n\nSome people taking Lamivudine Teva or other similar medicines are more at risk of serious side \neffects. You need to be aware of the extra risks: \n• if you have ever had other types of liver disease, such as hepatitis C. \n• if you are seriously overweight (especially if you are a woman). \n Talk to your doctor if any of these apply to you. You may need extra check-ups, including \n\nblood tests, while you are taking your medication. See Section 4 for more information about the \nrisks.  \n\n \nDo not stop taking Lamivudine Teva without your doctor’s advice, as there is a risk of your hepatitis \ngetting worse. When you stop taking Lamivudine Teva your doctor will monitor you for at least four \nmonths to check for any problems. This will mean taking blood samples to check for any raised liver \nenzyme levels, which may indicate liver damage. See section 3 for more information about how to take \nLamivudine Teva. \n\nLook out for important symptoms \nSome people taking medicines for hepatitis B infection develop other conditions, which can be \nserious. You need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you are taking \nLamivudine Teva. \n Read the information ‘Other possible side effects of therapy for Hepatitis B’ in Section 4 of this \n\nleaflet. \n\nProtect other people \nHepatitis B infection is spread by sexual contact with someone who has the infection, or by transfer of \ninfected blood (for example, by sharing injection needles). Lamivudine Teva will not stop you passing \nhepatitis B infection on to other people. To protect other people from becoming infected with hepatitis \nB: \n Use a condom when you have oral or penetrative sex. \n Do not risk blood transfer — for example, do not share needles. \n \nOther medicines and Lamivudine Teva \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including herbal medicines or other medicines you bought without a prescription.  \n\n \nRemember to tell your doctor or pharmacist if you begin taking a new medicine while you are taking \nLamivudine Teva. \n \nThese medicines should not be used with Lamivudine Teva: \n• medicines (usually liquids) containing sorbitol and other sugar alcohols (such as xylitol, \n\nmannitol, lactitol or maltitol), if taken regularly \n• other medicines containing lamivudine, used to treat HIV infection (sometimes called the AIDS \n\nvirus) \n• emtricitabine (used to treat HIV or hepatitis B infection) \n• cladribine, used to treat hairy cell leukaemia \n Tell your doctor if you are being treated with any of these. \n \nPregnancy  \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby: \n Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking Lamivudine Teva during your \n\npregnancy. \nDo not stop treatment with Lamivudine Teva without your doctor’s advice. \n \nBreast-feeding  \nLamivudine Teva can pass into breast-milk. If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-\nfeeding: \n\n\n\n29 \n\n Talk to your doctor before you take Lamivudine Teva. \n \nDriving and using machines \nLamivudine Teva may make you feel tired, which could affect your ability to drive or use machines.  \n Don’t drive or use machines unless you are sure you’re not affected. \n \nLamivudine Teva contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say \nessentially “sodium-free”. \n \n3. How to take Lamivudine Teva  \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you to. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure.  \n\nStay in regular contact with your doctor \nLamivudine Teva helps to control your hepatitis B infection. You need to keep taking it every day to \ncontrol your infection and stop your illness getting worse. \n Keep in touch with your doctor, and do not stop taking Lamivudine Teva without your \n\ndoctor’s advice. \n\nHow much to take \nThe usual dose of Lamivudine Teva is one tablet (100 mg lamivudine) once a day.  \n \nYour doctor may prescribe a lower dose if you have problems with your kidneys. An oral solution of \nLamivudine is available for people who need a lower than usual dose, or who can’t take tablets. \n \n Talk to your doctor if this applies to you. \n \nIf you are already taking another medicine that contains lamivudine for HIV infection, your doctor \nwill continue to treat you with the higher dose, (usually 150 mg twice a day), because the dose of \nlamivudine in Lamivudine Teva (100 mg) is not enough to treat HIV infection. If you are planning to \nchange your HIV treatment, discuss this change with your doctor first. \n \nSwallow the tablet whole, with some water. Lamivudine Teva can be taken with or without food. \n \nIf you take more Lamivudine Teva than you should \nAccidentally taking too much Lamivudine Teva is unlikely to cause any serious problems. If you \naccidentally take too much, tell your doctor or pharmacist, or contact your nearest hospital emergency \ndepartment for further advice. \n \nIf you forget to take Lamivudine Teva \nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then continue your treatment as before. \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. \n \nDo not stop taking Lamivudine Teva \nYou must not stop taking Lamivudine Teva without consulting your doctor. There is a risk of your \nhepatitis getting worse (see section 2). When you stop taking Lamivudine Teva your doctor will \nmonitor you for at least four months to check for any problems. This will mean taking blood samples \nto check for any raised liver enzyme levels, which may indicate liver damage. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, but not everyone gets them.  \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \nAs well as the side effects listed below for Lamivudine Teva, other conditions can develop during \ntherapy for hepatitis B.  \n It is important to read the information under ‘Other possible side effects of therapy for hepatitis \n\nB’. \n \nSide effects that were commonly reported in Lamivudine clinical trials were tiredness, respiratory \ntract infections, throat discomfort, headache, stomach discomfort and pain, nausea, vomiting and \ndiarrhoea, increases in liver enzymes and enzymes produced in the muscles (see below).  \n \nAllergic reaction  \nThese are rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). Signs include: \n• swelling of eyelids, face or lips \n• difficulty swallowing or breathing \n Contact a doctor immediately if you get these symptoms. Stop taking Lamivudine Teva. \n \nSide effects thought to be caused by Lamivudine Teva \n \nA very common side effect (these may affect more than 1 in 10 people) which may show up in \nblood tests is: \n• an increase in the level of some liver enzymes (transaminases), which may be a sign of \n\ninflammation or damage in the liver. \n \nA common side effect (these may affect up to 1 in 10 people) is: \n• cramps and muscle pains  \n• skin rash or ‘hives’ anywhere on the body. \n \nA common side effect which may show up in blood tests is: \n• an increase in the level of an enzyme produced in the muscles (creatine phosphokinase) which \n\nmay be a sign that body tissue is damaged. \n \nOther side effects  \nOther side effects have occurred in a very small number of people but their exact frequency is \nunknown \n• breakdown of muscle tissue \n• a worsening of liver disease after Lamivudine Teva is stopped or during treatment if the hepatitis \n\nB virus becomes resistant to Lamivudine Teva. This can be fatal in some people. \n• lactic acidosis (see the next section, ‘Other possible side effects of therapy for Hepatitis B’). \n\n \nA side effect which may show up in blood tests is: \n• a decrease in the number of cells involved in blood clotting (thrombocytopenia). \n\nIf you get any side effects \n Talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \n\nleaflet.  \n \nOther possible side effects of therapy for Hepatitis B \nLamivudine Teva and related medicines (NRTIs) may cause other conditions to develop during \nhepatitis B treatment. \n \nLactic acidosis is a rare but serious side effect \nSome people taking Lamivudine Teva, or other medicines like it (NRTIs), develop a condition called \nlactic acidosis, together with an enlarged liver.  \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nLactic acidosis is caused by a build-up of lactic acid in the body. It is rare; if it happens, it usually \ndevelops after a few months of treatment. It can be life-threatening, causing failure of internal organs. \n \nLactic acidosis is more likely to develop in people who have liver disease, or in obese (very \noverweight) people, especially women. \n \n\nSigns of lactic acidosis include: \n• deep, rapid, difficult breathing \n• drowsiness \n• numbness or weakness in the limbs \n• feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting)  \n• stomach pain. \n \nDuring your treatment, your doctor will monitor you for signs of lactic acidosis. If you have any of the \nsymptoms listed above, or any other symptoms that worry you: \n\n See your doctor as soon as possible. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety \nof this medicine.  \n \n5.
