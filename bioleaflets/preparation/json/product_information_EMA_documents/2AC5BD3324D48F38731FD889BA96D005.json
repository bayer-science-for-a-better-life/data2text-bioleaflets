NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \n \nNorvir 100 mg powder for oral suspension \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION  \n \nEach sachet of powder for oral suspension contains 100 mg of ritonavir. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n \nPowder for oral suspension. \n \nBeige/pale yellow to yellow powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRitonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 \ninfected patients (adults and children of 2 years of age and older). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nRitonavir should be administered by physicians who are experienced in the treatment of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \n \nRitonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer \n \nWhen ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer with other protease inhibitors the Summary of \nProduct Characteristics for the particular protease inhibitor must be consulted. \nThe following HIV-1 protease inhibitors have been approved for use with ritonavir as a \npharmacokinetic enhancer at the noted doses.   \n \nAdults \n\nAmprenavir 600 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. \nAtazanavir 300 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily. \nFosamprenavir 700 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. \nLopinavir co-formulated with ritonavir (lopinavir/ritonavir) 400 mg/100 mg or 800 mg/200 mg. \nSaquinavir 1000 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily in ART experienced patients. \nInitiate treatment with saquinavir 500 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily for the \nfirst 7 days, then saquinavir 1000 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily in ART-\nnaïve patients. \nTipranavir 500 mg twice daily with ritonavir 200 mg twice daily.  Tipranavir with ritonavir \nshould not be used in treatment-naïve patients. \n\n Darunavir 600 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily in antiretroviral treatment \n(ART) experienced patients.  Darunavir 800 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily \nmay be used in some ART experienced patients.  Refer to the darunavir Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for further information on once daily dosing in ART experienced patients. \n\n Darunavir 800 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily in ART-naïve patients. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nChildren and adolescents \nRitonavir is recommended for children 2 years of age and older.  For further dosage recommendations, \nrefer to the product information of other protease inhibitors approved for co-administration with \nritonavir. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nAs ritonavir is primarily metabolised by the liver, ritonavir may be appropriate for use with caution as \na pharmacokinetic enhancer in patients with renal insufficiency depending on the specific protease \ninhibitor with which it is co-administered.  However, since the renal clearance of ritonavir is \nnegligible, the decrease in the total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal impairment.  \nFor specific dosing information in patients with renal impairment, refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics (SPC) of the co-administered protease inhibitor.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nRitonavir should not be given as a pharmacokinetic enhancer to patients with decompensated liver \ndisease (see section 4.3).  In the absence of pharmacokinetic studies in patients with stable severe \nhepatic impairment (Child Pugh Grade C) without decompensation, caution should be exercised when \nritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer as increased levels of the co-administered PI may \noccur.  Specific recommendations for use of ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer in patients with \nhepatic impairment are dependent on the protease inhibitor with which it is co-administered.  The SPC \nof the co-administered PI should be reviewed for specific dosing information in this patient \npopulation.  \n \nRitonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent \n \nAdults \nThe recommended dose of Norvir powder for oral suspension is 600 mg (six sachets) twice daily by \nmouth and should be given with food.  \n \nGradually increasing the dose of ritonavir when initiating therapy may help to improve tolerance.  \nTreatment should be initiated at 300 mg (three sachets) twice daily for a period of three days and \nincreased by 100 mg (one sachet) twice daily increments up to 600 mg twice daily over a period of no \nlonger than 14 days.  Patients should not remain on 300 mg twice daily for more than 3 days. \n \nRefer to Method of Administration section below and section 6.6 for details on preparing doses. \n \nChildren and adolescents (2 years of age and above) \nThe recommended dosage of Norvir powder for suspension in children is 350 mg/m² by mouth twice \ndaily and should not exceed 600 mg twice daily.  Norvir should be started at 250 mg/m² and increased \nat 2 to 3 day intervals by 50 mg/m² twice daily.   \n\nPaediatric dosage guidelines for Norvir powder for oral suspension (prepared as \n100 mg/10 ml)*† \n\nBody Surface \nArea (m2) \n\nTwice Daily Dose \n250 mg/m2 \n\nTwice Daily Dose \n300 mg/m2 \n\nTwice Daily Dose \n350 mg/m2 \n\n0.25 6.4 ml (62.5 mg) 7.6 ml (76 mg) 8.8 ml (88 mg) \n0.50 12.6 ml (126 mg) 15.0 ml (150 mg) 17.6 ml (176 mg) \n0.75 18.8 ml (188 mg) 22.6 ml (226 mg) 26.4 ml (262.5 mg) \n1.00 25.0 ml (250 mg) 30.0 ml (300 mg) 35.0 ml (350 mg) \n1.25 31.4 ml (312.5 mg) 37.6 ml (376 mg) 43.8 ml (438mg) \n1.50 37.6 ml (376 mg) 45.0 ml (450 mg) 52.6 ml (526 mg) \n\n*When mixed with 9.4 ml of liquid the concentration of the suspension is 10 mg/ml.  \n \n†In some instances, the volumes and/or doses have been adjusted to ensure the recommended final dose and \ndosing volume.  \n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nBody surface area can be calculated with the following equation:  BSA (m2) = √(Height (cm) X Weight (kg) / \n3600) \n \nTo calculate the volume to be administered (in ml) for intermediate body surface areas not included in \nthe above table, the body surface area should be multiplied by a factor of: 25 for a dose of 250 mg/m²; \n30 for 300 mg/m²; and 35 for 350 mg/m².  \n \nRefer to Method of Administration section below and section 6.6 for details on preparing doses. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nPharmacokinetic data indicated that no dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section \n5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nCurrently, there are no data specific to this patient population and therefore specific dosage \nrecommendations cannot be made.  The renal clearance of ritonavir is negligible; therefore, a decrease \nin the total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal impairment.  Because ritonavir is \nhighly protein bound it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal \ndialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment \nRitonavir is principally metabolised and eliminated by the liver.  Pharmacokinetic data indicate that no \ndose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).  \nRitonavir must not be given to patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).   \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Norvir in children aged below 2 years has not been established.  Currently \navailable data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be \nmade. \n \nMethod of administration \nNorvir powder for oral suspension is administered orally, poured on soft food (apple sauce or vanilla \npudding) or mixed with liquid (water, chocolate milk, or infant formula).  For details on preparation \nand administration of the Norvir powder for oral suspension, see section 6.6.  Any mixing outside the \nrecommendations is the responsibility of the health care professional or the user.  \n \nNorvir powder for oral suspension should be taken with food.  The bitter aftertaste of Norvir powder \nfor oral suspension may be lessened if peanut butter, hazelnut chocolate spread, or black currant syrup \nare taken immediately after dose administration. \n \nThe prescribed dose of Norvir powder for oral suspension can be administered via a feeding tube after \nbeing mixed with water as detailed in section 6.6.  Follow the instructions for the feeding tube to \nadminister the medicine. \n \n4.3  Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.   \n \nWhen ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of other PIs, consult the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics of the co-administered protease inhibitor for contraindications. \n \nRitonavir should not be given as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent to patients \nwith decompensated liver disease. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nIn vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A- and \nCYP2D6- mediated biotransformations.  The following medicines are contraindicated when used with \nritonavir and unless otherwise noted, the contraindication is based on the potential for ritonavir to \ninhibit metabolism of the co-administered medicinal product, resulting in increased exposure to the \nco-administered medicinal product and risk of clinically significant adverse effects. \n \nThe enzyme-modulating effect of ritonavir may be dose dependent.  For some products, \ncontraindications may be more relevant when ritonavir is used as an antiretroviral agent than when \nritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer (e.g. rifabutin and voriconazole): \n \n\nMedicinal Product \nClass \n\nMedicinal Products \nwithin Class \n\nRationale \n\nConcomitant medicinal product levels increased or decreased \n\nα1-Adrenoreceptor \nAntagonist \n\nAlfuzosin Increased plasma concentrations of alfuzosin \nwhich may lead to severe hypotension (see \nsection 4.5). \n\nAnalgesics Pethidine, piroxicam, \npropoxyphne \n\nIncreased plasma concentrations of \nnorpethidine, piroxicam and propoxyphene.  \nThereby, increasing the risk of serious \nrespiratory depression or haematologic \nabnormalities, or other serious adverse effects \nfrom these agents. \n\nAntianginal Ranolazine Increased plasma concentrations of ranolazine \nwhich may increase the potential for serious \nand/or life-threatening reactions (see section \n4.5). \n\nAnticancer Neratinib Increased plasma concentrations of neratinib \nwhich may increase the potential for serious \nand/or life-threatening reactions including \nhepatotoxicity (see section 4.5). \n\nVenetoclax Increased plasma concentrations of venetoclax. \nIncreased risk of tumor lysis syndrome at the \ndose initiation and during the dose-titration \nphase (see section 4.5). \n\nAntiarrhythmics Amiodarone, bepridil, \ndronedarone, \nencainide, flecanide, \npropafenone, quinidine \n \n\nIncreased plasma concentrations of amiodarone, \nbepridil, dronedarone, encainide, flecanide, \npropafenone, quinidine.  Thereby, increasing \nthe risk of arrhythmias or other serious adverse \nreactions from these agents. \n\nAntibiotic Fusidic Acid Increased plasma concentrations of fusidic acid \nand ritonavir. \n\nAntifungal Voriconazole Concomitant use of ritonavir (400 mg twice \ndaily and more) and voriconazole is \ncontraindicated due to a reduction in \nvoriconazole plasma concentrations and \npossible loss of effect (see section 4.5). \n\nAnti-gout Colchicine Potential for serious and/or life-threatening \nreactions in patients with renal and/or hepatic \nimpairment (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\nAntihistamines Astemizole, \nterfenadine \n\nIncreased plasma concentrations of astemizole \nand terfenadine.  Thereby, increasing the risk of \nserious arrhythmias from these agents. \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nAntimycobacterial Rifabutin Concomitant use of ritonavir (500 mg twice \ndaily) dosed as an antiretroviral agent and \nrifabutin due to an increase of rifabutin serum \nconcentrations and risk of adverse events \nincluding uveitis (see section 4.4).  \nRecommendations regarding use of ritonavir \ndosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer with \nrifabutin are noted in section 4.5.   \n\nAntipsychotics/ \nNeuroleptics \n\nLurasidone Increased plasma concentrations of lurasidone \nwhich may increase the potential for serious \nand/or life-threatening reactions (see section \n4.5). \n\nClozapine, pimozide Increased plasma concentrations of clozapine \nand pimozide.  Thereby, increasing the risk of \nserious haematologic abnormalities, or other \nserious adverse effects from these agents. \n\n Quetiapine Increased plasma concentrations of quetiapine \nwhich may lead to coma.  The concomitant \nadministration with quetiapine is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\nErgot Derivatives Dihydroergotamine, \nergonovine, \nergotamine, \nmethylergonovine \n\nIncreased plasma concentrations of ergot \nderivatives leading to acute ergot toxicity, \nincluding vasospasm and ischaemia. \n\nGI motility agent Cisapride Increased plasma concentrations of cisapride.  \nThereby, increasing the risk of serious \narrhythmias from this agent. \n\nLipid-modifying agents \n \nHMG Co-A Reductase \nInhibitors \n\nLovastatin, simvastatin Increased plasma concentrations of lovastatin \nand simvastatin; thereby, increasing the risk of \nmyopathy including rhabdomyolysis (see \nsection 4.5). \n \n\nMicrosomal \ntriglyceride transfer \nprotein (MTTP) \ninhibitor \n\nLomitapide Increased plasma concentrations of lomitapide \n(see section 4.5). \n\nPDE5 inhibitors Avanafil Increased plasma concentrations of avanafil \n(see section 4.4. and 4.5). \n\n Sildenafil  Contraindicated when used for the treatment of \npulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) only.  \nIncreased plasma concentrations of sildenafil.  \nThereby, increasing the potential for sildenafil-\nassociated adverse events (which include \nhypotension and syncope).  See section 4.4 and \nsection 4.5 for co-administration of sildenafil in \npatients with erectile dysfunction. \n\n Vardenafil Increased plasma concentrations of vardenafil \n(see section 4.4. and 4.5). \n\nSedatives/hypnotics Clorazepate, diazepam, \nestazolam, flurazepam, \noral midazolam and \ntriazolam \n\nIncreased plasma concentrations of clorazepate, \ndiazepam, estazolam, flurazepam, oral \nmidazolam and triazolam.  Thereby, increasing \nthe risk of extreme sedation and respiratory \ndepression from these agents.  (For caution on \nparenterally administered midazolam, see \nsection 4.5). \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\n \n\nRitonavir medicinal product level decreased \n\nHerbal Preparation St. John’s wort Herbal preparations containing St John’s wort \n(Hypericum perforatum) due to the risk of \ndecreased plasma concentrations and reduced \nclinical effects of ritonavir (see section 4.5). \n\n \n4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nRitonavir is not a cure for HIV-1 infection or AIDS.  Patients receiving ritonavir or any other \nantiretroviral therapy may continue to develop opportunistic infections and other complications of \nHIV-1 infection.  \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent transmission \nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nWhen ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer with other PIs, full details on the warnings and \nprecautions relevant to that particular PI should be considered, therefore the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for the particular PI must be consulted. \n \nRitonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer   \n \nPatients with chronic diarrhoea or malabsorption \nExtra monitoring is recommended when diarrhoea occurs.  The relatively high frequency of diarrhoea \nduring treatment with ritonavir may compromise the absorption and efficacy (due to decreased \ncompliance) of ritonavir or other concurrent medicinal products.  Serious persistent vomiting and/or \ndiarrhoea associated with ritonavir use might also compromise renal function.  It is advisable to \nmonitor renal function in patients with renal function impairment. \n \nHaemophilia \nThere have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and \nhaemarthroses, in haemophiliac patients type A and B treated with protease inhibitors.  In some \npatients additional factor VIII was given.  In more than a half of the reported cases, treatment with \nprotease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued.  A causal \nrelationship has been evoked, although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated.  \nHaemophiliac patients should, therefore, be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters:  \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose, reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nPancreatitis \nPancreatitis should be considered if clinical symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) or \nabnormalities in laboratory values (such as increased serum lipase or amylase values) suggestive of \npancreatitis should occur.  Patients who exhibit these signs or symptoms should be evaluated and \nNorvir therapy should be discontinued if a diagnosis of pancreatitis is made (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nImmune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymtomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, \nand Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.  Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and \ntreatment instituted when necessary. \n \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \ncan occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nLiver disease \nRitonavir should not be given to patients with decompensated liver disease (see section 4.2).  Patients \nwith chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased \nrisk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions.  In case of concomitant antiviral therapy \nfor hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant product information for these medicinal products. \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be \nmonitored according to standard practice.  If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n \nRenal disease \nSince the renal clearance of ritonavir is negligible, the decrease in the total body clearance is not \nexpected in patients with renal impairment (see also section 4.2). \n \nRenal failure, renal impairment, elevated creatinine, hypophosphataemia and proximal tubulopathy \n(including Fanconi syndrome) have been reported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) \nin clinical practice (see section 4.8). \n \nMedication error \nSpecial attention should be given to the accurate calculation of the dose of Norvir, transcription of the \nmedication order, dispensing information and dosing instructions to minimise the risk for medication \nerrors and underdose.  This is especially important for infants and young children. \n \nOsteonecrosis \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART).  Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nPR interval prolongation \nRitonavir has been shown to cause modest asymptomatic prolongation of the PR interval in some \nhealthy adult subjects.  Rare reports of 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular block in patients with \nunderlying structural heart disease and pre-existing conduction system abnormalities or in patients \nreceiving medicinal products known to prolong the PR interval (such as verapamil or atazanavir) have \nbeen reported in patients receiving ritonavir.  Norvir should be used with caution in such patients (see \nsection 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nInteractions with other medicinal products \n \nRitonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent \n \nThe following warnings and precautions should be considered when ritonavir is used as an \nantiretroviral agent.  When ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer at the 100 mg and 200 mg \nlevel it cannot be assumed that the following warnings and precautions will also apply.  When \nritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, full details on the warnings and precautions relevant \nto that particular PI must be considered, therefore the Summary of Product Characteristics, section 4.4, \nfor the particular PI must be consulted to determine if the information below is applicable. \n \nPDE5 inhibitors \nParticular caution should be used when prescribing sildenafil or tadalafil for the treatment of erectile \ndysfunction in patients receiving ritonavir.  Co-administration of ritonavir with these medicinal \nproducts is expected to substantially increase their concentrations and may result in associated adverse \nreactions such as hypotension and prolonged erection (see section 4.5).  Concomitant use of avanafil \nor vardenafil with ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  Concomitant use of sildenafil with \nritonavir is contraindicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients (see section 4.3). \n \nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors \nThe HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin and lovastatin are highly dependent on CYP3A for \nmetabolism, thus concomitant use of ritonavir with simvastatin or lovastatin is not recommended due \nto an increased risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis.  Caution must also be exercised and \nreduced doses should be considered if ritonavir is used concurrently with atorvastatin, which is \nmetabolised to a lesser extent by CYP3A.  While rosuvastatin elimination is not dependent on \nCYP3A, an elevation of rosuvastatin exposure has been reported with ritonavir co-administration.  The \nmechanism of this interaction is not clear, but may be the result of transporter inhibition.  When used \nwith ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent, the lowest doses of \natorvastatin or rosuvastatin should be administered.  The metabolism of pravastatin and fluvastatin is \nnot dependent of CYP3A, and interactions are not expected with ritonavir.  If treatment with an HMG-\nCoA reductase inhibitor is indicated, pravastatin or fluvastatin is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nColchicine \nLife-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with colchicine and \nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A like ritonavir (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nDigoxin \nParticular caution should be used when prescribing ritonavir in patients taking digoxin since \nco-administration of ritonavir with digoxin is expected to increase digoxin levels.  The increased \ndigoxin levels may lessen over time (see section 4.5). \n \nIn patients who are already taking digoxin when ritonavir is introduced, the digoxin dose should be \nreduced to one-half of the patients’ normal dose and patient need to be followed more closely than \nusual for several weeks after initiating co-administration of ritonavir and digoxin. \n \nIn patients who are already taking ritonavir when digoxin is introduced, digoxin should be introduced \nmore gradually than usual.  Digoxin levels should be monitored more intensively than usual during \nthis period, with dose adjustments made, as necessary, based on clinical, electrocardiographic and \ndigoxin level findings.  \n \nEthinyl estradiol \nBarrier or other non-hormonal methods of contraception should be considered when administering \nritonavir at therapeutic or low doses as ritonavir is likely to reduce the effect and change the uterine \nbleeding profile when co-administered with estradiol-containing contraceptives. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nGlucocorticoids \nConcomitant use of ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4 \nis not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic \ncorticosteroid effects, including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section 4.5). \n \nTrazodone \nParticular caution should be used when prescribing ritonavir in patients using trazodone.  Trazodone is \na CYP3A4 substrate and co-administration of ritonavir is expected to increase trazodone levels.  \nAdverse reactions of nausea, dizziness, hypotension and syncope have been observed in single dose \ninteraction studies in healthy volunteers (see section 4.5) \n \nRivaroxaban \nIt is not recommended to use ritonavir in patients receiving rivaroxaban, due to the risk of increased \nbleeding (see section 4.5). \n \nRiociguat \nThe concomitant use of ritonavir is not recommended due to potential increase in riociguat exposure \n(see section 4.5). \n \nVorapaxar \nThe concomitant use of ritonavir is not recommended due to potential increase in vorapaxar exposure \n(see section 4.5). \n \nBedaquiline \nStrong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as protease inhibitors may increase bedaquiline exposure which could \npotentially increase the risk of bedaquiline-related adverse reactions.  Therefore, combination of \nbedaquiline with ritonavir should be avoided.  However, if the benefit outweighs the risk, co-\nadministration of bedaquiline with ritonavir must be done with caution.  More frequent \nelectrocardiogram monitoring and monitoring of transaminases is recommended (see section 4.5 and \nrefer to the bedaquiline Summary of Product Characteristics). \n \nDelamanid  \nCo-administration of delamanid with a strong inhibitor of CYP3A (ritonavir) may increase exposure to \ndelamanid metabolite, which has been associated with QTc prolongation.  Therefore, if \nco-administration of delamanid with ritonavir is considered necessary, very frequent ECG monitoring \nthroughout the full delamanid treatment period is recommended (see section 4.5 and refer to the \ndelamanid Summary of Product Characteristics).  \n \nRitonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer \nThe interaction profiles of HIV-protease inhibitors, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, are \ndependent on the specific co-administered protease inhibitor.  \n \nFor a description of the mechanisms and potential mechanisms contributing to the interaction profile \nof the PIs, see section 4.5.  Please also review the Summary of Product Characteristics for the \nparticular boosted PI. \n \nSaquinavir \nDoses of ritonavir higher than 100 mg twice daily should not be used.  Higher doses of ritonavir have \nbeen shown to be associated with an increased incidence of adverse reactions.  Co-administration of \nsaquinavir and ritonavir has led to severe adverse reactions, mainly diabetic ketoacidosis and liver \ndisorders, especially in patients with pre-existing liver disease.   \n \nSaquinavir/ritonavir should not be given together with rifampicin, due to the risk of severe \nhepatotoxicity (presenting as increased hepatic transaminases) if the three medicines are given \ntogether (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nTipranavir \nCo-administration of tipranavir with 200 mg of ritonavir has been associated with reports of clinical \nhepatitis and hepatic decompensation including some fatalities.  Extra vigilance is warranted in \npatients with chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C co-infection, as these patients have an increased risk of \nhepatotoxicity.  \n \nDoses of ritonavir lower than 200 mg twice daily should not be used as they might alter the efficacy \nprofile of the combination. \n  \nFosamprenavir \nCo-administration of fosamprenavir with ritonavir in doses greater than 100 mg twice daily has not \nbeen clinically evaluated.  The use of higher ritonavir doses might alter the safety profile of the \ncombination and therefore is not recommended. \n \nAtazanavir \nCo-administration of atazanavir with ritonavir at doses greater than 100 mg once daily has not been \nclinically evaluated.  The use of higher ritonavir doses may alter the safety profile of atazanavir \n(cardiac effects, hyperbilirubinemia) and therefore is not recommended.  Only when atazanavir with \nritonavir is co-administered with efavirenz, a dose increase of ritonavir to 200mg once daily could be \nconsidered.  In this instance, close clinical monitoring is warranted.  Refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for atazanavir for further details. \n \n4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nRitonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent \n \nRitonavir has a high affinity for several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms and may inhibit oxidation \nwith the following ranked order: CYP3A4 > CYP2D6.  Co-administration of ritonavir and medicinal \nproducts primarily metabolised by CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other \nmedicinal product, which could increase or prolong its therapeutic and adverse effects.  For selected \nmedicinal products (e.g. alprazolam) the inhibitory effects of ritonavir on CYP3A4 may decrease over \ntime.  Ritonavir also has a high affinity for P-glycoprotein and may inhibit this transporter.  The \ninhibitory effect of ritonavir (with or without other protease inhibitors) on P-gp activity may decrease \nover time (e.g. digoxin and fexofenadine-see table “Ritonavir effects on non-antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts” below).  Ritonavir may induce glucuronidation and oxidation by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, \nCYP2C9 and CYP2C19 thereby increasing the biotransformation of some medicinal products \nmetabolised by these pathways, and may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal \nproducts, which could decease or shorten their therapeutic effect.   \n \nImportant information regarding medicinal product interactions when ritonavir is used as a \npharmacokinetic enhancer is also contained in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the \nco-administered protease inhibitor. \n \nMedicinal products that affect ritonavir levels \n \nSerum levels of ritonavir can be reduced by concomitant use of herbal preparations containing \nSt John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum).  This is due to the induction of medicinal product \nmetabolising enzymes by St John’s wort.  Herbal preparations containing St John’s wort must not be \nused in combination with ritonavir.  If a patient is already taking St John’s wort, St John’s wort should \nbe stopped and if possible check viral levels.  Ritonavir levels may increase on stopping St John’s \nwort.  The dose of ritonavir may need adjusting.  The inducing effect may persist for at least 2 weeks \nafter cessation of treatment with St John’s wort (see section 4.3).   \n \nSerum levels of ritonavir may be affected by select co-administered medicinal products (e.g. \ndelavirdine, efavirenz, phenytoin and rifampicin).  These interactions are noted in the medicinal \nproduct interaction tables below. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nMedicinal product that are affected by the use of ritonavir \n \nInteractions between ritonavir and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease \ninhibitors and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in the tables below.  This list is not \nintended to be inclusive or comprehensive.  Individual SmPCs should be consulted. \n \n\nMedicinal Product Interactions – Ritonavir with Protease Inhibitors \nCo-\n\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProduct \n\nDose of Co-administered \nMedicinal Product (mg) \n\nDose of NORVIR \n(mg) \n\nMedicinal \nProduct \nAssessed \n\nAUC Cmin \n\nAmprenavir 600 q12h 100 q12h Amprenavir1 ↑ 64% ↑ 5 fold \n Ritonavir increases the serum levels of amprenavir as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition.

Fosamprenavir must be given with ritonavir to ensure its therapeutic effect.  Clinical \ntrials confirmed the safety and efficacy of fosamprenavir 700 mg twice daily with ritonavir \n100 mg twice daily.  Ritonavir doses higher than 100 mg twice daily have not been studied with \nfosamprenavir.  For further information, physicians should refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for fosamprenavir. \n\nIndinavir 800 q12h 100 q12h Indinavir3 ↑ 178% ND \n   Ritonavir ↑ 72% ND \n 400 q12h 400 q12h Indinavir3 ↔ ↑ 4 fold  \n   Ritonavir ↔ ↔ \n Ritonavir increases the serum levels of indinavir as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition.  Appropriate \n\ndoses for this combination, with respect to efficacy and safety, have not been established.  \nMinimal benefit of ritonavir-mediated pharmacokinetic enhancement is achieved with doses \nhigher than 100 mg twice daily.  In cases of co-administration of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) \nand indinavir (800 mg twice daily) caution is warranted as the risk of nephrolithiasis may be \nincreased.   \n\nNelfinavir 1250 q12h  100 q12h Nelfinavir ↑ 20to39% ND \n 750, single 500 q12h Nelfinavir ↑ 152% ND \n   Ritonavir ↔ ↔ \n Ritonavir increases the serum levels of nelfinavir as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition.

Refer to the colchicine prescribing information. \n\nAntihistamines \n \n\nAstemizole, terfenadine Ritonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma \nconcentrations of astemizole and terfenadine and is therefore \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \n\nFexofenadine Ritonavir may modify P-glycoprotein mediated fexofenadine efflux \nwhen dosed as an antriretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic \nenhancer resulting in increased concentrations of fexofenadine.  \nIncreased fexofenadine levels may lessen over time as induction \ndevelops. \n \n\nLoratadine Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral \nagent inhibits CYP3A and as a result is expected to increase the \nplasma concentrations of loratadine.  Careful monitoring of \ntherapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when loratidine is \nconcomitantly administered with ritonavir. \n \n\nAnti-infectives \n \n\nFusidic Acid Ritonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma \nconcentrations of both fusidic acid and ritonavir and is therefore \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \n\nRifabutin1 \n \n25-O-desacetyl rifabutin metabolite  \n\n150 daily  500 q12h,  ↑ 4-fold  \n \n↑ 38-fold  \n\n↑ 2.5-fold  \n \n↑ 16-fold \n\n Due to the large increase in rifabutin AUC, the concomitant use of \nrifabutin with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3).  The reduction of the rifabutin \ndose to 150 mg 3 times per week may be indicated for select PIs \nwhen co-administered with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer.  \nThe Summary of Product Characteristics of the co-administered \nprotease inhibitor should be consulted for specific recommendations.  \nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate \ntreatment of tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients.   \n \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nRitonavir effects on Non-antiretroviral Co-administered Medicinal Products \n\nCo-administered Medicinal Products Dose of Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts (mg) \n\nDose of \nNORVIR \n(mg) \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts AUC  \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts Cmax  \n\nRifampicin Although rifampicin may induce metabolism of ritonavir, limited data \nindicate that when high doses of ritonavir (600 mg twice daily) is \nco-administered with rifampicin, the additional inducing effect of \nrifampicin (next to that of ritonavir itself) is small and may have no \nclinical relevant effect on ritonavir levels in high-dose ritonavir \ntherapy.

Co-administration of voriconazole \nand ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer should be avoided, \nunless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use \nof voriconazole. \n \n\nAtovaquone Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral \nagent induces glucuronidation and as a result is expected to decrease \nthe plasma concentrations of atovaquone.  Careful monitoring of \nserum levels or therapeutic effects is recommended when atovaquone \nis concomitantly administered with ritonavir. \n \n\nBedaquiline  \n \n\nNo interaction study is available with ritonavir only.  In an interaction \nstudy of single-dose bedaquiline and multiple dose \nlopinavir/ritonavir, the AUC of bedaquiline was increased by 22%.  \nThis increase is likely due to ritonavir and a more pronounced effect \nmay be observed during prolonged co-administration.  Due to the risk \nof bedaquiline related adverse events, co-administration should be \navoided.  If the benefit outweighs the risk, co-administration of \nbedaquiline with ritonavir must be done with caution.  More frequent \nelectrocardiogram monitoring and monitoring of transaminases is \nrecommended (see section 4.4 and refer to the bedaquiline Summary \nof Product Characteristics). \n \n\nClarithromycin \n \n14-OH clarithromycin metabolite  \n\n500 q12h  200 q8h ↑ 77%  \n \n↓ 100%  \n\n↑ 31%  \n \n↓ 99%  \n\n Due to the large therapeutic window of clarithromycin no dose \nreduction should be necessary in patients with normal renal function.  \nClarithromycin doses greater than 1 g per day should not be \nco-administered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a \npharmacokinetic enhancer.  For patients with renal impairment, a \nclarithromycin dose reduction should be considered: for patients with \ncreatinine clearance of 30 to 60 ml/min the dose should be reduced by \n50%, for patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min the \ndose should be reduced by 75%. \n \n\nDelamanid No interaction study is available with ritonavir only.  In a healthy \nvolunteer drug interaction study of delamanid 100 mg twice daily and \nlopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily for 14 days, the exposure \nof the delamanid metabolite DM-6705 was 30% increased.  Due to \nthe risk of QTc prolongation associated with DM-6705, if \nco-administration of delamanid with ritonavir is considered \nnecessary, very frequent ECG monitoring throughout the full \ndelamanid treatment period is recommended (see section 4.4 and \nrefer to the delamanid Summary of Product Characteristics). \n \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\nRitonavir effects on Non-antiretroviral Co-administered Medicinal Products \n\nCo-administered Medicinal Products Dose of Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts (mg) \n\nDose of \nNORVIR \n(mg) \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts AUC  \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts Cmax  \n\nErythromycin, itraconazole Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral \nagent inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to increase the \nplasma concentrations of erythromycin and itraconazole.

Since increased concentrations of \nlovastatin and simvastatin  may predispose patients to myopathies, \nincluding rhabdomyolysis, the combination of these medicinal \nproducts with ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  \nAtorvastatin is less dependent on CYP3A for metabolism.  While \nrosuvastatin elimination is not dependent on CYP3A, an elevation of \nrosuvastatin exposure has been reported with ritonavir co-\nadministration.  The mechanism of this interaction is not clear, but \nmay be the result of transporter inhibition.  When used with ritonavir \ndosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent, the \nlowest possible doses of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin should be \nadministered.  The metabolism of pravastatin and fluvastatin is not \ndependent on CYP3A, and interactions are not expected with \nritonavir.  If treatment with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is \nindicated, pravastatin or fluvastatin is recommended. \n \n\nHormonal contraceptive \n \n\nEthinyl estradiol 50 µg, single \ndose  \n\n500 q12h ↓ 40%  ↓ 32%  \n\n Due to reductions in ethinyl estradiol concentrations, barrier or other \nnon-hormonal methods of contraception should be considered with \nconcomitant ritonavir use when dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as \na pharmacokinetic enhancer.

No medicinal product \ninteraction study has been performed for the co-administration of \nNorvir with benzodiazepines.  Based on data for other CYP3A4 \ninhibitors, plasma concentrations of midazolam are expected to be \nsignificantly higher when midazolam is given orally.  Therefore, \nNorvir should not be co-administered with orally administered \nmidazolam (see section 4.3), whereas caution should be used with \nco-administration of Norvir and parenteral midazolam.  Data from \nconcomitant use of parenteral midazolam with other protease \ninhibitors suggest a possible 3 – 4 fold increase in midazolam plasma \nlevels.  If Norvir is co-administered with parenteral midazolam, it \nshould be done in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar setting \nwhich ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical \nmanagement in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged \nsedation.

Careful monitoring of \ntherapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when buspirone \nconcomitantly administered with ritonavir. \n \n\nSleeping agent  \n\nZolpidem 5  200, 4 doses ↑ 28% ↑ 22% \n Zolpidem and ritonavir may be co-administered with careful \n\nmonitoring for excessive sedative effects. \n \n\nSmoke cessation  \n\nBupropion 150  100 q12h ↓ 22% ↓ 21% \n 150  600 q12h ↓ 66% ↓ 62% \n Bupropion is primarily metabolised by CYP2B6.  Concurrent \n\nadministration of bupropion with repeated doses of ritonavir is \nexpected to decrease bupropion levels.  These effects are thought to \nrepresent induction of bupropion metabolism.  However, because \nritonavir has also been shown to inhibit CYP2B6 in vitro, the \nrecommended dose of bupropion should not be exceeded.  In contrast \nto long-term administration of ritonavir, there was no significant \ninteraction with bupropion after short-term administration of low \ndoses of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 2 days), suggesting \nreductions in bupropion concentrations may have onset several days \nafter initiation of ritonavir co-administration. \n \n\nSteroids  \n\nInhaled, injectable or intranasal fluticasone \npropionate, budesonide, triamcinolone \n\nSystemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and \nadrenal suppression (plasma cortisol levels were noted to be \ndecreased 86% in the above study) have been reported in patients \nreceiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasal fluticasone propionate; \nsimilar effects could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolised \nby CYP3A e.g., budesonide and triamcinolone.  Consequently, \nconcomitant administration of ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral \nagent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer and these glucocorticoids is \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\nRitonavir effects on Non-antiretroviral Co-administered Medicinal Products \n\nCo-administered Medicinal Products Dose of Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts (mg) \n\nDose of \nNORVIR \n(mg) \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts AUC  \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts Cmax  \n\nnot recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs \nthe risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).  A dose \nreduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close \nmonitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a \nglucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g., \nbeclomethasone).  Moreover, in case of withdrawal of glucocorticoids \nprogressive dose reduction may be required over a longer period.    \n  \n\nDexamethasone Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral \nagent inhibits CYP3A and as a result is expected to increase the \nplasma concentrations of dexamethasone.  Careful monitoring of \ntherapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when dexamethasone \nis concomitantly administered with ritonavir.   \n \n\nPrednisolone 20 200 q12h ↑ 28% ↑ 9% \n Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is \n\nrecommended when prednisolone is concomitantly administered with \nritonavir.  The AUC of the metabolite prednisolone increased by 37 \nand 28% after 4 and 14 days ritonavir, respectively. \n \n\nThyroid hormone replacement \ntherapy \n\n \n\nLevothyroxine Post-marketing cases have been reported indicating a potential \ninteraction between ritonavir containing products and levothyroxine.  \nThyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) should be monitored in patients \ntreated with levothyroxine at least the first month after starting and/or \nending ritonavir treatment. \n\n ND: Not determined \n1. Based on a parallel group comparison \n2. Sulfamethoxazole was co-administered with trimethoprim.  \n\n \nCardiac and neurologic events have been reported when ritonavir has been co-administered with \ndisopyramide, mexiletine or nefazodone.  The possibility of medicinal product interaction cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nIn addition to the interactions listed above, as ritonavir is highly protein bound, the possibility of \nincreased therapeutic and toxic effects due to protein binding displacement of concomitant medicinal \nproducts should be considered. \n \nRitonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer \n \nImportant information regarding medicinal product interactions when ritonavir is used a \npharmacokinetic enhancer is also contained in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the co-\nadministered protease inhibitor.  \n \nProton pump inhibitors and H2-receptor antagonists \nProton pump inhibitors and H2-receptor antagonists (e.g. omeprazole or ranitidine) may reduce \nconcentrations for co-administered protease inhibitors.  For specific information regarding the impact \nof co-administration of acid reducing agents, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the \nco-administered protease inhibitor.  Based on interaction studies with the ritonavir boosted protease \ninhibitors (lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir), concurrent administration of omeprazole or ranitidine does \nnot significantly modify ritonavir efficacy as a pharmacokinetic enhancer despite a slight change of \nexposure (about 6 - 18%). \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nA large amount (6100 live births) of pregnant women were exposed to ritonavir during pregnancy; of \nthese, 2800 live births were exposed during the first trimester.  These data largely refer to exposures \nwhere ritonavir was used in combination therapy and not at therapeutic ritonavir doses but at lower \ndoses as a pharmacokinetic enhancer for other PIs.  These data indicate no increase in the rate of birth \ndefects compared to rates observed in population-based birth defect surveillance systems.  Animal data \nhave shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  Norvir can be used during pregnancy if clinically \nneeded. \n \nRitonavir adversely interacts with oral contraceptives (OCs).  Therefore, an alternative, effective and \nsafe method of contraception should be used during treatment. \n \nBreastfeeding \nLimited published data reports that ritonavir is present in human milk. \n \nThere is no information on the effects of ritonavir on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on \nmilk production.  Because of the potential for (1) HIV transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) \ndeveloping viral resistance (in HIV-postive infants) and (3) serious adverse reactions in a breastfed \ninfant,  HIV infected women should not breast feed their infants under any circumstances if they are \nreceiving Norvir. \n \nFertility  \nNo human data on the effect of ritonavir on fertility are available.  Animal studies do not indicate \nharmful effects of ritonavir on fertility (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.   Dizziness is a \nknown undesirable effect that should be taken into account when driving or using machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nRitonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer \n \nAdverse reactions associated with the use of ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer are dependent on \nthe specific co-administered PI.  For information on adverse reactions refer to the SPC of the specific \nco-administered PI. \n \nRitonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trials and post-marketing experience in adult patients \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse drug reactions among patients receiving ritonavir alone or in \ncombination with other antiretroviral drugs were gastrointestinal (including diarrhoea, nausea, \nvomiting, abdominal pain (upper and lower)), neurological disturbances (including paraesthesia and \noral paraesthesia) and fatigue/asthenia. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity with possible or probable relationship \nto ritonavir have been reported.  Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in \norder of decreasing seriousness: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\n(≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \nEvents noted as having a frequency not known were identified via post-marketing surveillance \n \n\nAdverse reactions in clinical studies and post-marketing in adult patients \n\nSystem Order Class Frequency Adverse reaction \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nCommon \n \n\nDecreased white blood cells, decreased \nhaemoglobin, decreased neutrophils, \nincreased eosinophils, thrombocytopenia \n \n\nUncommon Increased neutrophils  \n \n\nImmune system disorders Common Hypersensitivity, including urticaria and \nface oedema. \n \n\n Rare Anaphylaxis \n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nCommon Hypercholesterolaemia, \nhypertriglyceridaemia, gout, oedema and \nperipheral oedema, dehydration (usually \nassociated with gastrointestinal symptoms) \n\n Uncommon Diabetes mellitus \n \n\n Rare Hyperglycaemia \nNervous system disorders Very common \n\n \nDysgeusia, oral and peripheral paraesthesia, \nheadache, dizziness, peripheral neuropathy \n \n\nCommon Insomnia, anxiety, confusion, disturbance in \nattention, syncope, seizure \n\nEye disorders Common Blurred vision \n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon Myocardial infarction \n\nVascular disorders Common Hypertension, hypotension including \northostatic hypotension, peripheral coldness \n\n   \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n \n\nVery common Pharyngitis, oropharyngeal pain, cough  \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common \n \n\nAbdominal pain (upper and lower), nausea, \ndiarrhoea (including severe with electrolyte \nimbalance), vomiting, dyspepsia \n \n\nCommon Anorexia, flatulence, mouth ulcer, \ngastrointestinal haemorrhage, \ngastroesophageal reflux disease, pancreatitis \n \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Common Hepatitis (including increased AST, ALT, \nGGT), blood bilirubin increased (including \njaundice) \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n \n\nVery common Pruritus, rash (including erythematous and \nmaculopapular) \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\nAdverse reactions in clinical studies and post-marketing in adult patients \n\nSystem Order Class Frequency Adverse reaction \n\n Common \n \n\nAcne \n\n Rare Stevens Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis (TEN) \n\nMusculosketal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nVery common \n \n\nArthralgia and back pain \n \n\nCommon Myositis, rhabdomyolysis, myalgia, \nmyopathy/CPK increased \n \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Common Increased urination, renal impairment (e.g. \noliguria, elevated creatinine) \n \n\n Uncommon \n \n\nNot known \n\nAcute renal failure \n \nNephrolithiasis \n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders \n\nCommon Menorrhagia \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nVery common \n \n\nFatigue including asthenia, flushing, feeling \nhot \n \n\nCommon Fever, weight loss \n \n\nInvestigations Common \n \n\nIncreased amylase, decreased free and total \nthyroxine  \n \n\nUncommon Increased glucose, increased magnesium, \nincreased alkaline phosphatase \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nHepatic transaminase elevations exceeding five times the upper limit or normal, clinical hepatitis, and \njaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir alone or in combination with other \nantiretrovirals. \n \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section \n4.4). \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and can occur many months \nafter initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nPancreatitis has been observed in patients receiving ritonavir therapy, including those who developed \nhypertriglyceridaemia.  In some cases fatalities have been observed.  Patients with advanced HIV \ndisease may be at risk of elevated triglycerides and pancreatitis (see section 4.4). \n \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).  \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\nPaediatric populations \n \nThe safety profile of Norvir in children 2 years of age and older is similar to that seen in adults. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nHuman experience of acute overdose with ritonavir is limited.  One patient in clinical trials took \nritonavir 1500 mg/day for two days and reported paraesthesia, which resolved after the dose was \ndecreased.  A case of renal failure with eosinophilia has been reported. \n \nThe signs of toxicity observed in animals (mice and rats) included decreased activity, ataxia, dyspnoea \nand tremors. \n \nManagement \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with ritonavir.  Treatment of overdose with ritonavir should \nconsist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the \nclinical status of the patient.  Due to the solubility characteristics and possibility of transintestinal \nelimination, it is proposed that management of overdose could entail gastric lavage and administration \nof activated charcoal.  Since ritonavir is extensively metabolised by the liver and is highly protein \nbound, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of the medicine.   \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmaco-therapeutic group: antiviral for systemic use, protease inhibitors ATC code: J05AE03 \n \nRitonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer \n \nPharmacokinetic enhancement by ritonavir is based on ritonavir’s activity as a potent inhibitor of \nCYP3A- mediated metabolism.  The degree of enhancement is related to the metabolic pathway of the \nco-administered protease inhibitor and the impact of the co-administered protease inhibitor on the \nmetabolism of ritonavir.  Maximal inhibition of metabolism of the co-administered protease inhibitor \nis generally achieved with ritonavir doses of 100 mg daily to 200 mg twice daily, and is dependent on \nthe co-administered protease inhibitor.  For additional information on the effect of ritonavir on \nco-administered protease inhibitor metabolism, see section 4.5 and refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics of the particular co-administered PIs. \n \nRitonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent \n \nRitonavir is an orally active peptidomimetic inhibitor of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 aspartyl proteases.  \nInhibition of HIV protease renders the enzyme incapable of processing the gag-pol polyprotein \nprecursor which leads to the production of HIV particles with immature morphology that are unable to \ninitiate new rounds of infection.  Ritonavir has selective affinity for the HIV protease and has little \ninhibitory activity against human aspartyl proteases. \n \nRitonavir was the first protease inhibitor (approved in 1996) for which efficacy was proven in a study \nwith clinical endpoints.  However, due to ritonavir’s metabolic inhibitory properties its use as a \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n30 \n \n\npharmacokinetic enhancer of other protease inhibitors is the prevalent use of ritonavir in clinical \npractice (see section 4.2).  \n \nEffects on the Electrocardiogram   \n \nQTcF interval was evaluated in a randomised, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily) \ncontrolled crossover study in 45 healthy adults, with 10 measurements over 12 hours on Day 3.  The \nmaximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference in QTcF from placebo was 5.5 (7.6) for \n400 mg twice daily ritonavir.  The Day 3 ritonavir exposure was approximately 1.5 fold higher than \nthat observed with the 600 mg twice daily dose at steady state.  No subject experienced an increase in \nQTcF of ≥ 60 msec from baseline or a QTcF interval exceeding the potentially clinically relevant \nthreshold of 500 msec. \n \nModest prolongation of the PR interval was also noted in subjects receiving ritonavir in the same study \non Day 3.  The mean changes from baseline in PR interval ranged from 11.0 to 24.0 msec in the 12 \nhour interval post dose.  Maximum PR interval was 252 msec and no second or third degree heart \nblock was observed (see section 4.4). \n \nResistance \n \nRitonavir-resistant isolates of HIV-1 have been selected in vitro and isolated from patients treated with \ntherapeutic doses of ritonavir.  \n  \nReduction in the antiretroviral activity of ritonavir is primarily associated with the protease mutations \nV82A/F/T/S and I84V.  Accumulation of other mutations in the protease gene (including at positions \n20, 33, 36, 46, 54, 71, and 90) can also contribute to ritonavir resistance.  In general, as mutations \nassociated with ritonavir resistance accumulate, susceptibility to select other PIs may decrease due to \ncross-resistance.  The Summary of Product Characteristics of other protease inhibitors or official \ncontinuous updates should be consulted for specific information regarding protease mutations \nassociated with reduced response to these agents. \n   \nClinical pharmacodynamic data \n \nThe effects of ritonavir (alone or combined with other antiretroviral agents) on biological markers of \ndisease activity such as CD4 cell count and viral RNA were evaluated in several studies involving \nHIV-1 infected patients.  The following studies are the most important. \n \nAdult Use \n \nA controlled study completed in 1996 with ritonavir as add-on therapy in HIV-1 infected patients \nextensively pre-treated with nucleoside analogues and baseline CD4 cell counts ≤ 100 cells/µl showed \na reduction in mortality and AIDS defining events.  The mean average change from baseline over 16 \nweeks for HIV RNA levels was -0.79 log10 (maximum mean decrease: 1.29 log10) in the ritonavir \ngroup versus-0.01 log10 in the control group.  The most frequently used nucleosides in this study were \nzidovudine, stavudine, didanosine and zalcitabine.  \n \nIn a study completed in 1996 recruiting less advanced HIV-1 infected patients (CD4 200-500 cells/µl) \nwithout previous antiretroviral therapy, ritonavir in combination with zidovudine or alone reduced \nviral load in plasma and increased CD4 count.  The mean average change from baseline over 48 weeks \nfor HIV RNA levels was -0.88 log10 in the ritonavir group versus -0.66 log10 in the ritonavir + \nzidovudine group versus -0.42 log10 in the zidovudine group. \n \nThe continuation of ritonavir therapy should be evaluated by viral load because of the possibility of \nthe emergence of resistance as described under section 4.1. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\nPaediatric Use \n \nIn an open label trial completed in 1998 in HIV infected, clinically stable children there was a \nsignificant difference (p = 0.03) in the detectable RNA levels in favour of a triple regimen (ritonavir, \nzidovudine and lamivudine) following 48 weeks treatment. \n \nIn a study completed in 2003, 50 HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitor and lamivudine naïve children age \n4 weeks to 2 years received ritonavir 350 or 450 mg/m2 every 12 hours co-administered with \nzidovudine 160 mg/m2 every 8 hours and lamivudine 4 mg/kg every 12 hours.  In intent to treat \nanalyses, 72% and 36% of patients achieved reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA of ≤ 400 copies/ml at \nWeek 16 and 104, respectively.  Response was similar in both dosing regimens and across patient age.   \n \nIn a study completed in 2000, 76 HIV-1 infected children aged 6 months to 12 years who were \nprotease inhibitor naive and naive to lamivudine and/or stavudine received ritonavir 350 or 450 mg/m2 \nevery 12 hours co-administered with lamivudine and stavudine.  In intent to treat analyses, 50% and \n57% of patients in the 350 and 450 mg/m2 dose groups, respectively, achieved reduction in plasma \nHIV-1 RNA to ≤ 400 copies/ml at Week 48. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nThere is no parenteral formulation of ritonavir, therefore the extent of absorption and absolute \nbioavailability has not been determined.  The pharmacokinetics of ritonavir during multiple dose \nregimens were studied in non-fasting HIV-infected adult volunteers.  Upon multiple dosing, ritonavir \naccumulation is slightly less than predicted from a single dose due to a time and dose-related increase \nin apparent clearance (Cl/F).  Trough concentrations of ritonavir decrease over time, possibly due to \nenzyme induction, but appeared to stabilise by the end of 2 weeks.  The time to maximum \nconcentration (Tmax) remained constant at approximately 4 hours with increasing dose.  Renal \nclearance averaged less than 0.1 l/h and was relatively constant throughout the dosage range. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic parameters observed with various dosing schemes of ritonavir alone are shown \nin the table below. \n \n\nRitonavir Dosing Regimen \n 100 mg   once \n\ndaily \n100 mg twice \n\ndaily1 \n200 mg once \n\ndaily \n200 mg twice \n\ndaily \n600 mg twice \n\ndaily \nCmax (µg/ml) 0.84 ± 0.39 0.89 3.4 ± 1.3 4.5 ± 1.3 11.2 ± 3.6 \nCtrough (µg/ml) 0.08 ± 0.04 0.22 0.16 ± 0.10 0.6 ± 0.2 3.7 ± 2.6 \nAUC12 or 24 \n(µg•h/ml) \n\n6.6 ± 2.4 6.2 20.0 ± 5.6 21.92 ± 6.48 77.5 ± 31.5 \n\nt½ (h) ~5 ~5 ~4 ~8 ~3 to 5 \nCl/F (L/h) 17.2 ± 6.6 16.1 10.8 ± 3.1 10.0 ± 3.2 8.8 ± 3.2 \n\n1 Values expressed as geometric means.  Note: ritonavir was dosed after a meal for all listed regimens. \n \nEffects of food on oral absorption \n \nAdministration of a single 100 mg dose of ritonavir powder for oral suspension with a moderate fat \nmeal (617 kcal, 29% calories from fat) was associated with a mean decrease of 23 and 39% in \nritonavir AUCinf and Cmax  respectively, relative to fasting conditions. Administration with a high fat \nmeal (917 kcal, 60% calories from fat) was associated with a mean decrease of 32 and 49% in \nritonavir AUCinf and Cmax respectively, relative to fasting conditions. \n \nDistribution \nThe apparent volume of distribution (VB/F) of ritonavir is approximately 20 - 40 l after a single \n600 mg dose.  The protein binding of ritonavir in human plasma is approximately 98 - 99% and is \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\nconstant over the concentration range of 1.0 – 100 µg/ml.  Ritonavir binds to both human alpha 1-acid \nglycoprotein (AAG) and human serum albumin (HSA) with comparable affinities. \n \nTissue distribution studies with 14C-labelled ritonavir in rats showed the liver, adrenals, pancreas, \nkidneys and thyroid to have the highest concentrations of ritonavir.  Tissue to plasma ratios of \napproximately 1 measured in rat lymph nodes suggests that ritonavir distributes into lymphatic tissues.  \nRitonavir penetrates minimally into the brain. \n \nBiotransformation \nRitonavir was noted to be extensively metabolised by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system, primarily \nby the CYP3A isozyme family and to a lesser extent by the CYP2D6 isoform.  Animal studies as well \nas in vitro experiments with human hepatic microsomes indicated that ritonavir primarily underwent \noxidative metabolism.  Four ritonavir metabolites have been identified in man.  The isopropylthiazole \noxidation metabolite (M-2) is the major metabolite and has antiviral activity similar to that of parent \ncompound.  However, the AUC of the M-2 metabolite was approximately 3% of the AUC of parent \ncompound.   \n \nLow doses of ritonavir have shown profound effects on the pharmacokinetics of other protease \ninhibitors (and other products metabolised by CYP3A4) and other protease inhibitors may influence \nthe pharmacokinetics of ritonavir (see section 4.5).   \n \nElimination \nHuman studies with radiolabelled ritonavir demonstrated that the elimination of ritonavir was \nprimarily via the hepatobiliary system; approximately 86% of radiolabel was recovered from stool, \npart of which is expected to be unabsorbed ritonavir.  In these studies renal elimination was not found \nto be a major route of elimination of ritonavir.  This was consistent with the observations in animal \nstudies. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nNo clinically significant differences in AUC or Cmax were noted between males and females.  \nRitonavir pharmacokinetic parameters were not statistically significantly associated with body weight \nor lean body mass.  Ritonavir plasma exposures in patients 50 – 70 years of age when dosed 100 mg in \ncombination with lopinavir or at higher doses in the absence of other protease inhibitors is similar to \nthat observed in younger adults. \n \nPatients with impaired liver function \nAfter multiple dosing of ritonavir to healthy volunteers (500 mg twice daily) and subjects with mild to \nmoderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class A and B, 400 mg twice daily) exposure to ritonavir \nafter dose normalisation was not significantly different between the two groups.   \n \nPatients with impaired renal function \nRitonavir pharmacokinetic parameters have not been studied in patients with renal impairment.  \nHowever, since the renal clearance of ritonavir is negligible, no changes in the total body clearance are \nexpected in patients with renal impairment.   \n \nPaediatric patients \nRitonavir steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in HIV infected children above 2 \nyears of age receiving doses ranging from 250 mg/m² twice daily to 400 mg/m² twice daily.  Ritonavir \nconcentrations obtained after 350 to 400 mg/m² twice daily in paediatric patients were comparable to \nthose obtained in adults receiving 600 mg (approximately 330 mg/m²) twice daily.  Across dose \ngroups, ritonavir oral clearance (CL/F/m2) was approximately 1.5 to 1.7 times faster in paediatric \npatients above 2 years of age than in adult subjects. \n \nRitonavir steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in HIV infected children less than \n2 years of age receiving doses ranging from 350 to 450 mg/m² twice daily.  Ritonavir concentrations in \nthis study were highly variable and somewhat lower than those obtained in adults receiving 600 mg \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\n(approximately 330 mg/m²) twice daily.  Across dose groups, ritonavir oral clearance (CL/F/m2) \ndeclined with age with median values of 9.0 L/h/m2 in children less than 3 months of age, 7.8 L/h/m2 \nin children between 3 and 6 months of age and 4.4 L/h/m2 in children between 6 and 24 months of age. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeated dose toxicity studies in animals identified major target organs as the liver, retina, thyroid \ngland and kidney.  Hepatic changes involved hepatocellular, biliary and phagocytic elements and were \naccompanied by increases in hepatic enzymes.  Hyperplasia of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) \nand retinal degeneration have been seen in all of the rodent studies conducted with ritonavir, but have \nnot been seen in dogs.  Ultrastructural evidence suggests that these retinal changes may be secondary \nto phospholipidosis.  However, clinical trials revealed no evidence of medicinal product-induced \nocular changes in humans.  All thyroid changes were reversible upon discontinuation of ritonavir.  \nClinical investigation in humans has revealed no clinically significant alteration in thyroid function \ntests.  Renal changes including tubular degeneration, chronic inflammation and proteinurea were noted \nin rats and are felt to be attributable to species-specific spontaneous disease.  Furthermore, no \nclinically significant renal abnormalities were noted in clinical trials. \n \nDevelopmental toxicity observed in rats (embryolethality, decreased foetal body weight and \nossification delays and visceral changes, including delayed testicular descent) occurred mainly at a \nmaternally toxic dosage.  Developmental toxicity in rabbits (embryolethality, decreased litter size and \ndecreased foetal weights) occurred at a maternally toxic dosage. \n \nRitonavir was not found to be mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays \nincluding the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay using S. typhimurium and E. coli, the mouse \nlymphoma assay, the mouse micronucleus test and chromosomal aberration assays in human \nlymphocytes. \n \nLong term carcinogenicity studies of ritonavir in mice and rats revealed tumourigenic potential \nspecific for these species, but are regarded as of no relevance for humans. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \n \nNorvir 100 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION  \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 100 mg ritonavir.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nWhite, oval, debossed with [Abbott logo] and “NK”.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRitonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 \ninfected patients (adults and children of 2 years of age and older). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nRitonavir should be administered by physicians who are experienced in the treatment of HIV infection. \n \nRitonavir film-coated tablets are administered orally and should be ingested with food (see section \n5.2). \n \nNorvir film-coated tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, broken or crushed. \n \nPosology \n \nRitonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer  \n \nWhen ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer with other protease inhibitors the Summary \nof Product Characteristics for the particular protease inhibitor must be consulted. \n \nThe following HIV-1 protease inhibitors have been approved for use with ritonavir as a \npharmacokinetic enhancer at the noted doses.   \n \nAdults \n\nAmprenavir 600 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. \nAtazanavir 300 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily. \nFosamprenavir 700 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. \nLopinavir co-formulated with ritonavir (lopinavir/ritonavir) 400 mg/100 mg or 800 mg/200 mg. \nSaquinavir 1000 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily in ART experienced patients. \nInitiate treatment with saquinavir 500 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily for the \nfirst 7 days, then saquinavir 1000 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily in ART-\nnaïve patients. \nTipranavir 500 mg twice daily with ritonavir 200 mg twice daily.  Tipranavir with ritonavir \nshould not be used in treatment-naïve patients. \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\n Darunavir 600 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily in antiretroviral treatment. \n(ART) experienced patients.  Darunavir 800 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily \nmay be used in some ART experienced patients. Refer to the darunavir Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for further information on once daily dosing in ART experienced patients. \n\n Darunavir 800 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily in ART-naïve patients. \n \n\nChildren and adolescents \nRitonavir is recommended for children 2 years of age and older.  For further dosage recommendations, \nrefer to the product information of other Protease Inhibitors approved for co-administration with \nritonavir.   \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nAs ritonavir is primarily metabolised by the liver, ritonavir may be appropriate for use with caution as \na pharmacokinetic enhancer in patients with renal insufficiency depending on the specific protease \ninhibitor with which it is co-administered.  However, since the renal clearance of ritonavir is \nnegligible, the decrease in the total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal impairment.  \nFor specific dosing information in patients with renal impairment, refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics (SPC) of the co-administered protease inhibitor.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nRitonavir should not be given as a pharmacokinetic enhancer to patients with decompensated liver \ndisease, (see section 4.3).  In the absence of pharmacokinetic studies in patients with stable severe \nhepatic impairment (Child Pugh Grade C) without decompensation, caution should be exercised when \nritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer as increased levels of the co-administered PI may \noccur.  Specific recommendations for use of ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer in patients with \nhepatic impairment are dependent on the protease inhibitor with which it is co-administered.  The SPC \nof the co-administered PI should be reviewed for specific dosing information in this patient \npopulation.  \n \nRitonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent \n \nAdults \nThe recommended dose of Norvir film-coated tablets is 600 mg (6 tablets) twice daily (total of \n1200 mg per day) by mouth. \n \nGradually increasing the dose of ritonavir when initiating therapy may help to improve tolerance.  \nTreatment should be initiated at 300 mg (3 tablets) twice daily for a period of three days and increased \nby 100 mg (1 tablet) twice daily increments up to 600 mg twice daily over a period of no longer than \n14 days.  Patients should not remain on 300 mg twice daily for more than 3 days. \n \nChildren and adolescents (2 years of age and above) \nThe recommended dosage of Norvir in children is 350 mg/m² by mouth twice daily and should not \nexceed 600 mg twice daily.  Norvir should be started at 250 mg/m² and increased at 2 to 3 day \nintervals by 50 mg/m² twice daily (please refer to the Norvir 100 mg powder for oral suspension \nSummary of Product Characteristics). \n \nFor older children it may be feasible to substitute tablets for the maintenance dose of the powder for \noral suspension.  \n \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nDosage conversion from powder for oral suspension to tablets for children \n \n\nPowder for oral suspension dose Tablet dose \n176 mg (17.6 ml) twice daily 200 mg in the morning and 200 mg in the \n\nevening \n262.5 mg (26.4 ml) twice daily 300 mg in the morning and 300 mg in the \n\nevening \n350 mg (35.0 ml) twice daily 400 mg in the morning and 300 mg in the \n\nevening  \n438 mg (43.8 ml) twice daily 500 mg in the morning and 400 mg in the \n\nevening \n526 mg (52.6 ml) twice daily 500 mg in the morning and 500 mg in the \n\nevening \n \nNorvir is not recommended in children below 2 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nPharmacokinetic data indicated that no dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section \n5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nCurrently, there are no data specific to this patient population and therefore specific dosage \nrecommendations cannot be made.  The renal clearance of ritonavir is negligible therefore; a decrease \nin the total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal impairment.  Because ritonavir is \nhighly protein bound it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal \ndialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment \nRitonavir is principally metabolised and eliminated by the liver.  Pharmacokinetic data indicate that no \ndose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).  \nRitonavir must not be given to patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).   \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Norvir in childred aged below 2 years has not been established. Currently \navailable data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be \nmade. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.   \n \nWhen ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of other PIs, consult the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics of the co-administered protease inhibitor for contraindications. \n \nRitonavir should not be given as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent to patients \nwith decompensated liver disease.  \n \nIn vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A- and \nCYP2D6- mediated biotransformations.  The following medicines are contraindicated when used with \nritonavir and unless otherwise noted, the contraindication is based on the potential for ritonavir to \ninhibit metabolism of the co-administered medicinal product, resulting in increased exposure to the \nco-administered medicinal product and risk of clinically significant adverse effects. \n \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\nThe enzyme-modulating effect of ritonavir may be dose dependent.  For some products, \ncontraindications may be more relevant when ritonavir is used as an antiretroviral agent than when \nritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer (e.g. rifabutin and voriconazole): \n \n\nMedicinal Product \nClass \n\nMedicinal Products \nwithin Class \n\nRationale \n\nConcomitant medicinal product levels increased or decreased \n\nα1-Adrenoreceptor \nAntagonist \n\nAlfuzosin Increased plasma concentrations of alfuzosin \nwhich may lead to severe hypotension (see \nsection 4.5). \n\nAnalgesics Pethidine, piroxicam, \npropoxyphne \n\nIncreased plasma concentrations of \nnorpethidine, piroxicam and propoxyphene.  \nThereby, increasing the risk of serious \nrespiratory depression or haematologic \nabnormalities, or other serious adverse effects \nfrom these agents. \n\nAntianginal Ranolazine Increased plasma concentrations of ranolazine \nwhich may increase the potential for serious \nand/or life-threatening reactions (see section \n4.5). \n\nAnticancer Neratinib Increased plasma concentrations of neratinib \nwhich may increase the potential for serious \nand/or life-threatening reactions including \nhepatotoxicity (see section 4.5). \n\nVenetoclax Increased plasma concentrations of venetoclax. \nIncreased risk of tumor lysis syndrome at the \ndose initiation and during the dose-titration \nphase (see section 4.5). \n\nAntiarrhythmics Amiodarone, bepridil, \ndronedarone, \nencainide, flecainide, \npropafenone, quinidine \n \n\nIncreased plasma concentrations of amiodarone, \nbepridil, dronedarone, encainide, flecainide, \npropafenone, quinidine.  Thereby, increasing \nthe risk of arrhythmias or other serious adverse \neffects from these agents. \n\nAntibiotic Fusidic Acid Increased plasma concentrations of fusidic acid \nand ritonavir. \n\nAntifungal Voriconazole Concomitant use of ritonavir (400 mg twice \ndaily and more) and voriconazole is \ncontraindicated due to a reduction in \nvoriconazole plasma concentrations and \npossible loss of effect (see section 4.5). \n\nAntihistamines Astemizole, \nterfenadine \n\nIncreased plasma concentrations of astemizole \nand terfenadine.  Thereby, increasing the risk of \nserious arrhythmias from these agents. \n\nAnti-gout Colchicine Potential for serious and/or life-threatening \nreactions in patients with renal and/or hepatic \nimpairment (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\nAntimycobacterial Rifabutin Concomitant use of ritonavir (500 mg twice \ndaily) dosed as an antiretroviral agent and \nrifabutin due to an increase of rifabutin serum \nconcentrations and risk of adverse reactions \nincluding uveitis (see section 4.4).  \nRecommendations regarding use of ritonavir \ndosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer with \nrifabutin are noted in section 4.5.   \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\nAntipsychotics/ \nNeuroleptics \n\nLurasidone Increased plasma concentrations of lurasidone \nwhich may increase the potential for serious \nand/or life-threatening reactions (see section \n4.5). \n\nClozapine, pimozide Increased plasma concentrations of clozapine \nand pimozide.  Thereby, increasing the risk of \nserious haematologic abnormalities, or other \nserious adverse effects from these agents. \n\nQuetiapine Increased plasma concentrations of quetiapine \nwhich may lead to coma.  The concomitant \nadministration with quetiapine is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\nErgot Derivatives Dihydroergotamine, \nergonovine, \nergotamine, \nmethylergonovine \n\nIncreased plasma concentrations of ergot \nderivatives leading to acute ergot toxicity, \nincluding vasospasm and ischaemia. \n\nGI motility agent Cisapride Increased plasma concentrations of cisapride.  \nThereby, increasing the risk of serious \narrhythmias from this agent. \n\nLipid-modifying agents \n \nHMG Co-A Reductase \nInhibitors \n\nLovastatin, simvastatin Increased plasma concentrations of lovastatin \nand simvastatin; thereby, increasing the risk of \nmyopathy including rhabdomyolysis (see \nsection 4.5). \n \n\nMicrosomal \ntriglyceride transfer \nprotein (MTTP) \ninhibitor \n\nLomitapide Increased plasma concentrations of lomitapide \n(see section 4.5). \n\nPDE5 inhibitor Avanafil Increased plasma concentrations of avanafil \n(see section 4.4. and 4.5). \n\nSildenafil  Contraindicated when used for the treatment of \npulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) only.  \nIncreased plasma concentrations of sildenafil.  \nThereby, increasing the potential for sildenafil-\nassociated adverse events (which include \nhypotension and syncope).  See section 4.4 and \nsection 4.5 for co-administration of sildenafil in \npatients with erectile dysfunction. \n\nVardenafil Increased plasma concentrations of vardenafil \n(see section 4.4. and 4.5). \n\nSedatives/hypnotics Clorazepate, diazepam, \nestazolam, flurazepam, \noral midazolam and \ntriazolam \n\nIncreased plasma concentrations of clorazepate, \ndiazepam, estazolam, flurazepam, oral \nmidazolam and triazolam.  Thereby, increasing \nthe risk of extreme sedation and respiratory \ndepression from these agents.  (For caution on \nparenterally administered midazolam, see \nsection 4.5.). \n\nRitonavir medicinal product level decreased \n\nHerbal Preparation St. John’s Wort Herbal preparations containing St John’s wort \n(Hypericum perforatum) due to the risk of \ndecreased plasma concentrations and reduced \nclinical effects of ritonavir (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nRitonavir is not a cure for HIV-1 infection or AIDS.  Patients receiving Ritonavir or any other \nantiretroviral therapy may continue to develop opportunistic infections and other complications of \nHIV-1 infection.  \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent transmission \nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nWhen ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer with other PIs, full details on the warnings and \nprecautions relevant to that particular PI should be considered, therefore the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for the particular PI must be consulted. \n \nRitonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer   \n \nPatients with chronic diarrhoea or malabsorption \nExtra monitoring is recommended when diarrhoea occurs.  The relatively high frequency of diarrhoea \nduring treatment with ritonavir may compromise the absorption and efficacy (due to decreased \ncompliance) of ritonavir or other concurrent medicinal products.  Serious persistent vomiting and/or \ndiarrhoea associated with ritonavir use might also compromise renal function.  It is advisable to \nmonitor renal function in patients with renal function impairment. \n \nHaemophilia \nThere have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and \nhaemarthroses, in haemophiliac patients type A and B treated with protease inhibitors.  In some \npatients additional factor VIII was given.  In more than a half of the reported cases, treatment with \nprotease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued.  A causal \nrelationship has been evoked, although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated.  \nHaemophiliac patients should therefore be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters:  \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose, reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nPancreatitis \nPancreatitis should be considered if clinical symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) or \nabnormalities in laboratory values (such as increased serum lipase or amylase values) suggestive of \npancreatitis should occur.  Patients who exhibit these signs or symptoms should be evaluated and \nNorvir therapy should be discontinued if a diagnosis of pancreatitis is made (see section 4.8). \n \nImmune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymtomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, \nand Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.  Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and \ntreatment instituted when necessary. \n \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \ncan occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\nLiver disease \nRitonavir should not be given to patients with decompensated liver disease (see section 4.2).  Patients \nwith chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased \nrisk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions.  In case of concomitant antiviral therapy \nfor hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant product information for these medicinal products. \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be \nmonitored according to standard practice.  If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n \nRenal disease \nSince the renal clearance of ritonavir is negligible, the decrease in the total body clearance is not \nexpected in patients with renal impairment (see also section 4.2). \n \nRenal failure, renal impairment, elevated creatinine, hypophosphataemia and proximal tubulopathy \n(including Fanconi syndrome) have been reported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) \nin clinical practice (see section 4.8). \n \nOsteonecrosis \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART).  Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nPR interval prolongation \nRitonavir has been shown to cause modest asymptomatic prolongation of the PR interval in some \nhealthy adult subjects.  Rare reports of 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular block in patients with \nunderlying structural heart disease and pre-existing conduction system abnormalities or in patients \nreceiving medicinal products known to prolong the PR interval (such as verapamil or atazanavir) have \nbeen reported in patients receiving ritonavir.  Norvir should be used with caution in such patients (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nInteractions with other medicinal products \n \nRitonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent \n \nThe following warnings and precautions should be considered when ritonavir is used as an \nantiretroviral agent.  When ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer at the 100 mg and 200 mg \nlevel it cannot be assumed that the following warnings and precautions will also apply.  When \nritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, full details on the warnings and precautions relevant \nto that particular PI must be considered, therefore the Summary of Product Characteristics, section 4.4, \nfor the particular PI must be consulted to determine if the information below is applicable. \n \nPDE5 inhibitors \nParticular caution should be used when prescribing sildenafil or tadalafil for the treatment of erectile \ndysfunction in patients receiving ritonavir.  Co-administration of ritonavir with these medicinal \nproducts is expected to substantially increase their concentrations and may result in associated adverse \nreactions such as hypotension and prolonged erection (see section 4.5).  Concomitant use of avanafil \nor vardenafil with ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  Concomitant use of sildenafil with \nritonavir is contraindicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients (see section 4.3). \n \nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors \nThe HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin and lovastatin are highly dependent on CYP3A for \nmetabolism, thus concomitant use of ritonavir with simvastatin or lovastatin is not recommended due \nto an increased risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis.  Caution must also be exercised and \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\nreduced doses should be considered if ritonavir is used concurrently with atorvastatin, which is \nmetabolised to a lesser extent by CYP3A.  While rosuvastatin elimination is not dependent on \nCYP3A, an elevation of rosuvastatin exposure has been reported with ritonavir co-administration.  The \nmechanism of this interaction is not clear, but may be the result of transporter inhibition.  When used \nwith ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent, the lowest doses of \natorvastatin or rosuvastatin should be administered.  The metabolism of pravastatin and fluvastatin is \nnot dependent of CYP3A, and interactions are not expected with ritonavir.  If treatment with an HMG-\nCoA reductase inhibitor is indicated, pravastatin or fluvastatin is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nColchicine \nLife-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with colchicine and \nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A like ritonavir (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nDigoxin \nParticular caution should be used when prescribing ritonavir in patients taking digoxin since \nco-administration of ritonavir with digoxin is expected to increase digoxin levels.  The increased \ndigoxin levels may lessen over time (see section 4.5). \n \nIn patients who are already taking digoxin when ritonavir is introduced, the digoxin dose should be \nreduced to one-half of the patients’ normal dose and patients need to be followed more closely than \nusual for several weeks after initiating co-administration of ritonavir and digoxin. \n \nIn patients who are already taking ritonavir when digoxin is introduced, digoxin should be introduced \nmore gradually than usual.  Digoxin levels should be monitored more intensively than usual during \nthis period, with dose adjustments made, as necessary, based on clinical, electrocardiographic and \ndigoxin level findings.  \n \nEthinyl estradiol \nBarrier or other non-hormonal methods of contraception should be considered when administering \nritonavir at therapeutic or low doses as ritonavir is likely to reduce the effect and change the uterine \nbleeding profile when co-administered with estradiol-containing contraceptives. \n \nGlucocorticoids \nConcomitant use of ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4 \nis not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic \ncorticosteroid effects, including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section 4.5). \n \nTrazodone \nParticular caution should be used when prescribing ritonavir in patients using trazodone.  Trazodone is \na CYP3A4 substrate and co-administration of ritonavir is expected to increase trazodone levels.  \nAdverse reactions of nausea, dizziness, hypotension and syncope have been observed in single dose \ninteraction studies in healthy volunteers (see section 4.5) \n \nRivaroxaban \nIt is not recommended to use ritonavir in patients receiving rivaroxaban, due to the risk of increased \nbleeding (see section 4.5). \n \nRiociguat \nThe concomitant use of ritonavir is not recommended due to potential increase in riociguat exposure \n(see section 4.5). \n \nVorapaxar \nThe concomitant use of ritonavir is not recommended due to potential increase in vorapaxar exposure \n(see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\nBedaquiline \nStrong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as protease inhibitors may increase bedaquiline exposure which could \npotentially increase the risk of bedaquiline-related adverse reactions. Therefore, combination of \nbedaquiline with ritonavir should be avoided.  However, if the benefit outweighs the risk, co-\nadministration of bedaquiline with ritonavir must be done with caution. More frequent \nelectrocardiogram monitoring and monitoring of transaminases is recommended (see section 4.5 and \nrefer to the bedaquiline Summary of Product Characteristics). \n \nDelamanid \nCo-administration of delamanid with a strong inhibitor of CYP3A (ritonavir) may increase exposure to \ndelamanid metabolite, which has been associated with QTc prolongation.  Therefore, if \nco-administration of delamanid with ritonavir is considered necessary, very frequent ECG monitoring \nthroughout the full delamanid treatment period is recommended (see section 4.5 and refer to the \ndelamanid Summary of Product Characteristics).  \n \nRitonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer \n \nThe interaction profiles of HIV-protease inhibitors, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, are \ndependant on the specific co-administered protease inhibitor.  \n \nFor a description of the mechanisms and potential mechanisms contributing to the interaction profile \nof the PIs, see section 4.5.  Please also review the Summary of Product Characteristics for the \nparticular boosted PI. \n \nSaquinavir \nDoses of ritonavir higher than 100 mg twice daily should not be used.  Higher doses of ritonavir have \nbeen shown to be associated with an increased incidence of adverse reactions.  Co-administration of \nsaquinavir and ritonavir has led to severe adverse reactions, mainly diabetic ketoacidosis and liver \ndisorders, especially in patients with pre-existing liver disease.   \n \nSaquinavir/ritonavir should not be given together with rifampicin, due to the risk of severe \nhepatotoxicity (presenting as increased hepatic transaminases) if the three medicines are given \ntogether (see section 4.5). \n \nTipranavir \nCo-administration of tipranavir with 200 mg of ritonavir has been associated with reports of clinical \nhepatitis and hepatic decompensation including some fatalities.  Extra vigilance is warranted in \npatients with chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C co-infection, as these patients have an increased risk of \nhepatotoxicity.  \n \nDoses of ritonavir lower than 200 mg twice daily should not be used as they might alter the efficacy \nprofile of the combination.   \n  \nFosamprenavir \nCo-administration of fosamprenavir with ritonavir in doses greater than 100 mg twice daily has not \nbeen clinically evaluated.  The use of higher ritonavir doses might alter the safety profile of the \ncombination and therefore is not recommended. \n \nAtazanavir \nCo-administration of atazanavir with ritonavir at doses greater than 100 mg once daily has not been \nclinically evaluated.  The use of higher ritonavir doses may alter the safety profile of atazanavir \n(cardiac effects, hyperbilirubinemia) and therefore is not recommended.  Only when atazanavir with \nritonavir is co-administered with efavirenz, a dose increase of ritonavir to 200mg once daily could be \nconsidered. In this instance, close clinical monitoring is warranted.  Refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for atazanavir for further details. \n \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nRitonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent \n \nRitonavir has a high affinity for several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms and may inhibit oxidation \nwith the following ranked order: CYP3A4 > CYP2D6.  Co-administration of ritonavir and medicinal \nproducts primarily metabolised by CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other \nmedicinal product, which could increase or prolong its therapeutic and adverse effects. For selected \nmedicinal products (e.g. alprazolam) the inhibitory effects of ritonavir on CYP3A4 may decrease over \ntime.  Ritonavir also has a high affinity for P-glycoprotein and may inhibit this transporter.  The \ninhibitory effect of ritonavir (with or without other protease inhibitors) on P-gp activity may decrease \nover time (e.g. digoxin and fexofenadine-see table “Ritonavir effects on non-antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts” below).  Ritonavir may induce glucuronidation and oxidation by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, \nCYP2C9 and CYP2C19 thereby increasing the biotransformation of some medicinal products \nmetabolised by these pathways, and may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal \nproducts, which could decease or shorten their therapeutic effect.   \n \nImportant information regarding medicinal product interactions when ritonavir is used as a \npharmacokinetic enhancer is also contained in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the \nco-administered protease inhibitor. \n \nMedicinal products that affect ritonavir levels \n \nSerum levels of ritonavir can be reduced by concomitant use of herbal preparations containing \nSt John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum).  This is due to the induction of medicinal product \nmetabolising enzymes by St John’s wort.  Herbal preparations containing St John’s wort must not be \nused in combination with ritonavir.  If a patient is already taking St John’s wort, St John’s wort should \nbe stopped and if possible check viral levels.  Ritonavir levels may increase on stopping St John’s \nwort.  The dose of ritonavir may need adjusting.  The inducing effect may persist for at least 2 weeks \nafter cessation of treatment with St John’s wort (see section 4.3).   \n \nSerum levels of ritonavir may be affected by select co-administered medicinal products (e.g. \ndelavirdine, efavirenz, phenytoin and rifampicin).  These interactions are noted in the medicinal \nproduct interaction tables below. \n \nMedicinal products that are affected by the use of ritonavir \n \nInteractions between ritonavir and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease \ninhibitors and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in the tables below.

Adjustment to the \ndose of buprenorphine or ritonavir may therefore not be necessary \nwhen the two are dosed together.  When ritonavir is used in \ncombination with another protease inhibitor and buprenorphine, the \nSPC of the co-administered protease inhibitor should be reviewed for \nspecific dosing information. \n \n\nPethidine, piroxicam, propoxyphene Ritonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma \nconcentrations of pethidine, piroxicam, and propoxyphene and is \ntherefore contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \n\nFentanyl Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral \nagent inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to increase the \nplasma concentrations of fentanyl.  Careful monitoring of therapeutic \nand adverse effects (including respiratory depression) is \nrecommended when fentanyl is concomitantly administered with \nritonavir. \n \n\nMethadone1 5, single dose  500 q12h,  ↓ 36%  ↓ 38%  \n Increased methadone dose may be necessary when concomitantly \n\nadministered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a \npharmacokinetic enhancer due to induction of glucuronidation.

If \nthis co-administration is judged unavoidable, refer to the abemaciclib \nSmPC for dosage adjustment recommendations.  Monitor for ADRs \nrelated to abemaciclib. \n \n\nApalutamide Apalutamide is a moderate to strong CYP3A4 inducer and this may \nlead to a decreased exposure of ritonavir and potential loss of \nvirologic response.  In addition, serum concentrations may be \nincreased when co-administered with ritonavir resulting in the \npotential for serious adverse events including seizure.   \n \nConcomitant use of ritonavir with apalutamide is not recommended. \n \n\nCeritinib Serum concentrations may be increased due to CYP3A and P-gp \ninhibition by ritonavir.  Caution should be exercised in administering \nceritinib with Norvir.  Refer to the ceritinib SmPC for dosage \nadjustment recommendations.  Monitor for ADRs related to ceritinib. \n \n\nDasatinib, nilotinib, vincristine, vinblastine Serum concentrations may be increased when co-administered with \nritonavir resulting in the potential for increased incidence of adverse \nreactions. \n \n\nEncorafenib Serum concentrations may be increased when co-administered with \nritonavir which may increase the risk of toxicity, including the risk of \nserious adverse events such as QT interval prolongation.  \nCo-administration of encorafenib and ritonavir should be avoided.  If \nthe benefit is considered to outweigh the risk and ritonavir must be \nused, patients should be carefully monitored for safety. \n \n\nFostamatinib Co-administration of fostamatinib with ritonavir may increase \nfostamatinib metabolite R406 exposure resulting in dose-related \nadverse events such as hepatotoxicity, neutropenia, hypertension, or \ndiarrhoea.  Refer to the fostamatinib SmPC for dose reduction \nrecommendations if such events occur. \n \n\nIbrutinib Serum concentrations of ibrutinib may be increased due to CYP3A \ninhibition by ritonavir, resulting in increased risk for toxicity \nincluding risk of tumor lysis syndrome.  Co-administration of \nibrutinib and ritonavir should be avoided.  If the benefit is considered \nto outweigh the risk and ritonavir must be used, reduce the ibrutinib \ndose to 140 mg and monitor patient closely for toxicity. \n \n\nNeratinib Serum concentrations may be increased due to CYP3A4 inhibition by \nritonavir. \n \nConcomitant use of neratinib with Norvir is contraindicated due to \nserious and/or life-threatening potential reactions including \nhepatotoxicity (see section 4.3). \n \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\nRitonavir effects on Non-antiretroviral Co-administered Medicinal Products \n\nCo-administered Medicinal Products Dose of Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts (mg) \n\nDose of \nNORVIR \n(mg) \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts AUC  \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts Cmax  \n\nVenetoclax Serum concentrations may be increased due to CYP3A inhibition by \nritonavir, resulting in increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome at the \ndose initiation and during the ramp-up phase (see section 4.3 and \nrefer to the venetoclax SmPC). \n \nFor patients who have completed the ramp-up phase and are on a \nsteady daily dose of venetoclax, reduce the venetoclax dose by at \nleast 75% when used with strong CYP3A inhibitors (refer to the \nvenetoclax SmPC for dosing instructions). \n\nAnticoagulants \n \n\nRivaroxaban 10, single dose 600 q12h ↑ 153% ↑ 55%  \n Inhibition of CYP3A and P-gp lead to increased plasma levels and \n\npharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban which may lead to an \nincreased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of ritonavir is not \nrecommended in patients receiving rivaroxaban. \n \n\nVorapaxar Serum concentrations may be increased due to CYP3A inhibition by \nritonavir.  The co-administration of vorapaxar with Norvir is not \nrecommended (see section 4.4 and refer to the vorapaxar SmPC). \n \n\nWarfarin \nS-Warfarin  \nR-Warfarin \n\n5, single dose  400 q12h   \n↑ 9%  \n↓ 33%  \n\n \n↓ 9%  \n↔  \n\n Induction of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 lead to decreased levels of R-\nwarfarin while little pharmacokinetic effect is noted on S- warfarin \nwhen co-administered with ritonavir.  Decreased R-warfarin levels \nmay lead to reduced anticoagulation, therefore it is recommended that \nanticoagulation parameters are monitored when warfarin is \nco-administered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a \npharmacokinetic enhancer. \n \n\nAnticonvulsants \n \n\nCarbamazepine Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral \nagent inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to increase the \nplasma concentrations of carbamazepine.  Careful monitoring of \ntherapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when carbamazepine \nis concomitantly administered with ritonavir. \n \n\nDivalproex, lamotrigine, phenytoin Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral \nagent induces oxidation by CYP2C9 and glucuronidation and as a \nresult is expected to decrease the plasma concentrations of \nanticonvulsants. Careful monitoring of serum levels or therapeutic \neffects is recommended when these medicines are concomitantly \nadministered with ritonavir. Phenytoin may decrease serum levels of \nritonavir. \n \n\nAntidepressants \n \n\nAmitriptyline, fluoxetine, imipramine, \nnortriptyline, paroxetine, sertraline \n\nRitonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent is likely to inhibit CYP2D6 \nand as a result is expected to increase concentrations of imipramine, \namitriptyline, nortriptyline, fluoxetine, paroxetine or sertraline. \nCareful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is \nrecommended when these medicines are concomitantly administered \nwith antiretroviral doses of ritonavir (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n52 \n \n\nRitonavir effects on Non-antiretroviral Co-administered Medicinal Products \n\nCo-administered Medicinal Products Dose of Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts (mg) \n\nDose of \nNORVIR \n(mg) \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts AUC  \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts Cmax  \n\nDesipramine 100, single oral dose 500 q12h ↑ 145% ↑ 22% \n The AUC and Cmax of the 2-hydroxy metabolite were decreased 15 \n\nand 67%, respectively.

If trazodone is \nco-administered with ritonavir, the combination should be used with \ncaution, initiating trazodone at the lowest dosage and monitoring for \nclinical response and tolerability. \n \n\nAnti-gout treatments \n \n\nColchicine Concentrations of colchicine are expected to increase when \ncoadministered with ritonavir. \nLife-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in \npatients treated with colchicine and ritonavir (CYP3A4 and P-gp \ninhibition) in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4).  Refer to the colchicine prescribing information. \n\nAntihistamines \n \n\nAstemizole, terfenadine Ritonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma \nconcentrations of astemizole and terfenadine and is therefore \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \n\nFexofenadine Ritonavir may modify P-glycoprotein mediated fexofenadine efflux \nwhen dosed as an antriretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic \nenhancer resulting in increased concentrations of fexofenadine.  \nIncreased fexofenadine levels may lessen over time as induction \ndevelops. \n \n\nLoratadine Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral \nagent inhibits CYP3A and as a result is expected to increase the \nplasma concentrations of loratadine.  Careful monitoring of \ntherapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when loratidine is \nconcomitantly administered with ritonavir. \n \n\nAnti-infectives \n \n\nFusidic Acid Ritonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma \nconcentrations of both fusidic acid and ritonavir and is therefore \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \n\nRifabutin1 \n \n25-O-desacetyl rifabutin metabolite  \n\n150 daily  500 q12h,  ↑ 4-fold  \n \n↑ 38-fold  \n\n↑ 2.5-fold  \n \n↑ 16-fold \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\nRitonavir effects on Non-antiretroviral Co-administered Medicinal Products \n\nCo-administered Medicinal Products Dose of Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts (mg) \n\nDose of \nNORVIR \n(mg) \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts AUC  \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts Cmax  \n\n Due to the large increase in rifabutin AUC, the concomitant use of \nrifabutin with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3).  The reduction of the rifabutin \ndose to 150 mg 3 times per week may be indicated for select PIs \nwhen co-administered with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer.  \nThe Summary of Product Characteristics of the co-administered \nprotease inhibitor should be consulted for specific recommendations.  \nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate \ntreatment of tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients.   \n \n\nRifampicin Although rifampicin may induce metabolism of ritonavir, limited data \nindicate that when high doses of ritonavir (600 mg twice daily) is \nco-administered with rifampicin, the additional inducing effect of \nrifampicin (next to that of ritonavir itself) is small and may have no \nclinical relevant effect on ritonavir levels in high-dose ritonavir \ntherapy.  The effect of ritonavir on rifampicin is not known. \n \n\nVoriconazole 200 q12h 400 q12h  ↓ 82% ↓ 66% \n 200 q12h 100 q12h ↓ 39% ↓ 24% \n Concomitant use of ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent and \n\nvoriconazole is contraindicated due to reduction in voriconazole \nconcentrations (see section 4.3).  Co-administration of voriconazole \nand ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer should be avoided, \nunless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use \nof voriconazole. \n \n\nAtovaquone Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral \nagent induces glucuronidation and as a result is expected to decrease \nthe plasma concentrations of atovaquone. Careful monitoring of \nserum levels or therapeutic effects is recommended when atovaquone \nis concomitantly administered with ritonavir. \n \n\nBedaquiline No interaction study is available with ritonavir only. In an interaction \nstudy of single-dose bedaquiline and multiple dose \nlopinavir/ritonavir, the AUC of bedaquiline was increased by 22%.  \nThis increase is likely due to ritonavir and a more pronounced effect \nmay be observed during prolonged co-administration.  Due to the risk \nof bedaquiline related adverse events, co-administration should be \navoided.  If the benefit outweighs the risk, co-administration of \nbedaquiline with ritonavir must be done with caution.  More frequent \nelectrocardiogram monitoring and monitoring of transaminases is \nrecommended (see section 4.4 and refer to the bedaquiline Summary \nof Product Characteristics). \n \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\nRitonavir effects on Non-antiretroviral Co-administered Medicinal Products \n\nCo-administered Medicinal Products Dose of Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts (mg) \n\nDose of \nNORVIR \n(mg) \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts AUC  \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts Cmax  \n\nClarithromycin \n \n14-OH clarithromycin metabolite  \n\n500 q12h  200 q8h ↑ 77%  \n \n↓ 100%  \n\n↑ 31%  \n \n↓ 99%  \n\n Due to the large therapeutic window of clarithromycin no dose \nreduction should be necessary in patients with normal renal function.  \nClarithromycin doses greater than 1 g per day should not be co-\nadministered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a \npharmacokinetic enhancer.  For patients with renal impairment, a \nclarithromycin dose reduction should be considered: for patients with \ncreatinine clearance of 30 to 60 ml/min the dose should be reduced by \n50%, for patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min the \ndose should be reduced by 75%. \n \n\nDelamanid No interaction study is available with ritonavir only.

Due to \nthe risk of QTc prolongation associated with DM-6705, if \nco-administration of delamanid with ritonavir is considered \nnecessary, very frequent ECG monitoring throughout the full \ndelamanid treatment period is recommended (see section 4.4 and \nrefer to the delamanid Summary of Product Characteristics). \n \n\nErythromycin, itraconazole Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral \nagent inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to increase the \nplasma concentrations of erythromycin and itraconazole.  Careful \nmonitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when \nerythromycin or itraconazole is used concomitantly administered with \nritonavir. \n \n\nKetoconazole 200 daily 500 q12h ↑ 3.4-fold  ↑ 55%  \n Ritonavir inhibits CYP3A-mediated metabolism of ketoconazole.  \n\nDue to an increased incidence of gastrointestinal and hepatic adverse \nreactions, a dose reduction of ketoconazole should be considered \nwhen co-administered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent \nor as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. \n \n\nSulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim2 800/160, single \ndose  \n\n500 q12h  ↓ 20% / ↑ 20% ↔ \n\n Dose alteration of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim during concomitant \nritonavir therapy should not be necessary. \n \n\nAntipsychotics/Neuroleptics \n \n\nClozapine, pimozide Ritonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma \nconcentrations of clozapine or pimozide and is therefore \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \n\nHaloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine Ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent is likely to inhibit CYP2D6 \nand as a result is expected to increase concentrations of haloperidol, \nrisperidone and thioridazine.  Careful monitoring of therapeutic and \nadverse effects is recommended when these medicines are \nconcomitantly administered with antiretroviral doses of ritonavir. \n \n\nLurasidone Due to CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir, concentrations of lurasidone \nare expected to increase.  The concomitant administration with \nlurasidone is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\nRitonavir effects on Non-antiretroviral Co-administered Medicinal Products \n\nCo-administered Medicinal Products Dose of Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts (mg) \n\nDose of \nNORVIR \n(mg) \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts AUC  \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts Cmax  \n\nQuetiapine Due to CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir, concentrations of quetiapine \nare expected to increase.  Concomitant administration of Norvir and \nquetiapine is contraindicated as it may increase quetiapine-related \ntoxicity (see section 4.3). \n \n\nβ2-agonist (long acting)  \n\nSalmeterol Ritonavir inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result a pronounced increase in \nthe plasma concentrations of salmeterol is expected.  Therefore \nconcomitant use is not recommended. \n \n\nCalcium channel antagonists \n \n\nAmlodipine, diltiazem, nifedipine Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral \nagent inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to increase the \nplasma concentrations of calcium channel antagonists.  Careful \nmonitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when \nthese medicines are concomitantly administered with ritonavir. \n \n\nEndothelin antagonists \n \n\nBosentan Co-administration of bosentan and ritonavir may increase steady state \nbosentan maximum concentr ations (Cmax) and area under the curve \n(AUC). \n \n\nRiociguat Serum concentrations may be increased due to CYP3A and P-gp inhibition by ritonavir.  The co-administration of riociguat with \nNorvir is not recommended (see section 4.4 and refer to riociguat \nSmPC). \n \n\nErgot Derivatives \n \n\nDihydroergotamine, ergonovine, \nergotamine, methylergonovine \n\nRitonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma \nconcentrations of ergot derivatives and is therefore contraindicated \n(see section 4.3). \n \n\nGI motility agent \n \n\nCisapride Ritonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma \nconcentrations of cisapride and is therefore contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3). \n \n\nHCV Direct Acting Antiviral  \nGlecaprevir/pibrentasvir Serum concentrations may be increased due to P-glycoprotein, BCRP \n\nand OATP1B inhibition by ritonavir. \n \nConcomitant administration of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and Norvir is \nnot recommended due to an increased risk of ALT elevations \nassociated with increased glecaprevir exposure. \n \n\nHCV Protease Inhibitor  \nSimeprevir 200 qd 100 q12h ↑ 7.2-fold ↑ 4.7-fold \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\nRitonavir effects on Non-antiretroviral Co-administered Medicinal Products \n\nCo-administered Medicinal Products Dose of Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts (mg) \n\nDose of \nNORVIR \n(mg) \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts AUC  \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts Cmax  \n\n Ritonavir increases plasma concentrations of simeprevir as a result of \nCYP3A4 inhibition.  It is not recommended to co-administer ritonavir \nwith simeprevir. \n \n\nHMG Co-A Reductase Inhibitors \n \n\nAtorvastatin, Fluvastatin, Lovastatin, \nPravstatin, Rosuvastatin, Simvastatin \n\nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors which are highly dependent on \nCYP3A metabolism, such as lovastatin and simvastatin, are expected \nto have markedly increased plasma concentrations when co-\nadministered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a \npharmacokinetic enhancer.  Since increased concentrations of \nlovastatin and simvastatin may predispose patients to myopathies, \nincluding rhabdomyolysis, the combination of these medicinal \nproducts with ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  \nAtorvastatin is less dependent on CYP3A for metabolism.  While \nrosuvastatin elimination is not dependent on CYP3A, an elevation of \nrosuvastatin exposure has been reported with ritonavir co-\nadministration.  The mechanism of this interaction is not clear, but \nmay be the result of transporter inhibition.  When used with ritonavir \ndosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent, the \nlowest possible doses of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin should be \nadministered.  The metabolism of pravastatin and fluvastatin is not \ndependent on CYP3A, and interactions are not expected with \nritonavir.  If treatment with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is \nindicated, pravastatin or fluvastatin is recommended. \n \n\nHormonal contraceptive \n \n\nEthinyl estradiol 50 µg, single \ndose  \n\n500 q12h ↓ 40%  ↓ 32%  \n\n Due to reductions in ethinyl estradiol concentrations, barrier or other \nnon-hormonal methods of contraception should be considered with \nconcomitant ritonavir use when dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as \na pharmacokinetic enhancer.  Ritonavir is likely to change the uterine \nbleeding profile and reduce the effectiveness of estradiol-containing \ncontraceptives (see section 4.4). \n \n\nImmunosupressants \n \n\nCyclosporine, tacrolimus, everolimus Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral \nagent inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to increase the \nplasma concentrations of cyclosporine, tacrolimus or everolimus.  \nCareful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is \nrecommended when these medicines are concomitantly administered \nwith ritonavir. \n \n\nLipid-modifying agents \n \n\nLomitapide CYP3A4 inhibitors increase the exposure of lomitapide, with strong \ninhibitors increasing exposure approximately 27-fold.  Due to \nCYP3A inhibition by ritonavir, concentrations of lomitapide are \nexpected to increase.  Concomitant use of Norvir with lomitapide is \ncontraindicated (see prescribing information for lomitapide) (see \nsection 4.3). \n \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\nRitonavir effects on Non-antiretroviral Co-administered Medicinal Products \n\nCo-administered Medicinal Products Dose of Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts (mg) \n\nDose of \nNORVIR \n(mg) \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts AUC  \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts Cmax  \n\nPhosphodiesterase (PDE5) \ninhibitors \n\n \n\nAvanafil 50, single dose 600 q12h ↑ 13-fold ↑ 2.4-fold \nConcomitant use of avanafil with ritonavir is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3). \n \n\nSildenafil 100, single dose  500 q12h ↑ 11-fold ↑ 4-fold \n Concomitant use of sildenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction \n\nwith ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic \nenhancer should be with caution and in no instance should sildenafil \ndoses exceed 25 mg in 48 hours (see also section 4.4).  Concomitant \nuse of sildenafil with ritonavir is contraindicated in pulmonary \narterial hypertension patients (see section 4.3). \n \n\nTadalafil 20, single dose  200 q12h  ↑ 124% ↔ \n The concomitant use of tadalafil for the treatment of erectile \n\ndysfunction with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a \npharmacokinetic enhancer should be with caution at reduced doses of \nno more than 10 mg tadalafil every 72 hours with increased \nmonitoring for adverse reactions (see section 4.4). \n \nWhen tadalafil is used concurrently with ritonavir in patients with \npulmonary arterial hypertension, refer to the tadalafil Summary of \nProduct Characteristics. \n\nVardenafil 5, single dose 600 q12h ↑ 49-fold ↑ 13-fold \n Concomitant use of vardenafil with ritonavir is contraindicated (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n \n\nSedatives/hypnotics \n \n\nClorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, \nflurazepam, oral and parenteral midazolam  \n\nRitonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma \nconcentrations of clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam and flurazepam \nand is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3).  \nMidazolam is extensively metabolised by CYP3A4.  \nCo-administration with Norvir may cause a large increase in the \nconcentration of this benzodiazepine.  No medicinal product \ninteraction study has been performed for the co-administration of \nNorvir with benzodiazepines.  Based on data for other CYP3A4 \ninhibitors, plasma concentrations of midazolam are expected to be \nsignificantly higher when midazolam is given orally.  Therefore, \nNorvir should not be co-administered with orally administered \nmidazolam (see section 4.3), whereas caution should be used with \nco-administration of Norvir and parenteral midazolam.  Data from \nconcomitant use of parenteral midazolam with other protease \ninhibitors suggest a possible 3 – 4 fold increase in midazolam plasma \nlevels.  If Norvir is co-administered with parenteral midazolam, it \nshould be done in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar setting \nwhich ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical \nmanagement in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged \nsedation.  Dosage adjustment for midazolam should be considered, \nespecially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered. \n \n\nTriazolam 0.125, single \ndose \n\n200, 4 doses ↑ > 20 fold ↑ 87% \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\nRitonavir effects on Non-antiretroviral Co-administered Medicinal Products \n\nCo-administered Medicinal Products Dose of Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts (mg) \n\nDose of \nNORVIR \n(mg) \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts AUC  \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts Cmax  \n\n Ritonavir co-administration is likely to result in increased plasma \nconcentrations of triazolam and is therefore contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3). \n \n\nPethidine  \n \nNorpethidine metabolite  \n\n50, oral single \ndose  \n\n500 q12h ↓ 62%  \n \n↑ 47%  \n\n↓ 59%  \n \n↑ 87%  \n\n The use of pethidine and ritonavir is contraindicated due to the \nincreased concentrations of the metabolite, norpethidine, which has \nboth analgesic and CNS stimulant activity.  Elevated norpethidine \nconcentrations may increase the risk of CNS effects (e.g., seizures), \nsee section 4.3. \n \n\nAlprazolam 1, single dose  200 q12h, 2 \ndays \n\n↑ 2.5 fold ↔ \n\n  500 q12h, 10 \ndays \n\n↓ 12%  ↓ 16%  \n\n Alprazolam metabolism was inhibited following the introduction of \nritonavir.  After ritonavir use for 10 days, no inhibitory effect of \nritonavir was observed.  Caution is warranted during the first several \ndays when alprazolam is co-administered with ritonavir dosed as an \nantiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, before \ninduction of alprazolam metabolism develops. \n \n\nBuspirone Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral \nagent inhibits CYP3A and as a result is expected to increase the \nplasma concentrations of buspirone.  Careful monitoring of \ntherapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when buspirone \nconcomitantly administered with ritonavir. \n \n\nSleeping agent  \n\nZolpidem 5  200, 4 doses ↑ 28% ↑ 22% \n Zolpidem and ritonavir may be co-administered with careful \n\nmonitoring for excessive sedative effects. \n \n\nSmoke cessation  \n\nBupropion 150  100 q12h ↓ 22% ↓ 21% \n 150  600 q12h ↓ 66% ↓ 62% \n Bupropion is primarily metabolised by CYP2B6.  Concurrent \n\nadministration of bupropion with repeated doses of ritonavir is \nexpected to decrease bupropion levels.  These effects are thought to \nrepresent induction of bupropion metabolism.  However, because \nritonavir has also been shown to inhibit CYP2B6 in vitro, the \nrecommended dose of bupropion should not be exceeded.  In contrast \nto long-term administration of ritonavir, there was no significant \ninteraction with bupropion after short-term administration of low \ndoses of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 2 days), suggesting \nreductions in bupropion concentrations may have onset several days \nafter initiation of ritonavir co-administration. \n \n\nSteroids  \n\nInhaled, injectable or intranasal fluticasone \npropionate, budesonide, triamcinolone \n\nSystemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and \nadrenal suppression (plasma cortisol levels were noted to be \ndecreased 86% in the above study) have been reported in patients \nreceiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasal fluticasone propionate; \n\n\n\n59 \n \n\nRitonavir effects on Non-antiretroviral Co-administered Medicinal Products \n\nCo-administered Medicinal Products Dose of Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts (mg) \n\nDose of \nNORVIR \n(mg) \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts AUC  \n\nEffect on Co-\nadministered \nMedicinal \nProducts Cmax  \n\nsimilar effects could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolised \nby CYP3A e.g., budesonide and triamcinolone.  Consequently, \nconcomitant administration of ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral \nagent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer and these glucocorticoids is \nnot recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs \nthe risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).  A dose \nreduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close \nmonitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a \nglucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g., \nbeclomethasone).  Moreover, in case of withdrawal of glucocorticoids \nprogressive dose reduction may be required over a longer period.     \n\nDexamethasone Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral \nagent inhibits CYP3A and as a result is expected to increase the \nplasma concentrations of dexamethasone.  Careful monitoring of \ntherapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when dexamethasone \nis concomitantly administered with ritonavir.   \n \n\nPrednisolone 20 200 q12h ↑ 28% ↑ 9% \n Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is \n\nrecommended when prednisolone is concomitantly administered with \nritonavir.  The AUC of the metabolite prednisolone increased by 37 \nand 28% after 4 and 14 days ritonavir, respectively. \n \n\nThyroid hormone replacement \ntherapy \n\n \n\nLevothyroxine Post-marketing cases have been reported indicating a potential \ninteraction between ritonavir containing products and levothyroxine.  \nThyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) should be monitored in patients \ntreated with levothyroxine at least the first month after starting and/or \nending ritonavir treatment. \n\n ND: Not determined \n1. Based on a parallel group comparison \n2. Sulfamethoxazole was co-administered with trimethoprim.  \n\n \nCardiac and neurologic events have been reported when ritonavir has been co-administered with \ndisopyramide, mexiletine or nefazodone.  The possibility of medicinal product interaction cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nIn addition to the interactions listed above, as ritonavir is highly protein bound, the possibility of \nincreased therapeutic and toxic effects due to protein binding displacement of concomitant medicinal \nproducts should be considered. \n \nRitonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer \n \nImportant information regarding medicinal product interactions when ritonavir is used a \npharmacokinetic enhancer is also contained in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the co-\nadministered protease inhibitor. \n \nProton pump inhibitors and H2-receptor antagonists \nProton pump inhibitors and H2-receptor antagonists (e.g. omeprazole or ranitidine) may reduce \nconcentrations for co-administered protease inhibitors.  For specific information regarding the impact \nof co-administration of acid reducing agents, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the \nco-administered protease inhibitor.  Based on interaction studies with the ritonavir boosted protease \ninhibitors (lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir), concurrent administration of omeprazole or ranitidine does \n\n\n\n60 \n \n\nnot significantly modify ritonavir efficacy as a pharmacokinetic enhancer despite a slight change of \nexposure (about 6 - 18%).  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nA large amount (6100 live births) of pregnant women were exposed to ritonavir during pregnancy; of \nthese, 2800 live births were exposed during the first trimester.  These data largely refer to exposures \nwhere ritonavir was used in combination therapy and not at therapeutic ritonavir doses but at lower \ndoses as a pharmacokinetic enhancer for other PIs.  These data indicate no increase in the rate of birth \ndefects compared to rates observed in population-based birth defect surveillance systems.  Animal data \nhave shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  Norvir can be used during pregnancy if clinically \nneeded. \n \nRitonavir adversely interacts with oral contraceptives (OCs).  Therefore, an alternative, effective and \nsafe method of contraception should be used during treatment. \n \nBreastfeeding \nLimited published data reports that ritonavir is present in human milk. \n \nThere is no information on the effects of ritonavir on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on \nmilk production.  Because of the potential for (1) HIV transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) \ndeveloping viral resistance (in HIV-postive infants) and (3) serious adverse reactions in a breastfed \ninfant,  HIV infected women should not breast feed their infants under any circumstances if they are \nreceiving Norvir.   \n \nFertility \nNo human data on the effect of ritonavir on fertility are available.  Animal studies do not indicate \nharmful effects of ritonavir on fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  Dizziness is a \nknown undesirable effect that should be taken into account when driving or using machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nRitonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer \n \nAdverse reactions associated with the use of ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer are dependent on \nthe specific co-administered PI.  For information on adverse reactions refer to the SPC of the specific \nco-administered PI. \n \nRitonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trials and post-marketing experience in adult patients \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse drug reactions among patients receiving ritonavir alone or in \ncombination with other antiretroviral drugs were gastrointestinal (including diarrhea, nausea, \nvomiting, abdominal pain (upper and lower)), neurological disturbances (including paresthesia and \noral paresthesia) and fatigue/asthenia. \n \n\n\n\n61 \n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity with possible or probable relationship \nto ritonavir have been reported.  Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in \norder of decreasing seriousness: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n(≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \nEvents noted as having frequency not known were identified via post-marketing surveillance. \n \n\nAdverse reactions  in clinical studies and post-marketing in adult patients \n\nSystem Order Class Frequency Adverse reaction \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nCommon \n \n\nDecreased white blood cells, decreased \nhaemoglobin, decreased neutrophils, \nincreased eosinophils, thrombocytopenia \n \n\nUncommon Increased neutrophils  \n \n\nImmune system disorders Common Hypersensitivity including urticaria, and \nface oedema \n \n\n Rare Anaphylaxis \n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nCommon Hypercholesterolaemia, \nhypertriglyceridaemia, gout, oedema and \nperipheral oedema, dehydration (usually \nassociated with gastrointestinal symptoms) \n\n Uncommon Diabetes mellitus  \n \n\n Rare Hyperglycaemia \n \n\nNervous system disorders Very common \n \n \n\nDysgeusia, oral and peripheral paraesthesia, \nheadache, dizziness, peripheral neuropathy \n \n\nCommon Insomnia, anxiety, confusion, disturbance in \nattention, syncope, seizure \n \n\nEye disorders Common Blurred vision \n \n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon Myocardial infarction \n \n\nVascular disorders Common Hypertension, hypotension including \northostatic hypotension, peripheral coldness \n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n \n\nVery common Pharyngitis, oropharyngeal pain, cough  \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common \n \n\nAbdominal pain (upper and lower), nausea, \ndiarrhoea (including severe with electrolyte \nimbalance), vomiting, dyspepsia \n \n\nCommon Anorexia, flatulence, mouth ulcer, \ngastrointestinal haemorrhage, \ngastroesophageal reflux disease, pancreatitis \n \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Common \n \n\nHepatitis (including increased AST, ALT, \nGGT), blood bilirubin increased (including \njaundice) \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nVery common Pruritus, rash (including erythematous and \nmaculopapular) \n \n\n \n \n\nCommon Acne \n\n Rare Stevens Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis (TEN) \n \n\nMusculosketal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nVery common \n \n\nArthralgia and back pain \n \n\nCommon Myositis, rhabdomyolysis, myalgia, \nmyopathy/CPK increased \n \n\nRenal and urinary disorders  Common Increased urination, renal impairment (e.g. \noliguria, elevated creatinine) \n \n\n Uncommon \n \n\nNot known \n\nAcute renal failure \n \nNephrolithiasis \n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders \n \n\nCommon \n \n\nMenorrhagia \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nVery common \n \n\nFatigue including asthenia, flushing, feeling \nhot \n \n\nCommon Fever, weight loss \n \n\nInvestigations Common \n \n\nIncreased amylase, decreased free and total \nthyroxin  \n \n\nUncommon Increased glucose, increased magnesium, \nincreased alkaline phosphatase \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nHepatic transaminase elevations exceeding five times the upper limit or normal, clinical hepatitis, and \njaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir alone or in combination with other \nantiretrovirals. \n \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section \n4.4). \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and can occur many months \nafter initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nPancreatitis has been observed in patients receiving ritonavir therapy, including those who developed \nhypertriglyceridemia.  In some cases fatalities have been observed.  Patients with advanced HIV \ndisease may be at risk of elevated triglycerides and pancreatitis (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n63 \n \n\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).  \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric populations \n \nThe safety profile of Norvir in children 2 years of age and older is similar to that seen in adults. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nHuman experience of acute overdose with ritonavir is limited.  One patient in clinical trials took \nritonavir 1500 mg/day for two days and reported paraesthesia, which resolved after the dose was \ndecreased.  A case of renal failure with eosinophilia has been reported. \n \nThe signs of toxicity observed in animals (mice and rats) included decreased activity, ataxia, dyspnoea \nand tremors. \n \nManagement \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with ritonavir.  Treatment of overdose with ritonavir should \nconsist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the \nclinical status of the patient.  Due to the solubility characteristics and possibility of transintestinal \nelimination, it is proposed that management of overdose could entail gastric lavage and administration \nof activated charcoal.  Since ritonavir is extensively metabolised by the liver and is highly protein \nbound, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of the medicine.   \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitors ATC code: J05AE03 \n \nRitonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer \n \nPharmacokinetic enhancement by ritonavir is based on ritonavir’s activity as a potent inhibitor of \nCYP3A- mediated metabolism.  The degree of enhancement is related to the metabolic pathway of the \nco-administered protease inhibitor and the impact of the co-administered protease inhibitor on the \nmetabolism of ritonavir.  Maximal inhibition of metabolism of the co-administered protease inhibitor \nis generally achieved with ritonavir doses of 100 mg daily to 200 mg twice daily, and is dependent on \nthe co-administered protease inhibitor.  For additional information on the effect of ritonavir on \nco-administered protease inhibitor metabolism, see section 4.5 and refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics of the particular co-administered PIs. \n \nRitonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent  \n \nRitonavir is an orally active peptidomimetic inhibitor of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 aspartyl proteases.  \nInhibition of HIV protease renders the enzyme incapable of processing the gag-pol polyprotein \nprecursor which leads to the production of HIV particles with immature morphology that are unable to \ninitiate new rounds of infection.  Ritonavir has selective affinity for the HIV protease and has little \ninhibitory activity against human aspartyl proteases. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n64 \n \n\n \nRitonavir was the first protease inhibitor (approved in 1996) for which efficacy was proven in a study \nwith clinical endpoints.  However, due to ritonavir’s metabolic inhibitory properties its use as a \npharmacokinetic enhancer of other protease inhibitors is the prevalent use of ritonavir in clinical \npractice (see section 4.2). \n \nEffects on the Electrocardiogram   \n \nQTcF interval was evaluated in a randomised, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily) \ncontrolled crossover study in 45 healthy adults, with 10 measurements over 12 hours on Day 3.  The \nmaximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference in QTcF from placebo was 5.5 (7.6) for \n400 mg twice daily ritonavir.  The Day 3 ritonavir exposure was approximately 1.5 fold higher than \nthat observed with the 600 mg twice daily dose at steady state.  No subject experienced an increase in \nQTcF of ≥ 60 msec from baseline or a QTcF interval exceeding the potentially clinically relevant \nthreshold of 500 msec. \n \nModest prolongation of the PR interval was also noted in subjects receiving ritonavir in the same study \non Day 3.  The mean changes from baseline in PR interval ranged from 11.0 to 24.0 msec in the 12 \nhour interval post dose.  Maximum PR interval was 252 msec and no second or third degree heart \nblock was observed (see section 4.4). \n \nResistance \n \nRitonavir-resistant isolates of HIV-1 have been selected in vitro and isolated from patients treated with \ntherapeutic doses of ritonavir.   \n \nReduction in the antiretroviral activity of ritonavir is primarily associated with the protease mutations \nV82A/F/T/S and I84V.  Accumulation of other mutations in the protease gene (including at positions \n20, 33, 36, 46, 54, 71, and 90) can also contribute to ritonavir resistance.  In general, as mutations \nassociated with ritonavir resistance accumulate, susceptibility to select other PIs may decrease due to \ncross-resistance.  The Summary of Product Characteristics of other protease inhibitors or official \ncontinuous updates should be consulted for specific information regarding protease mutations \nassociated with reduced response to these agents. \n \nClinical pharmacodynamic data \n \nThe effects of ritonavir (alone or combined with other antiretroviral agents) on biological markers of \ndisease activity such as CD4 cell count and viral RNA were evaluated in several studies involving \nHIV-1 infected patients.  The following studies are the most important. \n \nAdult Use \n \nA controlled study completed in 1996 with ritonavir as add-on therapy in HIV-1 infected patients \nextensively pre-treated with nucleoside analogues and baseline CD4 cell counts ≤ 100 cells/µl showed \na reduction in mortality and AIDS defining events.  The mean average change from baseline over 16 \nweeks for HIV RNA levels was -0.79 log10 (maximum mean decrease: 1.29 log10) in the ritonavir \ngroup versus -0.01 log10 in the control group.  The most frequently used nucleosides in this study were \nzidovudine, stavudine, didanosine and zalcitabine.  \n \nIn a study completed in 1996 recruiting less advanced HIV-1 infected patients (CD4 200-500 cells/µl) \nwithout previous antiretroviral therapy, ritonavir in combination with zidovudine or alone reduced \nviral load in plasma and increased CD4 count.  The mean average change from baseline over 48 weeks \nfor HIV RNA levels was -0.88 log10 in the ritonavir group versus -0.66 log10 in the ritonavir + \nzidovudine group versus -0.42 log10 in the zidovudine group. \n \nThe continuation of ritonavir therapy should be evaluated by viral load because of the possibility of \nthe emergence of resistance as described under section 4.1. \n\n\n\n65 \n \n\n \nPaediatric Use \n \nIn an open label trial completed in 1998 in HIV infected, clinically stable children there was a \nsignificant difference (p = 0.03) in the detectable RNA levels in favour of a triple regimen (ritonavir, \nzidovudine and lamivudine) following 48 weeks treatment. \n \nIn a study completed in 2003, 50 HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitor and lamivudine naïve children age \n4 weeks to 2 years received ritonavir 350 or 450 mg/m2 every 12 hours co-administered with \nzidovudine 160 mg/m2 every 8 hours and lamivudine 4 mg/kg every 12 hours.  In intent to treat \nanalyses, 72% and 36% of patients achieved reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA of ≤ 400 copies/ml at \nWeek 16 and 104, respectively.  Response was similar in both dosing regimens and across patient age.   \n \nIn a study completed in 2000, 76 HIV-1 infected children aged 6 months to 12 years who were \nprotease inhibitor naive and naive to lamivudine and/or stavudine received ritonavir 350 or 450 mg/m2 \nevery 12 hours co-administered with lamivudine and stavudine.  In intent to treat analyses, 50% and \n57% of patients in the 350 and 450 mg/m2 dose groups, respectively, achieved reduction in plasma \nHIV-1 RNA to ≤ 400 copies/ml at Week 48. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nThere is no parenteral formulation of ritonavir, therefore the extent of absorption and absolute \nbioavailability have not been determined.  The pharmacokinetics of ritonavir during multiple dose \nregimens were studied in non-fasting HIV-infected adult volunteers.  Upon multiple dosing, ritonavir \naccumulation is slightly less than predicted from a single dose due to a time and dose-related increase \nin apparent clearance (Cl/F).  Trough concentrations of ritonavir decrease over time, possibly due to \nenzyme induction, but appeared to stabilise by the end of 2 weeks.  The time to maximum \nconcentration (Tmax) remained constant at approximately 4 hours with increasing dose.  Renal \nclearance averaged less than 0.1 l/h and was relatively constant throughout the dosage range. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic parameters observed with various dosing schemes of ritonavir alone are shown \nin the table below.  Plasma concentrations of ritonavir after administration of a single 100 mg dose \ntablet are similar to the 100 mg soft gelatin capsule under fed conditions. \n \n\nRitonavir Dosing Regimen \n\n 100 mg   once \ndaily \n\n100 mg twice \ndaily1 \n\n200 mg once \ndaily \n\n200 mg twice \ndaily \n\n600 mg twice \ndaily \n\nCmax (µg/ml) 0.84 ± 0.39 0.89 3.4 ± 1.3 4.5 ± 1.3 11.2 ± 3.6 \nCtrough (µg/ml) 0.08 ± 0.04 0.22 0.16 ± 0.10 0.6 ± 0.2 3.7 ± 2.6 \nAUC12 or 24 \n(µg•h/ml) \n\n6.6 ± 2.4 6.2 20.0 ± 5.6 21.92 ± 6.48 77.5 ± 31.5 \n\nt½ (h) ~5 ~5 ~4 ~8 ~3 to 5 \nCl/F (L/h) 17.2 ± 6.6 16.1 10.8 ± 3.1 10.0 ± 3.2 8.8 ± 3.2 \n\n1 Values expressed as geometric means.  Note: ritonavir was dosed after a meal for all listed regimens. \n \nEffects of food on oral absorption \nFood slightly decreases the bioavailability of the Norvir tablet.  Administration of a single 100 mg \ndose of Norvir tablet with a moderate fat meal (857 kcal, 31% calories from fat) or a high fat meal \n(907 kcal, 52% calories from fat) was associated with a mean decrease of 20-23% in ritonavir AUC \nand Cmax. \n \nDistribution \nThe apparent volume of distribution (VB/F) of ritonavir is approximately 20 - 40 l after a single \n600 mg dose.  The protein binding of ritonavir in human plasma is approximately 98 - 99% and is \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\nconstant over the concentration range of 1.0 – 100 µg/ml.  Ritonavir binds to both human alpha 1-acid \nglycoprotein (AAG) and human serum albumin (HSA) with comparable affinities. \n \nTissue distribution studies with 14C-labelled ritonavir in rats showed the liver, adrenals, pancreas, \nkidneys and thyroid to have the highest concentrations of ritonavir.  Tissue to plasma ratios of \napproximately 1 measured in rat lymph nodes suggests that ritonavir distributes into lymphatic tissues.  \nRitonavir penetrates minimally into the brain. \n \nBiotransformation \nRitonavir was noted to be extensively metabolised by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system, primarily \nby the CYP3A isozyme family and to a lesser extent by the CYP2D6 isoform.  Animal studies as well \nas in vitro experiments with human hepatic microsomes indicated that ritonavir primarily underwent \noxidative metabolism.  Four ritonavir metabolites have been identified in man.  The isopropylthiazole \noxidation metabolite (M-2) is the major metabolite and has antiviral activity similar to that of parent \ncompound.  However, the AUC of the M-2 metabolite was approximately 3% of the AUC of parent \ncompound.   \n \nLow doses of ritonavir have shown profound effects on the pharmacokinetics of other protease \ninhibitors (and other products metabolised by CYP3A4) and other protease inhibitors may influence \nthe pharmacokinetics of ritonavir (see section 4.5).   \n \nElimination \nHuman studies with radiolabelled ritonavir demonstrated that the elimination of ritonavir was \nprimarily via the hepatobiliary system; approximately 86% of radiolabel was recovered from stool, \npart of which is expected to be unabsorbed ritonavir.  In these studies renal elimination was not found \nto be a major route of elimination of ritonavir.  This was consistent with the observations in animal \nstudies. \n \nSpecial populations   \n \nNo clinically significant differences in AUC or Cmax were noted between males and females.  \nRitonavir pharmacokinetic parameters were not statistically significantly associated with body weight \nor lean body mass.  Ritonavir plasma exposures in patients 50 – 70 years of age when dosed 100 mg in \ncombination with lopinavir or at higher doses in the absence of other protease inhibitors is similar to \nthat observed in younger adults. \n \nPatients with impaired liver function \nAfter multiple dosing of ritonavir to healthy volunteers (500 mg twice daily) and subjects with mild to \nmoderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class A and B, 400 mg twice daily) exposure to ritonavir \nafter dose normalisation was not significantly different between the two groups.   \n \nPatients with impaired renal function \nRitonavir pharmacokinetic parameters have not been studied in patients with renal impairment.  \nHowever, since the renal clearance of ritonavir is negligible, no changes in the total body clearance are \nexpected in patients with renal impairment. \n \nPaediatric patients \nRitonavir steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in HIV infected children above 2 \nyears of age receiving doses ranging from 250 mg/m² twice daily to 400 mg/m² twice daily.  Ritonavir \nconcentrations obtained after 350 to 400 mg/m² twice daily in paediatric patients were comparable to \nthose obtained in adults receiving 600 mg (approximately 330 mg/m²) twice daily.  Across dose \ngroups, ritonavir oral clearance (CL/F/m2) was approximately 1.5 to 1.7 times faster in paediatric \npatients above 2 years of age than in adult subjects. \n \nRitonavir steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in HIV infected children less than \n2 years of age receiving doses ranging from 350 to 450 mg/m² twice daily.  Ritonavir concentrations in \nthis study were highly variable and somewhat lower than those obtained in adults receiving 600 mg \n\n\n\n67 \n \n\n(approximately 330 mg/m²) twice daily.  Across dose groups, ritonavir oral clearance (CL/F/m2) \ndeclined with age with median values of 9.0 L/h/m2 in children less than 3 months of age, 7.8 L/h/m2 \nin children between 3 and 6 months of age and 4.4 L/h/m2 in children between 6 and 24 months of age. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeated dose toxicity studies in animals identified major target organs as the liver, retina, thyroid \ngland and kidney.  Hepatic changes involved hepatocellular, biliary and phagocytic elements and were \naccompanied by increases in hepatic enzymes.  Hyperplasia of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) \nand retinal degeneration have been seen in all of the rodent studies conducted with ritonavir, but have \nnot been seen in dogs.  Ultrastructural evidence suggests that these retinal changes may be secondary \nto phospholipidosis.  However, clinical trials revealed no evidence of medicinal product-induced \nocular changes in humans.  All thyroid changes were reversible upon discontinuation of ritonavir.  \nClinical investigation in humans has revealed no clinically significant alteration in thyroid function \ntests.  Renal changes including tubular degeneration, chronic inflammation and proteinurea were noted \nin rats and are felt to be attributable to species-specific spontaneous disease.  Furthermore, no \nclinically significant renal abnormalities were noted in clinical trials. \n \nDevelopmental toxicity observed in rats (embryolethality, decreased foetal body weight and \nossification delays and visceral changes, including delayed testicular descent) occurred mainly at a \nmaternally toxic dosage.  Developmental toxicity in rabbits (embryolethality, decreased litter size and \ndecreased foetal weights) occurred at a maternally toxic dosage. \n \nRitonavir was not found to be mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays \nincluding the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay using S. typhimurium and E. coli, the mouse \nlymphoma assay, the mouse micronucleus test and chromosomal aberration assays in human \nlymphocytes. \n \nLong term carcinogenicity studies of ritonavir in mice and rats revealed tumourigenic potential \nspecific for these species, but are regarded as of no relevance for humans. \n \n \n6.

What Norvir is and what it is used for \n \nNorvir contains the active substance ritonavir.  Norvir is a protease inhibitor used to control HIV \ninfection.  Norvir is used in combination with other anti-HIV medicines (antiretrovirals) to control \nyour HIV infection.  Your doctor will discuss with you the best combination of medicines for you \n \nNorvir is used by children 2 years of age or older, adolescents and adults who are infected with HIV, \nthe virus which causes AIDS.   \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you or your child takes Norvir \n \nDo not take Norvir \n \n− if you are allergic to ritonavir or any of the other ingredients of Norvir (see section 6).  \n \n− if you have severe liver disease. \n \n− if you are currently taking any of the following medicines: \n\n− astemizole or terfenadine (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms – these medicines \nmay be available without prescription); \n\n− amiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, encainide, flecainide, propafenone, quinidine (used to \ncorrect irregular heartbeats); \n\n− dihydroergotamine, ergotamine (used to treat migraine headache); \n− ergonovine, methylergonovine (used to stop excessive bleeding that may occur following \n\nchildbirth or an abortion); \n− clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flurazepam, triazolam or oral (taken by mouth) \n\nmidazolam (used to help you sleep and/or relieve anxiety); \n− clozapine, pimozide, (used to treat abnormal thoughts or feelings); \n− quetiapine (used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder); \n− lurasidone (used to treat depression); \n− ranolazine (used to treat chronic chest pain [angina]); \n− pethidine, piroxicam, propoxyphene (used to relieve pain); \n\n\n\n86 \n \n\n− cisapride (used to relieve certain stomach problems); \n− rifabutin (used to prevent/treat certain infections)*; \n− voriconazole (used to treat fungal infections)*; \n− simvastatin, lovastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol); \n− neratinib (used to treat breast cancer); \n− lomitapide (used to lower blood cholesterol); \n− alfuzosin (used to treat enlarged prostate gland); \n− fusidic acid (used to treat bacterial infections); \n− sildenafil if you suffer from a lung disease called pulmonary arterial hypertension that \n\nmakes breathing difficult.  Patients without this disease may use sildenafil for impotence \n(erectile dysfunction) under their doctor’s supervision (see the section on Other \nmedicines and Norvir);  \n\n− avanafil or vardenafil (used to treat erectile dysfunction);  \n− colchicine (used to treat gout) if you have kidney and/or liver problems (see the section \n\non Other medicines and Norvir); \n− products containing St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) as this may stop Norvir from \n\nworking properly.  St John’s wort is often used in herbal medicines that you can buy \nyourself. \n\n \n*   Your doctor may decide that you can take rifabutin and/or voriconazole with a booster (lower dose) \n\nof Norvir but a full dose of Norvir must not be taken together with these two medicines.  \n \nIf you are currently taking any of these medicines, ask your doctor about switching to a different \nmedicine while you are taking Norvir.  \n \nAlso read the list of medicines under ‘Other medicines and Norvir’ for use with certain other \nmedicines which require special care. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Norvir. \n \nImportant information \n \n- If Norvir is taken in combination with other antiretroviral medicines, it is important that you \n\nalso carefully read the leaflets that are provided with these other medicines.  There may be \nadditional information in those leaflets about situations when Norvir should be avoided.  If you \nhave any further questions about Norvir (ritonavir) or the other medicines prescribed, please ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist. \n\n- Norvir is not a cure for HIV infection or AIDS. \n- People taking Norvir may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV \n\ninfection or AIDS.  It is therefore important that you remain under the supervision of your \ndoctor while taking Norvir. \n\n− You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective \nantiretroviral therapy.  Discuss with your physician the precautions needed to avoid infecting \nother people. \n\n \nTell your doctor if you have/had: \n \n- A history of liver disease.   \n- Hepatitis B or C and are being treated with a combination of antiretroviral agents, as you are at \n\na greater risk of a severe and potentially life threatening reaction because of the effect on the \nliver.  Regular blood tests may be required to check your liver is working properly. \n\n- Haemophilia, as there have been reports of increased bleeding in patients with haemophilia who \nare taking this type of medicine (protease inhibitors).  The reason for this is not known.  You \n\n\n\n87 \n \n\nmay need additional medicine to help your blood clot (factor VIII), in order to control any \nbleeding. \n\n- Erectile dysfunction, as the medicines used to treat erectile dysfunction can cause hypotension \nand prolonged erection. \n\n- Diabetes, as there have been reports of worsening of or the development of diabetes (diabetes \nmellitus) in some patients taking protease inhibitors. \n\n- Kidney (renal) disease, since your doctor may need to check the dose of your other medicines \n(such as protease inhibitors). \n\n \nTell your doctor if you experience: \n \n- Diarrhoea or vomiting that is not improving (persistent), as this may reduce how well the \n\nmedicines you are taking work. \n- Feeling sick (nausea), vomiting or have stomach pain, because these may be signs of \n\ninflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis).  Some patients taking Norvir can develop serious \nproblems with their pancreas.  Tell your doctor as soon as possible if this applies to you. \n\n- Symptoms of infection – inform your doctor immediately.  Some patients with advanced HIV \ninfection (AIDS) who then start anti-HIV treatment may develop the symptoms of infections \nthey have had in the past even if they didn’t know they had had them.  It is believed that this \nhappens because the body's immune response improves and helps the body to fight these \ninfections. \nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \nfor the treatment of your HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after \nthe start of treatment.  If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as \nmuscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of \nthe body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek \nnecessary treatment. \n\n- Joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty \nmoving, tell your doctor, as this may be a sign of a problem that can destroy bone \n(osteonecrosis).  Some patients taking a number of antiretroviral medicines may develop this \ndisease.  \n\n- Muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly in combination with antiretroviral therapy \nincluding protease inhibitors and nucleoside analogues.  On rare occasions these muscle \ndisorders have been serious. (See section 4. Possible side effects) \n\n- Dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting spells or abnormal heartbeat.  Some patients taking \nNorvir may experience changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG).  Tell your doctor if you have a \nheart defect or conduction defect. \n\n- If you have any other health concerns, discuss these with your doctor as soon as you can. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nNorvir is not recommended in children below 2 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Norvir \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.  There are some medicines you cannot \ntake at all with Norvir.  These are listed earlier in section 2, under ‘Do not take Norvir’.  There are \nsome other medicines that can only be used under certain circumstances as described below. \n \nThe following warnings apply when Norvir is taken as a full dose.  However, these warnings may also \napply when Norvir is used in lower doses (a booster) with other medicines.  \n \n\n\n\n88 \n \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines listed below, as special care should be \ntaken. \n \n- Sildenafil or tadalafil for impotence (erectile dysfunction).   \n\nThe dose and/or frequency of use of these medicines may need to be reduced to avoid \nhypotension and prolonged erection.  You must not take Norvir with sildenafil if you suffer from \npulmonary arterial hypertension (see also section 2. What you need to know before you or \nyour child takes Norvir).  Tell your doctor if you are taking tadalafil for pulmonary arterial \nhypertension. \n\n- Colchicine (for gout) as Norvir may raise the blood levels of this medicine.  You must not take \nNorvir with colchicine if you have kidney and/or liver problems (see also ‘Do not take Norvir’ \nabove). \n\n- Digoxin (heart medicine).  Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of digoxin and monitor you \nwhile you are taking digoxin and Norvir in order to avoid heart problems. \n\n- Hormonal contraceptives containing ethinyl oestradiol as Norvir may reduce the effectiveness \nof these medicines.  It is recommended that a condom or other non-hormonal method of \ncontraception is used instead.  You may also notice irregular uterine bleeding if you are taking \nthis type of hormonal contraceptive with Norvir. \n\n- Atorvastatin or rosuvastatin (for high cholesterol) as Norvir may raise the blood levels of \nthese medicines.  Talk to your doctor before you take any cholesterol-reducing medicines with \nNorvir (see also ‘Do not take Norvir’ above). \n\n- Steroids (e.g. dexamethasone, fluticasone propionate, prednisolone, triamcinolone) as Norvir \nmay raise the blood levels of these medicines which may lead to Cushing’s syndrome \n(development of a rounded face) and reduce production of the hormone cortisol.  Your doctor \nmay wish to reduce the steroid dose or monitor your side effects more closely. \n\n- Trazodone (a medicine for depression) as, unwanted effects like nausea, dizziness, low blood \npressure and fainting can occur when taken with Norvir.  \n\n- Rifampicin and saquinavir (used for tuberculosis and HIV, respectively) as serious liver \ndamage can occur when taken with Norvir. \n\n- Bosentan, riociguat (used for pulmonary arterial hypertension) as Norvir may increase the \nblood levels of this medicine. \n\n \nThere are medicines that may not mix with Norvir because their effects could increase or decrease \nwhen taken together.  In some cases your doctor may need to perform certain tests, change the dose or \nmonitor you regularly.  This is why you should tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines, \nincluding those you have bought yourself or herbal products, but it is especially important to mention \nthese:  \n \n- amphetamine or amphetamine derivatives; \n- antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin);  \n- anticancer treatments (e.g. abemaciclib, afatinib, apalutamide, ceritinib, encorafenib, dasatinib, \n\nibrutinib, nilotinib, venetoclax, vincristine, vinblastine); \n- medicines used to treat low blood platelet count (e.g. fostamatinib); \n- anticoagulants (e.g. rivaroxaban, vorapaxar, warfarin); \n- antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine, fluoxetine, imipramine, nefazodone, \n\nnortriptyline, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone); \n- antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole);  \n- antihistamines (e.g. loratadine, fexofenadine);  \n- antiretroviral medicines, including HIV-protease inhibitors (amprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, \n\nfosamprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, tipranavir), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors (NNRTI) (delavirdine, efavirenz, nevirapine), and others (didanosine, maraviroc, \nraltegravir, zidovudine);  \n\n- anti-tuberculosis medicine (bedaquiline and delamanid); \n- antiviral medicine used to treat chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults (e.g. \n\nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir and simeprevir); \n- anxiety medicine, buspirone;  \n- asthma medicine, theophylline, salmeterol;  \n\n\n\n89 \n \n\n- atovaquone, a medicine used to treat a certain type of pneumonia and malaria; \n- buprenorphine, a medicine used for the treatment of chronic pain; \n- bupropion, a medicine used to help you stop smoking; \n- epilepsy medicines (e.g. carbamazepine, divalproex, lamotrigine, phenytoin); \n- heart medicines (e.g. disopyramide, mexiletine and calcium channel antagonists such as \n\namlodipine, diltiazem and nifedipine);  \n- immune system medicines (e.g. cyclosporine, tacrolimus, everolimus);  \n- levothyroxine (used to treat thyroid problems); \n- morphine and morphine-like medicines used to treat severe pain (e.g. methadone, fentanyl); \n- sleeping pills (e.g. alprazolam, zolpidem) and also midazolam administered by injection;  \n- tranquillisers (e.g. haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine);  \n- colchicine, a treatment for gout. \n \nThere are some medicines you cannot take at all with Norvir.  These are listed earlier in section 2, \nunder ‘Do not take Norvir’. \n \nTaking Norvir with food and drink \n \nSee section 3. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a \nbaby, it is very important that you ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nThere is a large amount of information on the use of ritonavir (the active ingredient in Norvir) during \npregnancy.  In general, pregnant mothers received ritonavir after the first three months of pregnancy at \na lower dose (booster) along with other protease inhibitors.  Norvir did not appear to increase the \nchance of developing birth defects compared to the general population. \n \nNorvir can pass into breast milk.  To avoid transmitting the infection, mothers with HIV must not \nbreast feed their babies. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nNorvir can cause dizziness.  If you are affected do not drive or use machinery.  \n \n \n3. How to take Norvir \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you.  Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  Take this medicine one or two times a day every day with food.  \n \nFor doses of exactly 100 mg amounts (100, 200, 300, 400, 500, or 600 mg) pour the entire content of \neach sachet over soft food (apple sauce or vanilla pudding) or mix with a small amount of liquid \n(water, chocolate milk, or infant formula) and consume entire serving.  \n \nFor doses less than 100 mg amounts or doses between 100 mg amounts, the content of the entire \nsachet is to be mixed with a liquid and then dosed by the appropriate ml volume as told to you \nby your doctor using the oral dosing syringe.   \n \nFor administration using a feeding tube follow the instructions in section ‘How do I take the correct \ndose of Norvir powder for oral suspension mixed with liquid?’  Use water to mix the medicine and \nfollow the feeding tube instructions to administer the medicine. \n \n\n\n\n90 \n \n\nRecommended doses of Norvir are: \n \n• if Norvir is used to boost the effects of other anti-HIV medicines, the typical dose for adults is 1 \n\nor 2 sachets once or twice daily.  For more detailed dose recommendations, including those for \nchildren, see the Package Leaflet of the anti-HIV medicines Norvir is given in combination \nwith. \n \n\n• if your doctor prescribes a full dose, adults may be started on a dose of 3 sachets in the morning \nand 3 sachets 12 hours later, gradually increasing over a period of up to 14 days to the full dose \nof 6 sachets twice daily.  Children (2 – 12 years of age) will start with a dose smaller than this \nand continue up to the maximum allowed for their size.   \n\n \nYour doctor will advise you on the dosage to be taken. \n \nNorvir should be taken every day to help control your HIV, no matter how much better you feel.  If a \nside effect is preventing you from taking Norvir, tell your doctor straight away.  During episodes of \ndiarrhoea your doctor may decide that extra monitoring is needed. \n \nAlways keep enough Norvir on hand so you don't run out.  When you travel or need to stay in the \nhospital, make sure you have enough Norvir to last until you can get a new supply. \n \nNorvir powder for oral suspension has a lingering aftertaste.  Eating peanut butter, hazelnut chocolate \nspread, or black currant syrup immediately after taking the medication may help clear the aftertaste \nfrom your mouth.  \n \nPrepare only one dose at a time using the correct number of sachets.  When mixing the powder with \nfood or liquid, be sure to take the whole dose within 2 hours.  Do not mix Norvir with anything else \nwithout talking to your doctor or pharmacist.   \n \nHow do I take the correct dose of Norvir powder for oral suspension mixed with food (full \nsachet)?  \n \nFollow the instructions below: \n\n \n\nStep 1. Before mixing dose of Norvir, collect the \nfollowing supplies: (see Figure 1). \n \nStep 2. Check prescription for number of sachets \nor call your doctor or pharmacist. \n\nFigure 1  \n\n \nStep 3. Before first using the mixing cup, wash the cup in warm water and dish soap. Rinse and allow \nto air dry. \n \n\n\n\n91 \n \n\n \n\nStep 4. Put a small serving of soft food (applesauce or \nvanilla pudding) in a cup (see Figure 2). \n\nFigure 2  \n\n \n\nStep 5. Tear open sachet (see Figure 3). \n \n\n \nFigure 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStep 6. Pour ALL powder from sachet onto food (see \nFigure 4).  \n \n\n \nFigure 4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStep 7. Mix thoroughly (see Figure 5). \n \n\n \nFigure 5 \n\n \n\nStep 8. Feed serving to patient. \n\n\n\n92 \n \n\n \n\nStep 9. ENTIRE serving must be eaten (see Figure 6). If \npowder residue is left, add more spoonfuls of food and \nserve to patient. Use within 2 hours. \n \n\n \nFigure 6 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nStep 10. Place empty sachet in rubbish. Wash and dry \npreparation area. Immediately wash the spoon and cup in \nwarm water and dish soap (see Figure 7). Rinse and \nallow to air dry. \n \n\n \nFigure 7 \n\n \n\n \nHow do I take the correct dose of Norvir powder for oral suspension mixed with liquid?  \n \nFollow the instructions below: \n\n \n\nFigure 1 \n\nWhat you need \n \nBefore mixing a dose of Norvir, collect the items \nshown in Figure 1. \n \nYou may need more than 1 sachet for each dose. \nCheck the prescription label on the carton or call \nyour doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. If \nyou do need more than 1 sachet, repeat all the \nsteps with each sachet.  \n\n \n\nUsing the syringe \nBefore first using the dosing syringe, wash the \nsyringe in warm water and dish soap. Rinse and \nallow to air dry. \n \nReading the scale \na. Each millilitre (ml) is shown as a number \n\nwith a big line. \nb. Each 0.2 ml is shown as a smaller line \n\nbetween the numbers.  \n \nCheck the syringe before each use \nYou will need to use a new syringe if: \n• you cannot clean the syringe \n• you cannot read the scale \n\n\n\n93 \n \n\n• you cannot move the plunger \n• the syringe is damaged or leaking. \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 \n\nStep 1. Fill the syringe \n \na. Push the plunger all the way into syringe. \nb. Place the syringe tip into the liquid. \nc. Slowly pull the plunger back to the 10 ml mark \non the syringe (see Figure 2). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 \n\nStep 2. Move any bubbles to the tip of the \nsyringe \n \na. Hold the syringe with the tip pointing up. \nb. Tap the syringe with your \nother hand. This will move any bubbles to the tip.  \nc. Pull the plunger down. \nBe careful not to pull the plunger out. \nd. Tap the syringe again. This will help to break \nup the bubbles and make sure they are all at the \ntip (see Figure 3). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 \n\nStep 3. Measure the liquid \n \na. Keep the syringe pointed up. \nb. Slowly push the plunger up until the top of the \nplunger is at 9.4 ml - this will remove any bubbles \nfrom the syringe (see Figure 4). \n\n \n\nFigure 5 \n\nStep 4. Empty the syringe \n\na. Slowly push the plunger to empty the liquid \nfrom the syringe into the mixing cup (see Figure \n5). \n\n \n\nFigure 6 \n\nStep 5. Pour the powder into the cup \n \na. Tear open the sachet. \nb. Pour all of the powder into the mixing cup. \nc. Check if the sachet is empty. \n\nBe careful not to spill any powder outside of \nthe mixing cup (see Figure 6). \n\n\n\n94 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 7 \n\nStep 6. Mix the powder and liquid \n \na.Tightly screw on the lid and keep shaking the \nmixing cup hard for at least 90 seconds until all \nthe lumps have gone. \nb. Check for any lumps of powder. If there are \nstill lumps, keep shaking until they have all gone.   \nc. The liquid may look cloudy - this is okay. \nd. Let the liquid stand for 10 minutes and most of \nthe bubbles will disappear. \ne. You may see some small bubbles on top of the \nliquid - this is also okay (see Figure 7). \n\n \n\nFigure 8 \n\nStep 7. Fill the syringe \n \na. Push the plunger completely into the syringe. \nb. Place the syringe tip at the bottom of the \nmixing cup. \nc. Slowly pull the plunger back to the 10 ml mark \n- try not to pull any bubbles into the syringe (see \nFigure 8). \n\n \n\nFigure 9 \n\nStep 8. Remove any bubbles \n \na. Hold the syringe with the tip pointing up. \nb. Tap the syringe with your other hand. This will \nmove any bubbles to the tip. \nc. Pull the plunger down. Be careful not to pull \nthe plunger out. \nd. Tap the syringe again to break up the bubbles \nso they are all at the tip (see Figure 9). \ne. Slowly push the plunger until you see a small \namount of liquid at the tip of the syringe. \nf. If there are any large air bubbles, empty the \nliquid from the syringe into the mixing cup and \nstart again from Step 7. \n\n\n\n95 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 10 \n\nStep 9. Measure the dose \n \na. Check the prescription label on the carton for \nthe dose in ml. If you are not sure, call your \ndoctor or pharmacist. \nb. Point the syringe into the mixing cup and \nslowly push the plunger to the correct ml for the \ndose (see Figure 10). \nc. If you push out too much liquid, start again \nfrom Step 7. Be careful not to spill the liquid \noutside of the mixing cup. \n \n\n \n\nFigure 11 \n\nStep 10. Give the medicine to the patient \n \na. Place the syringe tip against the inside of the \npatient’s cheek. \nb. Slowly push the plunger to give all of the dose \n(see Figure 11). \nc. Give the patient the full dose within 2 hours of \nopening the sachet. \n\n \n\n \nStep 11. (If required) \n \nIf you need to use more than one sachet, repeat the \nprocess from the beginning. \n \n\n \nStep 12. After you have finished \n \na. Place the empty sachet and any left over \nmedicine from the mixing cup into a rubbish bag. \nb. Remove the plunger from the syringe. \nc. Hand wash the syringe, plunger, and mixing \ncup and lid in warm water and dish soap. Rinse \nwith water and allow to air dry. Do not wash these \nin the dishwasher. \nd. Wash and dry the area used to mix the \nmedicine. \n\n \nIf you take more Norvir than you should \n \nNumbness, tingling, or a “pins and needles” sensation may occur if you take too much Norvir.  If you \nrealise you have taken more Norvir than you were supposed to, contact your doctor or the Accident \nand Emergency Department of your nearest hospital straight away.  \n \nIf you forget to take Norvir \n \nIf you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as possible.  If it is nearly time for the next dose, just \ntake that one.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\n\n\n96 \n \n\nIf you stop taking Norvir \n \nEven if you feel better, do not stop taking Norvir without talking to your doctor.  Taking Norvir as \nrecommended should give you the best chance of delaying resistance to the medicines. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nLike all medicines, Norvir can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  Also, the side \neffects of Norvir when used with other antiretroviral medicines are dependent on the other medicines.  \nSo it is important that you carefully read the side effects section of the leaflets that are provided with \nthese other medicines. \n \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n \n• upper or lower stomach ache \n\n  \n• vomiting  \n• diarrhoea (may be severe)  \n• feeling sick (nausea) \n• flushing, feeling hot  \n• headache  \n• dizziness \n• pain in the throat \n• cough \n• upset stomach or indigestion  \n\n• a tingling sensation or numbness in  \nthe hands, feet or around the lips and \nmouth \n\n• feeling weak/tired \n• bad taste in the mouth \n• damage to the nerves that can cause \n\nweakness and pain \n• itching \n• rash \n• joint pain and back pain \n\n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people   \n \n• allergic reactions including skin  \n\nrashes (may be red, raised, itchy),  \nsevere swelling of the skin and  \nother tissues \n\n• inability to sleep (insomnia) \n• anxiety \n• increase in cholesterol \n• increase in triglycerides \n• gout \n• stomach bleeding \n• inflammation of the liver and yellowing of \n\nskin or whites of the eyes \n• increase in urination \n• reduced kidney function \n• seizures (fits) \n• low levels of blood platelets \n• thirst (dehydration) \n• abnormally heavy periods \n\n• wind (flatulence) \n• loss of appetite \n• mouth ulcer \n• muscle aches (pain), tenderness or \n\nweakness \n• fever \n• weight loss \n• laboratory test results: \n\nchanges in blood test results  \n(such as blood chemistry and  \nblood count) \n\n• confusion \n• difficulty paying attention \n• fainting \n• blurred vision \n• swelling of the hands and feet \n• high blood pressure \n• low blood pressure and feeling faint when \n\ngetting up \n• coldness in the hands and feet \n• acne \n\n \n\n\n\n97 \n \n\nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n \n• heart attack  \n• diabetes \n\n• kidney failure \n\n \nRare: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people \n \n• severe or life threatening skin  \n\nreaction including blisters \n(Stevens Johnson syndrome, toxic \nepidermal necrolysis) \n\n• serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) \n• high levels of sugar in the blood \n\n \nNot known: frequency cannot be estimated from the available data \n \n• kidney stones \n \nTell your doctor if you feel sick (nauseous), are vomiting, or have stomach pain, because these may be \nsigns of an inflamed pancreas.  Also tell your doctor if you experience joint stiffness, aches and pains \n(especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty moving, as this may be a sign of \nosteonecrosis.  See also section 2.

You may need to read it again. \n− If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n− This medicine has been prescribed for you.  Do not pass it on to others.  It may harm them, even \n\nif their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n− If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet.  See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What Norvir is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you or your child takes Norvir \n3. How to take Norvir \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Norvir \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Norvir is and what it is used for \n \nNorvir contains the active substance ritonavir.  Norvir is a protease inhibitor used to control HIV \ninfection.  Norvir is used in combination with other anti-HIV medicines (antiretrovirals) to control \nyour HIV infection.  Your doctor will discuss with you the best combination of medicines for you. \n \nNorvir is used by children 2 years of age or older, adolescents and adults who are infected with HIV, \nthe virus which causes AIDS.   \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you or your child takes Norvir \n \nDo not take Norvir \n \n− if you are allergic to ritonavir or any of the other ingredients of Norvir (see section 6).  \n \n− if you have severe liver disease. \n \n− if you are currently taking any of the following medicines: \n\n− astemizole or terfenadine (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms – these medicines \nmay be available without prescription); \n\n− amiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, encainide, flecainide, propafenone, quinidine (used to \ncorrect irregular heartbeats); \n\n− dihydroergotamine, ergotamine (used to treat migraine headache); \n− ergonovine, methylergonovine (used to stop excessive bleeding that may occur following \n\nchildbirth or an abortion); \n− clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flurazepam, triazolam or oral (taken by mouth) \n\nmidazolam (used to help you sleep and/or relieve anxiety); \n− clozapine, pimozide, (used to treat abnormal thoughts or feelings);  \n\n\n\n101 \n \n\n− quetiapine (used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder); \n− lurasidone (used to treat depression); \n− ranolazine (used to treat chronic chest pain [angina]); \n− pethidine, piroxicam, propoxyphene (used to relieve pain); \n− cisapride (used to relieve certain stomach problems); \n− rifabutin (used to prevent/treat certain infections)*; \n− voriconazole (used to treat fungal infections)*; \n− simvastatin, lovastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol); \n− neratinib (used to treat breast cancer); \n− lomitapide (used to lower blood cholesterol); \n− alfuzosin (used to treat enlarged prostate gland); \n− fusidic acid (used to treat bacterial infections); \n− sildenafil if you suffer from a lung disease called pulmonary arterial hypertension that \n\nmakes breathing difficult.  Patients without this disease may use sildenafil for impotence \n(erectile dysfunction) under their doctor’s supervision (see the section on Other \nmedicines and Norvir); \n\n− avanafil or vardenafil (used to treat erectile dysfunction);  \n− colchicine (used to treat gout) if you have kidney and/or liver problems (see the section \n\non Other medicines and Norvir); \n− products containing St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) as this may stop Norvir from \n\nworking properly.  St John’s wort is often used in herbal medicines that you can buy \nyourself. \n\n \n*    Your doctor may decide that you can take rifabutin and/or voriconazole with a booster (lower \n\ndose) of Norvir but a full dose of Norvir must not be taken together with these two medicines. \n \nIf you are currently taking any of these medicines, ask your doctor about switching to a different \nmedicine while you are taking Norvir.  \n \nAlso read the list of medicines under ‘Other medicines and Norvir’ for use with certain other \nmedicines which require special care. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Norvir. \n \nImportant information \n \n− If Norvir is taken in combination with other antiretroviral medicines, it is important that you \n\nalso carefully read the leaflets that are provided with these other medicines.  There may be \nadditional information in those leaflets about situations when Norvir should be avoided.  If you \nhave any further questions about Norvir (ritonavir) or the other medicines prescribed, please ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist. \n\n− Norvir is not a cure for HIV infection or AIDS. \n− People taking Norvir may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV \n\ninfection or AIDS.  It is therefore important that you remain under the supervision of your \ndoctor while taking Norvir. \n\n− You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective \nantiretroviral therapy.  Discuss with your physician the precautions needed to avoid infecting \nother people. \n\n \n\n\n\n102 \n \n\nTell your doctor if you have/had: \n \n− A history of liver disease.   \n− Hepatitis B or C and are being treated with a combination of antiretroviral agents, as you are at \n\na greater risk of a severe and potentially life threatening reaction because of the effect on the \nliver.  Regular blood tests may be required to check your liver is working properly. \n\n− Haemophilia, as there have been reports of increased bleeding in patients with haemophilia \nwho are taking this type of medicine (protease inhibitors).  The reason for this is not known.  \nYou may need additional medicine to help your blood clot (factor VIII), in order to control any \nbleeding. \n\n− Erectile dysfunction, as the medicines used to treat erectile dysfunction can cause hypotension \nand prolonged erection. \n\n− Diabetes, as there have been reports of worsening of or the development of diabetes (diabetes \nmellitus) in some patients taking protease inhibitors. \n\n− Kidney (renal) disease, since your doctor may need to check the dose of your other medicines \n(such as protease inhibitors). \n\n \nTell your doctor if you experience: \n \n− Diarrhoea or vomiting that is not improving (persistent), as this may reduce how well the \n\nmedicines you are taking work. \n− Feeling sick (nausea), vomiting or have stomach pain, because these may be signs of \n\ninflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis).  Some patients taking Norvir can develop serious \nproblems with their pancreas.  Tell your doctor as soon as possible if this applies to you. \n\n− Symptoms of infection – inform your doctor immediately.  Some patients with advanced HIV \ninfection (AIDS) who then start anti-HIV treatment may develop the symptoms of infections \nthey have had in the past even if they didn’t know they had had them.  It is believed that this \nhappens because the body's immune response improves and helps the body to fight these \ninfections. \nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \nfor the treatment of your HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after \nthe start of treatment.  If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as \nmuscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of \nthe body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek \nnecessary treatment. \n\n− Joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty \nmoving, tell your doctor, as this may be a sign of a problem that can destroy bone \n(osteonecrosis).  Some patients taking a number of antiretroviral medicines may develop this \ndisease.  \n\n− Muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly in combination with antiretroviral therapy \nincluding protease inhibitors and nucleoside analogues.  On rare occasions these muscle \ndisorders have been serious. (See section 4 Possible side effects) \n\n- Dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting spells or abnormal heartbeat.  Some patients taking \nNorvir may experience changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG).  Tell your doctor if you have a \nheart defect or conduction defect.  \n\n− If you have any other health concerns, discuss these with your doctor as soon as you can. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nNorvir is not recommended in children below 2 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Norvir \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.  There are some medicines you cannot \n\n\n\n103 \n \n\ntake at all with Norvir.  These are listed earlier in section 2, under ‘Do not take Norvir’.  There are \nsome other medicines that can only be used under certain circumstances as described below.   \n \nThe following warnings apply when Norvir is taken as a full dose.  However, these warnings may also \napply when Norvir is used in lower doses (a booster) with other medicines.  \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines listed below, as special care should be \ntaken. \n \n− Sildenafil or tadalafil for impotence (erectile dysfunction).   \n\nThe dose and/or frequency of use of these medicines may need to be reduced to avoid \nhypotension and prolonged erection.  You must not take Norvir with sildenafil if you suffer \nfrom pulmonary arterial hypertension (see also section 2. What you need to know before you \nor your child takes Norvir).  Tell your doctor if you are taking tadalafil for pulmonary arterial \nhypertension. \n\n− Colchicine (for gout) as Norvir may raise the blood levels of this medicine. You must not take \nNorvir with colchicine if you have kidney and/or liver problems (see also ‘Do not take Norvir’ \nabove). \n\n− Digoxin (heart medicine).  Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of digoxin and monitor you \nwhile you are taking digoxin and Norvir in order to avoid heart problems. \n\n− Hormonal contraceptives containing ethinyl oestradiol as Norvir may reduce the effectiveness \nof these medicines.  It is recommended that a condom or other non-hormonal method of \ncontraception is used instead.  You may also notice irregular uterine bleeding if you are taking \nthis type of hormonal contraceptive with Norvir. \n\n− Atorvastatin or rosuvastatin (for high cholesterol) as Norvir may raise the blood levels of \nthese medicines.  Talk to your doctor before you take any cholesterol-reducing medicines with \nNorvir (see also ‘Do not take Norvir’ above). \n\n− Steroids (e.g. dexamethasone, fluticasone propionate, prednisolone, triamcinolone) as Norvir \nmay raise the blood levels of these medicines which may lead to Cushing’s syndrome \n(development of a rounded face) and reduce production of the hormone cortisol.  Your doctor \nmay wish to reduce the steroid dose or monitor your side effects more closely. \n\n− Trazodone (a medicine for depression) as, unwanted effects like nausea, dizziness, low blood \npressure and fainting can occur when taken with Norvir.  \n\n− Rifampicin and saquinavir (used for tuberculosis and HIV, respectively) as serious liver \ndamage can occur when taken with Norvir. \n\n− Bosentan, riociguat (used for pulmonary arterial hypertension) as Norvir may increase the \nblood levels of this medicine. \n\n \nThere are medicines that may not mix with Norvir because their effects could increase or decrease \nwhen taken together.  In some cases your doctor may need to perform certain tests, change the dose or \nmonitor you regularly.  This is why you should tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines, \nincluding those you have bought yourself or herbal products, but it is especially important to mention \nthese:  \n \n− amphetamine or amphetamine derivatives; \n− antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin);  \n− anticancer treatments (e.g. abemaciclib; afatinib, apalutamide, ceritinib, encorafenib, dasatinib, \n\nibrutinib, nilotinib, venetoclax, vincristine, vinblastine); \n− medicines used to treat low blood platelet count (e.g. fostamatinib); \n− anticoagulants (e.g. rivaroxaban, vorapaxar, warfarin); \n− antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine, fluoxetine, imipramine, nefazodone, \n\nnortriptyline, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone); \n− antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole);  \n− antihistamines (e.g. loratidine, fexofenadine);  \n− antiretroviral medicines including HIV-protease inhibitors (amprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, \n\nfosamprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, tipranavir) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \n\n\n\n104 \n \n\ninhibitors( NNRTI) (delavirdine, efavirenz, nevirapine), and others (didanosine, maraviroc, \nraltegravir, zidovudine);  \n\n− anti-tuberculosis medicine (bedaquiline and delamanid); \n− antiviral medicine used to treat chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults (e.g. \n\nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir and simeprevir); \n− anxiety medicine, buspirone;  \n− asthma medicine, theophylline, salmeterol; \n− atovaquone, a medicine used to treat a certain type of pneumonia and malaria; \n− buprenorphine, a medicine used for the treatment of chronic pain; \n− bupropion, a medicine used to help you stop smoking; \n− epilepsy medicines (e.g. carbamazepine, divalproex, lamotrigine, phenytoin); \n− heart medicines (e.g. disopyramide, mexiletine and calcium channel antagonists such as \n\namlodipine, diltiazem and nifedipine);  \n− immune system (e.g. cyclosporine, tacrolimus, everolimus);  \n− levothyroxine (used to treat thyroid probems); \n− morphine and morphine-like medicines used to treat severe pain (e.g. methadone, fentanyl); \n− sleeping pills (e.g. alprazolam, zolpidem) and also midazolam administered by injection;  \n− tranquillisers (e.g. haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine);  \n− colchicine, a treatment for gout. \n \nThere are some medicines you cannot take at all with Norvir.  These are listed earlier in section 2, \nunder ‘Do not take Norvir’. \n \nTaking Norvir with food and drink \n \nNorvir tablets should be taken with food. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a \nbaby, it is very important that you ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nThere is a large amount of information on the use of ritonavir (the active ingredient in Norvir) during \npregnancy.  In general, pregnant mothers received ritonavir after the first three months of pregnancy at \na lower dose (booster) along with other protease inhibitors.  Norvir did not appear to increase the \nchance of developing birth defects compared to the general population. \n \nNorvir can pass into breast milk.  To avoid transmitting the infection, mothers with HIV must not \nbreast feed their babies. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nNorvir can cause dizziness.  If you are affected do not drive or use machinery.  \n \n \n3. How to take Norvir \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you.  Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  Take this medicine one or two times a day every day with food.   \n \nIt is important that Norvir tablets are swallowed whole and not chewed, broken or crushed. \n \nRecommended doses of Norvir are: \n \n• if Norvir is used to boost the effects of certain other anti-HIV medicines the typical dose for \n\nadults is 1 to 2 tablets once or twice daily.  For more detailed dose recommendations, including \n\n\n\n105 \n \n\nthose for children, see the Package Leaflet of the anti-HIV medicines Norvir is given in \ncombination with. \n\n \n• if your doctor prescribes a full dose, adults may be started on a dose of 3 tablets in the morning \n\nand 3 tablets 12 hours later, gradually increasing over a period of up to 14 days to the full dose \nof 6 tablets twice daily (totaling 1,200mg per day).  Children (2 – 12 years of age) will start with \na dose smaller than this and continue up to the maximum allowed for their size.   \n\n \nYour doctor will advise you on the dosage to be taken. \n \nNorvir should be taken every day to help control your HIV, no matter how much better you feel.  If a \nside effect is preventing you from taking Norvir as directed, tell your doctor straight away.  During \nepisodes of diarrhoea your doctor may decide that extra monitoring is needed. \n \nAlways keep enough Norvir on hand so you don't run out.  When you travel or need to stay in the \nhospital, make sure you have enough Norvir to last until you can get a new supply. \n \nIf you take more Norvir than you should \n \nNumbness, tingling, or a “pins and needles” sensation may occur if you take too much Norvir.  If you \nrealise you have taken more Norvir than you were supposed to, contact your doctor or the Accident \nand Emergency Department of your nearest hospital straight away.  \n \nIf you forget to take Norvir \n \nIf you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as possible.  If it is nearly time for the next dose, just \ntake that one.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Norvir \n \nEven if you feel better, do not stop taking Norvir without talking to your doctor.  Taking Norvir as \nrecommended should give you the best chance of delaying resistance to the medicines.   \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nLike all medicines, Norvir can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  Also, the side \neffects of Norvir when used with other antiretroviral medicines are dependent on the other medicines.  \nSo it is important that you carefully read the side effects section of the leaflets that are provided with \nthese other medicines. \n \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n \n• upper or lower stomach ache \n\n  \n• vomiting  \n• diarrhoea (may be severe) \n• feeling sick (nausea)  \n• flushing, feeling hot \n• headache \n• dizziness \n• pain in the throat \n\n• a tingling sensation or numbness in  \nthe hands, feet or around the lips and \nmouth \n\n• feeling weak/tired \n• bad taste in the mouth \n• damage to the nerves that can cause \n\nweakness and pain \n• itching \n• rash \n• joint pain and back pain \n\n\n\n106 \n \n\n• cough \n• upset stomach or indigestion \n\n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people  \n \n• allergic reactions including skin  \n\nrashes (may be red, raised, itchy),  \nsevere swelling of the skin and  \nother tissues \n\n• inability to sleep (insomnia) \n• anxiety \n• increase in cholesterol \n• increase in triglycerides \n• gout \n• stomach bleeding \n• inflammation of the liver and yellowing of \n\nskin or whites of the eyes \n• increase in urination \n• reduced kidney function \n• seizures (fits) \n• low levels of blood platelets \n• thirst (dehydration)  \n• abnormally heavy periods \n\n• wind (flatulence) \n• loss of appetite \n• mouth ulcer \n• muscle aches (pain), tenderness or \n\nweakness \n• fever \n• weight loss \n• laboratory test results: \n\nchanges in blood test results  \n(such as blood chemistry and  \nblood count) \n\n• confusion \n• difficulty paying attention \n• fainting \n• blurred vision \n• swelling of the hands and feet \n• high blood pressure \n• low blood pressure and feeling faint \n\nwhen getting up \n• coldness in the hands and feet \n• acne \n\n \nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people  \n \n• heart attack  \n• diabetes \n\n• kidney failure  \n\n \nRare: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people \n \n• severe or life threatening skin  \n\nreaction including blisters \n(Stevens Johnson syndrome, toxic \nepidermal necrolysis) \n\n• serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) \n• high levels of sugar in the blood \n\n \nNot known: frequency cannot be estimated from the available data \n \n• kidney stones \n \nTell your doctor if you feel sick (nauseous), are vomiting, or have stomach pain, because these may be \nsigns of an inflamed pancreas.  Also tell your doctor if you experience joint stiffness, aches and pains \n(especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty moving, as this may be a sign of \nosteonecrosis.  See also section 2. What you need to know before you or your child takes Norvir. \n \nIn patients with haemophilia type A and B, there have been reports of increased bleeding while taking \nthis treatment or another protease inhibitor.  Should this happen to you, seek immediate advice from \nyour doctor.   \n \nAbnormal liver function tests, hepatitis (inflammation of the liver), and rarely jaundice, have been \nreported in patients taking Norvir.  Some people had other illnesses or were taking other medicines.  \nPeople with liver disease or hepatitis may have worsening of liver disease.   \n \n\n\n\n107 \n \n\nThere have been reports of muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly when taking medicines \nto lower cholesterol in combination with antiretroviral therapy, including protease inhibitors and \nnucleoside analogues.  On rare occasions these muscle disorders have been serious (rhabdomyolysis).  \nIn the event of unexplained or continual muscle pain, tenderness, weakness or cramps, stop taking the \nmedicine, contact your doctor as soon as possible or go to the Accident and Emergency Department of \nyour nearest hospital. \n \nInform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience any symptoms that suggest an allergic \nreaction after taking Norvir such as rash, hives or breathing difficulties. \n \nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \ncontact your doctor, pharmacist, Accident and Emergency department or if it is urgent get \nimmediate medical help. \n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet.  You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.
