NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nBusilvex 6 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion  \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne ml of concentrate contains 6 mg of busulfan (60 mg in 10 ml). \nAfter dilution: 1 ml of solution contains 0.5 mg of busulfan \nFor the full list of excipients see section 6.1 \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \nClear, colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBusilvex followed by cyclophosphamide (BuCy2) is indicated as conditioning treatment prior to \nconventional haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) in adult patients when the \ncombination is considered the best available option. \n \nBusilvex following fludarabine (FB) is indicated as conditioning treatment prior to haematopoietic \nprogenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) in adult patients who are candidates for a reduced-intensity \nconditioning (RIC) regimen. \n \nBusilvex followed by cyclophosphamide (BuCy4) or melphalan (BuMel) is indicated as conditioning \ntreatment prior to conventional haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation in paediatric patients. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nBusilvex administration should be supervised by a physician experienced in conditioning treatment \nprior to haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation. \n \nBusilvex is administered prior to the haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT). \n \nPosology \nBusilvex in combination with cyclophosphamide or melphalan  \nIn adults \nThe recommended dose and schedule of administration is: \n\n- 0.8 mg/kg body weight (BW) of busulfan as a two-hour infusion every 6 hours over 4 \nconsecutive days for a total of 16 doses, \n\n- followed by cyclophosphamide at 60 mg/kg/day over 2 days initiated for at least 24 hours \nfollowing the 16th dose of Busilvex (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 3\n\nPaediatric population (0 to 17 years) \nThe recommended dose of Busilvex is as follows: \n \n\nActual body weight (kg) Busilvex dose (mg/kg) \n< 9 1.0 \n\n9 to < 16 1.2 \n16 to 23 1.1 \n\n> 23 to 34 0.95 \n> 34 0.8 \n\n \nfollowed by: \n\n- 4 cycles of 50 mg/kg body weight (BW) cyclophosphamide (BuCy4) or  \n- one administration of 140 mg/m² melphalan (BuMel)  \ninitiated for at least 24 hours following the 16th dose of Busilvex.(see section 4.5). \n\n \nBusilvex is administered as a two-hour infusion every 6 hours over 4 consecutive days for a total of 16 \ndoses prior to cyclophosphamide or melphalan and haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation \n(HPCT).  \n \nElderly patients \nPatients older than 50 years of age (n=23) have been successfully treated with Busilvex without dose-\nadjustment. However, for the safe use of Busilvex in patients older than 60 years only limited \ninformation is available. Same dose (see section 5.2) for elderly patients as for adults (< 50 years old) \nshould be used. \n \nBusilvex in combination with fludarabine (FB) \nIn adults  \nThe recommended dose and schedule of administration is: \n\n- fludarabine administered as a single daily one-hour infusion at 30 mg/m² for 5 consecutive days \nor 40 mg/m² for 4 consecutive days. \n\n- Busilvex will be administered at 3.2 mg/kg as a single daily three-hour infusion immediately \nafter fludarabine for 2 or 3 consecutive days.  \n\n \nPaediatric population (0 to 17 years) \nThe safety and efficacy of FB in pediatric population has not been established. \n \nElderly patients \nThe administration of FB regimen has not been specifically investigated in elderly patients. However, \nmore than 500 patients aged ≥ 55 years were reported in publications with FB conditioning regimens, \nyielding efficacy outcomes similar to younger patients. No dose adjustment was deemed necessary.  \n \nObese patients \nIn adults \nFor obese patients, dosing based on adjusted ideal body weight (AIBW) should be considered. \n \nIdeal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows: \nIBW men (kg) = 50 + 0.91x (height in cm-152); \nIBW women (kg) = 45 + 0.91x (height in cm-152). \n \nAdjusted ideal body weight (AIBW) is calculated as follows: \nAIBW= IBW+0.25x (actual body weight - IBW). \n \nIn paediatric population \nThe medicinal product is not recommended in obese children and adolescents with body mass index \nWeight (kg)/(m²) > 30 kg/m² until further data become available. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 4\n\nPatients with renal impairment \nStudies in renally impaired patients have not been conducted, however, as busulfan is moderately \nexcreted in the urine, dose modification is not recommended in these patients. \nHowever, caution is recommended (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nBusilvex as well as busulfan has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. \nCaution is recommended, particularly in those patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section \n4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \nBusilvex must be diluted prior to administration. A final concentration of approximately 0.5 mg/ml \nbusulfan should be achieved. Busilvex should be administered by intravenous infusion via central \nvenous catheter. \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \nBusilvex should not be given by rapid intravenous, bolus or peripheral injection.  \n \nAll patients should be pre-medicated with anticonvulsant medicinal products to prevent seizures \nreported with the use of high dose busulfan.  \nIt is recommended to administer anticonvulsants 12 h prior to Busilvex to 24 h after the last dose of \nBusilvex. \n \nIn adult and paediatric studies, patients received either phenytoin or benzodiazepines as seizure \nprophylaxis treatment. (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nAntiemetics should be administered prior to the first dose of Busilvex and continued on a fixed \nschedule according to local practice through its administration. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nPregnancy (see section 4.6).  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe consequence of treatment with Busilvex at the recommended dose and schedule is profound \nmyelosuppression, occurring in all patients. Severe granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, or \nany combination thereof may develop. Frequent complete blood counts, including differential white \nblood cell counts, and platelet counts should be monitored during the treatment and until recovery is \nachieved. \nProphylactic or empiric use of anti-infectives (bacterial, fungal, viral) should be considered for the \nprevention and management of infections during the neutropenic period. Platelet and red blood cell \nsupport, as well as the use of growth factors such as granulocyte colony stimulating agent (G-CSF), \nshould be employed as medically indicated. \n \nIn adults, absolute neutrophil counts < 0.5x109/l at a median of 4 days post transplant occurred in \n100% of patients and recovered at median day 10 and 13 days following autologous and allogeneic \ntransplant respectively (median neutropenic period of 6 and 9 days respectively). Thrombocytopenia \n(< 25x109/l or requiring platelet transfusion) occurred at a median of 5-6 days in 98% of patients. \nAnaemia (haemoglobin< 8.0 g/dl) occurred in 69% of patients.  \n \nIn paediatric population, absolute neutrophil counts < 0.5x109/l at a median of 3 days post transplant \noccurred in 100% of patients and lasted 5 and 18.5 days in autologous and allogeneic transplant \n\n\n\n \n\n 5\n\nrespectively. In children, thrombocytopenia (< 25x109/l or requiring platelet transfusion) occurred in \n100% of patients. Anaemia (haemoglobin< 8.0 g/dl) occurred in 100% of patients.  \n \nIn children < 9 kg, a therapeutic drug monitoring may be justified on a case by case basis, in particular \nin extremely young children and neonates (see section 5.2). \n \nThe Fanconi anaemia cells have hypersensitivity to cross-linking agents. There is limited clinical \nexperience of the use of busulfan as a component of a conditioning regimen prior to HSCT in children \nwith Fanconi’s anaemia. Therefore Busilvex should be used with caution in this type of patients. \n \nHepatic impairment  \nBusilvex as well as busulfan has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Since busulfan \nis mainly metabolized through the liver, caution should be observed when Busilvex is used in patients \nwith pre-existing impairment of liver function, especially in those with severe hepatic impairment. It is \nrecommended when treating these patients that serum transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and \nbilirubin should be monitored regularly 28 days following transplant for early detection of \nhepatotoxicity. \n \nHepatic veno-occlusive disease is a major complication that can occur during treatment with Busilvex. \nPatients who have received prior radiation therapy, greater than or equal to three cycles of \nchemotherapy, or prior progenitor cell transplant may be at an increased risk (see section 4.8). \n \nCaution should be exercised when using paracetamol prior to (less than 72 hours) or concurrently with \nBusilvex due to a possible decrease in the metabolism of busulfan (See section 4.5). \n \nAs documented in clinical studies, no treated patients experienced cardiac tamponade or other specific \ncardiac toxicities related to Busilvex. However cardiac function should be monitored regularly in \npatients receiving Busilvex (see section 4.8). \n \nOccurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome with subsequent respiratory failure associated with \ninterstitial pulmonary fibrosis was reported in Busilvex studies in one patient who died, although, no \nclear aetiology was identified. In addition, busulfan might induce pulmonary toxicity that may be \nadditive to the effects produced by other cytotoxic agents. Therefore, attention should be paid to this \npulmonary issue in patients with prior history of mediastinal or pulmonary radiation (see section 4.8). \n \nPeriodic monitoring of renal function should be considered during therapy with Busilvex (see section \n4.8). \n \nSeizures have been reported with high dose busulfan treatment. Special caution should be exercised \nwhen administering the recommended dose of Busilvex to patients with a history of seizures. Patients \nshould receive adequate anticonvulsant prophylaxis. In adults and children studies, data with Busilvex \nwere obtained when using concomitant administration of either phenytoin or benzodiazepines for \nseizure prophylaxis. The effect of those anticonvulsant agents on busulfan pharmacokinetics was \ninvestigated in a phase II study (see section 4.5). \n \nThe increased risk of a second malignancy should be explained to the patient. On the basis of human \ndata, busulfan has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a \nhuman carcinogen. The World Health Organisation has concluded that there is a causal relationship \nbetween busulfan exposure and cancer. Leukaemia patients treated with busulfan developed many \ndifferent cytological abnormalities, and some developed carcinomas. Busulfan is thought to be \nleukemogenic. \n \nFertility \nBusulfan can impair fertility. Therefore, men treated with Busilvex are advised not to father a child \nduring and up to 6 months after treatment and to seek advice on cryo-conservation of sperm prior to \ntreatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with Busilvex. Ovarian \nsuppression and amenorrhoea with menopausal symptoms commonly occur in pre-menopausal \n\n\n\n \n\n 6\n\npatients. Busulfan treatment in a pre-adolescent girl prevented the onset of puberty due to ovarian \nfailure. Impotence, sterility, azoospermia, and testicular atrophy have been reported in male patients. \nThe solvent dimethylacetamide (DMA) may also impair fertility. DMA decreases fertility in male and \nfemale rodents (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). \n \nCases of thrombotic microangiopathy after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), including fatal \ncases, have been reported in high-dose conditioning regimens in which busulfan was administered in \ncombination with another conditioning treatment. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo specific clinical trial was carried out to assess drug-drug interaction between intravenous busulfan \nand itraconazole or metronidazole. From published studies in adults, administration of itraconazole to \npatients receiving high-dose busulfan may result in reduced busulfan clearance. Also, there are \npublished case reports of increased plasma levels of busulfan after administration of metronidazole. \nPatients who are concurrently treated with busulfan and itraconazole or metronidazole should be \nclosely monitored for signs of busulfan toxicity. \nNo interaction was observed when busulfan was combined with fluconazole (antifungal agent) \nPublished studies in adults described that ketobemidone (analgesic) might be associated with high \nlevels of plasma busulfan. Therefore special care is recommended when combining these two \ncompounds. \n \nIn adults, for the BuCy2 regimen it has been reported that the time interval between the last oral \nbusulfan administration and the first cyclophosphamide administration may influence the development \nof toxicities. A reduced incidence of Hepatic Veno Occlusive Disease (HVOD) and other regimen-\nrelated toxicity have been observed in patients when the lag time between the last dose of oral \nbusulfan and the first dose of cyclophosphamide is > 24hours. \n \nThere is no common metabolism pathway between busulfan and fludarabine.  \nIn adults, for the FB regimen, published studies did not report any mutual drug-drug interaction \nbetween intravenous busulfan and fludarabine. \n \nIn paediatric population, for the BuMel regimen it has been reported that the administration of \nmelphalan less than 24 hours after the last oral busulfan administration may influence the development \nof toxicities. \n \nParacetamol is described to decrease glutathione levels in blood and tissues, and may therefore \ndecrease busulfan clearance when used in combination (see section 4.4). \n \nEither phenytoin or benzodiazepines were administered for seizure prophylaxis in patients \nparticipating to the clinical trials conducted with intravenous busulfan (see section 4.2 and 4.4).  \nThe concomitant systemic administration of phenytoin to patients receiving high-dose of oral busulfan \nhas been reported to increase busulfan clearance, due to induction of glutathion-S-transferase whereas \nno interaction has been reported when benzodiazepines such as diazepam, clonazepam or lorazepam \nhave been used to prevent seizures with high-dose busulfan.  \nNo evidence of an induction effect of phenytoin has been seen on Busilvex data. A phase II clinical \ntrial was performed to evaluate the influence of seizure prophylaxis treatment on intravenous busulfan \npharmacokinetics. In this study, 24 adult patients received clonazepam (0.025-0.03 mg/kg/day as IV \ncontinuous infusions) as anticonvulsant therapy and the PK data of these patients were compared to \nhistorical data collected in patients treated with phenytoin. The analysis of data through a population \npharmacokinetic method indicated no difference on intravenous busulfan clearance between phenytoin \nand clonazepam based therapy and therefore similar busulfan plasma exposures were achieved \nwhatever the type of seizure prophylaxis. \n  \nNo interaction was observed when busulfan was combined with 5 HT3 antiemetics such as \nondansetron or granisetron. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 7\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nHPCT is contraindicated in pregnant women; therefore, Busilvex is contraindicated during pregnancy. \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (embryo-fetal lethality and malformations). (see \nsection 5.3) \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of busulfan or DMA in pregnant women. A few \ncases of congenital abnormalities have been reported with low-dose oral busulfan, not necessarily \nattributable to the active substance, and third trimester exposure may be associated with impaired \nintrauterine growth.  \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and up to 6 months after \ntreatment. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether busulfan and DMA are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for \ntumorigenicity shown for busulfan in human and animal studies, breast-feeding should be \ndiscontinued during treatment with busulfan. \n \nFertility \nBusulfan and DMA can impair fertility in man or woman. Therefore it is advised not to father child \nduring the treatment and up to 6 months after treatment and to seek advice on cryo-conservation of \nsperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility (see section 4.4). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nBusilvex in combination with cyclophosphamide or melphalan  \nIn adults \nAdverse events information is derived from two clinical trials (n=103) of Busilvex.  \nSerious toxicities involving the haematologic, hepatic and respiratory systems were considered as \nexpected consequences of the conditioning regimen and transplant process. These include infection \nand Graft-versus host disease (GVHD) which although not directly related, were the major causes of \nmorbidity and mortality, especially in allogeneic HPCT. \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders: \nMyelo-suppression and immuno-suppression were the desired therapeutic effects of the conditioning \nregimen. Therefore all patients experienced profound cytopenia: leucopenia 96%, thrombocytopenia \n94%, and anemia 88%. The median time to neutropenia was 4 days for both autologous and allogeneic \npatients. The median duration of neutropenia was 6 days and 9 days for autologous and allogeneic \npatients.  \n \nImmune system disorders: \nThe incidence of acute graft versus host disease (a-GVHD) data was collected in OMC-BUS-4 study \n(allogeneic)(n=61). A total of 11 patients (18%) experienced a-GVHD. The incidence of a-GVHD \ngrades I-II was 13% (8/61), while the incidence of grade III-IV was 5% (3/61). Acute GVHD was \nrated as serious in 3 patients. Chronic GVHD (c-GVHD) was reported if serious or the cause of death, \nand was reported as the cause of death in 3 patients. \n\n\n\n \n\n 8\n\n \nInfections and infestations:  \n39% of patients (40/103) experienced one or more episodes of infection, of which 83% (33/40) were \nrated as mild or moderate. Pneumonia was fatal in 1% (1/103) and life-threatening in 3% of patients. \nOther infections were considered severe in 3% of patients. Fever was reported in 87% of patients and \ngraded as mild/moderate in 84% and severe in 3%. 47% of patients experienced chills which were \nmild/moderate in 46% and severe in 1%. \n \nHepato-biliary disorders: \n15% of SAEs involved liver toxicity. HVOD is a recognized potential complication of conditioning \ntherapy post-transplant. Six of 103 patients (6%) experienced HVOD. HVOD occurred in: 8.2% (5/61) \nallogeneic patients (fatal in 2 patients) and 2.5% (1/42) of autologous patients. Elevated bilirubin \n(n=3) and elevated AST (n=1) were also observed. Two of the above four patients with serious serum \nhepatotoxicity were among patients with diagnosed HVOD. \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: \nOne patient experienced a fatal case of acute respiratory distress syndrome with subsequent respiratory \nfailure associated with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis in the Busilvex studies. \n \nPaediatric population \nAdverse events information are derived from the clinical study in paediatrics (n=55). Serious toxicities \ninvolving the hepatic and respiratory systems were considered as expected consequences of the \nconditioning regimen and transplant process. \n \nImmune system disorders: \nThe incidence of acute graft versus host disease (a-GVHD) data was collected in allogeneic patients \n(n=28). A total of 14 patients (50%) experienced a-GVHD. The incidence of a-GVHD grades I-II was \n46.4% (13/28), while the incidence of grade III-IV was 3.6% (1/28). Chronic GVHD was reported \nonly if it is the cause of death: one patient died 13 months post-transplant. \n \nInfections and infestations:  \nInfections (documented and non documented febrile neutropenia) were experienced in 89% of patients \n(49/55). Mild/moderate fever was reported in 76% of patients. \n \nHepato-biliary disorders : \nGrade 3 elevated transaminases were reported in 24% of patients. \nVeno occlusive disease (VOD) was reported in 15% (4/27) and 7% (2/28) of the autologous and \nallogenic transplant respectively. VOD observed were neither fatal nor severe and resolved in all \ncases. \n \nBusilvex in combination with fludarabine (FB)  \nIn adults \nThe safety profile of Busilvex combined with fludarabine (FB) has been examined through a review of \nadverse events reported in published data from clinical trials in RIC regimen. In these studies, a total \nof 1574 patients received FB as a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen prior to \nhaematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation.  \n \nMyelo-suppression and immuno-suppression were the desired therapeutic effects of the conditioning \nregimen and consequently were not considered undesirable effects. \n \nInfections and infestations:  \nThe occurrence of infectious episodes or reactivation of opportunistic infectious agents mainly reflects \nthe immune status of the patient receiving a conditioning regimen.  \nThe most frequent infectious adverse reactions were Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation [range: \n30.7% - 80.0%], Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) reactivation [range: 2.3% - 61%], bacterial infections \n[range: 32.0% - 38.9%] and viral infections [range: 1.3% - 17.2%]. \n\n\n\n \n\n 9\n\n \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nThe highest frequency of nausea and vomiting was 59.1% and  the highest frequency of stomatitis was \n11%. \n \nRenal and urinary disorders: \nIt has been suggested that conditioning regimens containing fludarabine were associated with higher \nincidence of opportunistic infections after transplantation because of the immunosuppressive effect of \nfludarabine. Late haemorrhagic cystitis occurring 2 weeks post-transplant are likely related to viral \ninfection / reactivation. Haemorrhagic cystitis including haemorrhagic cystitis induced by viral \ninfection was reported in a range between 16% and 18.1%.  \n \nHepato-biliary disorders: \nVOD was reported with a range between 3.9% and 15.4%. \n \nThe treatment-related mortality/non-relapse mortality (TRM/NRM) reported until day+100 post-\ntransplant has also been examined through a review of published data from clinical trials. It was \nconsidered as deaths that could be attributable to secondary side effects after HPCT and not related to \nthe relapse/progression of the underlying haematological malignancies.  \nThe most frequent causes of reported TRM/NRMs were infection/sepsis, GVHD, pulmonary disorders \nand organ failure. \n \nTabulated summaries of adverse reactions \nFrequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100, < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000, \n< 1/100) or not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Undesirable effects coming from \npost-marketing survey have been implemented in the tables with the incidence “not known”. \n \nBusilvex in combination with cyclophosphamide or melphalan  \nAdverse reactions reported both in adults and paediatric patients as more than an isolated case are \nlisted below, by system organ class and by frequency.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe principal toxic effect is profound myeloablation and pancytopenia but the central nervous system, \nliver, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract may also be affected.  \n \nThere is no known antidote to Busilvex other than haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation. In \nthe absence of haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation, the recommended dose of Busilvex \nwould constitute an overdose of busulfan. The haematologic status should be closely monitored and \nvigorous supportive measures instituted as medically indicated. \nThere have been two reports that busulfan is dialyzable, thus dialysis should be considered in the case \nof an overdose. Since, busulfan is metabolized through conjugation with glutathione, administration of \nglutathione might be considered. \n \nIt must be considered that overdose of Busilvex will also increase exposure to DMA. In human the \nprincipal toxic effects were hepatotoxicity and central nervous system (CNS) effects. CNS changes \nprecede any of the more severe side effects. No specific antidote for DMA overdose is known. In case \nof overdose, management would include general supportive care. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 13\n\n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Alkyl sulfonates, ATC code: L01AB01. \n \nMechanism of action \nBusulfan is a potent cytotoxic agent and a bifunctional alkylating agent. In aqueous media, release of \nthe methanesulphonate groups produces carbonium ions which can alkylate DNA, thought to be an \nimportant biological mechanism for its cytotoxic effect. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nBusilvex in combination with cyclophosphamide \nIn adults \nDocumentation on the safety and efficacy of Busilvex in combination with cyclophosphamide in the \nBuCy2 regimen prior to conventional allogeneic and/or autologous HPCT derives from two clinical \ntrials (OMC-BUS-4 and OMC-BUS-3). \n \nTwo prospective, single arm, open-label, uncontrolled phase II studies were conducted in patients with \nhaematological disease, the majority of whom had advanced disease. \n \nDiseases included were acute leukaemia past first remission, in first or subsequent relapse, in first \nremission (high risk), or induction failures; chronic melogenous leukaemia in chronic or advanced \nphase; primary refractory or resistant relapsed Hodgkin’s disease or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and \nmyelodysplastic syndrome. \n \nPatients received doses of 0.8 mg/kg busulfan every 6 hours infusion for a total 16 doses followed by \ncyclophosphamide at 60 mg/kg once per day for two days (BuCy2 regimen). \nThe primary efficacy parameters in these studies were myeloablation, engraftment, relapse, and \nsurvival. \nIn both studies, all patients received a 16/16 dose regimen of Busilvex. No patients were discontinued \nfrom treatment due to adverse reactions related to Busilvex.  \n \nAll patients experienced a profound myelosuppression. The time to Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) \ngreater than 0.5x109 /l was 13 days (range 9-29 days) in allogenic patients (OMC-BUS 4), and 10 days \n(range 8-19 days) in autologous patients (OMC-BUS 3). All evaluable patients engrafted. There is no \nprimary or secondary graft rejection. Overall mortality and non- relapse mortality at more than 100 \ndays post-transplant was (8/61) 13% and (6/61) 10% in allotransplanted patients, respectively. During \nthe same period there was no death in autologous recipients. \n \nPaediatric population \nDocumentation of the safety and efficacy of Busilvex in combination with cyclophosphamide in the \nBuCy4 or with melphalan in the BuMel regimen prior to conventional allogeneic and/or autologous \nHPCT derives from clinical trial F60002 IN 101 G0. \nThe patients received the dosing mentioned in section 4.2. \nAll patients experienced a profound myelosuppression. The time to Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) \ngreater than 0.5x109/l was 21 days (range 12-47 days) in allogenic patients, and 11 days (range 10-15 \ndays) in autologous patients. All children engrafted. There is no primary or secondary graft rejection. \n93% of allogeneic patients showed complete chimerism. There was no regimen-related death through \nthe first 100-day post-transplant and up to one year post-transplant. \n \nBusilvex in combination with fludarabine (FB)  \nIn adults \nDocumentation on the safety and efficacy of Busilvex in combination with fludarabine (FB) prior to \nallogeneic HPCT derives from the literature review of 7 published studies involving 731 patients with \n\n\n\n \n\n 14\n\nmyeloid and lymphoid malignancies reporting the use of intravenous busulfan infused once daily \ninstead of four doses per day.  \n \nPatients received a conditioning regimen based on the administration of fludarabine immediately \nfollowed by single daily dose of 3.2 mg/kg busulfan over 2 or 3 consecutive days. Total dose of \nbusulfan per patient was between 6.4 mg/kg and 9.6 mg/kg. \nThe FB combination allowed sufficient myeloablation modulated by the intensity of conditioning \nregimen through the variation of number of days of busulfan infusion. Fast and complete engraftment \nrates in 80-100% of patients were reported in the majority of studies. A majority of publications \nreported a complete donor chimerism at day+30 for 90-100% of patients. The long-term outcomes \nconfirmed that the efficacy was maintained without unexpected effects.  \n \nData from a recently completed prospective multicentre phase 2 study including 80 patients, aged 18 \nto 65 years old, diagnosed with different hematologic malignancies who underwent allo-HCT with  an \nFB (3 days of Busilvex) reduced intensity conditioning regimen became available. In this study, all, \nbut one, patients engrafted, at a median of 15 (range, 10-23) days after allo-HCT. The cumulative \nincidence of neutrophil recovery at day 28 was 98.8% (95%CI, 85.7-99.9%). Platelet engraftment \noccurred at a median of 9 (range, 1-16) days after allo-HCT.  \nThe 2-year OS rate was 61.9% (95%CI, 51.1-72.7%)]. At 2 years, the cumulative incidence of NRM \nwas 11.3% (95%CI, 5.5-19.3%), and that of relapse or progression from allo-HCT was 43.8% (95CI, \n31.1-55.7%). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of DFS at 2 years was 49.9% (95%CI, 32.6-72.7). \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of Busilvex has been investigated. The information presented on \nbiotransformation and elimination is based on oral busulfan. \n \nPharmacokinetics in adults \nAbsorption \nThe pharmacokinetics of intravenous busulfan was studied in 124 evaluable patients following a 2-\nhour intravenous infusion for a total of 16 doses over four days. Immediate and complete availability \nof the dose is obtained after intravenous infusion of busulfan. Similar blood exposure was observed \nwhen comparing plasma concentrations in adult patients receiving oral and intravenous busulfan at \n1 mg/kg and 0.8 mg/kg respectively. Low inter (CV=21%) and intra (CV=12%) patient variability on \nbusulfan exposure was demonstrated through a population pharmacokinetic analysis, performed on \n102 patients.  \n \nDistribution \nTerminal volume of distribution Vz ranged between 0.62 and 0.85 l/kg. \nBusulfan concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid are comparable to those in plasma although these \nconcentrations are probably insufficient for anti-neoplastic activity. \nReversible binding to plasma proteins was around 7% while irreversible binding, primarily to albumin, \nwas about 32%. \n \nBiotransformation \nBusulfan is metabolised mainly through conjugation with glutathione (spontaneous and glutathione-S-\ntransferase mediated). The glutathione conjugate is then further metabolised in the liver by oxidation. \nNone of the metabolites is thought to contribute significantly to either efficacy or toxicity. \n \nElimination \nTotal clearance in plasma ranged 2.25 - 2.74 ml/minute/kg. The terminal half-life ranged from 2.8 to \n3.9 hours. \nApproximately 30% of the administered dose is excreted into the urine over 48 hours with 1% as \nunchanged busulfan. Elimination in faeces is negligible. Irreversible protein binding may explain the \nincomplete recovery. Contribution of long-lasting metabolites is not excluded. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 15\n\nLinearity   \nThe dose proportional increase of busulfan exposure was demonstrated following intravenous busulfan \nup to 1 mg/kg. \n \nCompared to the four times a day regimen, the once-daily regimen is characterized by a higher peak \nconcentration, no drug accumulation and a wash out period (without circulating busulfan \nconcentration) between consecutive administrations. The review of the literature allows a comparison \nof PK series performed either within the same study or between studies and demonstrated unchanged \ndose-independent PK parameters regardless the dosage or the schedule of administration. It seems  that \nthe recommended intravenous busulfan dose administered either as an individual infusion (3.2 mg/kg) \nor into 4 divided infusions (0.8 mg/kg) provided equivalent daily plasma exposure with similar both \ninter-and intrapatient variability. As a result, the control of intravenous busulfan AUC within the \ntherapeutic windows is not modified and a similar targeting performance between the two schedules \nwas illustrated. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships \nThe literature on busulfan suggests a therapeutic AUC window between 900 and 1500 µmol/L.minute \nper administration (equivalent to a daily exposure between 3600 and 6000 µmol/L.minute). During \nclinical trials with intravenous busulfan administered as 0.80 mg/kg four-times daily, 90% of patients \nAUCs were below the upper AUC limit (1500 µmol/L.minute) and at least 80% were within the \ntargeted therapeutic window (900-1500 µmol/L.minute). Similar targeting rate is achieved within the \ndaily exposure of 3600 - 6000 µmol/L.minute following the administration of intravenous busulfan 3.2 \nmg/kg once daily. \n \nSpecial populations \nHepatic or renal impairment \nThe effects of renal dysfunction on intravenous busulfan disposition have not been assessed. \nThe effects of hepatic dysfunction on intravenous busulfan disposition have not been assessed. \nNevertheless the risk of liver toxicity may be increased in this population. \nNo age effect on busulfan clearance was evidenced from available intravenous busulfan data in \npatients over 60 years. \n \nPaediatric population  \nA continuous variation of clearance ranging from 2.49 to 3.92 ml/minute/kg has been established in \nchildren from < 6 months up to 17 years old. The terminal half life ranged from 2.26 to 2.52 h. \n Inter and intra patient variabilities in plasma exposure were lower than 20% and 10%, respectively. \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed in a cohort of 205 children adequately \ndistributed with respect to bodyweight (3.5 to 62.5 kg), biological and diseases (malignant and non-\nmalignant) characteristics, thus representative of the high heterogeneity of children undergoing HPCT. \nThis study demonstrated that bodyweight was the predominant covariate to explain the busulfan \npharmacokinetic variability in children over body surface area or age.  \nThe recommended posology for children as detailed in section 4.2 enabled over 70% up to 90% of \nchildren ≥ 9 kg in achieving the therapeutic window (900-1500 µmol/L.minute). However a higher \nvariability was observed in children < 9 kg leading to 60% of children achieving the therapeutic \nwindow (900-1500 µmol/L.minute). For the 40% of children < 9 kg outside the target, the AUC was \nevenly distributed either below or above the targeted limits; i.e. 20% each < 900 and > 1500 \nµmol/L.min following 1 mg/kg. In this regard, for children < 9 kg, a monitoring of the plasma \nconcentrations of busulfan (therapeutic drug monitoring) for dose-adjustment may improve the \nbusulfan targeting performance, especially in extremely young children and neonates.  \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships: \nThe successful engraftment achieved in all patients during phase II trials suggests the appropriateness \nof the targeted AUCs. Occurrence of VOD was not related to overexposure. PK/PD relationship was \nobserved between stomatitis and AUCs in autologous patients and between bilirubin increase and \nAUCs in a combined autologous and allogeneic patient analysis. \n\n\n\n \n\n 16\n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nBusulfan is mutagenic and clastogenic. Busulfan was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium, \nDrosophila melanogaster and barley. Busulfan induced chromosomal aberrations in vitro (rodent and \nhuman cell) and in vivo (rodents and humans). Various chromosome aberrations have been observed in \ncells from patients receiving oral busulfan. \n \nBusulfan belongs to a class of substances which are potentially carcinogenic based on their mechanism \nof action. On the basis of human data, busulfan has been classified by the IARC as a human \ncarcinogen. WHO has concluded that there is a causal relationship between busulfan exposure and \ncancer. The available data in animals support the carcinogenic potential of busulfan. Intravenous \nadministration of busulfan to mice significantly increased the incidences of thymic and ovarian \ntumours. \n \nBusulfan is a teratogen in rats, mice and rabbits. Malformations and anomalies included significant \nalterations in the musculoskeletal system, body weight gain, and size. In pregnant rats, busulfan \nproduced sterility in both male and female offspring due to the absence of germinal cells in testes and \novaries. Busulfan was shown to cause sterility in rodents. Busulfan depleted oocytes of female rats, \nand induced sterility in male rats and hamster. \n \nRepeated doses of DMA produced signs of liver toxicity, the first being increases in serum clinical \nenzymes followed by histopatological changes in the hepatocytes. Higher doses can produce hepatic \nnecrosis and liver damage can be seen following single high exposures. \n \nDMA is teratogenic in rats. Doses of 400 mg/kg/day DMA administered during organogenesis caused \nsignificant developmental anomalies. The malformations included serious heart and/or major vessels \nanomalies: a common truncus arteriosis and no ductus arteriosis, coarctation of the pulmonary trunk \nand the pulmonary arteries, intraventricular defects of the heart. Other frequent anomalies included \ncleft palate, anasarca and skeletal anomalies of the vertebrae and ribs. DMA decreases fertility in male \nand female rodents. A single s.c. dose of 2.2 g/kg administered on gestation day 4 terminated \npregnancy in 100% of tested hamster. In rats, a DMA daily dose of 450 mg/kg given to rats for nine \ndays caused inactive spermatogenesis. \n \n \n6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nDimethylacetamide \nMacrogol 400. \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal \nproducts except those mentioned in section 6.6. \n \nDo not use polycarbonate syringes with Busilvex. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \nVials: 3 years \n \nDiluted solution: \nChemical and physical in-use stability after dilution in glucose 5% or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) \nsolution for injection has been demonstrated for: \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 17\n\n- 8 hours (including infusion time) after dilution when stored at 20 °C  5 °C  \n  \n-  12 hours after dilution when stored at 2 °C-8 °C followed by 3 hours stored at 20 °C  5 °C \n\n(including infusion time). \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately after dilution. If not \nused immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user \nand would normally not be longer than the above mentioned conditions when dilution has taken place \nin controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). \nDo not freeze the diluted solution. \nFor storage conditions after dilution of the medicinal product see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \n10 ml of concentrate for solution for infusion in clear glass vials (type I) with a butyl rubber stopper \ncovered by a purple flip-off aluminium seal cap. \nMultipack containing 8 (2 packs of 4) vials. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nPreparation of Busilvex \nProcedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer medicinal products should be considered. \n \nAll transfer procedures require strict adherence to aseptic techniques, preferably employing a vertical \nlaminar flow safety hood  \n \nAs with other cytotoxic compounds, caution should be exercised in handling and preparing the \nBusilvex solution: \n- The use of gloves and protective clothing is recommended.  \n- If Busilvex or diluted Busilvex solution contacts the skin or mucosa, wash them thoroughly with \n\nwater immediately. \n \nCalculation of the quantity of Busilvex to be diluted and of the diluent \n \nBusilvex must be diluted prior to use with either sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for \ninjection or glucose solution for injection 5%. \nThe quantity of the diluent must be 10 times the volume of Busilvex ensuring the final concentration \nof busulfan remains at approximately 0.5 mg/ml. By example: \n \nThe amount of Busilvex and diluent to be administered would be calculated as follows: \nfor a patient with a Y kg body weight: \n \n\n Quantity of Busilvex: \n \nY (kg) x D (mg/kg)  \n\n= A ml of Busilvex to be diluted \n6 (mg/ml) \n \nY: body weight of the patient in kg \nD: dose of Busilvex (see section 4.2) \n\n\n\n \n\n 18\n\n \n Quantity of diluent: \n\n \n(A ml Busilvex) x (10) = B ml of diluent \n \nTo prepare the final solution for infusion, add (A) ml of Busilvex to (B) ml of diluent (sodium chloride \n9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose solution for injection 5%) \n \nPreparation of the solution for infusion \n \n Busilvex must be prepared by a healthcare professional using sterile transfer techniques. Using a \n\nnon polycarbonate syringe fitted with a needle: \n \n\n- the calculated volume of Busilvex must be removed from the vial. \n \n\n- the contents of the syringe must be dispensed into an intravenous bag (or syringe) which \nalready contains the calculated amount of the selected diluent. Busilvex must always be added \nto the diluent, not the diluent to Busilvex. Busilvex must not be put into an intravenous bag \nthat does not contain sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose \nsolution for injection 5%. \n\n \n The diluted solution must be mixed thoroughly by inverting several times. \n\n \nAfter dilution, 1 ml of solution for infusion contains 0.5 mg of busulfan. \n\n \nDiluted Busilvex is a clear colourless solution. \n \nInstructions for use \nPrior to and following each infusion, flush the indwelling catheter line with approximately 5 ml of \nsodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose (5%) solution for injection. \n \nThe residual medicinal product must not be flushed in the administration tubing as rapid infusion of \nBusilvex has not been tested and is not recommended. \n \nThe entire prescribed Busilvex dose should be delivered over two or three hours depending of the \nconditioning regimen. \n \nSmall volumes may be administered over 2 hours using electric syringes. In this case infusion sets \nwith minimal priming space should be used (i.e. 0.3-0.6 ml), primed with medicinal product solution \nprior to beginning the actual Busilvex infusion and then flushed with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) \nsolution for injection or glucose (5%) solution for injection. \n \nBusilvex must not be infused concomitantly with another intravenous solution. \n \nPolycarbonate syringes must not be used with Busilvex. \n \nFor single use only. Only a clear solution without any particles should be used. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements for cytotoxic medicinal products. \n\n\n\n \n\n 19\n\n \n \n7 MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER \n \nPierre Fabre Médicament \n45, Place Abel Gance \nF-92654 Boulogne Billancourt Cedex \nFrance \n \n8 MARKETING AUTHORISATION NUMBER(S)  \n \nEU/1/03/254/002 \n \n9 DATE OF FIRST AUTHORISATION/RENEWAL OF THE AUTHORISATION \n \nDate of first authorisation: 09 July, 2003 \nDate of latest renewal: 08 July, 2008 \n \n10 DATE OF REVISION OF THE TEXT \n \nMM/YYYY \n \nDetailed information on this medicinal product is available on the website of European \nMedicinal Agency http://www.ema/europa.eu \n\n\n\n \n\n 20\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX II \n \nA.

What Busilvex is and what it is used for \n \nBusilvex contains the active substance busulfan, which belongs to a group of medicines called \nalkylating agents. Busilvex destroys the original bone marrow before the transplant. \n \nBusilvex is used in adults, new-born infants, children and adolescents as a treatment prior to \ntransplantation. \nIn adults Busilvex is used in combination with cyclophosphamide or fludarabine. \nIn new-born infants, children and adolescents, Busilvex is used in combination with \ncyclophosphamide or melphalan. \nYou will receive this preparative medicine before receiving a transplant of either bone marrow or \nhaematopoietic progenitor cell. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you  use Busilvex \n \nDo not use Busilvex: \n if you are allergic to busulfan or any of the other ingredients of Busilvex listed in section 6, \n if you are pregnant, or think you may be pregnant. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nBusilvex is a potent cytotoxic medicine that results in profound decrease of blood cells. At the \nrecommended dose, this is the desired effect. Therefore careful monitoring will be performed. \nIt is possible that use of Busilvex may increase the risk of suffering another malignancy in the future. \nYou should tell your doctor: \n if you have a liver, kidney, heart or lung problem, \n if you have a history of seizures, \n if you are currently taking other medicines. \nCases of formation of blood clots in the small blood vessels may appear after hematopoietic cell \ntransplantation (HCT) with high-dose of your treatment in combination with other medicines. \n \nOther medicines and Busilvex \nTell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. Busilvex may interact with other medicines. \n\n\n\n \n\n 32\n\n \nParticular caution should be taken if you use itraconazole and metronidazole (used for certain types of \ninfections) or ketobemidone (used to treat pain), because this may increase the side-effects. \n \nThe use of paracetamol during the 72 hours prior to or with Busilvex administration should be used \nwith caution. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor before you receive treatment with Busilvex. Women must not be pregnant during \ntreatment with Busilvex and up to 6 months after treatment.  \nWomen must stop breast-feeding before starting their treatment with Busilvex. \n \nAdequate contraceptive precautions should be used when either partner is receiving Busilvex. \n \nIt may no longer be possible for you to achieve a pregnancy (infertility) after treatment with busulfan.  \nIf you are concerned about having children, you should discuss this with your doctor before treatment. \nBusilvex can also produce symptoms of menopause and in pre-adolescent girls it can prevent the onset \nof puberty.  \n \nMen treated with Busilvex are advised not to father child during and up to 6 months after treatment.  \n \n \n3. How to use Busilvex \n \nDose and administration: \nThe dose of Busilvex will be calculated according to your body weight. \n \nIn adults: \nBusilvex in combination with cyclophosphamide: \n The recommended dose of Busilvex is 0.8 mg/kg \n Each infusion will last 2 hours \n Busilvex will be administered every 6 hours during 4 consecutive days prior to transplant. \n \nBusilvex in combination with fludarabine \n The recommended dose of Busilvex is 3.2 mg/kg \n Each infusion will last 3 hours \n Busilvex will be administered once daily during 2 or 3 consecutive days prior to transplant. \n \nIn new-born infants, children and adolescents (0 to 17 years): \nThe recommended dose of Busilvex in combination with cyclophosphamide or melphalan is based on \nyour body weight varying between 0.8 and 1.2 mg/kg. \n Each infusion will last 2 hours \n Busilvex will be administered every 6 hours during 4 consecutive days prior to transplant. \n \nMedicines before you receive Busilvex: \nBefore receiving Busilvex, you will be medicated with \n anticonvulsive medicines to prevent seizures (phenytoin or benzodiazepines) and \n antiemetic medicines to prevent vomiting. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 33\n\n \n4. Possible side effects  \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects: \nThe most serious side effects of Busilvex therapy or the transplant procedure may include decrease in \ncirculating blood cell counts (intended effect of the medicine to prepare you for your transplant \ninfusion), infection, liver disorders including blocking of a liver vein, graft versus host disease (the \ngraft attacks your body) and pulmonary complications.

In one article it was studied the role of busulfan in juvenile rats resulting in abnormal \nroot development; a review of two cases of immunodeficiency disorders treated with busulfan and \ncyclophosphamide in which dental orthodontic treatment was provided; additional 2 case report of \nhypoplasia of permanent tooth germ is presented; one review assessed the long term effects of \ncytotoxic therapy concluding that tooth agenesis was more prevalent in patients treated with busulfan \nand cyclophosphamide; a study of 81 patients concluded that busulfan is as toxic as total body \nirradiation in causing disturbances in dental development; finally, a study of risk factors of tooth \nformation anomalies in paediatric cancers concluded that the high risk group of tooth agenesis was \nthe subject with high dose chemotherapy under 4 years old. From the assessment of these articles, the \ncausality of busulfan in the development of tooth hypoplasia is confirmed. Therefore, “tooth \nhypoplasia” should be added to the product information for both pharmaceutical forms.  \n\nInteraction between busulfan and metronidazol has been reported in literature reviews and post \nmarketing cases. It is of particular interest the study of this interaction in three groups of patients in \nwhich higher plasma levels of busulfan were observed in the group receiving metronidazol \nprophylaxis during busulfan treatment than in those without metronidazoles. Therefore, this \ninteraction should be included in the product information for both pharmaceutical forms.  \n\nThe signal concerning interaction with deferasirox is refuted and it can be closed. This signal was \nopen based on an isolated case from the literature and no additional cases have been reported. No \npharmacokinetic explanation justifies this interaction. The signals concerning busulfan oral \nformulations and hepatic veno-oclusive disease risk in patients who have received prior radiation \ntherapy /chemotherapy /HSCT, sterility, overdose treatment can be closed. These risks are assessed \nin the corresponding national procedures.  \n\nThe MAH of Busilvex has responded to the question of “Thrombotic microangiopathy” (TMA) after \nhematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) requested as supplementary information. A cumulative \nreview of the literature and safety database has been performed. The occurrence of TMA is \nmultifactorial and busulfan IV by itself cannot be considered as a main factor in the development of \nthis reaction. Mainly studies from literature have shown that high busulfan i.v. doses in combination \nwith other drugs in conditioning treatment previous HCT could be an important role in the \ndevelopment of TMA. As a conclusion, busulfan could be one risk factor of development TMA and a \nwarning is section 4.4 of the Busilvex SmPC is considered warranted.  \n\nThe warning for TMA after HCT only applies to one pharmaceutical form: the intravenous. Cases of \nTMA after high doses of busulfan i.v. in combination with other medicine as a conditioning \ntreatment previous HCT have been seen after reviewing the literature and the cases retrieved in the \nsafety database of the company. There are no cases with oral busulfan. \n\nThe benefit risk profile of the product remains favourable in the approved indications. \n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 40\n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for busulfan the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-\nrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing busulfan is unchanged subject to the proposed \nchanges to the product information \n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA MANUFACTURER(S) RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tB CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS REGARDING SUPPLY AND USE\n\tC.
