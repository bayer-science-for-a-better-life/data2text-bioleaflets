NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nArsenic trioxide Mylan 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 ml of concentrate contains 1 mg of arsenic trioxide. \n \nEach 10 ml vial contains 10 mg of arsenic trioxide. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate) \n \nSterile, clear, colourless, aqueous solution with a pH of 7.5 to 8.5. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nArsenic trioxide Mylan is indicated for induction of remission, and consolidation in adult patients \nwith:  \n- Newly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (white blood \n\ncell count, \u2264 10 x 103/\u03bcl) in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) \n- Relapsed/refractory acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (Previous treatment should have \n\nincluded a retinoid and chemotherapy)  \ncharacterised by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation and/or the presence of the promyelocytic \nleukaemia/retinoic-acid-receptor-alpha (PML/RAR-alpha) gene. \n \nThe response rate of other acute myelogenous leukaemia subtypes to arsenic trioxide has not been \nexamined. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nArsenic trioxide Mylan must be administered under the supervision of a physician who is experienced \nin the management of acute leukaemias, and the special monitoring procedures described in section \n4.4 must be followed. \n \nPosology \n \nThe same dose is recommended for adults and elderly.  \n \nNewly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) \n \nInduction treatment schedule  \nArsenic trioxide Mylan must be administered intravenously at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day, given daily \nuntil complete remission is achieved. If complete remission has not occurred by day 60, dosing must \nbe discontinued. \n \nConsolidation schedule  \nArsenic trioxide Mylan must be administered intravenously at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day, 5 days per \nweek. Treatment should be continued for 4 weeks on and 4 weeks off, for a total of 4 cycles.  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nRelapsed/refractory acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) \n \nInduction treatment schedule  \nArsenic trioxide Mylan must be administered intravenously at a fixed dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day given \ndaily until complete remission is achieved (less than 5% blasts present in cellular bone marrow with \nno evidence of leukaemic cells). If complete remission has not occurred by day 50, dosing must be \ndiscontinued.  \n \nConsolidation schedule  \nConsolidation treatment must begin 3 to 4 weeks after completion of induction therapy. Arsenic \ntrioxide Mylan is to be administered intravenously at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day for 25 doses given 5 \ndays per week, followed by 2 days interruption, repeated for 5 weeks.  \n \nDose delay, modification and reinitiation \n \nTreatment with Arsenic trioxide Mylan must be temporarily interrupted before the scheduled end of \ntherapy at any time that a toxicity grade 3 or greater on the National Cancer Institute Common \nToxicity Criteria is observed and judged to be possibly related to Arsenic trioxide Mylan treatment. \nPatients who experience such reactions that are considered arsenic trioxide related must resume \ntreatment only after resolution of the toxic event or after recovery to baseline status of the abnormality \nthat prompted the interruption. In such cases, treatment must resume at 50% of the preceding daily \ndose. If the toxic event does not recur within 7 days of restarting treatment at the reduced dose, the \ndaily dose can be escalated back to 100% of the original dose. Patients who experience a recurrence of \ntoxicity must be removed from treatment.  \nFor ECG, electrolytes abnormalities and hepatotoxicity see section 4.4.  \n \nSpecial populations  \n \nHepatic impairment  \n \nSince no data are available across all hepatic impairment groups and hepatotoxic effects may occur \nduring the treatment with Arsenic trioxide Mylan, caution is advised in the use of Arsenic trioxide \nMylan in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.4 and 4.8).  \n \nRenal impairment  \n \nSince no data are available across all renal impairment groups, caution is advised in the use of Arsenic \ntrioxide Mylan in patients with renal impairment.  \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Arsenic trioxide Mylan in children aged up to 17 years has not been \nestablished. Currently available data for children aged 5 to 16 years are described in section 5.1 but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made. No data are available for children under 5 years.  \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nArsenic trioxide Mylan must be administered intravenously over 1-2 hours. The infusion duration may \nbe extended up to 4 hours if vasomotor reactions are observed. A central venous catheter is not \nrequired. Patients must be hospitalised at the beginning of treatment due to symptoms of disease and \nto ensure adequate monitoring.   \n \nFor instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nClinically unstable APL patients are especially at risk and will require more frequent monitoring of \nelectrolyte and glycaemia levels as well as more frequent haematologic, hepatic, renal and coagulation \nparameter tests.  \n \nLeukocyte activation syndrome (APL differentiation syndrome)  \n27% of patients with APL, in the relapsed/refractory setting, treated with arsenic trioxide have \nexperienced symptoms similar to a syndrome called the retinoic-acid-acute promyelocytic leukaemia \n(RA-APL) or APL differentiation syndrome, characterised by fever, dyspnoea, weight gain, \npulmonary infiltrates and pleural or pericardial effusions, with or without leukocytosis. This syndrome \ncan be fatal. In newly diagnosed APL patients treated with arsenic trioxide and all-trans-retinoic acid \n(ATRA), APL differentiation syndrome was observed in 19% including 5 severe cases. At the first \nsigns that could suggest the syndrome (unexplained fever, dyspnoea and/or weight gain, abnormal \nchest auscultatory findings or radiographic abnormalities), treatment with arsenic trioxide must be \ntemporarily discontinued and high-dose steroids (dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously twice a day) \nmust be immediately initiated, irrespective of the leukocyte count and continued for at least 3 days or \nlonger until signs and symptoms have abated. If clinically justified/required, concomitant diuretic \ntherapy is also recommended. The majority of patients do not require permanent termination of arsenic \ntrioxide therapy during treatment of the APL differentiation syndrome. As soon as signs and \nsymptoms have subsided, treatment with arsenic trioxide can be resumed at 50% of the previous dose \nduring the first 7 days. Thereafter, in the absence of worsening of the previous toxicity, arsenic \ntrioxide might be resumed at full dosage. In the case of the reappearance of symptoms arsenic trioxide \nshould be reduced to the previous dosage. In order to prevent the development of the APL \ndifferentiation syndrome during induction treatment, prednisone (0.5 mg/kg body weight per day \nthroughout induction treatment) may be administered from day 1 of arsenic trioxide application to the \nend of induction therapy in APL patients. It is recommended that chemotherapy not be added to \ntreatment with steroids since there is no experience with administration of both steroids and \nchemotherapy during treatment of the leukocyte activation syndrome due to arsenic trioxide. \nPost--marketing experience suggests that a similar syndrome may occur in patients with other types of \nmalignancy. Monitoring and management for these patients should be as described above.  \n \nElectrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities  \nArsenic trioxide can cause QT interval prolongation and complete atrioventricular block. QT \nprolongation can lead to a torsade de pointes-type ventricular arrhythmia, which can be fatal. Previous \ntreatment with anthracyclines may increase the risk of QT prolongation. The risk of torsade de pointes \nis related to the extent of QT prolongation, concomitant administration of QT prolonging medicinal \nproducts (such as class Ia and III antiarrythmics (e.g. quinidine, amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide), \nantipsychotics (e.g. thioridazine), antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline), some macrolides (e.g. \nerythromycin), some antihistamines (e.g. terfenadine and astemizole), some quinolone antibiotics (e.g. \nsparfloxacin), and other individual medicinal products known to increase QT interval (e.g. cisapride)), \na history of torsade de pointes, pre-existing QT interval prolongation, congestive heart failure, \nadministration of potassium-wasting diuretics, amphotericin B or other conditions that result in \nhypokalemia or hypomagnesaemia. In clinical trials, in the relapsed/refractory setting, 40% of patients \ntreated with arsenic trioxide experienced at least one QT corrected (QTc) interval prolongation greater \nthan 500 msec. Prolongation of the QTc was observed between 1 and 5 weeks after arsenic trioxide \ninfusion, and then returned to baseline by the end of 8 weeks after arsenic trioxide infusion. One \npatient (receiving multiple, concomitant medicinal products, including amphotericin B) had \nasymptomatic torsade de pointes during induction therapy for relapsed APL with arsenic trioxide. In \nnewly diagnosed APL patients 15.6% showed QTc prolongation with arsenic trioxide in combination \nwith ATRA (see section 4.8). In one newly diagnosed patient induction treatment was terminated \n\n\n\n5 \n\nbecause of severe prolongation of the QTc interval and electrolyte abnormalities on day 3 of induction \ntreatment. \n \nECG and electrolyte monitoring recommendations  \nPrior to initiating therapy with arsenic trioxide, a 12-lead ECG must be performed and serum \nelectrolytes (potassium, calcium, and magnesium) and creatinine must be assessed; preexisting \nelectrolyte abnormalities must be corrected and, if possible, medicinal products that are known to \nprolong the QT interval must be discontinued. Patients with risk factors of QTc prolongation or risk \nfactors of torsade de pointes should be monitored with continuous cardiac monitoring (ECG). For QTc \ngreater than 500 msec, corrective measures must be completed and the QTc reassessed with serial \nECGs and, if available, a specialist advice could be sought prior to considering using arsenic trioxide. \nDuring therapy with arsenic trioxide, potassium concentrations must be kept above 4 mEq/l and \nmagnesium concentrations must be kept above 1.8 mg/dl. Patients who reach an absolute QT interval \nvalue > 500 msec must be reassessed and immediate action must be taken to correct concomitant risk \nfactors, if any, while the risk/benefit of continuing versus suspending arsenic trioxide therapy must be \nconsidered. If syncope, rapid or irregular heartbeat develops, the patient must be hospitalised and \nmonitored continuously, serum electrolytes must be assessed, arsenic trioxide therapy must be \ntemporarily discontinued until the QTc interval regresses to below 460 msec, electrolyte abnormalities \nare corrected, and the syncope and irregular heartbeat cease. After recovery, treatment should be \nresumed at 50% of the preceding daily dose. If QTc prolongation does not recur within 7 days of \nrestarting treatment at the reduced dose, treatment with arsenic trioxide can be resumed at 0.11 mg/kg \nbody weight per day for a second week. The daily dose can be escalated back to 100% of the original \ndose if no prolongation occurs. There are no data on the effect of arsenic trioxide on the QTc interval \nduring the infusion. Electrocardiograms must be obtained twice weekly, and more frequently for \nclinically unstable patients, during induction and consolidation.  \n \nHepatotoxicity (grade 3 or greater)  \nIn newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate risk APL 63.2% developed grade 3 or 4 hepatic \ntoxic effects during induction or consolidation treatment with arsenic trioxide in combination with \nATRA (see section 4.8). However, toxic effects resolved with temporary discontinuation of either \narsenic trioxide, ATRA or both. Treatment with arsenic trioxide must be discontinued before the \nscheduled end of therapy at any time that a hepatotoxicity grade 3 or greater on the National Cancer \nInstitute Common Toxicity Criteria is observed. As soon as bilirubin and/or SGOT and/or alkaline \nphosphatase are decreased to below 4 times the normal upper level, treatment with arsenic trioxide \nshould be resumed at 50% of the previous dose during the first 7 days. Thereafter, in absence of \nworsening of the previous toxicity, arsenic trioxide should be resumed at full dosage. In case of \nreappearance of hepatotoxicity, arsenic trioxide must be permanently discontinued.  \n \nDose delay and modification  \nTreatment with arsenic trioxide must be temporarily interrupted before the scheduled end of therapy at \nany time that a toxicity grade 3 or greater on the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria \nis observed and judged to be possibly related to arsenic trioxide treatment. (see section 4.2)  \n \nLaboratory tests  \nThe patient\u2019s electrolyte and glycaemia levels, as well as haematologic, hepatic, renal and coagulation \nparameter tests must be monitored at least twice weekly, and more frequently for clinically unstable \npatients during the induction phase and at least weekly during the consolidation phase. \n \nRenal impairment  \nSince no data are available across all renal impairment groups, caution is advised in the use of arsenic \ntrioxide in patients with renal impairment. The experience in patients with severe renal impairment is \ninsufficient to determine if dose adjustment is required.  \nThe use of arsenic trioxide in patients on dialysis has not been studied. \n \nHepatic impairment  \n\n\n\n6 \n\nSince no data are available across all hepatic impairment groups and hepatotoxic effects may occur \nduring the treatment with arsenic trioxide caution is advised in the use of arsenic trioxide in patients \nwith hepatic impairment (see section 4.4 on hepatotoxicity and section 4.8). The experience in patients \nwith severe hepatic impairment is insufficient to determine if dose adjustment is required.  \n \nElderly  \nThere is limited clinical data on the use of arsenic trioxide in the elderly population. Caution is needed \nin these patients.  \n \nHyperleukocytosis  \nTreatment with arsenic trioxide has been associated with the development of hyperleukocytosis (\u2265 \n10 x 103/\u03bcl) in some relapsed/refractory APL patients. There did not appear to be a relationship \nbetween baseline white blood cell (WBC) counts and development of hyperleukocytosis nor did there \nappear to be a correlation between baseline WBC count and peak WBC counts. Hyperleukocytosis \nwas never treated with additional chemotherapy and resolved on continuation of arsenic trioxide. \nWBC counts during consolidation were not as high as during induction treatment and were < 10 x \n103/\u03bcl, except in one patient who had a WBC count of 22 x 103/\u03bcl during consolidation. Twenty \nrelapsed/refractory APL patients (50%) experienced leukocytosis; however, in all these patients, the \nWBC count was declining or had normalized by the time of bone marrow remission and cytotoxic \nchemotherapy or leukopheresis was not required. In newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate \nrisk APL leukocytosis developed during induction therapy in 35 of 74 (47%) patients (see section 4.8). \nHowever all cases were successfully managed with hydroxyurea therapy.  \n \nIn newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory APL patients who develop sustained leukocytosis after \ninitiation of therapy, hydroxyurea should be administered. Hydroxyurea should be continued at a \ngiven dose to keep the white blood cell count \u2264 10 x 103/\u03bcl and subsequently tapered.  \n \nTable 1 Recommendation for initiation of hydroxyurea \n\nWBC  Hydroxyurea  \n10\u201350 x 103/\u03bcl  500 mg four times a day  \n> 50 x 103/\u03bcl  1000 mg four times a day  \n\n \nDevelopment of second primary malignancies  \nThe active ingredient of Arsenic trioxide Mylan, arsenic trioxide, is a human carcinogen. Monitor \npatients for the development of second primary malignancies.  \n \nEncephalopathy  \nCases of encephalopathy were reported with treatment with arsenic trioxide. Wernicke encephalopathy \nafter arsenic trioxide treatment was reported in patients with vitamin B1 deficiency. Patients at risk of \nB1 deficiency should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of encephalopathy after arsenic \ntrioxide initiation. Some cases recovered with vitamin B1 supplementation. \n \nExcipient with known effect \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal assessments of pharmacokinetic interactions between arsenic trioxide and other therapeutic \nmedicinal products have been conducted.  \n \nMedicinal products known to cause QT/QTc interval prolongation, hypokalemia or hypomagnesaemia \nQT/QTc prolongation is expected during treatment with arsenic trioxide, and torsade de pointes and \ncomplete heart block have been reported. Patients who are receiving, or who have received, medicinal \nproducts known to cause hypokalemia or hypomagnesaemia, such as diuretics or amphotericin B, may \nbe at higher risk for torsade de pointes. Caution is advised when Arsenic trioxide Mylan is \n\n\n\n7 \n\ncoadministered with other medicinal products known to cause QT/QTc interval prolongation such as \nmacrolide antibiotics, the antipsychotic thioridazine, or medicinal products known to cause \nhypokalemia or hypomagnesaemia. Additional information about QT prolonging medicinal agents, is \nprovided in section 4.4.   \n \nMedicinal products known to cause hepatotoxic effects  \nHepatotoxic effects may occur during the treatment with arsenic trioxide, caution is advised when \nArsenic trioxide Mylan is coadministered with other medicinal products known to cause hepatotoxic \neffects (see section 4.4 and 4.8).  \n \nOther antileukaemic medicinal products  \nThe influence of Arsenic trioxide Mylan on the efficacy of other antileukaemic medicinal products is \nunknown. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nContraception in males and females \nWomen of childbearing potential and men must use effective contraception during treatment with \nArsenic trioxide Mylan.  \n \nPregnancy  \nArsenic trioxide has been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic in animal studies (see section 5.3). \nThere are no studies in pregnant women using Arsenic trioxide Mylan. If this medicinal product is \nused during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this product, the patient must \nbe informed of the potential harm to the foetus.  \n \nBreast-feeding  \nArsenic is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in \nbreast-feeding children from Arsenic trioxide Mylan, breast-feeding must be discontinued prior to and \nthroughout administration.  \n \nFertility  \nNo clinical or non-clinical fertility studies have been conducted with Arsenic trioxide Mylan. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nArsenic trioxide Mylan has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nRelated adverse reactions of CTC grade 3 and 4 occurred in 37% of relapsed/refractory APL patients \nin clinical trials. The most commonly reported reactions were hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia, \nneutropenia, and increased alanine amino transferase (ALT). Leukocytosis occurred in 50% of patients \nwith relapsed/refractory APL, as determined by haematology assessments.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions were common (1-10%) and not unexpected in the relapsed/refractory \npopulation. Those serious adverse reactions attributed to arsenic trioxide included APL differentiation \nsyndrome (3), leukocytosis (3), prolonged QT interval (4, 1 with torsade de pointes), atrial \nfibrillation/atrial flutter (1), hyperglycaemia (2) and a variety of serious adverse reactions related to \nhaemorrhage, infections, pain, diarrhoea, nausea.  \n \nIn general, treatment-emergent adverse reactions tended to decrease over time, in relapsed/refractory \nAPL patients perhaps accounted for by amelioration of the underlying disease process. Patients tended \nto tolerate consolidation and maintenance treatment with less toxicity than in induction. This is \nprobably due to the confounding of adverse reactions by the uncontrolled disease process early on in \n\n\n\n8 \n\nthe treatment course and the myriad concomitant medicinal products required to control symptoms and \nmorbidity.  \n \nIn a phase 3, multicenter, noninferiority trial comparing all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) plus \nchemotherapy with ATRA plus arsenic trioxide in newly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk APL \npatients (Study APL0406; see also section 5.1), serious adverse reactions including hepatic toxicity, \nthrombocytopenia, neutropenia and QTc prolongation were observed in patients treated with arsenic \ntrioxide.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \nThe following undesirable effects have been reported in the APL0406 study in newly diagnosed \npatients and in clinical trials and/or post-marketing experience in relapsed/refractory APL patients. \nUndesirable effects are listed in table 2 below as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and \nfrequencies observed during arsenic trioxide clinical trials in 52 patients with refractory/relapsed APL. \nFrequencies are defined as: (very common \u2265 1/10), (common \u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), (uncommon \u2265 \n1/1,000 to < 1/100), not known (cannot be estimated from available data).  \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 2 \n\n All grades Grades \u2265 3 \nInfections and infestations   \nHerpes zoster  Common Not known \nSepsis  Not known Not known \nPneumonia  Not known Not known \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders   \nFebrile neutropenia  Common Common \nLeukocytosis  Common Common \nNeutropenia  Common Common \nPancytopenia  Common Common \nThrombocytopenia  Common Common \nAnaemia  Common Not known \nLeukopenia  Not known Not known \nLymphopenia  Not known Not known \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders   \nHyperglycaemia  Very Common Very Common \nHypokalaemia  Very Common Very Common \nHypomagnesaemia  Very Common Common \nHypernatraemia  Common Common \nKetoacidosis  Common Common \nHypermagnesaemia  Common Not known \nDehydration  Not known Not known \nFluid retention  Not known Not known \nPsychiatric disorders   \nConfusional state  Not known Not known \nNervous system disorders   \nParaesthesia  Very Common Common \nDizziness  Very Common Not known \nHeadache  Very Common Not known \nConvulsion Common Not known \nEncephalopathy, Wernicke encephalopathy Not known Not known \nEye disorders   \nVision blurred Common Not known \nCardiac disorders   \nTachycardia  Very Common Common \nPericardial effusion  Common Common \nVentricular extrasystoles  Common Not known \n\n\n\n9 \n\n All grades Grades \u2265 3 \nCardiac failure  Not known Not known \nVentricular tachycardia  Not known Not known \nVascular disorders   \nVasculitis  Common Common \nHypotension  Common Not known \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders   \nDifferentiation syndrome  Very Common Very Common \nDyspnoea  Very Common Common \nHypoxia  Common Common \nPleural effusion  Common Common \nPleuritic pain  Common Common \nPulmonary alveolar haemorrhage  Common Common \nPneumonitis  Not known Not known \nGastrointestinal disorders   \nDiarrhoea  Very Common Common \nVomiting  Very Common Not known \nNausea  Very Common Not known \nAbdominal pain  Common Common \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders   \nPruritus  Very Common Not known \nRash  Very Common Not known \nErythema  Common Common \nFace oedema  Common Not known \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders   \nMyalgia  Very Common Common \nArthralgia  Common Common \nBone pain  Common Common \nRenal and urinary disorders   \nRenal failure  Common Not known \nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\n  \n\nPyrexia  Very Common Common \nPain  Very Common Common \nFatigue  Very Common Not known \nOedema  Very Common Not known \nChest pain  Common Common \nChills  Common Not known \nInvestigations   \nAlanine amino transferase increased  Very Common Common \nAspartate amino transferase increased  Very Common Common \nElectrocardiogram QT prolonged  Very Common Common \nHyperbilirubinaemia  Common Common \nBlood creatinine increased  Common Not known \nWeight increased  Common Not known \nGamma-glutamyltransferase increased*  Not known* Not known* \n\n*In the CALGB study C9710, 2 cases of grade \u22653 increased GGT were reported out of the \n200 patients who received arsenic trioxide consolidation cycles (cycle 1 and cycle 2) versus none in \nthe control arm. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nDifferentiation syndrome  \nDuring arsenic trioxide treatment, 14 of the 52 patients in the APL studies in the relapsed setting had \none or more symptoms of APL differentiation syndrome, characterised by fever, dyspnoea, weight \ngain, pulmonary infiltrates and pleural or pericardial effusions, with or without leukocytosis (see \nsection 4.4). Twenty-seven patients had leukocytosis (WBC \u2265 10 x 103/\u03bcl) during induction, 4 of \n\n\n\n10 \n\nwhom had values above 100,000/\u03bcl. Baseline white blood cell (WBC) counts did not correlate with \ndevelopment of leukocytosis on study, and WBC counts during consolidation therapy were not as high \nas during induction. In these studies, leukocytosis was not treated with chemotherapeutic medicinal \nproducts. Medicinal products that are used to lower the white blood cell count often exacerbate the \ntoxicities associated with leukocytosis, and no standard approach has proven effective. One patient \ntreated under a compassionate use program died from cerebral infarct due to leukocytosis, following \ntreatment with chemotherapeutic medicinal products to lower WBC count. Observation is the \nrecommended approach with intervention only in selected cases.  \n \nMortality in the pivotal studies in the relapsed setting from disseminated intravascular coagulation \n(DIC) associated haemorrhage was very common (> 10%), which is consistent with the early mortality \nreported in the literature.  \n \nIn newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate risk APL, differentiation syndrome was observed \nin 19% including 5 severe cases.  \n \nIn post marketing experience, a differentiation syndrome, like retinoic acid syndrome, has also been \nreported for the treatment of malignancies other than APL with arsenic trioxide.  \n \nQT interval prolongation  \nArsenic trioxide can cause QT interval prolongation (see section 4.4). QT prolongation can lead to a \ntorsade de pointes-type ventricular arrhythmia, which can be fatal. The risk of torsade de pointes is \nrelated to the extent of QT prolongation, concomitant administration of QT prolonging medicinal \nproducts, a history of torsade de pointes, preexisting QT interval prolongation, congestive heart \nfailure, administration of potassium-wasting diuretics, or other conditions that result in hypokalaemia \nor hypomagnesaemia. One patient (receiving multiple, concomitant medicinal products, including \namphotericin B) had asymptomatic torsade de pointes during induction therapy for relapsed APL with \narsenic trioxide. She went onto consolidation without further evidence of QT prolongation.  \n \nIn newly diagnosed patients, with low to intermediate risk APL, QTc prolongation was observed in \n15.6%. In one patient induction treatment was terminated because of severe prolongation of the QTc \ninterval and electrolyte abnormalities on day 3.  \n \nPeripheral neuropathy  \nPeripheral neuropathy, characterised by paresthesia/dysesthesia, is a common and well-known effect \nof environmental arsenic. Only 2 relapsed/refractory APL patients discontinued treatment early due to \nthis adverse reaction and one went on to receive additional arsenic trioxide on a subsequent protocol. \nForty-four percent of relapsed/refractory APL patients experienced symptoms that could be associated \nwith neuropathy; most were mild to moderate and were reversible upon cessation of treatment with \narsenic trioxide.  \n \nHepatotoxicity (grade 3-4) \nIn newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate risk APL 63.2% developed grade 3 or 4 hepatic \ntoxic effects during induction or consolidation treatment with arsenic trioxide in combination with \nATRA. However, toxic effects resolved with temporary discontinuation of either arsenic trioxide, \nATRA or both (see section 4.4).  \n \nHaematological and gastrointestinal toxicity  \nIn newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate risk APL, gastrointestinal toxicity, grade 3-4 \nneutropenia and grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia occurred, however these were 2.2 times less frequent \nin patients treated with arsenic trioxide in combination with ATRA compared to patients treated with \nATRA + chemotherapy.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n11 \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIf symptoms suggestive of serious acute arsenic toxicity (e.g. convulsions, muscle weakness and \nconfusion) appear, Arsenic trioxide Mylan must be immediately discontinued and chelating therapy \nwith penicillamine at a daily dose \u2264 1 g per day may be considered. The duration of treatment with \npenicillamine must be evaluated taking into account the urinary arsenic laboratory values. For patients \nwho cannot take oral medicinal product, dimercaprol administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg \nintramuscularly every 4 hours until any immediately life-threatening toxicity has subsided may be \nconsidered. Thereafter, penicillamine at a daily dose \u2264 1 g per day may be given. In the presence of \ncoagulopathy, the oral administration of the chelating agent Succimer or Dimercaptosuccinic Acid \n(DCI) 10 mg/kg or 350 mg/m2 every 8 hours during 5 days and then every 12 hours during 2 weeks is \nrecommended. For patients with severe, acute arsenic overdose, dialysis should be considered. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX27 \n \nMechanism of action  \n \nThe mechanism of action of Arsenic trioxide Mylan is not completely understood. Arsenic trioxide \ncauses morphological changes and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragmentation characteristic of \napoptosis in NB4 human promyelocytic leukaemia cells in vitro. Arsenic trioxide also causes damage \nor degradation of the fusion protein promyelocytic leukaemia/retinoic acid receptor-alpha (PML/RAR \nalpha). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety  \n \nNewly diagnosed non high risk APL patients  \nArsenic trioxide has been investigated in 77 newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate risk \nAPL, in a controlled, randomized, non-inferiority Phase 3 clinical study comparing the efficacy and \nsafety of arsenic trioxide combined with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) with those of \nATRA + chemotherapy (eg, idarubicin and mitoxantrone) (Study APL0406). Patients with newly \ndiagnosed APL confirmed by the presence of t(15; 17) or PML-RAR\u03b1 by RT-PCR or micro speckled \nPML nuclear distribution in leukemic cells were included. No data are available on patient with \nvariant translocations like t(11;17) (PLZF/RAR\u03b1). Patients with significant arrhythmias, EKG \nabnormalities (congenital long QT syndrome, history or presence of significant ventricular or atrial \ntachyarrhythmia, clinically significant resting bradycardia (<50 beats per minute), QTc > 450 msec on \nscreening EKG, right bundle branch block plus left anterior hemiblock, bifascicular block) or \nneuropathy were excluded from the study. Patients in the ATRA + arsenic trioxide treatment group \nreceived oral ATRA at 45 mg/m2 daily and iv arsenic trioxide at 0.15 mg/kg daily until CR. During \nconsolidation, ATRA was given at the same dose for periods of 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off for a total \nof 7 courses, and arsenic trioxide was given at the same dose 5 days per week, 4 weeks on and 4 \nweeks off, for a total of 4 courses. Patients in the ATRA + chemotherapy treatment group received iv \nidarubicin at 12 mg/m2 on days 2, 4, 6, and 8 and oral ATRA at 45 mg/m2 daily until CR. During \nconsolidation, patients received idarubicin at 5 mg/m2 on days 1 to 4 and ATRA at 45 mg/m2 daily for \n15 days, then iv mitoxantrone at 10 mg/m2 on days 1 to 5 and ATRA again at 45 mg/m2 daily for 15 \ndays, and finally a single dose of idarubicin at 12 mg/m2 and ATRA at 45 mg/m2 daily for 15 days. \nEach course of consolidation was initiated at hematological recovery from the previous course defined \nas absolute neutrophil count >1.5\u00d7109/L and platelets >100\u00d7109/L. Patients in the \nATRA + chemotherapy treatment group also received maintenance treatment for up to 2 years, \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n12 \n\nconsisting of oral 6-mercaptopurine at 50 mg/m2 daily, intramuscular methotrexate at 15 mg/m2 \nweekly, and ATRA at 45 mg/m2 daily for 15 days every 3 months.  \n \nThe key efficacy results are summarised in table 3 below: \n \nTable 3 \n\nEndpoint ATRA + \nArsenic trioxide \n(n = 77) \n[%] \n\nATRA + \nChemotherapy \n(n = 79) \n[%] \n\nConfidence \ninterval (CI) \n\nP-value \n\n2-Year event-free \nsurvival (EFS)  97 86 \n\n95% CI for the \ndifference, \n2-22 \npercentage \npoints \n\np<0.001 \nfor noninferiority \n \np = 0.02 \nfor superiority of \nATRA + arsenic \ntrioxide \n\nHematologic \ncomplete remission \n(HCR)  \n\n100 95  p = 0.12 \n\n2-Year overall \nsurvival (OS)  99 91  p = 0.02 \n\n2-Year disease-free \nsurvival (DFS)  97 90  p = 0.11 \n\n2-Year cumulative \nincidence of \nrelapse (CIR)  \n\n1 6  p = 0.24 \n\nAPL = acute promyelocytic leukemia; ATRA = all-trans-retinoic acid \n \nRelapsed/refractory APL  \nArsenic trioxide has been investigated in 52 APL patients, previously treated with an anthracycline \nand a retinoid regimen, in two open-label, single-arm, non-comparative studies. One was a single \ninvestigator clinical study (n=12) and the other was a multicentre, 9-institution study (n=40). Patients \nin the first study received a median dose of 0.16 mg/kg/day of arsenic trioxide (range 0.06 to \n0.20 mg/kg/day) and patients in the multicentre study received a fixed dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day. \nArsenic trioxide was administered intravenously over 1 to 2 hours until the bone marrow was free of \nleukaemic cells, up to a maximum of 60 days. Patients with complete remission received consolidation \ntherapy with arsenic trioxide for 25 additional doses over a 5-week period. Consolidation therapy \nbegan 6 weeks (range, 3-8) after induction in the single institution study and 4 weeks (range, 3-6) in \nthe multicentre study. Complete remission (CR) was defined as the absence of visible leukaemic cells \nin the bone marrow and peripheral recovery of platelets and white blood cells. \nPatients in the single centre study had relapsed following 1-6 prior therapy regimens and 2 patients \nhad relapsed following stem cell transplantation. Patients in the multicentre study had relapsed \nfollowing 1-4 prior therapy regimens and 5 patients had relapsed following stem cell transplantation. \nThe median age in the single centre study was 33 years (age range 9 to 75). The median age in the \nmulticentre study was 40 years (age range 5 to 73).  \n \nThe results are summarised in the table 4 below.  \n \nTable 4 \n\n Single centre trial \nN=12 \n\nMulticentre trial \nN=40 \n\nArsenic trioxide dose, \nmg/kg/day (median, range)  \n\n0.16 (0.06 \u2013 0.20) 0.15 \n\nComplete remission  11 (92%) 34 (85%) \nTime to bone marrow \nremission (median)  \n\n32 days 35 days \n\n\n\n13 \n\nTime to CR (median)  54 days 59 days \n18-Month survival  67% 66% \n\n \nThe single institution study included 2 paediatric patients (< 18 years old), both of whom achieved \nCR. The multicentre trial included 5 paediatric patients (< 18 years old), 3 of whom achieved CR. No \nchildren of less than 5 years of age were treated.  \n \nIn a follow-up treatment after consolidation, 7 patients in the single institution study and 18 patients in \nthe multicentre study received further maintenance therapy with arsenic trioxide. Three patients from \nthe single institution study and 15 patients from the multicentre study had stem cell transplants after \ncompleting arsenic trioxide. The Kaplan-Meier median CR duration for the single institution study is \n14 months and has not been reached for the multicentre study. At last follow-up, 6 of 12 patients in the \nsingle institution study were alive with a median follow-up time of 28 months (range 25 to 29). In the \nmulticentre study 27 of 40 patients were alive with a median follow-up time of 16 months (range 9 to \n25). Kaplan-Meier estimates of 18-month survival for each study are shown below. \n \n\n \n \nCytogenetic confirmation of conversion to a normal genotype and reverse transcriptase - polymerase \nchain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of PML/RAR\u03b1 conversion to normal are shown in table 5 below. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nCytogenetics after arsenic trioxide therapy \n \nTable 5 \n\n Single centre pilot trial \nN with CR = 11 \n\nMulticentre trial \nN with CR = 34 \n\nConventional \nCytogenetics \n[t(15;17)] \n\n  \n\nAbsent 8 (73%) 31 (91%) \nPresent 1 (9%) 0% \nNot evaluable 2 (18%) 3 (9%) \n\nRT-PCR for PML/ \nRAR\u03b1   \n\nNegative 8 (73%) 27 (79%) \nPositive 3 (27%) 4 (12%) \nNot evaluable 0 3 (9%) \n\n \nResponses were seen across all age groups tested, ranging from 6 to 75 years. The response rate was \nsimilar for both genders. There is no experience on the effect of arsenic trioxide on the variant APL \ncontaining the t(11;17) and t(5;17) chromosomal translocations.  \n \nPaediatric population  \nThe experience in children is limited. Of 7 patients under 18 years of age (range 5 to 16 years) treated \nwith arsenic trioxide at the recommended dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day, 5 patients achieved a complete \nresponse (see section 4.2). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe inorganic, lyophilized form of arsenic trioxide, when placed into solution, immediately forms the \nhydrolysis product arsenious acid (AsIII). AsIII is the pharmacologically active species of arsenic \ntrioxide.  \n \nDistribution  \nThe volume of distribution (Vd) for AsIII is large (>400 L) indicating significant distribution into the \ntissues with negligible protein binding. Vd is also weight dependent, increasing with increasing body \nweight. Total arsenic accumulates mainly in the liver, kidney, and heart and, to a lesser extent, in the \nlung, hair, and nails.  \n \nBiotransformation  \nThe metabolism of arsenic trioxide involves oxidation of arsenious acid (AsIII), the active species of \narsenic trioxide, to arsenic acid (AsV), as well as oxidative methylation to monomethylarsonic acid \n(MMAV) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAV) by methyltransferases, primarily in the liver. The \npentavalent metabolites, MMAV and DMAV, are slow to appear in plasma (approximately 10-24 hours \nafter first administration of arsenic trioxide), but due to their longer half-life, accumulate more upon \nmultiple dosing than does AsIII. The extent of accumulation of these metabolites is dependent on the \ndosing regimen. Approximate accumulation ranged from 1.4- to 8-fold following multiple as \ncompared to single dose administration. AsV is present in plasma only at relatively low levels.  \n \nIn vitro enzymatic studies with human liver microsomes revealed that arsenic trioxide has no \ninhibitory activity on substrates of the major cytochrome P450 enzymes such as 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, \n2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4/5, 4A9/11. Substances that are substrates for these P450 enzymes are not \nexpected to interact with Arsenic trioxide Mylan. \n \nElimination  \n\n\n\n15 \n\nApproximately 15% of the administered Arsenic trioxide Mylan dose is excreted in the urine as \nunchanged AsIII. The methylated metabolites of AsIII (MMAV, DMAV) are primarily excreted in the \nurine. The plasma concentration of AsIII declines from peak plasma concentration in a biphasic manner \nwith a mean terminal elimination half-life of 10 to 14 hours. The total clearance of AsIII over the \nsingle-dose range of 7-32 mg (administered as 0.15 mg/kg) is 49 L/h and the renal clearance is 9 L/h. \nClearance is not dependent on the weight of the subject or the dose administered over the dose range \nstudied. The mean estimated terminal elimination half-lives of the metabolites MMAV and DMAV are \n32 hours and 70 hours, respectively.  \n \nRenal impairment  \nPlasma clearance of AsIII was not altered in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance \nof 50-80 mL/min) or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30-49 mL/min). The plasma \nclearance of AsIII in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min) \nwas 40% lower when compared with patients with normal renal function (see section 4.4).  \n \nSystemic exposure to MMAV and DMAV tended to be larger in patients with renal impairment; the \nclinical consequence of this is unknown but no increased toxicity was noted.  \n \nHepatic impairment  \nPharmacokinetic data from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma having mild to moderate hepatic \nimpairment indicate that AsIII or AsV do not accumulate following twice-weekly infusions. No clear \ntrend toward an increase in systemic exposure to AsIII, AsV, MMAV or DMAV was observed with \ndecreasing level of hepatic function as assessed by dose-normalized (per mg dose) AUC.  \n \nLinearity/non-linearity  \nIn the total single dose range of 7 to 32 mg (administered as 0.15 mg/kg), systemic exposure (AUC) \nappears to be linear. The decline from peak plasma concentration of AsIII occurs in a biphasic manner \nand is characterized by an initial rapid distribution phase followed by a slower terminal elimination \nphase. After administration at 0.15 mg/kg on a daily (n=6) or twice-weekly (n=3) regimen, an \napproximate 2-fold accumulation of AsIII was observed as compared to a single infusion. This \naccumulation was slightly more than expected based on single-dose results. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nLimited reproductive toxicity studies of arsenic trioxide in animals indicate embryotoxicity and \nteratogenicity (neural tube defects, anophthalmia and microphthalmia) at administration of 1-10 times \nthe recommended clinical dose (mg/m2). Fertility studies have not been conducted with Arsenic \ntrioxide Mylan. Arsenic compounds induce chromosomal aberrations and morphological \ntransformations of mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo. No formal carcinogenicity studies of arsenic \ntrioxide have been performed. However, arsenic trioxide and other inorganic arsenic compounds are \nrecognised as human carcinogens. \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Arsenic trioxide Mylan is and what it is used for \n \nArsenic trioxide Mylan is used in adult patients with newly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk acute \npromyelocytic leukaemia (APL), and in adult patients, whose disease has not responded to other \ntherapies. APL is a unique type of myeloid leukaemia, a disease in which abnormal white blood cells \nand abnormal bleeding and bruising occur. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Arsenic trioxide Mylan \n \nArsenic trioxide Mylan must be given under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of acute leukaemias.  \n \nYou must not receive Arsenic trioxide Mylan \nIf you are allergic to arsenic trioxide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nYou must talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Arsenic trioxide Mylan, if \n- you have impaired kidney function. \n- you have any liver problems. \n \nYour doctor will take the following precautions:  \n- Tests will be performed to check the amount of potassium, magnesium, calcium and creatinine \n\nin your blood before your first dose of Arsenic trioxide Mylan.  \n- You should have an electrical recording of the heart (electrocardiogram ECG) performed before \n\nyour first dose.  \n- Blood tests (potassium, magnesium, calcium, liver function) should be repeated during your \n\ntreatment with Arsenic trioxide Mylan. \n- In addition, you will receive electrocardiograms twice weekly.  \n- If you are at risk for a certain type of abnormal heart rhythm (e.g. torsade de pointes or QTc \n\nprolongation), your heart will be monitored continuously.  \n- Your doctor may monitor your health during and after treatment, since arsenic trioxide, the \n\nactive substance in Arsenic trioxide Mylan, may cause other cancers. You should report any \nnew and exceptional symptoms and circumstances whenever you see your doctor.  \n\n\n\n27 \n\n- Follow-up of your cognitive and mobility functions if you are at risk for vitamin B1 deficiency.  \n \nChildren and adolescents  \nArsenic trioxide Mylan is not recommended in children and adolescents below 18 years of age.  \n \nOther medicines and Arsenic trioxide Mylan \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.   \n \nIn particular tell your doctor  \n- if you are taking any of various types of medicines which could cause a change in the rhythm of \n\nyour heartbeat. These include:  \n\u2022 some types of antiarrhythmics (medicines used to correct irregular heart beats, e.g. \n\nquinidine, amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide)  \n\u2022 medicines to treat psychosis (loss of contact with reality, e.g. thioridazine)  \n\u2022 medicines for depression (e.g. amitriptyline)  \n\u2022 some types of medicines to treat bacterial infections (e.g. erythromycin and sparfloxacin)  \n\u2022 some medicines to treat allergies such as hayfever, called antihistamines (e.g. terfenadine \n\nand astemizole)  \n\u2022 any medicines that cause a decrease in magnesium or potassium in your blood (e.g. \n\namphotericin B)  \n\u2022 cisapride (a medicine used to relieve certain stomach problems).  \n\nThe effect of these medicines on your heartbeat can be made worse by Arsenic trioxide Mylan. \nYou must be sure to tell your doctor about all medicines you are taking.  \n\n- if you are taking or have recently taken any medicine which may affect your liver. If you are not \nsure, show the bottle or pack to your doctor.  \n\n \nArsenic trioxide Mylan with food and drink  \nThere are no restrictions on your food or drink while you are receiving Arsenic trioxide Mylan.  \n \nPregnancy  \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.  \nArsenic trioxide Mylan may cause harm to the foetus when used by pregnant women.  \nIf you are able to become pregnant, you must use effective birth control during treatment with Arsenic \ntrioxide Mylan.  \nIf you are pregnant or you become pregnant during the treatment with Arsenic trioxide Mylan, you \nmust ask your doctor for advice.  \nMen should also use effective contraception during treatment with Arsenic trioxide Mylan.  \n \nBreast-feeding  \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.  \nThe arsenic in Arsenic trioxide Mylan passes into breast milk.  \nBecause Arsenic trioxide Mylan can harm nursing infants, do not breast-feed while on Arsenic \ntrioxide Mylan. \n \nDriving and using machines  \nArsenic trioxide Mylan is expected to have no or negligible influence on your ability to drive and use \nmachines.  \nIf you experience discomfort or if you feel unwell after a Arsenic trioxide Mylan injection, you should \nwait until the symptoms go away before driving or using machines.  \n \nArsenic trioxide Mylan contains sodium  \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\n3. How to use Arsenic trioxide Mylan \n \nDuration and frequency of treatment  \n \nPatients with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukaemia  \nYour doctor will give you Arsenic trioxide Mylan once every day as an infusion. In your first \ntreatment cycle, you may be treated every day up to 60 days at most or until your doctor determines \nthat your disease is better. If your disease responds to Arsenic trioxide Mylan, you will be given 4 \nadditional treatment cycles.
