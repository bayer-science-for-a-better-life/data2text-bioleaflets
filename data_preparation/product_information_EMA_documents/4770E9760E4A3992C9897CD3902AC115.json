NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nZOSTAVAX powder and solvent for suspension for injection\nZOSTAVAX powder and solvent for suspension for injection in a pre-filled syringe\n\nshingles (herpes zoster) vaccine (live)\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nAfter reconstitution, 1 dose (0.65 mL) contains: \n\nVaricella-zoster virus1, Oka/Merck strain, (live, attenuated) not less than 19,400 PFU2\n1\nproduced in human diploid (MRC-5) cells\n\n2PFU = Plaque-forming units\n\nThis vaccine may contain traces of neomycin. See sections 4.3 and 4.4.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder and solvent for suspension for injection.\n\nThe powder is a white to off-white compact crystalline plug.\nThe solvent is a clear, colourless fluid.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nZOSTAVAX is indicated for prevention of herpes zoster (“zoster” or shingles) and herpes \nzoster-related post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN).\n\nZOSTAVAX is indicated for immunization of individuals 50 years of age or older.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nIndividuals should receive a single dose (0.65 mL).\n\nThe need for a booster dose is not known. See sections 4.8 and 5.1.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety and efficacy of ZOSTAVAX in children and adolescents have not been established. No \ndata are available.\n\nThere is no relevant use of ZOSTAVAX in children and adolescents for prevention of primary \nvaricella infection (chickenpox).\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThe vaccine can be injected subcutaneously (SC) or intramuscularly (IM), preferably in the deltoid \nregion (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).\n\nThe vaccine should be administered subcutaneously in patients with severe thrombocytopenia or any \ncoagulation disorder (see section 4.4).\n\nThe vaccine should under no circumstances be injected intravascularly.\n\nFor precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product see section 6.6.\n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n History of hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients or trace residuals \n(e.g. neomycin) (see sections 4.4 and 6.1).\n\n Primary and acquired immunodeficiency states due to conditions such as: acute and chronic \nleukaemias; lymphoma; other conditions affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system; \nimmunosuppression due to HIV/AIDS (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1); cellular immune \ndeficiencies.\n\n Immunosuppressive therapy (including high-dose corticosteroids) (see sections 4.4 and 4.8);\nhowever, ZOSTAVAX is not contraindicated for use in individuals who are receiving \ntopical/inhaled corticosteroids or low-dose systemic corticosteroids or in patients who are \nreceiving corticosteroids as replacement therapy, e.g., for adrenal insufficiency (see sections 4.8 \nand 5.1).\n\n Active untreated tuberculosis.\n Pregnancy. Furthermore, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month following vaccination (see \n\nsection 4.6).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nAppropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare \nanaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction following the administration of the vaccine, as there is a \npossibility of hypersensitivity reactions, not only to the active substances, but also to the excipients \nand trace residuals (e.g. neomycin) present in the vaccine (see sections 4.3, 4.8 and 6.1).\n\nNeomycin allergy generally manifests as a contact dermatitis. However, a history of contact dermatitis \ndue to neomycin is not a contraindication to receiving live virus vaccines.\n\nZOSTAVAX is a live, attenuated varicella-zoster vaccine and administration to individuals who are \nimmunosuppressed or immunodeficient may result in disseminated varicella-zoster virus disease, \nincluding fatal outcomes. Patients who previously received immune suppressive therapy should be \ncarefully evaluated for the reconstitution of the immune system prior to receiving Zostavax (see \nsection 4.3). \n\nThe safety and efficacy of ZOSTAVAX have not been established in adults who are known to be \ninfected with HIV with or without evidence of immunosuppression (see section 4.3) however, a phase \nII safety and immunogenicity study in HIV-infected adults with conserved immune function (CD 4+T \ncell count ≥ 200 cells/µL) has been completed (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).\n\nThis vaccine should be given subcutaneously to individuals with severe thrombocytopenia or any \ncoagulation disorder, because these individuals may bleed following intramuscular injections.\n\nZOSTAVAX is not indicated for treatment of zoster or PHN.\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nImmunisation should be postponed in individuals suffering from moderate to severe acute febrile \nillness or infection.\n\nAs for any vaccine, vaccination with ZOSTAVAX may not result in protection in all vaccine \nrecipients. See section 5.1.\n\nTransmission\nIn clinical trials with ZOSTAVAX, transmission of the vaccine virus has not been reported. However, \npost-marketing experience with varicella vaccines suggests that transmission of vaccine virus may \noccur rarely between vaccinees who develop a varicella-like rash and susceptible contacts [for \nexample, varicella-zoster virus (VZV) susceptible infant grandchildren]. Transmission of vaccine virus \nfrom varicella vaccine recipients who do not develop a varicella-like rash has also been reported. This \nis a theoretical risk for vaccination with ZOSTAVAX. The risk of transmitting the attenuated vaccine \nvirus from a vaccinee to a susceptible contact should be weighed against the risk of developing natural \nzoster and potentially transmitting wild-type VZV to a susceptible contact.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nZOSTAVAX can be administered concomitantly with inactivated influenza vaccine as separate \ninjections and at different body sites (see section 5.1).\n\nThe concomitant use of ZOSTAVAX and a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine resulted \nin reduced immunogenicity of ZOSTAVAX in a small clinical trial. However, data collected in a large \nobservational study did not indicate increased risk for developing herpes zoster after concomitant \nadministration of the two vaccines.\n\nNo data are currently available regarding concomitant use with other vaccines.\n\nConcurrent administration of ZOSTAVAX and anti-viral medications known to be effective against \nVZV has not been evaluated.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no data on the use of ZOSTAVAX in pregnant women. Traditional non-clinical studies are \ninsufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). However naturally-occurring \nvaricella-zoster virus infection is known to sometimes cause foetal harm. ZOSTAVAX is not \nrecommended to be administered to pregnant women. In any case, pregnancy should be avoided for \none month following vaccination (see section 4.3).\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether VZV is secreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be \nexcluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to not administer \nZOSTAVAX taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \nvaccination for the woman.\n\nFertility\nZOSTAVAX has not been evaluated in fertility studies.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive or use machines have been performed. However, \nZOSTAVAX is expected to have no or negligible influence on ability to drive and use machines.\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\na. Summary of the safety profile\n\nThe most common adverse reactions reported in pivotal clinical trials were injection-site reactions. \nHeadache and pain in the extremity were the most common systemic adverse reactions. Most of these \nlocal and systemic adverse reactions were reported as mild in intensity. Vaccine-related serious \nadverse reactions were reported for 0.01% subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX and subjects who \nreceived placebo.\n\nData from a clinical trial (n=368) demonstrated that the current refrigerated formulation has a safety \nprofile comparable to that of the frozen formulation.\n\nb. Tabulated summary of adverse events\n\nIn clinical trials, general safety has been evaluated in more than 57,000 adults vaccinated with \nZOSTAVAX.\nTable 1 presents vaccine-related injection-site and systemic adverse reactions reported at a \nsignificantly greater incidence in the vaccine group versus the placebo group within 42 days post-\nvaccination in the ZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety trial (ZEST) study and in the Adverse Event \nMonitoring Substudy of Shingles Prevention Study (SPS).\n\nAdditional adverse reactions, spontaneously reported through post-marketing surveillance, are also \nincluded in Table 1. As these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is \nnot possible to reliably calculate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure. \nConsequently, the frequencies of these adverse reactions have been estimated based on the adverse \nevents reported in SPS and ZEST (regardless of vaccine relationship assigned by the investigator).\n\nThe adverse reactions are assigned frequency categories using the following convention:\nVery Common (≥1/10); \nCommon (≥1/100 to <1/10); \nUncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); \nRare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); \nVery rare (<1/10,000)\n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nTable 1: Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trial Experience and Post-Marketing Surveillance\n\nMedDRA System Organ Class Adverse reaction terms Frequency\n\nInfections and infestations Varicella, Herpes zoster (vaccine strain) Very rare\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders\n\nLymphadenopathy (cervical, axillary) Uncommon\n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity reactions including \nanaphylactic reactions\n\nRare\n\nNervous system disorders Headache1 Common\nEye Disorders Necrotizing retinitis (patients on \n\nimmunosuppressive therapy)\nVery rare\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea Uncommon\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nRash Common\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders\n\nArthralgia, Myalgia, Pain in extremity1 Common\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nInjection site: Erythema\n1,2\n\n, Pain/tenderness\n1,2\n\n,\n\nPruritus\n1,2, Swelling\n\n1,2\n\nInjection site: Induration1, Haematoma1, \nWarmth1, Rash, Pyrexia\n\nInjection site urticaria\n\nVery common\n\nCommon\n\nRare\n1 Clinical trials experience.\n2 Solicited adverse reaction within 5 days post-vaccination.\n\nc. Description of selected adverse reactions\n\nInjection site reactions\nVaccine-related injection-site adverse reactions were significantly greater for subjects vaccinated with \nZOSTAVAX versus subjects who received placebo. In SPS, the overall incidence of vaccine-related \ninjection-site adverse reactions were 48% for ZOSTAVAX and 17% for placebo in subjects 60 years \nof age and older.\n\nIn ZEST, the overall incidence of vaccine-related injection site adverse reactions were 63.9% for \nZOSTAVAX and 14.4% for placebo in subjects 50 to 59 years of age. Most of these adverse reactions \nwere reported as mild in intensity.\n\nIn other clinical trials evaluating ZOSTAVAX in subjects 50 years of age or older, including a study \nof concomitantly administered inactivated influenza vaccine, a higher rate of injection-site adverse \nexperiences of mild-to-moderate intensity was reported among subjects 50-59 years of age compared \nwith subjects ≥60 years of age (see section 5.1).\n\nZOSTAVAX was administered either subcutaneously (SC) or intramuscularly (IM) in subjects \n50 years of age or older (see section 5.1). The general safety profiles of the SC and IM routes were \notherwise comparable, but injection-site adverse reactions were significantly less frequent in the IM \ngroup (34%) compared with the SC group (64%).\n\nHerpes zoster/herpes zoster-like rashes and Varicella/varicella-like rashes in clinical trials\nIn clinical trials the number of herpes zoster/herpes zoster-like rashes within the 42-day post-\nvaccination was low in both ZOSTAVAX and placebo groups. The majority of rashes have been rated \nas mild to moderate; no complications from rash have been observed in the clinical setting. Most of \nthe reporting rashes that were VZV positive by PCR analysis were associated with wild-type VZV.\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\nIn SPS and ZEST, the number of subjects who reported herpes zoster/herpes zoster-like rashes was \nless than 0.2% for ZOSTAVAX and placebo groups, with no significant difference observed between \nthe two groups. The number of subjects who reported varicella/varicella-like rashes was less than \n0.7% for ZOSTAVAX and placebo.\n\nThe Oka/Merck strain of VZV was not detected from any specimens in SPS or ZEST. VZV was \ndetected in one (0.01%) specimen from a ZOSTAVAX recipient reporting a varicella/varicella-like \nrash; however, the virus strain (wild type or Oka/Merck strain) could not be determined. Across all \nother clinical trials, the Oka/Merck strain was identified by PCR analysis from the lesion specimens of \nonly two subjects who reported varicella-like rashes (onset on Day 8 and 17).\n\nd. Special populations\n\nAdults with a history of herpes zoster (HZ) prior to vaccination\nZOSTAVAX was administered to subjects 50 years of age or older with a history of herpes zoster \n(HZ) prior to vaccination (see section 5.1). The safety profile was generally similar to that seen in the \nAdverse Event Monitoring Substudy of the SPS. \n\nAdults on chronic/maintenance systemic corticosteroids\nIn subjects 60 years of age or older who were receiving chronic/maintenance systemic corticosteroid \ntherapy at a daily dose equivalent of 5 to 20 mg of prednisone for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment, \nand 6 weeks or more following vaccination, the safety profile was generally comparable to that seen in \nthe Adverse Event Monitoring Substudy of the SPS (see sections 4.3 and 5.1).\n\nHIV-infected adults with conserved immune function\nIn a clinical trial, ZOSTAVAX was administered to HIV-infected adults (18 years of age or older, \nCD4+ T cell count ≥ 200 cells/µL) (see section 5.1). The safety profile was generally similar to the \nAdverse Event Monitoring Substudy of the SPS. Adverse events were followed up to Day 42 post \nvaccination and serious adverse events throughout the entire study period (i.e. through Day 180). Of \nthe 295 ZOSTAVAX recipients, one case of serious vaccine related maculo-papular rash was reported \non Day 4 following Dose 1 of ZOSTAVAX (see section 4.3). \n\nVZV-seronegative adults\nBased on limited data from 2 clinical trials that enrolled VZV-seronegative or low seropositive \nsubjects (30 years of age or older) receiving live attenuated zoster vaccine, injection site and systemic \nadverse experiences were generally similar to those reported by other subjects who received \nZOSTAVAX in clinical trials, with 2 of the 27 subjects reporting fever. No subjects reported \nvaricella-like or herpes zoster-like rashes. No serious vaccine-related adverse experiences were \nreported.\n\ne. Other studies\n\nAdults receiving additional doses/revaccination \nIn a clinical study, adults 60 years of age or older received a second dose of ZOSTAVAX 42 days \nfollowing the initial dose (see section 5.1). The frequency of vaccine-related adverse experiences after \nthe second dose of ZOSTAVAX was generally similar to that seen with the first dose.\n\nIn another study, ZOSTAVAX was administered as a booster dose to HZ history-negative subjects \n70 years of age or older who had received a first dose approximately 10 years previously, and as a first \ndose to HZ history-negative subjects 70 years of age or older (see section 5.1). The frequency of \nvaccine-related adverse experiences after the booster dose of ZOSTAVAX was generally similar to \nthat seen with the first dose.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nAdministration of a higher than recommended dose of ZOSTAVAX was reported rarely and the \nadverse reaction profile was comparable to that observed with the recommended dose of \nZOSTAVAX.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Viral Vaccine; ATC code: J07BK02\n\nMechanism of action\nAnyone who has been infected with VZV, including those without a clinical history of varicella, is at \nrisk for developing zoster. This risk appears to be causally related to a decline in VZV-specific \nimmunity. ZOSTAVAX was shown to boost VZV-specific immunity, which is thought to be the \nmechanism by which it protects against zoster and its complications (See Immunogenicity).\n\nClinical Efficacy\nThe protective clinical efficacy of ZOSTAVAX was demonstrated in two large, randomised, placebo \ncontrolled clinical trials where subjects received ZOSTAVAX subcutaneously (see Tables 2 and 3).\n\nZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety Trial (ZEST) in subjects 50 to 59 years of age:\nThe ZEST study was a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial in which 22,439 subjects were \nrandomised to receive a single dose of either ZOSTAVAX or placebo and were followed for the \ndevelopment of zoster for a median of 1.3 years (range 0 to 2 years). Final determination of zoster \ncases was made by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) [86%], or in the absence of virus detection, as \ndetermined by a clinical evaluation committee [14%]. ZOSTAVAX significantly decreased the \nincidence of zoster compared to placebo (see Table 2).\n\nTable 2: Efficacy of ZOSTAVAX on zoster incidence compared with placebo in the ZEST trial \nin subjects 50 to 59 years of age*\n\nZOSTAVAX Placebo Vaccine efficacy\n(95% CI)\n\nNumber \nof \n\nsubjects\n\nNumber \nof \n\nzoster \ncases\n\nIncidence \nrate of \n\nzoster per \n1,000 \nperson \nyears\n\nNumber \nof \n\nsubjects\n\nNumber \nof \n\nzoster \ncases\n\nIncidence \nrate of \n\nzoster per \n1,000 \nperson \nyears\n\n11,211 30 2.0 11,228 99 6.6 70%\n(54%, 81%)\n\n*The analysis was performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population that included all subjects randomised in the ZEST study\n\nShingles Prevention Study (SPS) in Subjects 60 years of age and older:\nThe SPS study was a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial in which 38,546 subjects were \nrandomised to receive a single dose of either ZOSTAVAX or placebo and were followed for the \ndevelopment of zoster for a median of 3.1 years (range 31 days to 4.9 years).\n\nZOSTAVAX significantly decreased the incidence of zoster compared with placebo (see Table 3).\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9\n\nTable 3: Efficacy of ZOSTAVAX on zoster incidence compared with placebo in the SPS in \nsubjects 60 years of age and older*\n\nAge \ngroup†\n\nZOSTAVAX Placebo Vaccine \nefficacy\n\n(95% CI)Number \nof \n\nsubjects\n\nNumber \nof zoster \n\ncases\n\nIncidence \nrate of \n\nzoster per \n1,000 \nperson \nyears\n\nNumber \nof \n\nsubjects\n\nNumber \nof zoster \n\ncases\n\nIncidence \nrate of \n\nzoster per \n1,000 \nperson \nyears\n\n≥ 60 19,254 315 5.4 19,247 642 11.1 51% (44%, \n58%)\n\n60-69 10,370 122 3.9 10,356 334 10.8 64% (56%, \n71%)\n\n≥ 70 8,884 193 7.2 8,891 308 11.5 38% (25%, \n48%)\n\n70-79 7,621 156 6.7 7,559 261 11.4 41% (28%,\n52%)\n\n* The analysis was performed on the Modified Intent-To-Treat (MITT) population that included all subjects randomised in \nthe study who were followed for at least 30 days post-vaccination and did not develop an evaluable case of zoster within the \nfirst 30 days post vaccination\n† Age strata at randomisation were 60-69 and ≥ 70 years of age\n\nIn the SPS, the reduction in zoster was seen in almost all dermatomes. Ophthalmic zoster occurred in \n35 subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX vs. 69 subjects who received placebo. Impaired vision \noccurred in 2 subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX vs. 9 who received placebo.\n\nZOSTAVAX significantly decreased the incidence of Post-herpetic Neuralgia (PHN) compared with \nplacebo (see Table 4). In subjects who developed zoster, ZOSTAVAX decreased the risk of \nsubsequently developing PHN. In the vaccine group, the risk of developing PHN after zoster was 9 % \n(27/315), while in the placebo group it was 13 % (80/642). This effect was more prominent in the \ngroup of older subjects (≥70 years of age), where the risk of developing PHN after zoster was reduced \nto 10% in the vaccine group vs. 19% for the placebo group.\n\n \n\n\n\n10\n\nTable 4: Efficacy of ZOSTAVAX on PHN† incidence compared with placebo in the SPS in \nsubjects 60 years of age and older*\n\nAge \ngroup‡\n\nZOSTAVAX Placebo Vaccine \nefficacy (95% \n\nCI)Number \nof \n\nsubjects\n\nNumber \nof PHN \ncases\n\nIncidence \nrate of \n\nPHN per \n1,000 \nperson \nyears\n\nNumber of \nsubjects\n\nNumber \nof PHN \ncases\n\nIncidence \nrate of \n\nPHN per \n1,000 \nperson \nyears\n\n≥ 60 19,254 27 0.5 19,247 80 1.4 67%§\n\n(48%, 79%)\n60-69 10,370 8 0.3 10,356 23 0.7 66%\n\n(20%, 87%)\n≥ 70 8,884 19 0.7 8,891 57 2.1 67%\n\n(43%, 81%)\n70-79 7,621 12 0.5 7,559 45 2.0 74%\n\n(49%, 87%)\n† PHN was defined as zoster-associated pain rated as ≥3 (on a 0-10 scale), persisting or appearing more than 90 days after \nonset of zoster rash using Zoster Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI).\n* The table is based on the Modified Intent-To-Treat (MITT) population that included all subjects randomised in the study \nwho were followed for at least 30 days post-vaccination and did not develop an evaluable case of zoster within the first 30 \ndays post-vaccination.\n‡ Age strata at randomisation were 60-69 and ≥70 years of age.\n§ Age-adjusted estimate based on the age strata (60-69 and ≥70 years of age) at randomisation.\n\nZOSTAVAX significantly reduced the zoster pain Burden of Illness (BOI) score (see Table 5).\n\nTable 5: Reduction of the zoster-associated pain by the BOI† score in the SPS in subjects \n60 years of age and older\n\nAge \ngroup‡\n\nZOSTAVAX Placebo Vaccine efficacy \n(95% CI)\n\nNumber \nof\n\nsubjects\n\nNumber \nof zoster \n\nconfirmed \ncases\n\nMean \nBOI \nscore\n\nNumber \nof\n\nsubjects\n\nNumber \nof zoster \n\nconfirmed \ncases\n\nMean \nBOI \nscore\n\n≥ 60 19,254 315 2.21 19,247 642 5.68 61% (51%, 69%)\n60-69 10,370 122 1.5 10,356 334 4.33 66% (52%, 76%)\n≥ 70 8,884 193 3.47 8,891 308 7.78 55% (40%, 67%)\n70-79 7,621 156 3.04 7,559 261 7.43 59% (43%, 71%)\n† The zoster pain BOI score is a composite score that incorporates the incidence, severity, and duration of acute and chronic \nzoster-associated pain over a 6 month follow-up period.\n‡ Age strata at randomisation were 60-69 and ≥70 years of age.\n\nPrevention of HZ cases with severe pain in the entire SPS study population\nZOSTAVAX reduced the incidence of zoster with severe and long-lasting pain (severity-by-duration \nscore >600) by 73% (95% CI: [46 to 87%]) compared with placebo (11 vs. 40 cases, respectively). \n\nReduction of zoster pain severity-by-duration in vaccinated individuals who developed zoster\nWith regard to the acute pain (pain between 0-30 days) there was no statistically significant difference \nbetween the vaccine group and the placebo group. \n\nHowever, among vaccinated individuals who developed PHN, ZOSTAVAX significantly reduced \nPHN-associated (chronic) pain compared with placebo. In the period from 90 days after rash onset to \nthe end of follow-up, there was a 57% reduction in the severity-by-duration score (average scores of \n347 for ZOSTAVAX and 805 for placebo; p=0.016).\n\n \n\n\n\n11\n\nOverall, among vaccinated individuals who developed zoster, ZOSTAVAX significantly reduced \noverall acute and chronic zoster-associated pain compared with placebo. Over the 6-month (acute and \nchronic) follow-up period, there was a 22% reduction (p =0.008) in the severity-by-duration score and \na 52% (95% CI: [7 to 74%]) reduction (from 6.2% to 3.5%) in the risk of having zoster with severe \nand long-lasting pain (severity-by-duration score of >600).\n\nZostavax persistence of protection\nThe persistence of protection following vaccination has been evaluated through longer-term follow-up \nin Short-term Persistence Substudy (STPS) and Long-term Persistence Substudy (LTPS) and supports \nthe continued benefit of ZOSTAVAX throughout the follow-up periods studied. The STPS was \ninitiated to accrue additional information on the persistence of vaccine efficacy for subjects who \nreceived ZOSTAVAX in SPS.\n\nPersistence of ZOSTAVAX efficacy was studied 4 to 7 years post-vaccination in the STPS, which \nincluded 7,320 subjects previously vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX and 6,950 subjects previously \nvaccinated with placebo in the SPS (mean age at enrollment was 73.3 years); and 7 to 10 years post-\nvaccination in the Long-term Persistence Substudy (LTPS), which included 6,867 subjects previously \nvaccinated with ZOSTAVAX (mean age at enrollment into the LTPS was 74.5 years). The median \nfollow-up was ~1.2 years (range is one day to 2.2 years) and ~3.9 years (range is one week to \n4.75 years) in STPS and LTPS, respectively. During the course of the STPS, placebo recipients were \noffered ZOSTAVAX, at which time they were considered to have completed the STPS. A concurrent \nplacebo control was not available in the LTPS; data from prior placebo recipients were used to \nestimate vaccine efficacy.\n\nIn the STPS, there were 84 evaluable zoster cases [8.4/1,000 person-years] in the ZOSTAVAX group \nand 95 evaluable cases [14.0/1,000 person-years] in the placebo group. The estimated vaccine efficacy \nduring the STPS follow-up period was 40% (95% CI: [18 to 56%]) for zoster incidence, 60% (95% CI: \n[-10 to 87%]) for PHN incidence and 50% (95% CI: [14 to 71%]) for zoster BOI.\n\nIn the LTPS, there were 263 evaluable zoster cases reported among 261 patients [10.3/1000 \nperson-years]. The estimated vaccine efficacy during the LTPS follow-up period was 21% (95% CI: \n[11 to 30%]) for zoster incidence, 35% (95% CI: [9 to 56%]) for PHN incidence and 37% (95% CI: \n[27 to 46%]) for zoster BOI.\n\nLong-term effectiveness study in individuals 50 years of age or older\nIn a large-scale ongoing US prospective observational cohort study of the long-term effectiveness of \nZOSTAVAX, individuals 50 years of age or older at the time of vaccination are being followed for the \noccurrence of HZ and PHN using validated endpoints.\n\nIn an interim analysis of the 2007 to 2014 study period, out of 1,355,720 study individuals, 392,677 \nreceived ZOSTAVAX. A total of 48,889 confirmed HZ cases and 3,316 confirmed PHN cases (>90 \ndays of zoster-associated pain) were observed. The results showed that ZOSTAVAX is effective in \nreducing HZ and PHN incidence in vaccinated individuals as compared to an unvaccinated reference \ngroup.\n\nVaccine effectiveness (VE) against HZ was evaluated for up to eight years postvaccination.

ZOSTAVAX elicited significantly higher VZV-specific immune responses at 6 weeks post-\nvaccination compared with placebo. \n\nZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety Trial (ZEST)\nWithin ZEST, immune responses to vaccination were evaluated in a random 10% subcohort (n=1,136 \nfor ZOSTAVAX and n=1,133 for placebo) of the subjects enrolled in the ZEST. ZOSTAVAX elicited\nsignificantly higher VZV-specific immune responses at 6 weeks post-vaccination compared with \nplacebo.\n\nWhen evaluated at 4 weeks post-vaccination, the immunogenicity of the current refrigerator-stable \nformulation was shown to be similar to the immunogenicity of the earlier frozen formulation of \nZOSTAVAX.\n\nSubjects who received ZOSTAVAX by SC (subcutaneous) or IM (intramuscular) route\nIn an open-label, randomised, controlled clinical trial, ZOSTAVAX was administered either by SC \nroute or by IM route to 353 subjects 50 years of age or older. Subjects with severe thrombocytopenia \nor any other coagulation disorder were excluded. The VZV specific immune responses to \nZOSTAVAX at Week 4 post-vaccination were comparable whether administered by SC or IM route.\n\n \n\n\n\n14\n\nConcomitant administration\nIn a double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 762 adults 50 years of age and older were randomised to \nreceive a single dose of ZOSTAVAX administered either concomitantly (N=382) or nonconcomitantly \n(N=380) with inactivated split influenza vaccine. The VZV-specific immune responses to both \nvaccines at 4 weeks post-vaccination were similar, whether administered concomitantly or \nnonconcomitantly.\n\nIn a double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 473 adults, 60 years of age or older, were randomised to \nreceive a single dose of ZOSTAVAX either concomitantly (N=237), or nonconcomitantly (N=236) \nwith 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. At four weeks post-vaccination, the \nVZV-specific immune responses following concomitant use were not similar to the VZV-specific \nimmune responses following nonconcomitant administration. However in a US effectiveness cohort \nstudy of 35,025 adults ≥ 60 years old, no increased risk of herpes zoster was observed in individuals \nwho received ZOSTAVAX and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine concomitantly \n(n=16,532) as compared to individuals receiving ZOSTAVAX one month to one year after 23-valent \npneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (n=18,493) in routine practice. The adjusted hazard ratio \ncomparing the incidence rate of HZ in the two groups was 1.04 (95% CI, 0.92, 1.16) over a median \nfollow-up of 4.7 years. The data do not indicate that concomitant administration alters the \neffectiveness of ZOSTAVAX.\n\nSubjects with a history of herpes zoster (HZ) prior to vaccination\nIn a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial, ZOSTAVAX was administered to \n100 subjects 50 years of age or older with a history of herpes zoster prior to vaccination to assess \nimmunogenicity and safety (see section 4.8) of ZOSTAVAX. ZOSTAVAX induced a significantly \nhigher VZV-specific immune response at 4 weeks post-vaccination, compared with placebo. \nVZV-specific immune responses were generally similar in subjects 50 to 59 compared to subjects \n≥60 years of age.\n\nAdults receiving additional doses/revaccination\nThe need for, or timing of, a booster dose with ZOSTAVAX has not yet been determined. In an \nopen-label study, ZOSTAVAX was administered as: (1) a booster dose to 201 zoster history-negative \nsubjects 70 years of age or older who had received a first dose approximately 10 years previously as \nparticipants in the SPS, and (2) a first dose to 199 zoster history-negative subjects 70 years of age or \nolder. The VZV-specific immune responses to vaccine 6 weeks post-vaccination was comparable in \nthe booster dose and first dose group.\n\nSubjects on chronic/maintenance systemic corticosteroids\nIn a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial, ZOSTAVAX was administered to \n206 subjects 60 years of age or older who were receiving chronic/maintenance systemic corticosteroid \ntherapy at a daily dose equivalent of 5 to 20 mg of prednisone for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment, \nand 6 weeks or more following vaccination to assess the immunogenicity and safety profile of \nZOSTAVAX. Compared with placebo, ZOSTAVAX induced a higher VZV-specific immune \nresponse at 6 weeks post-vaccination.\n\nHIV-infected adults with conserved immune function\nIn a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised clinical trial, ZOSTAVAX was administered to \nHIV-infected adults (18 years of age or older; median age 49 years) on appropriate antiretroviral \ntherapy with conserved immune function (CD4+ T cell count ≥ 200 cells/µL). Although, ZOSTAVAX \nis indicated as a single dose regimen (see section 4.2), a two-dose regimen was used. 286 subjects \nreceived two doses and 9 subjects received only one dose. The VZV-specific immune responses \nfollowing Doses 1 and 2 were similar (see section 4.3).\n\nImmunocompromised subjects\nThe vaccine has not been studied in subjects with impaired immunity.\n\n \n\n\n\n15\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nZOSTAVAX in all the subsets of paediatric population (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric \nuse).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nNot applicable.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nTraditional non-clinical studies were not performed, but there are no non-clinical concerns considered \nrelevant to clinical safety beyond data included in other sections of the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics (SmPC).\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This vaccine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.\n- If you get any of the side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What ZOSTAVAX is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you receive ZOSTAVAX\n3. How to use ZOSTAVAX\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store ZOSTAVAX\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What ZOSTAVAX is and what it is used for\n\nZOSTAVAX is a vaccine used to prevent shingles (zoster) and zoster-related post-herpetic neuralgia \n(PHN), the long-lasting nerve pain that follows shingles.\n\nZOSTAVAX is used to vaccinate individuals 50 years of age or older.\n\nZOSTAVAX cannot be used to treat existing shingles or the pain associated with existing shingles.\n\nDisease information on shingles:\n\nWhat is shingles?\n\nShingles is a painful, blistering rash. It usually occurs in one part of the body and can last for several \nweeks. It may lead to severe and long-lasting pain and scarring. Less commonly, bacterial skin \ninfections, weakness, muscle paralysis, loss of hearing or vision can occur. Shingles is caused by the \nsame virus that causes chickenpox. After you have had chickenpox, the virus that caused it stays in \nyour body in nerve cells. Sometimes, after many years, the virus becomes active again and causes \nshingles. \n\nWhat is PHN?\n\nAfter the shingles blisters heal, pain can last for months or years and may be severe. This long-lasting \nnerve pain is called post-herpetic neuralgia or PHN. \n\n2. What you need to know before you receive ZOSTAVAX\n\nDo not receive ZOSTAVAX\n\n if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to any of the components of this vaccine (including \nneomycin or any of the other ingredients listed in section 6)\n\n if you have a blood disorder or any type of cancer that weakens your immune system\n\n \n\n\n\n39\n\n if you have been told by your doctor that you have a weakened immune system as a result of a \ndisease, medicines, or other treatment\n\n if you have active untreated tuberculosis\n if you are pregnant (in addition, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month after vaccination, see \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding).\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nIf you have experienced any of the following, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before receiving \nZOSTAVAX:\n if you have or have had any medical problems or any allergies\n if you have a fever\n if you have HIV infection\n\nTell your doctor if you have ever had an allergic reaction to any of the ingredients (including \nneomycin or any of the ingredients listed under section 6) before you receive this vaccine.\n\nAs with many vaccines, ZOSTAVAX may not completely protect all persons who are vaccinated.\n\nIf you have a blood clotting disorder or low levels of platelets, the vaccine should be given under the \nskin because bleeding may occur following administration into the muscle.\n\nOther medicines and ZOSTAVAX\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines\nor vaccines.\n\nZOSTAVAX can be administered at the same time as inactivated influenza vaccine. The two vaccines \nshould be given as separate injections at different body sites.\n\nFor information about the administration of ZOSTAVAX and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine \nat the same time, talk to your doctor or health care provider.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\nZOSTAVAX should not be given to pregnant women. Women of child-bearing potential should take \nthe necessary precautions to avoid pregnancy for 1 month following vaccination. \n\nInform your doctor if you are breast-feeding or intending to breast-feed. Your doctor will decide if \nZOSTAVAX should be given.\n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before receiving this vaccine.\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nThere is no information to suggest that ZOSTAVAX affects the ability to drive or use machines.\n\nZOSTAVAX contains sodium\n\nZOSTAVAX contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free'.\n\n3. How to use ZOSTAVAX\n\nZOSTAVAX should be injected under the skin or into the muscle, preferably in the upper arm.\n\n \n\n\n\n40\n\nIf you have a blood clotting disorder or low levels of platelets in your blood, the injection will be \ngiven under the skin.\n\nZOSTAVAX is given as a single dose.\n\nReconstitution instructions intended for healthcare professionals are included at the end of the \nleaflet.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all vaccines and medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets \nthem.\n\nRarely (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people), allergic reactions may occur. Some of these reactions may \nbe serious and may include difficulty in breathing or swallowing. If you have an allergic reaction, call \nyour doctor right away.\n\nThe following side effects have been observed:\n Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): Redness, pain, swelling and itching at the \n\ninjection site* \n Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): Warmth, bruising, hard lump, and rash at the \n\ninjection site*; headache*; pain in the arm or leg*; joint pain, muscle pain; fever; rash \n Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): Nausea; swollen gland (neck, armpit)\n Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): Hives at the injection site\n Very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): Varicella (chicken pox); shingles; damage of \n\nretina caused by inflammation resulting in changes in sight (in patients under \nimmunosuppressive therapy).\n\n*These adverse reactions have been observed in clinical trials and through post-marketing \nsurveillance; most of those observed in clinical trials were reported as mild in intensity.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This vaccine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.\n- If you get any of the side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet.

How to store ZOSTAVAX\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What ZOSTAVAX is and what it is used for\n\nZOSTAVAX is a vaccine used to prevent shingles (zoster) and zoster-related post-herpetic neuralgia \n(PHN), the long-lasting nerve pain that follows shingles.\n\nZOSTAVAX is used to vaccinate individuals 50 years of age or older.\n\nZOSTAVAX cannot be used to treat existing shingles or the pain associated with existing shingles.\n\nDisease information on shingles:\n\nWhat is shingles?\n\nShingles is a painful, blistering rash. It usually occurs in one part of the body and can last for several \nweeks. It may lead to severe and long-lasting pain and scarring. Less commonly, bacterial skin \ninfections, weakness, muscle paralysis, loss of hearing or vision can occur. Shingles is caused by the \nsame virus that causes chickenpox. After you have had chickenpox, the virus that caused it stays in \nyour body in nerve cells. Sometimes, after many years, the virus becomes active again and causes \nshingles. \n\nWhat is PHN?\n\nAfter the shingles blisters heal, pain can last for months or years and may be severe. This long-lasting \nnerve pain is called post-herpetic neuralgia or PHN. \n\n2. What you need to know before you receive ZOSTAVAX\n\nDo not receive ZOSTAVAX\n\n if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to any of the components of this vaccine (including \nneomycin or any of the other ingredients listed in section 6)\n\n if you have a blood disorder or any type of cancer that weakens your immune system\n\n \n\n\n\n45\n\n if you have been told by your doctor that you have a weakened immune system as a result of a \ndisease, medicines, or other treatment\n\n if you have active untreated tuberculosis\n if you are pregnant (in addition, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month after vaccination, see\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding).\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nIf you have experienced any of the following, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before receiving\nZOSTAVAX:\n if you have or have had any medical problems or any allergies\n if you have a fever\n if you have HIV infection\n\nTell your doctor if you have ever had an allergic reaction to any of the ingredients (including \nneomycin or any of the ingredients listed under section 6) before you receive this vaccine.\n\nAs with many vaccines, ZOSTAVAX may not completely protect all persons who are vaccinated.\n\nIf you have a blood clotting disorder or low levels of platelets, the vaccine should be given under the \nskin because bleeding may occur following administration into the muscle.\n\nOther medicines and ZOSTAVAX\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines\nor vaccines.\n\nZOSTAVAX can be administered at the same time as inactivated influenza vaccine. The two vaccines \nshould be given as separate injections at different body sites.\n\nFor information about the administration of ZOSTAVAX and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine \nat the same time, talk to your doctor or health care provider.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\nZOSTAVAX should not be given to pregnant women. Women of child-bearing age should take the \nnecessary precautions to avoid pregnancy for 1 month following vaccination. \n\nInform your doctor if you are breast-feeding or intending to breast-feed. Your doctor will decide if \nZOSTAVAX should be given.\n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before receiving this vaccine.\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nThere is no information to suggest that ZOSTAVAX affects the ability to drive or use machines.\n\nZOSTAVAX contains sodium\n\nZOSTAVAX contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free'.\n\n3. How to use ZOSTAVAX\n\nZOSTAVAX should be injected under the skin or into the muscle, preferably in the upper arm.\n\n \n\n\n\n46\n\nIf you have a blood clotting disorder or low levels of platelets in your blood, the injection will be \ngiven under the skin.\n\nZOSTAVAX is given as a single dose.\n\nReconstitution instructions intended for healthcare professionals are included at the end of the \nleaflet.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all vaccines and medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets \nthem.\n\nRarely (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people), allergic reactions may occur. Some of these reactions may \nbe serious and may include difficulty in breathing or swallowing. If you have an allergic reaction, call \nyour doctor right away.\n\nThe following side effects have been observed:\n Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): Redness, pain, swelling and itching at the \n\ninjection site* \n Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): Warmth, bruising, hard lump, and rash at the \n\ninjection site*; headache*; pain in the arm or leg*; joint pain, muscle pain; fever; rash \n Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): Nausea; swollen gland (neck, armpit)\n Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): Hives at the injection site\n Very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): Varicella (chicken pox); shingles; damage of \n\nretina caused by inflammation resulting in changes in sight (in patients under \nimmunosuppressive therapy).\n\n*These adverse reactions have been observed in clinical trials and through post-marketing \nsurveillance; most of those observed in clinical trials were reported as mild in intensity.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.
