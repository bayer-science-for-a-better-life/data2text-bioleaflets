PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nTivicay 10 mg film-coated tablets \n \nWhite, round, biconvex tablets approximately 6 mm in diameter debossed with \u2018SV 572\u2019 on one side and \n\u201810\u2019 on the other side. \n \nTivicay 25 mg film-coated tablets \n \nPale yellow, round, biconvex tablets approximately 7 mm in diameter debossed with \u2018SV 572\u2019 on one side \nand \u201825\u2019 on the other side. \n \nTivicay 50 mg film-coated tablets \n \nYellow, round, biconvex tablets approximately 9 mm in diameter debossed with \u2018SV 572\u2019 on one side and \n\u201850\u2019 on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTivicay is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment of Human \nImmunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected adults, adolescents and children of at least 6 years of age or older \nand weighing at least 14 kg. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nTivicay should be prescribed by physicians experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \n \nPatients infected with HIV-1 without documented or clinically suspected resistance to the integrase class \nThe recommended dose of dolutegravir is 50 mg orally once daily.  \n \nDolutegravir should be administered twice daily in this population when co-administered with some \nmedicines (e.g. efavirenz, nevirapine, tipranavir/ritonavir, or rifampicin).  Please refer to section 4.5. \n \nPatients infected with HIV-1 with resistance to the integrase class (documented or clinically suspected) \nThe recommended dose of dolutegravir is 50 mg twice daily.  \n \nIn the presence of documented resistance that includes Q148 + \u22652 secondary mutations from G140A/C/S, \nE138A/K/T, L74I, modelling suggests that an increased dose may be considered for patients with limited \ntreatment options (less than 2 active agents) due to advanced multi class resistance (see section 5.2).  \n \nThe decision to use dolutegravir for such patients should be informed by the integrase resistance pattern (see \nsection 5.1). \n   \nAdolescents aged 12 and above, to less than 18 years, and weighing at least 20 kg \n \nIn patients infected with HIV-1 without resistance to the integrase class, the recommended dose of \ndolutegravir is 50 mg once daily. Alternatively, if preferred 25 mg may be taken twice daily (see section \n5.2). In the presence of integrase inhibitor resistance, there are insufficient data to recommend a dose for \ndolutegravir in adolescents.  \n \nChildren aged 6 and above, to less than 12 years, and weighing at least 14 kg  \n \nIn patients infected with HIV-1 without resistance to the integrase class, the recommended dose of \ndolutegravir is determined according to the weight of the child (see Table 1 and section 5.2).  \n \nTable 1 Paediatric dose recommendations for film-coated tablets  \nBody weight (kg) Dose \n14 to less than 20  40 mg once daily \n20 or greater 50 mg once daily \n \nAlternatively, if preferred the dose may be divided equally into 2 doses, with one dose taken in the morning \nand one dose taken in the evening (see Table 2 and section 5.2).  \n \nTable 2 Alternative paediatric dose recommendations for film-coated tablets \nBody weight (kg) Dose \n14 to less than 20  20 mg twice daily \n20 or greater 25 mg twice daily \n \nIn the presence of integrase inhibitor resistance, there are insufficient data to recommend a dose for \ndolutegravir in children. \n \nDispersible Tablets \nTivicay is available as film-coated tablets for patients aged 6 years and above and weighing at least 14 kg. \nTivicay is also available as dispersible tablets for patients aged 4 weeks and above and weighing at least 3 \nkg, or for patients in whom film-coated tablets are not appropriate. Patients can change between film-coated \n\n\n\n4 \n\ntablets and dispersible tablets. However, the bioavailability of film-coated tablets and dispersible tablets is \nnot comparable, therefore they are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see section 5.2). \nFor example, the recommended adult dose for film-coated tablets is 50 mg versus 30 mg for dispersible \ntablets. Patients changing between film-coated and dispersible tablets should follow the dosing \nrecommendations that are specific for the formulation. \n \nMissed doses \nIf the patient misses a dose of Tivicay, the patient should take Tivicay as soon as possible, providing the next \ndose is not due within 4 hours. If the next dose is due within 4 hours, the patient should not take the missed \ndose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule.  \n \nElderly \nThere are limited data available on the use of dolutegravir in patients aged 65 years and over.  There is no \nevidence that elderly patients require a different dose than younger adult patients (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate or severe (CrCl <30 mL/min, not on \ndialysis) renal impairment.  No data are available in subjects receiving dialysis although differences in \npharmacokinetics are not expected in this population (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh grade A \nor B).  No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh grade C); therefore \ndolutegravir should be used with caution in these patients (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nDolutegravir is also available in dispersible tablets for children aged 4 weeks and above and weighing at \nleast 3 kg. However, the safety and efficacy of dolutegravir in children aged less than 4 weeks or weighing \nless than 3 kg have not yet been established. In the presence of integrase inhibitor resistance, there are \ninsufficient data to recommend a dose for dolutegravir in children and adolescents. Currently available data \nare described in section 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. \nTivicay can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). In the presence of integrase class resistance, \nTivicay should preferably be taken with food to enhance exposure (particularly in patients with Q148 \nmutations) (see section 5.2).  \n \nTo reduce the risk of choking, patients should not swallow more than one tablet at a time, and where \npossible, children weighing 14 to less than 20 kg should preferentially take the dispersible tablet formulation. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nMedicinal products with narrow therapeutic windows that are substrates of organic cation transporter 2 \n(OCT2), including but not limited to fampridine (also known as dalfampridine; see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce the risk \nof sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent transmission should be \ntaken in accordance with national guidelines.  \n \nIntegrase class resistance of particular concern \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nThe decision to use dolutegravir in the presence of integrase class resistance should take into account that the \nactivity of dolutegravir is considerably compromised for viral strains harbouring Q148+\u22652 secondary \nmutations from G140A/C/S, E138A/K/T, L74I (see section 5.1). To what extent dolutegravir provides added \nefficacy in the presence of such integrase class resistance is uncertain (see section 5.2). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nHypersensitivity reactions have been reported with dolutegravir, and were characterized by rash, \nconstitutional findings, and sometimes, organ dysfunction, including severe liver reactions. Dolutegravir and \nother suspect medicinal products should be discontinued immediately if signs or symptoms of \nhypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by raised \nliver enzymes, fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, \nfacial oedema, eosinophilia, angioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases and bilirubin \nshould be monitored. Delay in stopping treatment with dolutegravir or other suspect active substances after \nthe onset of hypersensitivity may result in a life-threatening allergic reaction.  \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such \nreactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples \nare cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii \npneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.  \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur \nin the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events \ncan occur many months after initiation of treatment.  \n \nLiver biochemistry elevations consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome were observed in some \nhepatitis B and/or C co-infected patients at the start of dolutegravir therapy.  Monitoring of liver \nbiochemistries is recommended in patients with hepatitis B and/or C co-infection.  Particular diligence \nshould be applied in initiating or maintaining effective hepatitis B therapy (referring to treatment guidelines) \nwhen starting dolutegravir-based therapy in hepatitis B co-infected patients (see section 4.8). \n \nOpportunistic infections \n \nPatients should be advised that dolutegravir or any other antiretroviral therapy does not cure HIV infection \nand that they may still develop opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection. Therefore, \npatients should remain under close clinical observation by physicians experienced in the treatment of these \nassociated HIV diseases. \n \nDrug interactions \n \nFactors that decrease dolutegravir exposure should be avoided in the presence of integrase class resistance. \nThis includes co-administration with medicinal products that reduce dolutegravir exposure (e.g. magnesium/ \naluminium-containing antacid, iron and calcium supplements, multivitamins and inducing agents, etravirine \n(without boosted protease inhibitors), tipranavir/ritonavir, rifampicin, St. John\u2019s wort and certain anti-\nepileptic medicinal products) (see section 4.5). \n \nDolutegravir increased metformin concentrations. A dose adjustment of metformin should be considered \nwhen starting and stopping coadministration of dolutegravir with metformin, to maintain glycaemic control \n(see section 4.5). Metformin is eliminated renally and, therefore, it is of importance to monitor renal function \nwhen co-treated with dolutegravir. This combination may increase the risk for lactic acidosis in patients with \nmoderate renal impairment (stage 3a creatinine clearance [CrCl] 45\u2013 59 mL/min) and a cautious approach is \nrecommended. Reduction of the metformin dose should be highly considered.   \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nOsteonecrosis \n \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, biphosphonates, \nalcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to CART. Patients should be \nadvised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in \nmovement. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \n \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral therapy. Such \nchanges may in part be linked to disease control and lifestyle. For lipids, there is in some cases evidence for \na treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating this to any particular treatment. \nFor monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to established HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid \ndisorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nLamivudine and dolutegravir  \n \nThe two-drug regimen of dolutegravir 50 mg once daily and lamivudine 300 mg once daily was explored in \ntwo large randomized and blinded studies, GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 (see section 5.1). This regimen is only \nsuitable for the treatment of HIV-1 infection where there is no known or suspected resistance to the integrase \ninhibitor class, or to lamivudine. \n \nExcipients \n \nTivicay contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say is essentially \u2018sodium free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffect of other agents on the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir \n \nAll factors that decrease dolutegravir exposure should be avoided in the presence of integrase class \nresistance. \n \nDolutegravir is eliminated mainly through metabolism by UGT1A1. Dolutegravir is also a substrate of \nUGT1A3, UGT1A9, CYP3A4, Pgp, and BCRP; therefore medicinal products that induce those enzymes may \ndecrease dolutegravir plasma concentration and reduce the therapeutic effect of dolutegravir (see Table 3). \nCo-administration of dolutegravir and other medicinal products that inhibit these enzymes may increase \ndolutegravir plasma concentration (see Table 3). \n \nThe absorption of dolutegravir is reduced by certain anti-acid agents (see Table 3). \n \nEffect of dolutegravir on the pharmacokinetics of other agents \n \nIn vivo, dolutegravir did not have an effect on midazolam, a CYP3A4 probe.  Based on in vivo and/or in vitro \ndata, dolutegravir is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of \nany major enzyme or transporter such as CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and P-gp (for more information see section 5.2).   \n \nIn vitro, dolutegravir inhibited the renal organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) and multidrug and toxin \nextrusion transporter (MATE) 1. In vivo, a 10-14% decrease of creatinine clearance (secretory fraction is \ndependent on OCT2 and MATE-1 transport) was observed in patients. In vivo, dolutegravir may increase \nplasma concentrations of medicinal products in which excretion is dependent upon OCT2 and/or MATE-1 \n(e.g. fampridine [also known as dalfampridine], metformin) (see Table 3). \n \nIn vitro, dolutegravir inhibited the renal uptake transporters, organic anion transporters (OAT1) and OAT3.  \nBased on the lack of effect on the in vivo pharmacokinetics of the OAT substrate tenofovir, in vivo inhibition \n\n\n\n7 \n\nof OAT1 is unlikely. Inhibition of OAT3 has not been studied in vivo. Dolutegravir may increase plasma \nconcentrations of medicinal products in which excretion is dependent upon OAT3.   \n \nEstablished and theoretical interactions with selected antiretrovirals and non-antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts are listed in Table 3. \n \nInteraction table \nInteractions between dolutegravir and co-administered medicinal products are listed in Table 3 (increase is \nindicated as \u201c\u2191\u201d, decrease as \u201c\u2193\u201d, no change as \u201c\u2194\u201d, area under the concentration versus time curve as \n\u201cAUC\u201d, maximum observed concentration as \u201cCmax\u201d, concentration at end of dosing interval as \u201cC\u03c4\u201d). \n \nTable 3: Drug Interactions \nMedicinal products \nby therapeutic areas \n\nInteraction  \nGeometric mean change \n(%)  \n\nRecommendations concerning \nco-administration \n\nHIV-1 Antiviral Agents \nNon-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors \nEtravirine without \nboosted protease \ninhibitors \n\nDolutegravir \u2193 \n   AUC \u2193 71% \n   Cmax \u2193 52% \n   C\u03c4 \u2193 88% \n \nEtravirine \u2194 \n(induction of UGT1A1 and \nCYP3A enzymes) \n\nEtravirine without boosted protease inhibitors \ndecreased plasma dolutegravir concentration.

Most neural tube defects occur within the first 4 weeks of embryonic development after \nconception (approximately 6 weeks after the last menstrual period). If a pregnancy is confirmed in the \nfirst trimester while on dolutegravir, the benefits and risks of continuing dolutegravir versus switching to \nanother antiretroviral regimen should be discussed with the patient taking the gestational age and the critical \ntime period of neural tube defect development into account. \n \nData analysed from the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry do not indicate an increased risk of major birth \ndefects in over 600 women exposed to dolutegravir during pregnancy but are currently insufficient to address \nthe risk of neural tube defects. \n \nIn animal reproductive toxicity studies, no adverse development outcomes, including neural tube defects, \nwere identified (see section 5.3). Dolutegravir was shown to cross the placenta in animals.  \n \nMore than 1000 outcomes from exposure during second and third trimester of pregnancy indicate no \nevidence of increased risk of foeto/neonatal toxicity. Dolutegravir may be used during the second and third \ntrimester of pregnancy when the expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n  \nBreast-feeding \n \nDolutegravir is excreted in human milk in small amounts. There is insufficient information on the effects of \ndolutegravir in neonates/infants. \n \nIt is recommended that HIV infected women do not breast-feed their infants under any circumstances in \norder to avoid transmission of HIV. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effects of dolutegravir on human male or female fertility. Animal studies indicate no \neffects of dolutegravir on male or female fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with dolutegravir. The clinical \nstatus of the patient and the adverse reaction profile of dolutegravir should be borne in mind when \nconsidering the patient's ability to drive or operate machinery.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most severe adverse reaction, seen in an individual patient, was a hypersensitivity reaction that included \nrash and severe liver effects (see section 4.4).  The most commonly seen treatment emergent adverse \nreactions were nausea (13%), diarrhoea (18%) and headache (13%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions considered at least possibly related to dolutegravir are listed by body system, organ \nclass and absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000). \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nTable 4 Adverse Reactions \nImmune system \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Hypersensitivity (see section 4.4) \nUncommon Immune Reconstitution Syndrome (see section 4.4)** \n\nPsychiatric disorders Common Insomnia \nCommon Abnormal dreams \nCommon Depression \nCommon Anxiety \nUncommon Suicidal ideation*, suicide attempt*  \n\n*particularly in patients with a pre-existing history of \ndepression or psychiatric illness. \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nVery common Headache \nCommon Dizziness \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nVery common Nausea \nVery common Diarrhoea \nCommon Vomiting \nCommon Flatulence \nCommon Upper abdominal pain \nCommon Abdominal pain \nCommon Abdominal discomfort \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Hepatitis \n\nRare Acute hepatic failure \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nCommon Rash \nCommon Pruritus \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Arthralgia \nUncommon Myalgia \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nCommon Fatigue \n\nInvestigations Common Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or Aspartate \naminotransferase (AST) elevations \n\nCommon Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevations \n \n**see below under Description of selected adverse reactions. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nChanges in laboratory biochemistries \nIncreases in serum creatinine occurred within the first week of treatment with dolutegravir and remained \nstable through 48 weeks. A mean change from baseline of 9.96 \u00b5mol/L was observed after 48 weeks of \ntreatment. Creatinine increases were comparable by various background regimens. These changes are not \nconsidered to be clinically relevant since they do not reflect a change in glomerular filtration rate. \n \nCo-infection with Hepatitis B or C \nIn Phase III studies patients with hepatitis B and/or C co-infection were permitted to enrol provided that \nbaseline liver chemistry tests did not exceed 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Overall, the safety \nprofile in patients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or C was similar to that observed in patients without \nhepatitis B or C co-infection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were higher in the subgroup \nwith hepatitis B and/or C co-infection for all treatment groups. Liver chemistry elevations consistent with \nimmune reconstitution syndrome were observed in some subjects with hepatitis B and/or C co-infection at \nthe start of dolutegravir therapy, particularly in those whose anti-hepatitis B therapy was withdrawn (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nImmune reactivation syndrome \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination antiretroviral \ntherapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise.  \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; \nhowever, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation \nof treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nBased on available data from the ongoing P1093 (ING112578) and ODYSSEY (201296) studies in 172 \ninfants, children and adolescents (aged 4 weeks and above, to less than 18 years, and weighing at least 3 kg) \nwho received the recommended doses of film-coated tablets or dispersible tablets once daily, there were no \nadditional types of adverse reactions beyond those observed in the adult population. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is currently limited experience with overdosage in dolutegravir.  \n \nLimited experience of single higher doses (up to 250 mg in healthy subjects) revealed no specific symptoms \nor signs, apart from those listed as adverse reactions.   \n \nFurther management should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by the national poisons centre, \nwhere available.  There is no specific treatment for an overdose of dolutegravir. If overdose occurs, the \npatient should be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring, as necessary. As dolutegravir is highly \nbound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by dialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, other antivirals, ATC code: J05AX12 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nDolutegravir inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand transfer \nstep of retroviral Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integration which is essential for the HIV replication cycle. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nAntiviral activity in cell culture  \nThe IC50 for dolutegravir in various labstrains using PBMC was 0.5 nM, and when using MT-4 cells it \nranged from 0.7-2 nM. Similar IC50s were seen for clinical isolates without any major difference between \nsubtypes; in a panel of 24 HIV-1 isolates of clades A, B, C, D, E, F and G and group O the mean IC50 value \nwas 0.2 nM (range 0.02-2.14). The mean IC50 for 3 HIV-2 isolates was 0.18 nM (range 0.09-0.61). \n \nAntiviral activity in combination with other antiviral agents \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n15 \n\nNo antagonistic effects in vitro were seen with dolutegravir and other antiretrovirals tested: stavudine, \nabacavir, efavirenz, nevirapine, lopinavir, amprenavir, enfuvirtide, maraviroc and raltegravir.  In addition, no \nantagonistic effects were seen for dolutegravir and adefovir, and ribavirin had no apparent effect on \ndolutegravir activity.  \n \nEffect of human serum  \nIn 100% human serum, the mean protein fold shift was 75 fold, resulting in protein adjusted IC90 of 0.064 \n\u00b5g/mL.  \n \nResistance \n \nResistance in vitro \n \nSerial passage is used to study resistance evolution in vitro. When using the lab-strain HIV-1 IIIB during \npassage over 112 days, mutations selected appeared slowly, with substitutions at positions S153Y and F, \nresulting in a maximal fold change in susceptibility of 4 (range 2-4). These mutations were not selected in \npatients treated with dolutegravir in the clinical studies.  Using strain NL432, mutations E92Q (FC 3) and \nG193E (also FC 3) were selected. The E92Q mutation has been selected in patients with pre-existing \nraltegravir resistance who were then treated with dolutegravir (listed as a secondary mutation for \ndolutegravir).  \n \nIn further selection experiments using clinical isolates of subtype B, mutation R263K was seen in all five \nisolates (after 20 weeks and onwards). In subtype C (n=2) and A/G (n=2) isolates the integrase substitution \nR263K was selected in one isolate, and G118R in two isolates.  R263K was reported from two ART \nexperienced, INI naive individual patients with subtypes B and C in the clinical program, but without effects \non dolutegravir susceptibility in vitro. G118R lowers the susceptibility to dolutegravir in site directed \nmutants (FC 10), but was not detected in patients receiving dolutegravir in the Phase III program.   \n \nPrimary mutations for raltegravir/elvitegravir (Q148H/R/K, N155H, Y143R/H/C, E92Q and T66I) do not \naffect the in vitro susceptibility of dolutegravir as single mutations. When mutations listed as secondary \nintegrase inhibitor associated mutations (for raltegravir/elvitegravir) are added to these primary mutations in \nexperiments with site directed mutants, dolutegravir susceptibility is still unchanged (FC <2 vs wild type \nvirus), except in the case of Q148-mutations, where a FC of 5-10 or higher is seen with combinations of \ncertain secondary mutations. The effect by the Q148-mutations (H/R/K) was also verified in passage \nexperiments with site directed mutants.  In serial passage with strain NL432, starting with site directed \nmutants harbouring N155H or E92Q, no further selection of resistance was seen (FC unchanged around 1). \nIn contrast, starting with mutants harbouring mutation Q148H (FC 1), a variety of secondary mutations were \nseen with a consequent increase of FC to values >10.  \n \nA clinically relevant phenotypic cut-off value (FC vs wild type virus) has not been determined; genotypic \nresistance was a better predictor for outcome. \n \nSeven hundred and five raltegravir resistant isolates from raltegravir experienced patients were analyzed for \nsusceptibility to dolutegravir.  Dolutegravir has a less than or equal to 10 FC against 94% of the 705 clinical \nisolates. \n \nResistance in vivo \nIn previously untreated patients receiving dolutegravir + 2 NRTIs in Phase IIb and Phase III, no development \nof resistance to the integrase class, or to the NRTI class was seen (n=1118 follow-up of 48-96 weeks). In \npreviously untreated patients receiving dolutegravir + lamivudine in the GEMINI studies through week 96 \n(n=716), no development of resistance to the integrase class, or to the NRTI class was seen. \n \nIn patients with prior failed therapies, but na\u00efve to the integrase class (SAILING study), integrase inhibitor \nsubstitutions were observed in 4/354 patients (follow-up 48 weeks) treated with dolutegravir, which was \ngiven in combination with an investigator selected background regimen (BR). Of these four, two subjects \nhad a unique R263K integrase substitution, with a maximum FC of 1.93, one subject had a polymorphic \n\n\n\n16 \n\nV151V/I integrase substitution, with maximum FC of 0.92, and one subject had pre-existing integrase \nmutations and is assumed to have been integrase experienced or infected with integrase resistant virus by \ntransmission. The R263K mutation was also selected in vitro (see above). \n \nIn the presence of integrase class-resistance (VIKING-3 study) the following mutations were selected in 32 \npatients with protocol defined virological failure (PDVF) through Week 24 and with paired genotypes (all \ntreated with dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily + optimized background agents):  L74L/M (n=1), E92Q (n=2), \nT97A (n=9), E138K/A/T (n=8), G140S (n=2), Y143H (n=1), S147G (n=1), Q148H/K/R (n=4), and N155H \n(n=1) and E157E/Q (n=1).  Treatment emergent integrase resistance typically appeared in patients with a \nhistory of the Q148-mutation (baseline or historic). Five further subjects experienced PDVF between weeks \n24 and 48, and 2 of these 5 had treatment emergent mutations.  Treatment-emergent mutations or mixtures of \nmutations observed were L74I (n=1), N155H (n=2). \n \nThe VIKING-4 study examined dolutegravir (plus optimized background therapy) in subjects with primary \ngenotypic resistance to INIs at Screening in 30 subjects.  Treatment-emergent mutations observed were \nconsistent with those observed in the VIKING-3 study. \n \nIn paediatric patients with prior failed therapies, but na\u00efve to the integrase class, the integrase inhibitor \nsubstitution G118R was observed in 5/159 patients treated with dolutegravir, given in combination with an \ninvestigator selected background regimen. Of these five, 4 participants had additional integrase associated \nsubstitutions as follows: L74M, E138E/K, E92E/Q and T66I. Four of the 5 participants with emergent \nG118R had phenotypic data available. Dolutegravir FC (fold change as compared to wildtype virus) for these \nfour participants ranged from 6 to 25-fold. \n \nEffects on electrocardiogram \n \nNo relevant effects were seen on the QTc interval, with doses exceeding the clinical dose by approximately \nthree fold.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety  \n \nPreviously untreated patients  \nThe efficacy of dolutegravir in HIV-infected, therapy na\u00efve subjects is based on the analyses of 96-week data \nfrom two randomized, international, double-blind, active-controlled trials, SPRING-2 (ING113086) and \nSINGLE (ING114467). This is supported by 96 week data from an open-label, randomized and active-\ncontrolled study FLAMINGO (ING114915) and additional data from the open-label phase of SINGLE to \n144 weeks. The efficacy of dolutegravir in combination with lamivudine in adults is supported by 96-week \ndata from two identical 148-week, randomised, multicentre, double-blind, non-inferiority studies GEMINI-1 \n(204861) and GEMINI-2 (205543). \n \nIn SPRING-2, 822 adults were randomized and received at least one dose of either dolutegravir 50 mg once \ndaily or raltegravir (RAL) 400 mg twice daily, both administered with either ABC/3TC or TDF/FTC.  At \nbaseline, median patient age was 36 years, 14% were female, 15% non-white, 11% had hepatitis B and/or C \nco-infection and 2% were CDC Class C, these characteristics were similar between treatment groups. \n \nIn SINGLE, 833 subjects were randomized and received at least one dose of either dolutegravir 50 mg once \ndaily with fixed-dose abacavir-lamivudine (Dolutegravir + ABC/3TC) or fixed-dose efavirenz-tenofovir-\nemtricitabine (EFV/TDF/FTC). At baseline, median patient age was 35 years, 16% were female, 32% non-\nwhite, 7% had hepatitis C co-infection and 4% were CDC Class C, these characteristics were similar \nbetween treatment groups.  \n \nThe primary endpoint and other week 48 outcomes (including outcomes by key baseline covariates) for \nSPRING-2 and SINGLE are shown in Table 5. \n \nTable 5 Response in SPRING-2 and SINGLE at 48 Weeks (Snapshot algorithm, <50 copies/mL) \n\n\n\n17 \n\n SPRING-2 SINGLE \n Dolutegravir \n\n50 mg Once \nDaily + 2 NRTI \n\nN=411 \n\nRAL 400 mg \nTwice Daily + 2 \n\nNRTI \nN=411 \n\nDolutegravir \n50 mg + \n\nABC/3TC Once \nDaily \n\nN=414 \n\nEFV/TDF/FTC \nOnce Daily \n\nN=419 \n\nHIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL 88% 85% 88% 81% \n  Treatment Difference* 2.5% (95% CI: -2.2%, 7.1%) 7.4% (95% CI: 2.5%, 12.3%) \nVirologic non-response\u2020  5% 8% 5% 6% \n\nHIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL by baseline covariates \nBaseline Viral Load \n(cps/mL)     \n\n  \u2264100,000  267 / 297 (90%) 264 / 295 (89%) 253 / 280 (90%) 238 / 288 (83%) \n  >100,000  94 / 114 (82%) 87 / 116 (75%) 111 / 134 (83%) 100 / 131 (76%) \nBaseline CD4+ (cells/ mm3)     \n  <200 43 / 55 (78%) 34 / 50 (68%) 45 / 57 (79%) 48 / 62 (77%) \n  200 to <350  128 / 144 (89%) 118 / 139 (85%) 143 / 163 (88%) 126 / 159 (79%) \n  \u2265350  190 / 212 (90%) 199 / 222 (90%) 176 / 194 (91%) 164 / 198 (83%) \nNRTI backbone     \n  ABC/3TC 145 / 169 (86%) 142 / 164 (87%) N/A N/A \n  TDF/FTC 216 / 242 (89%) 209 / 247 (85%) N/A N/A \nGender     \n  Male  308 / 348 (89%) 305 / 355 (86%) 307 / 347 (88%) 291 / 356 (82%) \n  Female 53 / 63 (84%) 46 / 56 (82%) 57 / 67 (85%) 47 / 63 (75%) \nRace      \n  White  306 / 346 (88%) 301 / 352 (86%) 255 / 284 (90%) 238 /285 (84%) \n  African-America/African \nHeritage/Other 55 / 65 (85%) 50 / 59 (85%) 109 / 130 (84%) 99 / 133 (74%) \n\nAge (years)     \n  <50 324/370 (88%) 312/365 (85%) 319/361 (88%) 302/375 (81%) \n  \u226550 37/41 (90%) 39/46 (85%) 45/53 (85%) 36/44 (82%) \nMedian CD4 change from \nbaseline 230 230 246\u2021 187\u2021 \n\n* Adjusted for baseline stratification factors. \n\u2020 Includes subjects who changed BR to new class or changed BR not permitted per protocol or due to lack \nof efficacy prior to Week 48 (for SPRING-2 only), subjects who discontinued prior to Week 48 for lack or \nloss of efficacy and subjects who are \u226550 copies in the 48 week window.  \n\u2021 Adjusted mean treatment difference was statistically significant (p<0.001) \n \nAt week 48, dolutegravir was non-inferior to raltegravir in the SPRING-2 study, and in the SINGLE study \ndolutegravir + ABC/3TC was superior to efavirenz/TDF/FTC (p=0.003), table 5 above. In SINGLE, the \nmedian time to viral suppression was shorter in the dolutegravir treated patients (28 vs 84 days, (p<0.0001, \nanalysis pre-specified and adjusted for multiplicity).  \n \nAt week 96, results were consistent with those seen at week 48.  In SPRING-2, dolutegravir was still non-\ninferior to raltegravir (viral suppression in 81% vs 76% of patients), and with a median change in CD4 count \nof 276 vs 264 cells/mm3, respectively.  In SINGLE, dolutegravir + ABC/3TC was still superior to \nEFV/TDF/FTC (viral suppression in 80% vs 72%, treatment difference 8.0% (2.3, 13.8), p=0.006, and with \nan adjusted mean change in CD4 count of 325 vs 281 cells/ mm3, respectively.  At 144 weeks in the open-\nlabel phase of SINGLE, virologic suppression was maintained, the dolutegravir + ABC/3TC arm (71%) was \nsuperior to the EFV/TDF/FTC arm (63%), treatment difference was 8.3% (2.0, 14.6). \n \nIn FLAMINGO (ING114915), an open-label, randomised and active-controlled study, 484 HIV-1 infected \nantiretroviral na\u00efve adults received one dose of either dolutegravir 50 mg once daily (n=242) or \ndarunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) 800 mg/100 mg once daily (n=242), both administered with either ABC/3TC or \n\n\n\n18 \n\nTDF/FTC.  At baseline, median patient age was 34 years, 15% were female, 28% non-white, 10% had \nhepatitis B and/or C co-infection, and 3% were CDC Class C; these characteristics were similar between \ntreatment groups.  Virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) in the dolutegravir group (90%) was \nsuperior to the DRV/r group (83%) at 48 weeks. The adjusted difference in proportion and 95% CI were \n7.1% (0.9, 13.2), p=0.025. At 96 weeks, virologic suppression in the dolutegravir group (80%) was superior \nto the DRV/r group (68%), (adjusted treatment difference [Dolutegravir-(DRV+RTV)]: 12.4%; 95% CI: \n[4.7, 20.2]. \n \nIn GEMINI-1 (204861) and GEMINI-2 (205543), identical 148-week, randomised, double-blind studies, \n1433 adult HIV-1 infected antiretroviral na\u00efve subjects were randomised to either a two-drug regimen of \ndolutegravir 50 mg plus lamivudine 300 mg once daily, or to a three-drug regimen of dolutegravir 50 mg \nonce daily with fixed dose TDF/FTC. Subjects were enrolled with a screening plasma HIV-1 RNA of 1000 \nc/mL to \u2264500,000 c/mL. At baseline, in the pooled analysis, median patient age was 33 years, 15% were \nfemale, 31% non-white, 6% had hepatitis C co-infection and 9% were CDC Stage 3. Approximately one \nthird of the patients were infected with an HIV non-B subtype; these characteristics were similar between \ntreatment groups. Virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) in the dolutegravir plus lamivudine \ngroup was non-inferior to the dolutegravir plus TDF/FTC group at 48 weeks, as shown in Table 6. The \nresults of the pooled analysis were in line with those of the individual studies, for which the primary \nendpoint (difference in proportion <50 copies/mL plasma HIV-1 RNA at week 48 based on the Snapshot \nalgorithm) was met. The adjusted difference was -2.6% (95% CI: -6.7; 1.5) for GEMINI-1 and -0.7% (95% \nCI: -4.3; 2.9) for GEMINI-2 with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10%. \n \nTable 6 Response (<50 cps/ml, snapshot) in GEMINI 1 + 2, pooled data.  \n\n Dolutegravir + 3TC \n(N=716) \nn/N (%) \n\nDolutegravir + \nTDF/FTC \n(N=717) \nn/N (%) \n\nAll patients 655/716 (91) 669/717 (93) \n adjusted diff -1.7% (CI95-4.4, 1.1) a \n\nBy BL HIV-1 RNA \n\u2264100,000 cps/mL 526/576 (91) 531/564 (94) \n>100,000 cps/mL 129/140 (92) 138/153 (90) \nBy CD4+ \n\u2264200 c/ mm3 50/63 (79) 51/55 (93) \n>200 c/ mm3 605/653 (93) 618/662 (93) \nBy HIV-1 subtype  \nB 424/467 (91) 452/488 (93) \nNon-B 231/249 (93) 217/229 (95) \n\n \nRebound up to week 48 b 6 (<1) 4 (<1) \n\n \nMean change in CD4 count from \nbaseline at Week 48, c/ mm3 224 217 \n\na adjusted for BL stratification factors: Plasma HIV-1 RNA (\u2264100,000 cps/mL vs. >100,000 cps/mL) and CD4+ \ncell count (\u2264200 cells/mm3 vs. >200 cells/mm3). \nb Confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA levels to \u2265200 cps/mL after prior confirmed suppression to <200 cps/mL. \n\n  \nAt 96 weeks the dolutegravir plus lamivudine group (86% with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL [pooled \ndata]) remained non-inferior to the dolutegravir plus tenofovir/emtricitabine FDC group (90% with plasma \nHIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL [pooled data]). The adjusted difference in proportions and 95% CI was -3.4% (-\n6.7, 0.0).

The adjusted differences of -4.9 (95% CI: -9.8; 0.0) for GEMINI-1 and -1.8 (95% CI: -6.4; 2.7) for \nGEMINI-2 were within the prespecified non-inferiority margin of -10%. The mean increase in CD4+ T-cell \ncounts was 269 in the DTG+3TC arm and 259 in the DTG+FTC/TDF arm, at week 96. \n\n\n\n19 \n\nTreatment emergent resistance in previously untreated patients failing therapy \nThrough 96 weeks in SPRING-2 and FLAMINGO and 144 weeks in SINGLE, no cases of treatment \nemergent primary resistance to the integrase- or NRTI-class were seen in the dolutegravir-containing arms. \nFor the comparator arms, the same lack of treatment emergent resistance was also the case for patients \ntreated with darunavir/r in FLAMINGO. In SPRING-2, four patients in the RAL-arm failed with major \nNRTI mutations and one with raltegravir resistance; in SINGLE, six patients in the EFV/TDF/FTC-arm \nfailed with mutations associated with NNRTI resistance, and one developed a major NRTI mutation. \nThrough 96 weeks in the GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 studies, no cases of emergent resistance to the \nintegrase- or NRTI-class were seen in either the Dolutegravir+3TC or comparator Dolutegravir+TDF/FTC \narms. \n \nPatients with prior treatment failure, but not exposed to the integrase class  \nIn the international multicentre, double-blind SAILING study (ING111762), 719 HIV-1 infected, \nantiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced adults were randomized and received either dolutegravir 50 mg \nonce daily or raltegravir 400 mg twice daily with investigator selected background regimen consisting of up \nto 2 agents (including at least one fully active agent).  At baseline, median patient age was 43 years, 32% \nwere female, 50% non-white, 16% had hepatitis B and/or C co-infection, and 46% were CDC Class C.

The study enrolled 183 patients, 133 with INI-resistance at \nScreening and 50 with only historical evidence of resistance (and not at Screening).  Raltegravir/elvitegravir \nwas part of the current failing regimen in 98/183 patients (part of prior failing therapies in the others).  At \nbaseline, median patient age was 48 years, 23% were female, 29% non-white, and 20% had hepatitis B \nand/or C co-infection.

The day 8 responses in this placebo controlled study were fully in line with \nthose seen in VIKING-3 (not placebo controlled), including by baseline integrase resistance categories.

Of these \nfive, 4 participants had additional integrase associated substitutions as follows: L74M, E138E/K, E92E/Q \nand T66I. Four of the 5 participants with emergent G118R had phenotypic data available. Dolutegravir FC \n(fold change as compared to wildtype virus) for these four participants ranged from 6 to 25-fold. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Tivicay in \npaediatric patients aged 4 weeks to below 6 years with HIV infection (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \nThere are no data available on the use of dolutegravir plus lamivudine as a two-drug regimen in paediatric \npatients. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDolutegravir pharmacokinetics are similar between healthy and HIV-infected subjects. The PK variability of \ndolutegravir is low to moderate. In Phase I studies in healthy subjects, between-subject CVb% for AUC and \nCmax ranged from ~20 to 40% and C\u03c4 from 30 to 65% across studies.  The between-subject PK variability of \ndolutegravir was higher in HIV-infected subjects than healthy subjects. Within-subject variability (CVw%) is \nlower than between-subject variability. \n \nFilm-coated tablets and dispersible tablets do not have the same bioavailability. The relative bioavailability \nof dispersible tablets is approximately 1.6-fold higher as compared to film-coated tablets. Thus, a 50 mg \ndolutegravir dose administered as film-coated tablet(s) will have similar exposure to a 30 mg dolutegravir \ndose administered as six 5 mg dispersible tablets. Similarly, a 40 mg dolutegravir dose administered as four \n10 mg film-coated tablets will provide comparable exposure to a 25 mg dolutegravir dose administered as \nfive 5 mg dispersible tablets.  \n \nAbsorption \n  \n\n\n\n23 \n\nDolutegravir is rapidly absorbed following oral administration, with median Tmax at 2 to 3 hours post dose for \ntablet formulation.  \n \nFood increased the extent and slowed the rate of absorption of dolutegravir. Bioavailability of dolutegravir \ndepends on meal content: low, moderate, and high fat meals increased dolutegravir AUC(0-\u221e) by 33%, 41%, \nand 66%, increased Cmax by 46%, 52%, and 67%, prolonged Tmax to 3, 4, and 5 hours from 2 hours under \nfasted conditions, respectively for the film-coated tablet. These increases may be clinically relevant in the \npresence of certain integrase class resistance. Therefore, Tivicay is recommended to be taken with food by \npatients infected with HIV with integrase class resistance (see section 4.2). \n \nThe absolute bioavailability of dolutegravir has not been established.   \n \nDistribution \n  \nDolutegravir is highly bound (>99%) to human plasma proteins based on in vitro data.  The apparent volume \nof distribution is 17 L to 20 L in HIV-infected patients, based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis.  \nBinding of dolutegravir to plasma proteins is independent of dolutegravir concentration.  Total blood and \nplasma drug-related radioactivity concentration ratios averaged between 0.441 to 0.535, indicating minimal \nassociation of radioactivity with blood cellular components. The unbound fraction of dolutegravir in plasma \nis increased at low levels of serum albumin (<35 g/L) as seen in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment.  \n \nDolutegravir is present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).  In 13 treatment-na\u00efve subjects on a stable dolutegravir \nplus abacavir/lamivudine regimen, dolutegravir concentration in CSF averaged 18 ng/mL (comparable to \nunbound plasma concentration, and above the IC50).   \n \nDolutegravir is present in the female and male genital tract.  AUC in cervicovaginal fluid, cervical tissue and \nvaginal tissue were 6-10% of those in corresponding plasma at steady state. AUC in semen was 7% and 17% \nin rectal tissue of those in corresponding plasma at steady state. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nDolutegravir is primarily metabolized through glucuronidation via UGT1A1 with a minor CYP3A \ncomponent.  Dolutegravir is the predominant circulating compound in plasma; renal elimination of \nunchanged active substance is low (< 1% of the dose).  Fifty-three percent of total oral dose is excreted \nunchanged in the faeces. It is unknown if all or part of this is due to unabsorbed active substance or biliary \nexcretion of the glucuronidate conjugate, which can be further degraded to form the parent compound in the \ngut lumen.  Thirty-two percent of the total oral dose is excreted in the urine, represented by ether glucuronide \nof dolutegravir (18.9% of total dose), N-dealkylation metabolite (3.6% of total dose), and a metabolite \nformed by oxidation at the benzylic carbon (3.0% of total dose). \n \nDrug interactions \n \nIn vitro, dolutegravir demonstrated no direct, or weak inhibition (IC50>50 \u03bcM) of the enzymes cytochrome \nP450 (CYP)1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 CYP3A, uridine diphosphate \nglucuronosyl transferase (UGT)1A1 or UGT2B7, or the transporters Pgp, BCRP, BSEP, OATP1B1, \nOATP1B3, OCT1, MATE2-K, MRP2 or MRP4. In vitro, dolutegravir did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or \nCYP3A4. Based on this data, dolutegravir is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of medicinal \nproducts that are substrates of major enzymes or transporters (see section 4.5).  \n \nIn vitro, dolutegravir was not a substrate of human OATP 1B1, OATP 1B3 or OCT 1. \n \nElimination \n  \nDolutegravir has a terminal half-life of ~14 hours.  The apparent oral clearance (CL/F) is approximately \n1L/hr in HIV-infected patients based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n  \nThe linearity of dolutegravir pharmacokinetics is dependent on dose and formulation. Following oral \nadministration of film-coated tablet formulations, in general, dolutegravir exhibited nonlinear \npharmacokinetics with less than dose-proportional increases in plasma exposure from 2 to 100 mg; however \nincrease in dolutegravir exposure appears dose proportional from 25 mg to 50 mg for the film-coated tablet \nformulation. With 50 mg film-coated tablet twice daily, the exposure over 24 hours was approximately \ndoubled compared to 50 mg film-coated tablet once daily. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) \n \nIn a randomized, dose-ranging trial, HIV-1\u2013infected subjects treated with dolutegravir monotherapy \n(ING111521) demonstrated rapid and dose-dependent antiviral activity, with mean decline in HIV-1 RNA of \n2.5 log10 at day 11 for 50 mg dose. This antiviral response was maintained for 3 to 4 days after the last dose \nin the 50 mg film-coated tablet group.   \n \nPK/PD modelling using pooled data from clinical studies in integrase resistant patients suggest that \nincreasing the dose from 50 mg film-coated tablet twice daily to 100 mg film-coated tablet twice daily may \nincrease the effectiveness of dolutegravir in patients with integrase resistance and limited treatment options \ndue to advanced multi class resistance. The proportion of responders (HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL) at week 24 \nwas predicted to increase around 4-18% in the subjects with Q148 + \u22652 secondary mutations from \nG140A/C/S, E138A/K/T, L74I. Although these simulated results have not been confirmed in clinical trials, \nthis high dose may be considered in the presence of the Q148 + \u22652 secondary mutations from G140A/C/S, \nE138A/K/T, L74I in patients with overall limited treatment options due to advanced multi class resistance. \nThere is no clinical data on the safety or efficacy of the 100 mg film-coated tablet twice daily dose. Co-\ntreatment with atazanavir increases the exposure of dolutegravir markedly, and should not be used in \ncombination with this high dose, since safety with the resulting dolutegravir exposure has not been \nestablished. \n \nSpecial patient populations \n \nChildren  \nThe pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir given once daily as film-coated and dispersible tablets in HIV-1 \ninfected infants, children and adolescents aged \u2265 4 weeks to < 18 years were evaluated in two on-going \nstudies (P1093/ING112578 and ODYSSEY/201296). Steady state simulated plasma exposure at once daily \nweight band doses is summarized in Table 11.  \n\n\n\n25 \n\nTable 11 Summary of Simulated Dolutegravir PK Parameters at Once Daily Doses by Weight Band in \nPaediatric HIV-1 Infected Subjects \n\nWeight Band \n(kg) \n\nDolutegravir \nDosage \nForma \n\nOnce Daily \nDose (mg) \n\nPK Parameter \nGeometric Mean (90% CI) \n\nCmax \n(\u00b5g/mL) \n\nAUC0-24h \n(\u00b5g*h/mL) \n\nC24h \n(ng/mL) \n\n3 to <6 DT 5 \n4.02  \n\n(2.12, 7.96) \n49.4 \n\n (21.6, 115) \n1070  \n\n(247, 3830) \n\n6 to <10b DT 10 \n5.90  \n\n(3.23, 10.9) \n67.4  \n\n(30.4, 151) \n1240 \n\n (257, 4580) \n\n6 to <10c  DT 15 \n6.67  \n\n(3.75, 12.1) \n68.4  \n\n(30.6, 154) \n964 \n\n(158, 4150) \n\n10 to <14 DT 20 \n6.61  \n\n(3.80, 11.5) \n63.1  \n\n(28.9, 136) \n719  \n\n(102, 3340) \n\n14 to <20 \nDT \n\n \nFCT \n\n25 \n \n\n40 \n\n7.17 \n(4.10, 12.6) \n\n6.96  \n(3.83, 12.5) \n\n69.5  \n(32.1, 151) \n\n72.6  \n(33.7, 156) \n\n824  \n(122, 3780) \n\n972  \n(150, 4260) \n\n20 to <25 \nDT \n\n \nFCT \n\n30 \n \n\n50 \n\n7.37  \n(4.24, 12.9) \n\n7.43  \n(4.13, 13.3) \n\n72.0  \n(33.3, 156)  \n\n78.6  \n(36.8, 171) \n\n881  \n(137, 3960) \n\n1080  \n(178, 4690) \n\n25 to <30 FCT 50 \n6.74  \n\n(3.73, 12.1) \n71.4  \n\n(33.2, 154) \n997  \n\n(162, 4250) \n\n30 to <35 FCT 50 \n6.20  \n\n(3.45, 11.1) \n66.6  \n\n(30.5, 141) \n944  \n\n(154, 4020) \n\n\u226535 FCT 50 \n4.93  \n\n(2.66, 9.08) \n54.0  \n\n(24.4, 118) \n814  \n\n(142, 3310) \n\nTarget: Geometric Mean  46 (37-134) 995 (697-2260) \n\nDT=dispersible tablet \nFCT=film-coated tablet \na.

The bioavailability of dolutegravir DT is ~1.6-fold dolutegravir FCT. \nb. <6 months of age \nc. \u22656 months of age \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n Elderly \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of dolutegravir using data in HIV-1 infected adults showed that there \nwas no clinically relevant effect of age on dolutegravir exposure. \n \nPharmacokinetic data for dolutegravir in subjects >65 years of age are limited. \n \nRenal impairment \nRenal clearance of unchanged active substance is a minor pathway of elimination for dolutegravir. A study \nof the pharmacokinetics of a single 50 mg dose of dolutegravir film-coated tablets was performed in subjects \nwith severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) and matched healthy controls. The exposure to \ndolutegravir was decreased by approximately 40% in subjects with severe renal impairment. The mechanism \nfor the decrease is unknown. No dosage adjustment is considered necessary for patients with renal \nimpairment. Tivicay has not been studied in patients on dialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment \nDolutegravir is primarily metabolized and eliminated by the liver. A single 50 mg dose of dolutegravir film-\ncoated tablets was administered to 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) and to \n8 matched healthy adult controls. While the total dolutegravir concentration in plasma was similar, a 1.5- to \n2-fold increase in unbound exposure to dolutegravir was observed in subjects with moderate hepatic \nimpairment compared to healthy controls. No dosage adjustment is considered necessary for patients with \nmild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \nTivicay has not been studied. \n \nPolymorphisms in drug metabolising enzymes \nThere is no evidence that common polymorphisms in drug metabolising enzymes alter dolutegravir \npharmacokinetics to a clinically meaningful extent. In a meta-analysis using pharmacogenomics samples \ncollected in clinical studies in healthy subjects, subjects with UGT1A1 (n=7) genotypes conferring poor \ndolutegravir metabolism had a 32% lower clearance of dolutegravir and 46% higher AUC compared with \nsubjects with genotypes associated with normal metabolism via UGT1A1 (n=41).  \n \nGender \nPopulation PK analyses using pooled pharmacokinetic data from Phase IIb and Phase III adult trials revealed \nno clinically relevant effect of gender on the exposure of dolutegravir.  \n \nRace  \nPopulation PK analyses using pooled pharmacokinetic data from Phase IIb and Phase III adult trials revealed \nno clinically relevant effect of race on the exposure of dolutegravir. The pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir \nfollowing single dose oral administration to Japanese subjects appear similar to observed parameters in \nWestern (US) subjects.  \n \nCo-infection with Hepatitis B or C  \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that hepatitis C virus co-infection had no clinically relevant \neffect on the exposure to dolutegravir. There are limited data on subjects with hepatitis B co-infection. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nDolutegravir was not mutagenic or clastogenic using in vitro tests in bacteria and cultured mammalian cells, \nand an in vivo rodent micronucleus assay.  Dolutegravir was not carcinogenic in long term studies in the \nmouse and rat. \n \nDolutegravir did not affect male or female fertility in rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day, the highest dose \ntested (24 times the 50 mg twice daily human clinical exposure based on AUC).   \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nOral administration of dolutegravir to pregnant rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg daily from days 6 to 17 of \ngestation did not elicit maternal toxicity, developmental toxicity or teratogenicity (27 times the 50 mg twice \ndaily human clinical exposure based on AUC). \n \nOral administration of dolutegravir to pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1000 mg/kg daily from days 6 to 18 of \ngestation did not elicit developmental toxicity or teratogenicity (0.40 times the 50 mg twice daily human \nclinical exposure based on AUC).  In rabbits, maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption, scant/no \nfaeces/urine, suppressed body weight gain) was observed at 1000 mg/kg (0.40 times the 50 mg twice daily \nhuman clinical exposure based on AUC).   \n \nIn a juvenile toxicity study in rats, dolutegravir administration resulted in two preweanling deaths at \n75 mg/kg/day.  Over the preweaning treatment period, mean body weight gain was decreased in this group \nand the decrease persisted throughout the entire study for females during the postweaning period.  The \nsystemic exposure at this dose (based on AUC) to dolutegravir was ~17-20-fold higher than humans at the \nrecommended pediatric exposure.  There were no new target organs identified in juveniles compared to \nadults.  In the rat pre/post-natal development study, decreased body weight of the developing offspring was \nobserved during lactation at a maternally toxic dose (approximately 27 times human exposure at the \nmaximum recommended human dose). \n \nThe effect of prolonged daily treatment with high doses of dolutegravir has been evaluated in repeat oral \ndose toxicity studies in rats (up to 26 weeks) and in monkeys (up to 38 weeks).  The primary effect of \ndolutegravir was gastrointestinal intolerance or irritation in rats and monkeys at doses that produce systemic \nexposures approximately 21 and 0.82 times the 50 mg twice daily human clinical exposure based on AUC, \nrespectively.  Because gastrointestinal (GI) intolerance is considered to be due to local active substance \nadministration, mg/kg or mg/m2 metrics are appropriate determinates of safety cover for this toxicity.  GI \nintolerance in monkeys occurred at 15 times the human mg/kg equivalent dose (based on a 50 kg human), \nand 5 times the human mg/m2 equivalent dose for a clinical dose of 50 mg twice daily.   \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTivicay 5 mg dispersible tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach dispersible tablet contains dolutegravir sodium equivalent to 5 mg dolutegravir. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nDispersible tablet. \nWhite, round, biconvex tablets approximately 6 mm in diameter debossed with \u2018SV H7S\u2019 on one side and \u20185\u2019 \non the other side.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTivicay is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment of Human \nImmunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected adults, adolescents and children of at least 4 weeks of age or older \nand weighing at least 3 kg.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n \nTivicay should be prescribed by physicians experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \n \nPatients infected with HIV-1 without documented or clinically suspected resistance to the integrase class \nThe recommended dose of dolutegravir is 30 mg (six 5 mg dispersible tablets) orally once daily.  \n \nDolutegravir should be administered twice daily in this population when co-administered with some \nmedicines (e.g. efavirenz, nevirapine, tipranavir/ritonavir, or rifampicin).  Please refer to section 4.5. \n \nPatients infected with HIV-1 with resistance to the integrase class (documented or clinically suspected) \nThe recommended dose of dolutegravir is 30 mg (six 5 mg dispersible tablets) twice daily.  \n \nIn the presence of documented resistance that includes Q148 + \u22652 secondary mutations from G140A/C/S, \nE138A/K/T, L74I, modelling suggests that an increased dose may be considered for patients with limited \ntreatment options (less than 2 active agents) due to advanced multi class resistance (see section 5.2).  \n \nThe decision to use dolutegravir for such patients should be informed by the integrase resistance pattern (see \nsection 5.1). \n \n\nAdolescents, children and infants aged 4 weeks and above and weighing at least 3 kg  \n\nPatients infected with HIV-1 without resistance to the integrase class \n\n\n\n32 \n\nThe recommended dose of dolutegravir is determined according to weight and age (see Table 1 and section \n5.2).  \n \nTable 1 Paediatric dose recommendations for dispersible tablets \n\nBody weight (kg) Dose \n3 to less than 6  5 mg once daily \n\n6 to less than 10 \n                          < 6 months                          \n \n                          \u2265 6 months \n \n\n \n10 mg once daily  \n \n15 mg once daily \n \n\n10 to less than 14  20 mg once daily \n \n\n14 to less than 20 25 mg once daily \n\n20 or greater 30 mg once daily \n\n \nAlternatively, if preferred the dose may be divided equally into 2 doses, with one dose taken in the morning \nand one dose taken in the evening (see Table 2 and section 5.2). \n \nTable 2 Alternative paediatric dose recommendations for dispersible tablets \n\nBody weight (kg) Dose \n3 to less than 6           --- \n\n6 to less than 10 \n                          < 6 months                          \n \n                          \u2265 6 months \n \n\n \n5 mg twice daily  \n \n10 mg twice daily \n \n\n10 to less than 14  10 mg twice daily \n \n\n14 to less than 20  15 mg twice daily \n\n20 or greater  15 mg twice daily \n\n \nPatients infected with HIV-1 with resistance to the integrase class \nThere are insufficient data to recommend a dose for dolutegravir in integrase inhibitor resistant adolescents, \nchildren and infants. \n \nFilm-coated tablets \nTivicay is available as dispersible tablets for patients aged 4 weeks and above and weighing at least 3 kg, or \nfor patients in whom film-coated tablets are not appropriate. Tivicay is available as film-coated tablets for \npatients aged 6 years and above and weighing at least 14 kg. Patients can change between dispersible tablets \nand film-coated tablets. However, the bioavailability of dispersible tablets and film-coated tablets is not \ncomparable, therefore they are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see section 5.2). For \nexample, the recommended adult dose for dispersible tablets is 30 mg versus 50 mg for film-coated tablets. \nPatients changing between dispersible and film-coated tablets should follow the dosing recommendations \nthat are specific for the formulation. \n \nMissed doses \n\n\n\n33 \n\nIf the patient misses a dose of Tivicay, the patient should take Tivicay as soon as possible, providing the next \ndose is not due within 4 hours. If the next dose is due within 4 hours, the patient should not take the missed \ndose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule.  \n \nElderly \nThere are limited data available on the use of dolutegravir in patients aged 65 years and over.  There is no \nevidence that elderly patients require a different dose than younger adult patients (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate or severe (CrCl <30 mL/min, not on \ndialysis) renal impairment.  No data are available in subjects receiving dialysis although differences in \npharmacokinetics are not expected in this population (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh grade A \nor B).  No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh grade C); therefore \ndolutegravir should be used with caution in these patients (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of dolutegravir in children aged less than 4 weeks or weighing less than 3 kg have \nnot yet been established. There are insufficient data to recommend a dose for dolutegravir in integrase \ninhibitor resistant adolescents, children and infants. Currently available data are described in section 4.8, 5.1 \nand 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. \nTivicay can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). In the presence of integrase class resistance, \nTivicay should preferably be taken with food to enhance exposure (particularly in patients with Q148 \nmutations) (see section 5.2). The dispersible tablets may be dispersed in drinking water, or swallowed whole \nwith drinking water.  \n \nWhen dispersed, the amount of water will depend on the number of tablets prescribed. The tablet(s) should \nbe fully dispersed before swallowing. However, tablets should not be chewed, cut or crushed. The dose of \nmedicine must be given within 30 minutes of preparation. If it has been more than 30 minutes the dose \nshould be washed away and a new dose should be prepared. Comprehensive instructions for dispersing the \ntablet are provided in the package leaflet (see Step-by-step instructions for use). \n \nIf swallowing tablets whole, patients should not swallow more than one tablet at a time, to reduce the risk of \nchoking. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nMedicinal products with narrow therapeutic windows that are substrates of organic cation transporter 2 \n(OCT2), including but not limited to fampridine (also known as dalfampridine; see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce the risk \nof sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent transmission should be \ntaken in accordance with national guidelines.  \n \nIntegrase class resistance of particular concern \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nThe decision to use dolutegravir in the presence of integrase class resistance should take into account that the \nactivity of dolutegravir is considerably compromised for viral strains harbouring Q148+\u22652 secondary \nmutations from G140A/C/S, E138A/K/T, L74I (see section 5.1). To what extent dolutegravir provides added \nefficacy in the presence of such integrase class resistance is uncertain (see section 5.2). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nHypersensitivity reactions have been reported with dolutegravir, and were characterized by rash, \nconstitutional findings, and sometimes, organ dysfunction, including severe liver reactions. Dolutegravir and \nother suspect medicinal products should be discontinued immediately if signs or symptoms of \nhypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by raised \nliver enzymes, fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, \nfacial oedema, eosinophilia, angioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases and bilirubin \nshould be monitored. Delay in stopping treatment with dolutegravir or other suspect active substances after \nthe onset of hypersensitivity may result in a life-threatening allergic reaction.  \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such \nreactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples \nare cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii \npneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.  \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur \nin the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events \ncan occur many months after initiation of treatment.  \n \nLiver biochemistry elevations consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome were observed in some \nhepatitis B and/or C co-infected patients at the start of dolutegravir therapy.  Monitoring of liver \nbiochemistries is recommended in patients with hepatitis B and/or C co-infection.  Particular diligence \nshould be applied in initiating or maintaining effective hepatitis B therapy (referring to treatment guidelines) \nwhen starting dolutegravir-based therapy in hepatitis B co-infected patients (see section 4.8). \n \nOpportunistic infections \n \nPatients should be advised that dolutegravir or any other antiretroviral therapy does not cure HIV infection \nand that they may still develop opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection. Therefore, \npatients should remain under close clinical observation by physicians experienced in the treatment of these \nassociated HIV diseases. \n \nDrug interactions \n \nFactors that decrease dolutegravir exposure should be avoided in the presence of integrase class resistance. \nThis includes co-administration with medicinal products that reduce dolutegravir exposure (e.g. magnesium/ \naluminium-containing antacid, iron and calcium supplements, multivitamins and inducing agents, etravirine \n(without boosted protease inhibitors), tipranavir/ritonavir, rifampicin, St. John\u2019s wort and certain anti-\nepileptic medicinal products) (see section 4.5). \n \nDolutegravir increased metformin concentrations. A dose adjustment of metformin should be considered \nwhen starting and stopping coadministration of dolutegravir with metformin, to maintain glycaemic control \n(see section 4.5). Metformin is eliminated renally and, therefore, it is of importance to monitor renal function \nwhen co-treated with dolutegravir. This combination may increase the risk for lactic acidosis in patients with \nmoderate renal impairment (stage 3a creatinine clearance [CrCl] 45\u2013 59 mL/min) and a cautious approach is \nrecommended. Reduction of the metformin dose should be highly considered.   \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nOsteonecrosis \n \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, biphosphonates, \nalcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to CART. Patients should be \nadvised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in \nmovement. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \n \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral therapy. Such \nchanges may in part be linked to disease control and lifestyle. For lipids, there is in some cases evidence for \na treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating this to any particular treatment. \nFor monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to established HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid \ndisorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nLamivudine and dolutegravir  \n \nThe two-drug regimen of dolutegravir 50 mg film-coated tablets once daily and lamivudine 300 mg once \ndaily was explored in two large randomized and blinded studies, GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 (see section 5.1). \nThis regimen is only suitable for the treatment of HIV-1 infection where there is no known or suspected \nresistance to the integrase inhibitor class, or to lamivudine. \n \nExcipients \n \nTivicay contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say is essentially \u2018sodium free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffect of other agents on the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir \n \nAll factors that decrease dolutegravir exposure should be avoided in the presence of integrase class \nresistance. \n \nDolutegravir is eliminated mainly through metabolism by UGT1A1. Dolutegravir is also a substrate of \nUGT1A3, UGT1A9, CYP3A4, Pgp, and BCRP; therefore medicinal products that induce those enzymes may \ndecrease dolutegravir plasma concentration and reduce the therapeutic effect of dolutegravir (see Table 3). \nCo-administration of dolutegravir and other medicinal products that inhibit these enzymes may increase \ndolutegravir plasma concentration (see Table 3). \n \nThe absorption of dolutegravir is reduced by certain anti-acid agents (see Table 3). \n \nEffect of dolutegravir on the pharmacokinetics of other agents \n \nIn vivo, dolutegravir did not have an effect on midazolam, a CYP3A4 probe.  Based on in vivo and/or in vitro \ndata, dolutegravir is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of \nany major enzyme or transporter such as CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and P-gp (for more information see section 5.2).   \n \nIn vitro, dolutegravir inhibited the renal organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) and multidrug and toxin \nextrusion transporter (MATE) 1. In vivo, a 10-14% decrease of creatinine clearance (secretory fraction is \ndependent on OCT2 and MATE-1 transport) was observed in patients. In vivo, dolutegravir may increase \nplasma concentrations of medicinal products in which excretion is dependent upon OCT2 and/or MATE-1 \n(e.g. fampridine [also known as dalfampridine], metformin) (see Table 3). \n \nIn vitro, dolutegravir inhibited the renal uptake transporters, organic anion transporters (OAT1) and OAT3.  \nBased on the lack of effect on the in vivo pharmacokinetics of the OAT substrate tenofovir, in vivo inhibition \n\n\n\n36 \n\nof OAT1 is unlikely. Inhibition of OAT3 has not been studied in vivo. Dolutegravir may increase plasma \nconcentrations of medicinal products in which excretion is dependent upon OAT3.   \n \nEstablished and theoretical interactions with selected antiretrovirals and non-antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts are listed in Table 3. \n \nInteraction table \nInteractions between dolutegravir and co-administered medicinal products are listed in Table 3 (increase is \nindicated as \u201c\u2191\u201d, decrease as \u201c\u2193\u201d, no change as \u201c\u2194\u201d, area under the concentration versus time curve as \n\u201cAUC\u201d, maximum observed concentration as \u201cCmax\u201d, concentration at end of dosing interval as \u201cC\u03c4\u201d). \n \nTable 3: Drug Interactions \nMedicinal products \nby therapeutic areas \n\nInteraction  \nGeometric mean change \n(%)  \n\nRecommendations concerning \nco-administration \n\nHIV-1 Antiviral Agents \nNon-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors \nEtravirine without \nboosted protease \ninhibitors \n\nDolutegravir \u2193 \n   AUC \u2193 71% \n   Cmax \u2193 52% \n   C\u03c4 \u2193 88% \n \nEtravirine \u2194 \n(induction of UGT1A1 and \nCYP3A enzymes) \n\nEtravirine without boosted protease inhibitors \ndecreased plasma dolutegravir concentration.

Most neural tube defects occur within the first 4 weeks of embryonic development after \nconception (approximately 6 weeks after the last menstrual period). If a pregnancy is confirmed in the \nfirst trimester while on dolutegravir, the benefits and risks of continuing dolutegravir versus switching to \nanother antiretroviral regimen should be discussed with the patient taking the gestational age and the critical \ntime period of neural tube defect development into account. \n \nData analysed from the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry do not indicate an increased risk of major birth \ndefects in over 600 women exposed to dolutegravir during pregnancy but are currently insufficient to address \nthe risk of neural tube defects. \n \nIn animal reproductive toxicity studies, no adverse development outcomes, including neural tube defects, \nwere identified (see section 5.3). Dolutegravir was shown to cross the placenta in animals.  \n \nMore than 1000 outcomes from exposure during second and third trimester of pregnancy indicate no \nevidence of increased risk of foeto/neonatal toxicity. Dolutegravir may be used during the second and third \ntrimester of pregnancy when the expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nDolutegravir is excreted in human milk in small amounts. There is insufficient information on the effects of \ndolutegravir in neonates/infants. \n \nIt is recommended that HIV infected women do not breast-feed their infants under any circumstances in \norder to avoid transmission of HIV. \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effects of dolutegravir on human male or female fertility. Animal studies indicate no \neffects of dolutegravir on male or female fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with dolutegravir. The clinical \nstatus of the patient and the adverse reaction profile of dolutegravir should be borne in mind when \nconsidering the patient's ability to drive or operate machinery.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most severe adverse reaction, seen in an individual patient, was a hypersensitivity reaction that included \nrash and severe liver effects (see section 4.4).  The most commonly seen treatment emergent adverse \nreactions were nausea (13%), diarrhoea (18%) and headache (13%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions considered at least possibly related to dolutegravir are listed by body system, organ \nclass and absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000). \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nTable 4 Adverse Reactions \nImmune system \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Hypersensitivity (see section 4.4) \nUncommon Immune Reconstitution Syndrome (see section 4.4)** \n\nPsychiatric disorders Common Insomnia \nCommon Abnormal dreams \nCommon Depression \nCommon Anxiety \nUncommon Suicidal ideation*, suicide attempt*  \n\n*particularly in patients with a pre-existing history of \ndepression or psychiatric illness. \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nVery common Headache \nCommon Dizziness \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nVery common Nausea \nVery common Diarrhoea \nCommon Vomiting \nCommon Flatulence \nCommon Upper abdominal pain \nCommon Abdominal pain \nCommon Abdominal discomfort \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Hepatitis \n\nRare Acute hepatic failure \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nCommon Rash \nCommon Pruritus \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Arthralgia \nUncommon Myalgia \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nCommon Fatigue \n\nInvestigations Common Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or Aspartate \naminotransferase (AST) elevations \n\nCommon Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevations \n \n**see below under Description of selected adverse reactions. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nChanges in laboratory biochemistries \nIncreases in serum creatinine occurred within the first week of treatment with dolutegravir and remained \nstable through 48 weeks. A mean change from baseline of 9.96 \u00b5mol/L was observed after 48 weeks of \ntreatment. Creatinine increases were comparable by various background regimens. These changes are not \nconsidered to be clinically relevant since they do not reflect a change in glomerular filtration rate. \n \nCo-infection with Hepatitis B or C \nIn Phase III studies patients with hepatitis B and/or C co-infection were permitted to enrol provided that \nbaseline liver chemistry tests did not exceed 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Overall, the safety \nprofile in patients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or C was similar to that observed in patients without \nhepatitis B or C co-infection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were higher in the subgroup \nwith hepatitis B and/or C co-infection for all treatment groups. Liver chemistry elevations consistent with \nimmune reconstitution syndrome were observed in some subjects with hepatitis B and/or C co-infection at \nthe start of dolutegravir therapy, particularly in those whose anti-hepatitis B therapy was withdrawn (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n43 \n\nImmune reactivation syndrome \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination antiretroviral \ntherapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise.  \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; \nhowever, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation \nof treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nBased on available data from the ongoing P1093 (ING112578) and ODYSSEY (201296) studies in 172 \ninfants, children and adolescents (aged 4 weeks and above, to less than 18 years, and weighing at least 3 kg), \nwho received the recommended doses of dispersible tablets or film-coated tablets once daily, there were no \nadditional types of adverse reactions beyond those observed in the adult population. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is currently limited experience with overdosage in dolutegravir.  \n \nLimited experience of single higher doses (up to 250 mg film-coated tablets in healthy subjects) revealed no \nspecific symptoms or signs, apart from those listed as adverse reactions.   \n \nFurther management should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by the national poisons centre, \nwhere available.  There is no specific treatment for an overdose of dolutegravir. If overdose occurs, the \npatient should be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring, as necessary. As dolutegravir is highly \nbound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by dialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, other antivirals, ATC code: J05AX12 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nDolutegravir inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand transfer \nstep of retroviral Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integration which is essential for the HIV replication cycle. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nAntiviral activity in cell culture  \nThe IC50 for dolutegravir in various labstrains using PBMC was 0.5 nM, and when using MT-4 cells it \nranged from 0.7-2 nM. Similar IC50s were seen for clinical isolates without any major difference between \nsubtypes; in a panel of 24 HIV-1 isolates of clades A, B, C, D, E, F and G and group O the mean IC50 value \nwas 0.2 nM (range 0.02-2.14). The mean IC50 for 3 HIV-2 isolates was 0.18 nM (range 0.09-0.61). \n \nAntiviral activity in combination with other antiviral agents \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n44 \n\nNo antagonistic effects in vitro were seen with dolutegravir and other antiretrovirals tested: stavudine, \nabacavir, efavirenz, nevirapine, lopinavir, amprenavir, enfuvirtide, maraviroc and raltegravir.  In addition, no \nantagonistic effects were seen for dolutegravir and adefovir, and ribavirin had no apparent effect on \ndolutegravir activity.  \n \nEffect of human serum  \nIn 100% human serum, the mean protein fold shift was 75 fold, resulting in protein adjusted IC90 of 0.064 \n\u00b5g/mL.  \n \nResistance \n \nResistance in vitro \n \nSerial passage is used to study resistance evolution in vitro. When using the lab-strain HIV-1 IIIB during \npassage over 112 days, mutations selected appeared slowly, with substitutions at positions S153Y and F, \nresulting in a maximal fold change in susceptibility of 4 (range 2-4). These mutations were not selected in \npatients treated with dolutegravir in the clinical studies.  Using strain NL432, mutations E92Q (FC 3) and \nG193E (also FC 3) were selected. The E92Q mutation has been selected in patients with pre-existing \nraltegravir resistance who were then treated with dolutegravir (listed as a secondary mutation for \ndolutegravir).  \n \nIn further selection experiments using clinical isolates of subtype B, mutation R263K was seen in all five \nisolates (after 20 weeks and onwards). In subtype C (n=2) and A/G (n=2) isolates the integrase substitution \nR263K was selected in one isolate, and G118R in two isolates.  R263K was reported from two ART \nexperienced, INI naive individual patients with subtypes B and C in the clinical program, but without effects \non dolutegravir susceptibility in vitro. G118R lowers the susceptibility to dolutegravir in site directed \nmutants (FC 10), but was not detected in patients receiving dolutegravir in the Phase III program.   \n \nPrimary mutations for raltegravir/elvitegravir (Q148H/R/K, N155H, Y143R/H/C, E92Q and T66I) do not \naffect the in vitro susceptibility of dolutegravir as single mutations. When mutations listed as secondary \nintegrase inhibitor associated mutations (for raltegravir/elvitegravir) are added to these primary mutations in \nexperiments with site directed mutants, dolutegravir susceptibility is still unchanged (FC <2 vs wild type \nvirus), except in the case of Q148-mutations, where a FC of 5-10 or higher is seen with combinations of \ncertain secondary mutations. The effect by the Q148-mutations (H/R/K) was also verified in passage \nexperiments with site directed mutants.  In serial passage with strain NL432, starting with site directed \nmutants harbouring N155H or E92Q, no further selection of resistance was seen (FC unchanged around 1). \nIn contrast, starting with mutants harbouring mutation Q148H (FC 1), a variety of secondary mutations were \nseen with a consequent increase of FC to values >10.  \n \nA clinically relevant phenotypic cut-off value (FC vs wild type virus) has not been determined; genotypic \nresistance was a better predictor for outcome. \n \nSeven hundred and five raltegravir resistant isolates from raltegravir experienced patients were analyzed for \nsusceptibility to dolutegravir.  Dolutegravir has a less than or equal to 10 FC against 94% of the 705 clinical \nisolates. \n \nResistance in vivo \nIn previously untreated patients receiving dolutegravir + 2 NRTIs in Phase IIb and Phase III, no development \nof resistance to the integrase class, or to the NRTI class was seen (n=1118 follow-up of 48-96 weeks). In \npreviously untreated patients receiving dolutegravir + lamivudine in the GEMINI studies through week 96 \n(n=716), no development of resistance to the integrase class, or to the NRTI class was seen. \n \nIn patients with prior failed therapies, but na\u00efve to the integrase class (SAILING study), integrase inhibitor \nsubstitutions were observed in 4/354 patients (follow-up 48 weeks) treated with dolutegravir, which was \ngiven in combination with an investigator selected background regimen (BR). Of these four, two subjects \nhad a unique R263K integrase substitution, with a maximum FC of 1.93, one subject had a polymorphic \n\n\n\n45 \n\nV151V/I integrase substitution, with maximum FC of 0.92, and one subject had pre-existing integrase \nmutations and is assumed to have been integrase experienced or infected with integrase resistant virus by \ntransmission. The R263K mutation was also selected in vitro (see above). \n \nIn the presence of integrase class-resistance (VIKING-3 study) the following mutations were selected in 32 \npatients with protocol defined virological failure (PDVF) through Week 24 and with paired genotypes (all \ntreated with a 50 mg dose of dolutegravir film-coated tablets twice daily + optimized background agents):  \nL74L/M (n=1), E92Q (n=2), T97A (n=9), E138K/A/T (n=8), G140S (n=2), Y143H (n=1), S147G (n=1), \nQ148H/K/R (n=4), and N155H (n=1) and E157E/Q (n=1).  Treatment emergent integrase resistance typically \nappeared in patients with a history of the Q148-mutation (baseline or historic). Five further subjects \nexperienced PDVF between weeks 24 and 48, and 2 of these 5 had treatment emergent mutations.  \nTreatment-emergent mutations or mixtures of mutations observed were L74I (n=1), N155H (n=2). \n \nThe VIKING-4 study examined dolutegravir (plus optimized background therapy) in subjects with primary \ngenotypic resistance to INIs at Screening in 30 subjects.  Treatment-emergent mutations observed were \nconsistent with those observed in the VIKING-3 study. \n \nIn paediatric patients with prior failed therapies, but na\u00efve to the integrase class, the integrase inhibitor \nsubstitution G118R was observed in 5/159 patients treated with dolutegravir, given in combination with an \ninvestigator selected background regimen. Of these five, 4 participants had additional integrase associated \nsubstitutions as follows: L74M, E138E/K, E92E/Q and T66I. Four of the 5 participants with emergent \nG118R had phenotypic data available. Dolutegravir FC (fold change as compared to wildtype virus) for these \nfour participants ranged from 6 to 25-fold. \n \nEffects on electrocardiogram \n \nNo relevant effects were seen on the QTc interval with doses exceeding the clinical dose by approximately \nthree fold.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety  \n \nPreviously untreated patients  \nThe efficacy of dolutegravir in HIV-infected, therapy na\u00efve subjects is based on the analyses of 96-week data \nfrom two randomized, international, double-blind, active-controlled trials, SPRING-2 (ING113086) and \nSINGLE (ING114467). This is supported by 96 week data from an open-label, randomized and active-\ncontrolled study FLAMINGO (ING114915) and additional data from the open-label phase of SINGLE to \n144 weeks. The efficacy of dolutegravir in combination with lamivudine in adults is supported by 96-week \ndata from two identical 148-week, randomised, multicentre, double-blind, non-inferiority studies GEMINI-1 \n(204861) and GEMINI-2 (205543). \n \nIn SPRING-2, 822 adults were randomized and received at least one dose of either dolutegravir 50 mg film-\ncoated tablets once daily or raltegravir (RAL) 400 mg twice daily, both administered with either ABC/3TC \nor TDF/FTC.  At baseline, median patient age was 36 years, 14% were female, 15% non-white, 11% had \nhepatitis B and/or C co-infection and 2% were CDC Class C, these characteristics were similar between \ntreatment groups. \n \nIn SINGLE, 833 subjects were randomized and received at least one dose of either dolutegravir 50 mg film-\ncoated tablets once daily with fixed-dose abacavir-lamivudine (Dolutegravir + ABC/3TC) or fixed-dose \nefavirenz-tenofovir-emtricitabine (EFV/TDF/FTC). At baseline, median patient age was 35 years, 16% were \nfemale, 32% non-white, 7% had hepatitis C co-infection and 4% were CDC Class C, these characteristics \nwere similar between treatment groups.  \n \nThe primary endpoint and other week 48 outcomes (including outcomes by key baseline covariates) for \nSPRING-2 and SINGLE are shown in Table 5. \n \nTable 5 Response in SPRING-2 and SINGLE at 48 Weeks (Snapshot algorithm, <50 copies/mL) \n\n\n\n46 \n\n SPRING-2 SINGLE \n Dolutegravir \n\n50 mg Once \nDaily + 2 NRTI \n\nN=411 \n\nRAL 400 mg \nTwice Daily + 2 \n\nNRTI \nN=411 \n\nDolutegravir \n50 mg + \n\nABC/3TC Once \nDaily \n\nN=414 \n\nEFV/TDF/FTC \nOnce Daily \n\nN=419 \n\nHIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL 88% 85% 88% 81% \n  Treatment Difference* 2.5% (95% CI: -2.2%, 7.1%) 7.4% (95% CI: 2.5%, 12.3%) \nVirologic non-response\u2020  5% 8% 5% 6% \n\nHIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL by baseline covariates \nBaseline Viral Load \n(cps/mL)     \n\n  \u2264100,000  267 / 297 (90%) 264 / 295 (89%) 253 / 280 (90%) 238 / 288 (83%) \n  >100,000  94 / 114 (82%) 87 / 116 (75%) 111 / 134 (83%) 100 / 131 (76%) \nBaseline CD4+ (cells/ mm3)     \n  <200 43 / 55 (78%) 34 / 50 (68%) 45 / 57 (79%) 48 / 62 (77%) \n  200 to <350  128 / 144 (89%) 118 / 139 (85%) 143 / 163 (88%) 126 / 159 (79%) \n  \u2265350  190 / 212 (90%) 199 / 222 (90%) 176 / 194 (91%) 164 / 198 (83%) \nNRTI backbone     \n  ABC/3TC 145 / 169 (86%) 142 / 164 (87%) N/A N/A \n  TDF/FTC 216 / 242 (89%) 209 / 247 (85%) N/A N/A \nGender     \n  Male  308 / 348 (89%) 305 / 355 (86%) 307 / 347 (88%) 291 / 356 (82%) \n  Female 53 / 63 (84%) 46 / 56 (82%) 57 / 67 (85%) 47 / 63 (75%) \nRace      \n  White  306 / 346 (88%) 301 / 352 (86%) 255 / 284 (90%) 238 /285 (84%) \n  African-America/African \nHeritage/Other 55 / 65 (85%) 50 / 59 (85%) 109 / 130 (84%) 99 / 133 (74%) \n\nAge (years)     \n  <50 324/370 (88%) 312/365 (85%) 319/361 (88%) 302/375 (81%) \n  \u226550 37/41 (90%) 39/46 (85%) 45/53 (85%) 36/44 (82%) \nMedian CD4 change from \nbaseline 230 230 246\u2021 187\u2021 \n\n* Adjusted for baseline stratification factors. \n\u2020 Includes subjects who changed BR to new class or changed BR not permitted per protocol or due to lack \nof efficacy prior to Week 48 (for SPRING-2 only), subjects who discontinued prior to Week 48 for lack or \nloss of efficacy and subjects who are \u226550 copies in the 48 week window.  \n\u2021 Adjusted mean treatment difference was statistically significant (p<0.001) \n \nAt week 48, dolutegravir was non-inferior to raltegravir in the SPRING-2 study, and in the SINGLE study \ndolutegravir + ABC/3TC was superior to efavirenz/TDF/FTC (p=0.003), table 5 above. In SINGLE, the \nmedian time to viral suppression was shorter in the dolutegravir treated patients (28 vs 84 days, (p<0.0001, \nanalysis pre-specified and adjusted for multiplicity).  \n \nAt week 96, results were consistent with those seen at week 48.  In SPRING-2, dolutegravir was still non-\ninferior to raltegravir (viral suppression in 81% vs 76% of patients), and with a median change in CD4 count \nof 276 vs 264 cells/mm3, respectively.  In SINGLE, dolutegravir + ABC/3TC was still superior to \nEFV/TDF/FTC (viral suppression in 80% vs 72%, treatment difference 8.0% (2.3, 13.8), p=0.006, and with \nan adjusted mean change in CD4 count of 325 vs 281 cells/ mm3, respectively.  At 144 weeks in the open-\nlabel phase of SINGLE, virologic suppression was maintained, the dolutegravir + ABC/3TC arm (71%) was \nsuperior to the EFV/TDF/FTC arm (63%), treatment difference was 8.3% (2.0, 14.6). \n \nIn FLAMINGO (ING114915), an open-label, randomised and active-controlled study, 484 HIV-1 infected \nantiretroviral na\u00efve adults received one dose of either dolutegravir 50 mg film-coated tablets once daily \n(n=242) or darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) 800 mg/100 mg once daily (n=242), both administered with either \n\n\n\n47 \n\nABC/3TC or TDF/FTC.  At baseline, median patient age was 34 years, 15% were female, 28% non-white, \n10% had hepatitis B and/or C co-infection, and 3% were CDC Class C; these characteristics were similar \nbetween treatment groups.  Virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) in the dolutegravir group \n(90%) was superior to the DRV/r group (83%) at 48 weeks. The adjusted difference in proportion and 95% \nCI were 7.1% (0.9, 13.2), p=0.025. At 96 weeks, virologic suppression in the dolutegravir group (80%) was \nsuperior to the DRV/r group (68%), (adjusted treatment difference [Dolutegravir-(DRV+RTV)]: 12.4%; 95% \nCI: [4.7, 20.2]. \n \nIn GEMINI-1 (204861) and GEMINI-2 (205543), identical 148-week, randomised, double-blind studies, \n1433 adult HIV-1 infected antiretroviral na\u00efve subjects were randomised to either a two-drug regimen of \ndolutegravir 50 mg film-coated tablets plus lamivudine 300 mg once daily, or to a three-drug regimen of \ndolutegravir 50 mg film-coated tablets once daily with fixed dose TDF/FTC. Subjects were enrolled with a \nscreening plasma HIV-1 RNA of 1000 c/mL to \u2264500,000 c/mL. At baseline, in the pooled analysis, median \npatient age was 33 years, 15% were female, 31% non-white, 6% had hepatitis C co-infection and 9% were \nCDC Stage 3. Approximately one third of the patients were infected with an HIV non-B subtype; these \ncharacteristics were similar between treatment groups. Virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) \nin the dolutegravir plus lamivudine group was non-inferior to the dolutegravir plus TDF/FTC group at 48 \nweeks, as shown in Table 6. The results of the pooled analysis were in line with those of the individual \nstudies, for which the primary endpoint (difference in proportion <50 copies/mL plasma HIV-1 RNA at \nweek 48 based on the Snapshot algorithm) was met. The adjusted difference was -2.6% (95% CI: -6.7; 1.5) \nfor GEMINI-1 and -0.7% (95% CI: -4.3; 2.9) for GEMINI-2 with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of \n10%. \n \nTable 6 Response (<50 cps/ml, snapshot) in GEMINI 1 + 2, pooled data.  \n\n Dolutegravir + 3TC \n(N=716) \nn/N (%) \n\nDolutegravir + \nTDF/FTC \n(N=717) \nn/N (%) \n\nAll patients 655/716 (91) 669/717 (93) \n adjusted diff -1.7% (CI95-4.4, 1.1) a \n\nBy BL HIV-1 RNA \n\u2264100,000 cps/mL 526/576 (91) 531/564 (94) \n>100,000 cps/mL 129/140 (92) 138/153 (90) \nBy CD4+ \n\u2264200 c/ mm3 50/63 (79) 51/55 (93) \n>200 c/ mm3 605/653 (93) 618/662 (93) \nBy HIV-1 subtype  \nB 424/467 (91) 452/488 (93) \nNon-B 231/249 (93) 217/229 (95) \n\n \nRebound up to week 48 b 6 (<1) 4 (<1) \n\n \nMean change in CD4 count from \nbaseline at Week 48, c/ mm3 224 217 \n\na adjusted for BL stratification factors: Plasma HIV-1 RNA (\u2264100,000 cps/mL vs. >100,000 cps/mL) and CD4+ \ncell count (\u2264200 cells/mm3 vs. >200 cells/mm3). \nb Confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA levels to \u2265200 cps/mL after prior confirmed suppression to <200 cps/mL. \n\n  \nAt 96 weeks the dolutegravir plus lamivudine group (86% with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL [pooled \ndata]) remained non-inferior to the dolutegravir plus tenofovir/emtricitabine FDC group (90% with plasma \nHIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL [pooled data]). The adjusted difference in proportions and 95% CI was -3.4% (-\n6.7, 0.0). The results of the pooled analysis were in line with those of the individual studies, for which the \nsecondary endpoint (difference in proportion <50 copies/mL plasma HIV-1 RNA at Week 96 based on the \nSnapshot algorithm for dolutegravir plus lamivudine versus dolutegravir plus tenofovir/emtricitabine FDC) \nwas met. The adjusted differences of -4.9 (95% CI: -9.8; 0.0) for GEMINI-1 and -1.8 (95% CI: -6.4; 2.7) for \n\n\n\n48 \n\nGEMINI-2 were within the prespecified non-inferiority margin of -10%. The mean increase in CD4+ T-cell \ncounts was 269 in the DTG+3TC arm and 259 in the DTG+FTC/TDF arm, at week 96. \n \nTreatment emergent resistance in previously untreated patients failing therapy \nThrough 96 weeks in SPRING-2 and FLAMINGO and 144 weeks in SINGLE, no cases of treatment \nemergent primary resistance to the integrase- or NRTI-class were seen in the dolutegravir-containing arms. \nFor the comparator arms, the same lack of treatment emergent resistance was also the case for patients \ntreated with darunavir/r in FLAMINGO. In SPRING-2, four patients in the RAL-arm failed with major \nNRTI mutations and one with raltegravir resistance; in SINGLE, six patients in the EFV/TDF/FTC-arm \nfailed with mutations associated with NNRTI resistance, and one developed a major NRTI mutation. \nThrough 96 weeks in the GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 studies, no cases of emergent resistance to the \nintegrase- or NRTI-class were seen in either the Dolutegravir+3TC or comparator Dolutegravir+TDF/FTC \narms. \n \nPatients with prior treatment failure, but not exposed to the integrase class  \nIn the international multicentre, double-blind SAILING study (ING111762), 719 HIV-1 infected, \nantiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced adults were randomized and received either dolutegravir 50 mg \nfilm-coated tablets once daily or raltegravir 400 mg twice daily with investigator selected background \nregimen consisting of up to 2 agents (including at least one fully active agent).  At baseline, median patient \nage was 43 years, 32% were female, 50% non-white, 16% had hepatitis B and/or C co-infection, and 46% \nwere CDC Class C.

The study enrolled 183 patients, 133 with INI-\nresistance at Screening and 50 with only historical evidence of resistance (and not at Screening).  \nRaltegravir/elvitegravir was part of the current failing regimen in 98/183 patients (part of prior failing \ntherapies in the others).  At baseline, median patient age was 48 years, 23% were female, 29% non-white, \nand 20% had hepatitis B and/or C co-infection.

At baseline, median patient age was 49 years, 20% were \nfemale, 58% non-white, and 23% had hepatitis B and/or C co-infection.  Median baseline CD4+ was 160 \ncells/mm3, median duration of prior ART was 13 years, and 63% were CDC Class C.

Sixteen of 30 subjects (53%) harboured Q148 virus at baseline.  The \nprimary endpoint at Day 8 showed that dolutegravir 50 mg film-coated tablets twice daily was superior to \nplacebo, with an adjusted mean treatment difference for the change from Baseline in Plasma HIV-1 RNA of \n-1.2 log10 copies/mL (95% CI -1.5 - -0.8log10 copies/mL, p<0.001). The day 8 responses in this placebo \ncontrolled study were fully in line with those seen in VIKING-3 (not placebo controlled), including by \nbaseline integrase resistance categories.

Of these \nfive, 4 participants had additional integrase associated substitutions as follows: L74M, E138E/K, E92E/Q \nand T66I. Four of the 5 participants with emergent G118R had phenotypic data available. Dolutegravir FC \n(fold change as compared to wildtype virus) for these four participants ranged from 6 to 25-fold. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Tivicay in \npaediatric patients aged 4 weeks to below 6 years with HIV infection (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \nThere are no data available on the use of dolutegravir plus lamivudine as a two-drug regimen in paediatric \npatients. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDolutegravir pharmacokinetics are similar between healthy and HIV-infected subjects. The PK variability of \ndolutegravir is low to moderate. In Phase I studies in healthy subjects, between-subject CVb% for AUC and \nCmax ranged from ~20 to 40% and C\u03c4 from 30 to 65% across studies. The between-subject PK variability of \ndolutegravir was higher in HIV-infected subjects than healthy subjects. Within-subject variability (CVw%) is \nlower than between-subject variability. \n \nDispersible tablets and film-coated tablets do not have the same bioavailability. The relative bioavailability \nof dispersible tablets is approximately 1.6-fold higher as compared to film-coated tablets. Thus, a 30 mg \ndolutegravir dose administered as six 5 mg dispersible tablets will have similar exposure to a 50 mg \ndolutegravir dose administered as film-coated tablet(s). Similarly, a 25 mg dolutegravir dose administered as \nfive 5 mg dispersible tablets, will provide comparable exposure to a 40 mg dolutegravir dose administered as \nfour 10 mg film-coated tablets. \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \nAbsorption \n  \nDolutegravir is rapidly absorbed following oral administration, with median Tmax at 2 to 3 hours post dose for \ntablet formulation.  \n \nFood increased the extent and slowed the rate of absorption of dolutegravir. Bioavailability of dolutegravir \ndepends on meal content: low, moderate, and high fat meals increased dolutegravir AUC(0-\u221e) by 33%, 41%, \nand 66%, increased Cmax by 46%, 52%, and 67%, prolonged Tmax to 3, 4, and 5 hours from 2 hours under \nfasted conditions, respectively for the film-coated tablet. These increases may be clinically relevant in the \npresence of certain integrase class resistance. Therefore, Tivicay is recommended to be taken with food by \npatients infected with HIV with integrase class resistance (see section 4.2). No formal food effect studies \nwere conducted for dispersible tablets. However, based on the available data, a higher food effect is not \nexpected for the dispersible tablet compared to the film-coated tablet. \n \nThe absolute bioavailability of dolutegravir has not been established.   \n \nDistribution \n  \nDolutegravir is highly bound (>99%) to human plasma proteins based on in vitro data. The apparent volume \nof distribution is 17 L to 20 L in HIV-infected patients, based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis.  \nBinding of dolutegravir to plasma proteins is independent of dolutegravir concentration.  Total blood and \nplasma drug-related radioactivity concentration ratios averaged between 0.441 to 0.535, indicating minimal \nassociation of radioactivity with blood cellular components. The unbound fraction of dolutegravir in plasma \nis increased at low levels of serum albumin (<35 g/L) as seen in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment.  \n \nDolutegravir is present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In 13 treatment-na\u00efve subjects on a stable dolutegravir \nplus abacavir/lamivudine regimen, dolutegravir concentration in CSF averaged 18 ng/mL (comparable to \nunbound plasma concentration, and above the IC50).   \n \nDolutegravir is present in the female and male genital tract. AUC in cervicovaginal fluid, cervical tissue and \nvaginal tissue were 6-10% of those in corresponding plasma at steady state. AUC in semen was 7% and 17% \nin rectal tissue of those in corresponding plasma at steady state. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nDolutegravir is primarily metabolized through glucuronidation via UGT1A1 with a minor CYP3A \ncomponent. Dolutegravir is the predominant circulating compound in plasma; renal elimination of \nunchanged active substance is low (< 1% of the dose). Fifty-three percent of total oral dose is excreted \nunchanged in the faeces. It is unknown if all or part of this is due to unabsorbed active substance or biliary \nexcretion of the glucuronidate conjugate, which can be further degraded to form the parent compound in the \ngut lumen. Thirty-two percent of the total oral dose is excreted in the urine, represented by ether glucuronide \nof dolutegravir (18.9% of total dose), N-dealkylation metabolite (3.6% of total dose), and a metabolite \nformed by oxidation at the benzylic carbon (3.0% of total dose). \n \nDrug interactions \n \nIn vitro, dolutegravir demonstrated no direct, or weak inhibition (IC50>50 \u03bcM) of the enzymes cytochrome \nP450 (CYP)1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 CYP3A, uridine diphosphate \nglucuronosyl transferase (UGT)1A1 or UGT2B7, or the transporters Pgp, BCRP, BSEP, OATP1B1, \nOATP1B3, OCT1, MATE2-K, MRP2 or MRP4. In vitro, dolutegravir did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or \nCYP3A4. Based on this data, dolutegravir is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of medicinal \nproducts that are substrates of major enzymes or transporters (see section 4.5).  \n \nIn vitro, dolutegravir was not a substrate of human OATP 1B1, OATP 1B3 or OCT 1. \n \n\n\n\n53 \n\nElimination \n  \nDolutegravir has a terminal half-life of ~14 hours.  The apparent oral clearance (CL/F) is approximately \n1L/hr in HIV-infected patients based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n  \nThe linearity of dolutegravir pharmacokinetics is dependent on dose and formulation. Following oral \nadministration of film-coated tablet formulations, in general, dolutegravir exhibited nonlinear \npharmacokinetics with less than dose-proportional increases in plasma exposure from 2 to 100 mg; however \nincrease in dolutegravir exposure appears dose proportional from 25 mg to 50 mg for the film-coated tablet \nformulation. With 50 mg film-coated tablet twice daily, the exposure over 24 hours was approximately \ndoubled compared to 50 mg film-coated tablet once daily. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) \n \nIn a randomized, dose-ranging trial, HIV-1\u2013infected subjects treated with dolutegravir monotherapy \n(ING111521) demonstrated rapid and dose-dependent antiviral activity, with mean decline in HIV-1 RNA of \n2.5 log10 at day 11 for 50 mg film-coated tablet dose. This antiviral response was maintained for 3 to 4 days \nafter the last dose in the 50 mg film-coated tablet group.   \n \nPK/PD modelling using pooled data from clinical studies in integrase resistant patients suggest that \nincreasing the dose from 50 mg film-coated tablet twice daily to 100 mg film-coated tablet twice daily may \nincrease the effectiveness of dolutegravir in patients with integrase resistance and limited treatment options \ndue to advanced multi class resistance. The proportion of responders (HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL) at week 24 \nwas predicted to increase around 4-18% in the subjects with Q148 + \u22652 secondary mutations from \nG140A/C/S, E138A/K/T, L74I. Although these simulated results have not been confirmed in clinical trials, \nthis high dose may be considered in the presence of the Q148 + \u22652 secondary mutations from G140A/C/S, \nE138A/K/T, L74I in patients with overall limited treatment options due to advanced multi class resistance. \nThere is no clinical data on the safety or efficacy of the 100 mg film-coated tablet twice daily dose. Co-\ntreatment with atazanavir increases the exposure of dolutegravir markedly, and should not be used in \ncombination with this high dose, since safety with the resulting dolutegravir exposure has not been \nestablished. \n \nSpecial patient populations \n \nChildren \nThe pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir given once daily as dispersible and film-coated tablets in HIV-1 \ninfected infants, children and adolescents aged \u2265 4 weeks to < 18 years were evaluated in two on-going \nstudies (P1093/ING112578 and ODYSSEY/201296).

A study \nof the pharmacokinetics of a single 50 mg dose of dolutegravir film-coated tablets was performed in subjects \nwith severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) and matched healthy controls. The exposure to \ndolutegravir was decreased by approximately 40% in subjects with severe renal impairment. The mechanism \nfor the decrease is unknown. No dosage adjustment is considered necessary for patients with renal \nimpairment. Tivicay has not been studied in patients on dialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment \nDolutegravir is primarily metabolized and eliminated by the liver. A single 50 mg dose of dolutegravir film-\ncoated tablets was administered to 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) and to \n8 matched healthy adult controls. While the total dolutegravir concentration in plasma was similar, a 1.5- to \n2-fold increase in unbound exposure to dolutegravir was observed in subjects with moderate hepatic \nimpairment compared to healthy controls. No dosage adjustment is considered necessary for patients with \nmild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \nTivicay has not been studied. \n \nPolymorphisms in drug metabolising enzymes \nThere is no evidence that common polymorphisms in drug metabolising enzymes alter dolutegravir \npharmacokinetics to a clinically meaningful extent. In a meta-analysis using pharmacogenomics samples \ncollected in clinical studies in healthy subjects, subjects with UGT1A1 (n=7) genotypes conferring poor \ndolutegravir metabolism had a 32% lower clearance of dolutegravir and 46% higher AUC compared with \nsubjects with genotypes associated with normal metabolism via UGT1A1 (n=41).  \n \nGender \nPopulation PK analyses using pooled pharmacokinetic data from Phase IIb and Phase III adult trials revealed \nno clinically relevant effect of gender on the exposure of dolutegravir.  \n \nRace  \nPopulation PK analyses using pooled pharmacokinetic data from Phase IIb and Phase III adult trials revealed \nno clinically relevant effect of race on the exposure of dolutegravir. The pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir \nfollowing single dose oral administration to Japanese subjects appear similar to observed parameters in \nWestern (US) subjects.  \n \nCo-infection with Hepatitis B or C  \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that hepatitis C virus co-infection had no clinically relevant \neffect on the exposure to dolutegravir. There are limited data on subjects with hepatitis B co-infection. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nDolutegravir was not mutagenic or clastogenic using in vitro tests in bacteria and cultured mammalian cells, \nand an in vivo rodent micronucleus assay.  Dolutegravir was not carcinogenic in long term studies in the \nmouse and rat. \n \nDolutegravir did not affect male or female fertility in rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day, the highest dose \ntested (24 times the twice daily human clinical exposure based on AUC).   \n \nOral administration of dolutegravir to pregnant rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg daily from days 6 to 17 of \ngestation did not elicit maternal toxicity, developmental toxicity or teratogenicity (27 times the twice daily \n\n\n\n57 \n\nhuman clinical exposure based on AUC). In the rat pre/post-natal development study, decreased body weight \nof the developing offspring was observed during lactation at a maternally toxic dose (approximately 27 times \nhuman exposure at the maximum recommended human dose). \n \nOral administration of dolutegravir to pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1000 mg/kg daily from days 6 to 18 of \ngestation did not elicit developmental toxicity or teratogenicity (0.40 times the twice daily human clinical \nexposure based on AUC).  In rabbits, maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption, scant/no faeces/urine, \nsuppressed body weight gain) was observed at 1000 mg/kg (0.40 times the twice daily human clinical \nexposure based on AUC).   \n \nIn a juvenile toxicity study in rats, dolutegravir administration resulted in two preweanling deaths at \n75 mg/kg/day.  Over the preweaning treatment period, mean body weight gain was decreased in this group \nand the decrease persisted throughout the entire study for females during the postweaning period.  The \nsystemic exposure at this dose (based on AUC) to dolutegravir was ~17 to 20-fold higher than humans at the \nrecommended pediatric exposure. There were no new target organs identified in juveniles compared to \nadults. At the NOAEL dose of 2 mg/kg/day, the AUC values in juvenile rats on Day 13 post-partum was \u223c3 \nto 6-fold higher than paediatric patients weighing 3 to <10 kg (ages 4 weeks to >6 months). \n \nThe effect of prolonged daily treatment with high doses of dolutegravir has been evaluated in repeat oral \ndose toxicity studies in rats (up to 26 weeks) and in monkeys (up to 38 weeks).  The primary effect of \ndolutegravir was gastrointestinal intolerance or irritation in rats and monkeys at doses that produce systemic \nexposures approximately 21 and 0.82 times the twice daily human clinical exposure based on AUC, \nrespectively. Because gastrointestinal (GI) intolerance is considered to be due to local active substance \nadministration, mg/kg or mg/m2 metrics are appropriate determinates of safety cover for this toxicity.  GI \nintolerance in monkeys occurred at 15 times the human mg/kg equivalent dose (based on a 50 kg human), \nand 5 times the human mg/m2 equivalent twice daily dose.   \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you (or your child, if they are the patient) only. Do not pass it \n\non to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Tivicay is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you take Tivicay  \n3. How to take Tivicay \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Tivicay \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Tivicay is and what it is used for \n \nTivicay contains the active ingredient dolutegravir. Dolutegravir belongs to a group of anti-retroviral \nmedicines called integrase inhibitors (INIs). \n \nTivicay is used to treat HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection in adults, adolescents and children \nof at least 6 years of age or older, and who weigh at least 14 kg. \n \nTivicay does not cure HIV infection; it reduces the amount of virus in your body, and keeps it at a low level. \nAs a result of that, it also increases the CD4 cell count in your blood. CD4 cells are a type of white blood \ncells that are important in helping your body to fight infection. \n \nNot everyone responds to treatment with Tivicay in the same way. Your doctor will monitor the effectiveness \nof your treatment. \n \nTivicay is always used in combination with other anti-retroviral medicines (combination therapy).  \nTo control your HIV infection, and to stop your illness from getting worse, you must keep taking all your \nmedicines, unless your doctor tells you to stop taking any. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Tivicay  \n \nDon\u2019t take Tivicay: \n\n\u2022 if you (or your child, if they are the patient) are allergic to dolutegravir or any of the other \ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n\u2022 if you (or your child) are taking another medicine called fampridine (also known as dalfampridine; \nused in multiple sclerosis). \n\n\u2192 If you think any of these apply to you (or your child), tell your doctor. \n \n\n\n\n81 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nLook out for important symptoms \nSome people taking medicines for HIV infection develop other conditions, which can be serious. These \ninclude: \n\n\u2022 symptoms of infections and inflammation \n\u2022 joint pain, stiffness and bone problems \n\nYou need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you (or your child, if they are \nthe patient) are taking Tivicay. \n\n\u2192 Read the information in Section 4 of this leaflet. \n \nProtect other people \nHIV infection is spread by sexual contact with someone who has the infection, or by transfer of infected \nblood (for example, by sharing injection needles). You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, \nalthough the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your doctor the precautions \nneeded to avoid infecting other people. \n \nChildren \nDo not give this medicine to children under 6 years of age, weighing less than 14 kg or with HIV infection \nthat is resistant to other medicines similar to Tivicay. The use of Tivicay film-coated tablets in children under \n6 or weighing less than 14 kg has not yet been studied. \n \nChildren must keep planned doctor\u2019s appointments (see \u2018Use in children and adolescents\u2019 in Section 3 for \nmore information). \n \nOther medicines and Tivicay \nTell your doctor if you (or your child) are taking, have recently taken or are planning to take any other \nmedicines. \n \nDon't take Tivicay with the following medicine: \n\n\u2022 fampridine (also known as dalfampridine), used in multiple sclerosis. \n \nSome medicines can affect how Tivicay works, or make it more likely that you will have side effects. \nTivicay can also affect how some other medicines work.  \nTell your doctor if you (or your child) are taking any of the medicines in the following list: \n\n\u2022 metformin, to treat diabetes \n\u2022 medicines called antacids, to treat indigestion and heartburn. Do not take an antacid during the 6 \n\nhours before you take Tivicay, or for at least 2 hours after you take it. (See also Section 3). \n\u2022 calcium supplements, iron supplements and multivitamins.  Do not take a calcium supplement, \n\niron supplement or multivitamin during the 6 hours before you take Tivicay, or for at least 2 hours \nafter you take it (see also Section 3). \n\n\u2022 etravirine, efavirenz, fosamprenavir/ritonavir, nevirapine or tipranavir/ritonavir, to treat HIV \ninfection \n\n\u2022 rifampicin, to treat tuberculosis (TB) and other bacterial infections \n\u2022 phenytoin and phenobarbital, to treat epilepsy \n\u2022 oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine, to treat epilepsy or bipolar disorder \n\u2022 St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal remedy to treat depression \n\n \u2192 Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you (or your child) are taking any of these. Your doctor may \ndecide to adjust your dose or that you need extra check ups. \n\n \nPregnancy \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or if you are planning to have a baby: \n \u2192 Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking Tivicay. \n \nTaking Tivicay at the time of becoming pregnant or during the first six weeks of pregnancy, may increase the \nrisk of a type of birth defect, called neural tube defect, such as spina bifida (malformed spinal cord). \n\n\n\n82 \n\nIf you could get pregnant while receiving Tivicay: \n \u2192 Talk to your doctor and discuss whether there is a need for contraception, such as condom or pills. \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. Your doctor will \nreview your treatment. Do not stop taking Tivicay without consulting your doctor, as this may harm you and \nyour unborn child. \n \nBreast-feeding  \nWomen who are HIV-positive must not breast feed because HIV infection can be passed on to the baby in \nbreast milk.  \n \nA small amount of the ingredient in Tivicay can pass into your breast milk. \n \nIf you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding: \n \u2192 Talk to your doctor immediately.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nTivicay can make you dizzy and have other side effects that make you less alert. \n \u2192 Don\u2019t drive or operate machinery unless you are sure you\u2019re not affected.  \n \nTivicay contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say is essentially \u2018sodium-free.\u2019 \n \n3. How to take Tivicay \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you \nare not sure. \n \n\n\u2022 The usual dose is 50 mg once a day.  \n\u2022 If you are taking certain other medicines, the dose is 50 mg twice a day. \n\u2022 For HIV that is resistant to other medicines similar to Tivicay, the usual dose is 50 mg, twice a \n\nday. \n \nYour doctor will decide on the correct dose of Tivicay for you. \n \nSwallow the tablet(s) with some liquid.  \n \nTivicay can be taken with or without food. When Tivicay is taken twice a day, your doctor may advise you \nto take with food.  \n \nTivicay is also available as dispersible tablets. Film-coated tablets and dispersible tablets are not the same, \ntherefore do not switch between film-coated tablets and dispersible tablets without first talking to your \ndoctor.  \n \nUse in children and adolescents \n\n\u2022 Children\u2019s dose of Tivicay needs to be adjusted as they get older or gain weight. \n  \u2192 It is important therefore that children keep planned doctor\u2019s appointments. \n\n\u2022 Children and adolescents weighing at least 20 kg can take the adult dose of 50 mg, once a day or 25 \nmg twice daily. Your doctor will decide how Tivicay should be given. \n\n\u2022 For children aged between 6 and 12 years your doctor will decide on the correct dose of Tivicay, \ndepending on the weight of your child.  \n\n\u2022 To reduce the risk of choking, children must not swallow more than one tablet at a time. \n\u2022 Tivicay should not be used in children and adolescents with HIV infection that is resistant to other \n\nmedicines similar to Tivicay. \n \nAntacid medicines \n\n\n\n83 \n\nAntacids, to treat indigestion and heartburn, can stop Tivicay being absorbed into your body and make it \nless effective. \nDo not take an antacid during the 6 hours before you take Tivicay, or for at least 2 hours after you take it.  \nOther acid-lowering medicines like ranitidine and omeprazole can be taken at the same time as Tivicay.   \n \u2192 Talk to your doctor for further advice on taking acid-lowering medicines with Tivicay. \n \nCalcium supplements, iron supplements or multivitamins \nCalcium supplements, iron supplements or multivitamins can stop Tivicay being absorbed into your body \nand make it less effective. \nDo not take a calcium supplement, iron supplement or multivitamin during the 6 hours before you take \nTivicay, or for at least 2 hours after you take it.   \n \u2192 Talk to your doctor for further advice on taking calcium supplements, iron supplements or \nmultivitamins with Tivicay. \n \nIf you take more Tivicay than you should \nIf you (or your child) take too many tablets of Tivicay, contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice. If \npossible, show them the Tivicay pack. \n \nIf you forget to take Tivicay \nIf you (or your child) miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember.  But if your next dose is due within 4 \nhours, skip the dose you missed and take the next one at the usual time. Then continue your treatment as \nbefore.  \n Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. \n \nDon\u2019t stop taking Tivicay without advice from your doctor \nTake Tivicay for as long as your doctor recommends.  Don\u2019t stop unless your doctor advises you to.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, but not everybody gets them.  \n \nAllergic reactions \nThese are uncommon in people taking Tivicay. Signs include: \n\n\u2022 skin rash \n\u2022 a high temperature (fever) \n\u2022 lack of energy (fatigue) \n\u2022 swelling, sometimes of the face or mouth (angioedema), causing difficulty in breathing \n\u2022 muscle or joint aches. \n\u2192 See a doctor straight away. Your doctor may decide to carry out tests on your liver, kidneys or \nblood, and may tell you to stop taking Tivicay. \n\n \nVery common side effects  \nThese may affect more than 1 in 10 people: \n\n\u2022 headache \n\u2022 diarrhoea \n\u2022 feeling sick (nausea). \n\n \nCommon side effects  \nThese may affect up to 1 in 10 people: \n\n\u2022 rash \n\u2022 itching (pruritus) \n\u2022 being sick (vomiting) \n\u2022 stomach pain (abdominal pain) \n\n\n\n84 \n\n\u2022 stomach (abdominal) discomfort \n\u2022 insomnia \n\u2022 dizziness \n\u2022 abnormal dreams \n\u2022 depression (feelings of deep sadness and unworthiness) \n\u2022 anxiety \n\u2022 lack of energy (fatigue) \n\u2022 wind (flatulence) \n\u2022 increase in the level of liver enzymes \n\u2022 increase in the level of enzymes produced in the muscles (creatine phosphokinase). \n \n\nUncommon side effects  \nThese may affect up to 1 in 100 people: \n\n\u2022 inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) \n\u2022 suicide attempt* \n\u2022 suicidal thoughts*  \n\u2022 joint pain \n\u2022 muscle pain \n\n \n* particularly in patients who have had depression or mental health problems before. \n \nRare side effects  \nThese may affect up to 1 in 1000 people: \n\n\u2022 liver failure (signs may include yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes or unusually dark \nurine). \n\n \nSymptoms of infection and inflammation  \n\nPeople with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) have weak immune systems, and are more likely to develop \nserious infections (opportunistic infections). Such infections may have been \u201csilent\u201d and not detected by the \nweak immune system before treatment was started. After starting treatment, the immune system becomes \nstronger, and may attack the infections, which can cause symptoms of infection or inflammation. Symptoms \nusually include fever, plus some of the following: \n\n\u2022 headache \n\u2022 stomach ache \n\u2022 difficulty breathing \n\nIn rare cases, as the immune system becomes stronger, it can also attack healthy body tissue (autoimmune \ndisorders).  The symptoms of autoimmune disorders may develop many months after you start taking \nmedicine to treat your HIV infection. Symptoms may include: \n\n\u2022 palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat) or tremor \n\u2022 hyperactivity (excessive restlessness and movement)  \n\u2022 weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body. \n\n \nIf you (or your child) get any symptoms of infection and inflammation or if you notice any of the \nsymptoms above: \n \u2192 Tell your doctor immediately. Don\u2019t take other medicines for the infection without your doctor\u2019s \nadvice. \n \nJoint pain, stiffness and bone problems \n\nSome people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With this \ncondition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. People may be more \nlikely to get this condition: \n\n\u2022 if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time \n\u2022 if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids \n\u2022 if they drink alcohol \n\n\n\n85 \n\n\u2022 if their immune systems are very weak \n\u2022 if they are overweight. \n\nSigns of osteonecrosis include: \n\u2022 stiffness in the joints \n\u2022 aches and pains in the joints (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) \n\u2022 difficulty moving. \n\nIf you notice any of these symptoms: \n \u2192 Tell your doctor. \n \nWeight, blood lipid and blood glucose effects \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This is \npartly linked to restored health and lifestyle, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV medicines \nthemselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.  \n\n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed \nin this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix \nV. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n5.

Contents of the pack and other information \nStep-by-step instructions for use are also provided \n \n \n1. What Tivicay is and what it is used for \n \nTivicay contains the active ingredient dolutegravir. Dolutegravir belongs to a group of anti-retroviral \nmedicines called integrase inhibitors (INIs). \n \nTivicay is used to treat HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection in adults, adolescents and children \nof at least 4 weeks of age or older, and who weigh at least 3 kg. \n \nTivicay does not cure HIV infection; it reduces the amount of virus in your body, and keeps it at a low level. \nAs a result of that, it also increases the CD4 cell count in your blood. CD4 cells are a type of white blood \ncells that are important in helping your body to fight infection. \n \nNot everyone responds to treatment with Tivicay in the same way. Your doctor will monitor the effectiveness \nof your treatment. \n \nTivicay is always used in combination with other anti-retroviral medicines (combination therapy). To control \nyour HIV infection, and to stop your illness from getting worse, you must keep taking all your medicines, \nunless your doctor tells you to stop taking any. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Tivicay  \n \nDon\u2019t take Tivicay: \n\n\u2022 if you (or your child, if they are the patient) are allergic to dolutegravir or any of the other \ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n\u2022 if you (or your child) are taking another medicine called fampridine (also known as dalfampridine; \nused in multiple sclerosis). \n\n\u2192 If you think any of these apply to you (or your child), tell your doctor. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n\n\n\n89 \n\nLook out for important symptoms \nSome people taking medicines for HIV infection develop other conditions, which can be serious. These \ninclude: \n\n\u2022 symptoms of infections and inflammation \n\u2022 joint pain, stiffness and bone problems \n\nYou need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you (or your child, if they are \nthe patient) are taking Tivicay. \n\n\u2192 Read the information in Section 4 of this leaflet. \n \nProtect other people \nHIV infection is spread by sexual contact with someone who has the infection, or by transfer of infected \nblood (for example, by sharing injection needles). You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, \nalthough the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your doctor the precautions \nneeded to avoid infecting other people. \n \nChildren \nDo not give this medicine to children under 4 weeks of age, weighing less than 3 kg or with HIV infection \nthat is resistant to other medicines similar to Tivicay. The use of Tivicay dispersible tablets in children under \n4 weeks or weighing less than 3 kg has not yet been studied. \n \nChildren must keep planned doctor\u2019s appointments (see \u2018Children and adolescents\u2019 in Section 3 for more \ninformation). \n \nOther medicines and Tivicay \nTell your doctor if you (or your child) are taking, have recently taken or are planning to take any other \nmedicines. \n \nDon't take Tivicay with the following medicine: \n\n\u2022 fampridine (also known as dalfampridine), used in multiple sclerosis. \n \nSome medicines can affect how Tivicay works, or make it more likely that you will have side effects. \nTivicay can also affect how some other medicines work.  \nTell your doctor if you (or your child) are taking any of the medicines in the following list: \n\n\u2022 metformin, to treat diabetes \n\u2022 medicines called antacids, to treat indigestion and heartburn. Do not take an antacid during the 6 \n\nhours before you take Tivicay, or for at least 2 hours after you take it. (See also Section 3). \n\u2022 calcium supplements, iron supplements and multivitamins.  Do not take a calcium supplement, \n\niron supplement or multivitamin during the 6 hours before you take Tivicay, or for at least 2 hours \nafter you take it (see also Section 3). \n\n\u2022 etravirine, efavirenz, fosamprenavir/ritonavir, nevirapine or tipranavir/ritonavir, to treat HIV \ninfection \n\n\u2022 rifampicin, to treat tuberculosis (TB) and other bacterial infections \n\u2022 phenytoin and phenobarbital, to treat epilepsy \n\u2022 oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine, to treat epilepsy or bipolar disorder \n\u2022 St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal remedy to treat depression \n\n \u2192 Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you (or your child) are taking any of these. Your doctor may \ndecide to adjust your dose or that you need extra check ups. \n\n \nPregnancy \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or if you are planning to have a baby: \n \u2192 Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking Tivicay. \n \nTaking Tivicay at the time of becoming pregnant or during the first six weeks of pregnancy, may increase the \nrisk of a type of birth defect, called neural tube defect, such as spina bifida (malformed spinal cord). \n \n\n\n\n90 \n\nIf you could get pregnant while receiving Tivicay: \n \u2192 Talk to your doctor and discuss whether there is a need for contraception, such as condom or pills. \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. Your doctor will \nreview your treatment. Do not stop taking Tivicay without consulting your doctor, as this may harm you and \nyour unborn child. \n \nBreast-feeding  \nWomen who are HIV-positive must not breast feed because HIV infection can be passed on to the baby in \nbreast milk.  \n \nA small amount of the ingredient in Tivicay can pass into your breast milk. \n \nIf you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding: \n \u2192 Talk to your doctor immediately.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nTivicay can make you dizzy and have other side effects that make you less alert. \n \u2192 Don\u2019t drive or operate machinery unless you are sure you\u2019re not affected.  \n \nTivicay contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say is essentially \u2018sodium-free.\u2019 \n \n \n3. How to take Tivicay \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you \nare not sure. \n \nAdults \n\n\u2022 The usual adult dose is 30 mg (taken as six 5 mg dispersible tablets) once a day.  \n\u2022 If you are taking certain other medicines, the dose is 30 mg (taken as six 5 mg dispersible tablets) \n\ntwice a day. \n\u2022 For HIV that is resistant to other medicines similar to Tivicay, the usual dose is 30 mg (taken as \n\nsix 5 mg dispersible tablets), twice a day. \n \nYour doctor will decide on the correct dose of Tivicay for you. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n\n\u2022 Children\u2019s dose of Tivicay needs to be adjusted as they get older or gain weight. \n\u2192 It is important therefore that children keep planned doctor\u2019s appointments. \n\n\u2022 Children and adolescents weighing at least 20 kg can take the adult dose of 30 mg, once a day or 15 \nmg twice a day. Your doctor will decide how Tivicay should be given. \n\n\u2022 For children aged at least 4 weeks and weighing between 3 and 20 kg, your doctor will decide on the \ncorrect dose of Tivicay, depending on the weight and age of your child. \n\n\u2022 If swallowing tablets whole with water, children must not swallow more than one tablet at a time \nto reduce the risk of choking. \n\n\u2022 Tivicay should not be used in children and adolescents with HIV infection that is resistant to other \nmedicines similar to Tivicay. \n\n \nHow to take the dispersible tablets \n\n\u2022 The dispersible tablets may be dispersed in drinking water or swallowed whole with drinking water. \nWhen dispersed, the amount of water will depend on the number of tablets prescribed. The tablet(s) \nshould be fully dispersed before swallowing.  \nSee the separate instructions for use regarding how to disperse and administer the tablets using the \ndosing cup and oral syringe provided in this pack. \n\n\u2022 Do not chew, cut or crush the tablets.  \n\n\n\n91 \n\n\u2022 Tivicay can be taken with or without food. When Tivicay is taken twice a day, your doctor may \nadvise you to take with food. \n\n \nTivicay is also available as film-coated tablets. Film-coated tablets and dispersible tablets are not the same, \ntherefore do not switch between film-coated tablets and dispersible tablets without first talking to your \ndoctor. \n \nAntacid medicines \nAntacids, to treat indigestion and heartburn, can stop Tivicay being absorbed into your body and make it \nless effective. \nDo not take an antacid during the 6 hours before you take Tivicay, or for at least 2 hours after you take it.  \nOther acid-lowering medicines like ranitidine and omeprazole can be taken at the same time as Tivicay.   \n \u2192 Talk to your doctor for further advice on taking acid-lowering medicines with Tivicay. \n \nCalcium supplements, iron supplements or multivitamins \nCalcium supplements, iron supplements or multivitamins can stop Tivicay being absorbed into your body \nand make it less effective. \nDo not take a calcium supplement, iron supplement or multivitamin during the 6 hours before you take \nTivicay, or for at least 2 hours after you take it.   \n \u2192 Talk to your doctor for further advice on taking calcium supplements, iron supplements or \nmultivitamins with Tivicay. \n \nIf you take more Tivicay than you should \nIf you (or your child) take too many tablets of Tivicay, contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice. If \npossible, show them the Tivicay pack. \n \nIf you forget to take Tivicay \nIf you (or your child) miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember.  But if your next dose is due within 4 \nhours, skip the dose you missed and take the next one at the usual time. Then continue your treatment as \nbefore.  \n Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. \n \nDon\u2019t stop taking Tivicay without advice from your doctor \nTake Tivicay for as long as your doctor recommends.  Don\u2019t stop unless your doctor advises you to.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, but not everybody gets them.  \n \nAllergic reactions \nThese are uncommon in people taking Tivicay. Signs include: \n\n\u2022 skin rash \n\u2022 a high temperature (fever) \n\u2022 lack of energy (fatigue) \n\u2022 swelling, sometimes of the face or mouth (angioedema), causing difficulty in breathing \n\u2022 muscle or joint aches. \n\u2192 See a doctor straight away. Your doctor may decide to carry out tests on your liver, kidneys or \nblood, and may tell you to stop taking Tivicay. \n\n \n \nVery common side effects  \nThese may affect more than 1 in 10 people: \n\n\u2022 headache \n\n\n\n92 \n\n\u2022 diarrhoea \n\u2022 feeling sick (nausea). \n\n \nCommon side effects  \nThese may affect up to 1 in 10 people: \n\n\u2022 rash \n\u2022 itching (pruritus) \n\u2022 being sick (vomiting) \n\u2022 stomach pain (abdominal pain) \n\u2022 stomach (abdominal) discomfort \n\u2022 insomnia \n\u2022 dizziness \n\u2022 abnormal dreams \n\u2022 depression (feelings of deep sadness and unworthiness) \n\u2022 anxiety \n\u2022 lack of energy (fatigue) \n\u2022 wind (flatulence) \n\u2022 increase in the level of liver enzymes \n\u2022 increase in the level of enzymes produced in the muscles (creatine phosphokinase). \n \n\nUncommon side effects  \nThese may affect up to 1 in 100 people: \n\n\u2022 inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) \n\u2022 suicide attempt* \n\u2022 suicidal thoughts*  \n\u2022 joint pain \n\u2022 muscle pain \n\n \n* particularly in patients who have had depression or mental health problems before \n \nRare side effects  \nThese may affect up to 1 in 1000 people: \n\n\u2022 liver failure (signs may include yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes or unusually dark \nurine). \n\n \nSymptoms of infection and inflammation  \n\nPeople with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) have weak immune systems, and are more likely to develop \nserious infections (opportunistic infections). Such infections may have been \u201csilent\u201d and not detected by the \nweak immune system before treatment was started. After starting treatment, the immune system becomes \nstronger, and may attack the infections, which can cause symptoms of infection or inflammation. Symptoms \nusually include fever, plus some of the following: \n\n\u2022 headache \n\u2022 stomach ache \n\u2022 difficulty breathing \n\nIn rare cases, as the immune system becomes stronger, it can also attack healthy body tissue (autoimmune \ndisorders).  The symptoms of autoimmune disorders may develop many months after you start taking \nmedicine to treat your HIV infection. Symptoms may include: \n\n\u2022 palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat) or tremor \n\u2022 hyperactivity (excessive restlessness and movement)  \n\u2022 weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body. \n\n \nIf you (or your child) get any symptoms of infection and inflammation or if you notice any of the \nsymptoms above: \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \u2192 Tell your doctor immediately. Don\u2019t take other medicines for the infection without your doctor\u2019s \nadvice. \n \nJoint pain, stiffness and bone problems \n\nSome people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With this \ncondition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. People may be more \nlikely to get this condition: \n\n\u2022 if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time \n\u2022 if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids \n\u2022 if they drink alcohol \n\u2022 if their immune systems are very weak \n\u2022 if they are overweight. \n\nSigns of osteonecrosis include: \n\u2022 stiffness in the joints \n\u2022 aches and pains in the joints (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) \n\u2022 difficulty moving. \n\nIf you notice any of these symptoms: \n \u2192 Tell your doctor. \n \nWeight, blood lipid and blood glucose effects \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This is \npartly linked to restored health and lifestyle, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV medicines \nthemselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.  \n\n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed \nin this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix \nV. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n5.

cause side effects, but not everybody gets them. allergic reactions these are uncommon in people taking tivicay. signs include: skin rash a high temperature (fever) lack of energy (fatigue) swelling, sometimes of the face or mouth (angioedema), causing difficulty in breathing muscle or joint aches. \u2192 see a doctor straight away. your doctor may decide to carry out tests on your liver, kidneys or blood, and may tell you to stop taking tivicay. very common side effects these may affect more than 1 in 10 people: headache diarrhoea feeling sick (nausea). common side effects these may affect up to 1 in 10 people: rash itching (pruritus) being sick (vomiting) stomach pain (abdominal pain) 84 stomach (abdominal) discomfort insomnia dizziness abnormal dreams depression (feelings of deep sadness and unworthiness) anxiety lack of energy (fatigue) wind (flatulence) increase in the level of liver enzymes increase in the level of enzymes produced in the muscles (creatine phosphokinase). uncommon side effects these may affect up to 1 in 100 people: inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) suicide attempt* suicidal thoughts* joint pain muscle pain * particularly in patients who have had depression or mental health problems before. rare side effects these may affect up to 1 in 1000 people: liver failure (signs may include yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes or unusually dark urine). symptoms of infection and inflammation people with advanced hiv infection (aids) have weak immune systems, and are more likely to develop serious infections (opportunistic infections). such infections may have been \"silent\" and not detected by the weak immune system before treatment was started. after starting treatment, the immune system becomes stronger, and may attack the infections, which can cause symptoms of infection or inflammation. symptoms usually include fever, plus some of the following: headache stomach ache difficulty breathing in rare cases, as the immune system becomes stronger, it can also attack healthy body tissue (autoimmune disorders). the symptoms of autoimmune disorders may develop many months after you start taking medicine to treat your hiv infection. symptoms may include: palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat) or tremor hyperactivity (excessive restlessness and movement) weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body. if you (or your child) get any symptoms of infection and inflammation or if you notice any of the symptoms above: \u2192 tell your doctor immediately. don't take other medicines for the infection without your doctor's advice. joint pain, stiffness and bone problems some people taking combination therapy for hiv develop a condition called osteonecrosis. with this condition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. people may be more likely to get this condition: if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids if they drink alcohol 85 if their immune systems are very weak if they are overweight. signs of osteonecrosis include: stiffness in the joints aches and pains in the joints (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) difficulty moving. if you notice any of these symptoms: \u2192 tell your doctor. weight, blood lipid and blood glucose effects during hiv therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. this is partly linked to restored health and lifestyle, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the hiv medicines themselves. your doctor will test for these changes. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety
