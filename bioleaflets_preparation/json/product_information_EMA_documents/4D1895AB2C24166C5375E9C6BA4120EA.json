NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nQuintanrix powder and suspension for suspension for injection \nDiphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whole cell), hepatitis B (rDNA) and Haemophilus type b conjugate \nvaccine (adsorbed) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nAfter reconstitution, 1 dose (0.5 ml) contains: \n \nDiphtheria toxoid1   not less than 30 International Units \nTetanus toxoid1  not less than 60 International Units \nInactivated Bordetella pertussis 2  not less than 4 International Units \nHepatitis B surface antigen (rDNA) 2, 3 10 micrograms \nHaemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide \n(polyribosylribitol phosphate) 2 2.5 micrograms \nconjugated to tetanus toxoid as a carrier  5-10 micrograms \n \n1 adsorbed on aluminium hydroxide, hydrated Total: 0.26 milligrams Al3+ \n2adsorbed on aluminium phosphate Total: 0.40 milligrams Al3+ \n3 produced in Saccharomyces cerevisae cells by recombinant DNA technology \n \nFor excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and suspension for suspension for injection \nThe liquid diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whole cell), hepatitis B (DTPw-HBV) component is a turbid \nwhite suspension. \nThe lyophilised Haemophilus influenzae type b (HIB) component is a white powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nQuintanrix is indicated for primary immunisation of infants (during the first year of life) against \ndiphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae \ntype b and for booster immunisation of young children during the second year of life. \n \nThe use of Quintanrix should be determined on the basis of official recommendations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nPrimary vaccination:  \n \nThe primary vaccination schedule consists of three doses of 0.5 ml to be administered at intervals of \nat least 4 weeks within the first six months of life in accordance with local official recommendations. \nThe first dose can be administered at 6 weeks of age.  The following schedules have been studied in \nclinical trials:  2-4-6 months, 3-4-5 months and 6-10-14 weeks. The 3-5-12 month schedule was not \nevaluated. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n3 \n\nQuintanrix can be given to children who have received hepatitis B vaccine at birth. \n \nThe immunoprophylactic measures for hepatitis B should not be modified for children born to \nhepatitis B virus carrying mothers.  This may require separate administration of hepatitis B vaccine \nand should follow official recommendations. \n \nBooster vaccination:  \n \nAfter the completion of the primary series, a booster should be administered preferably before the \nend of the second year of life. Booster administration should be in accordance with official \nrecommendations. \n \nQuintanrix may be used to boost responses to DTP, HBV and HIB antigens if its composition is in \naccordance with official recommendations for boosting. The booster dose should preferably be given \nat least 6 months after the last primary dose. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nQuintanrix is for deep intramuscular injection, preferably in the anterolateral thigh. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients. \n \nQuintanrix is contra-indicated if the child has experienced an encephalopathy of unknown aetiology, \noccurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussis containing vaccine.  In these \ncircumstances the vaccination course should be continued with diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B and \nHIB vaccines. \n \nAs with other vaccines, the administration of Quintanrix should be postponed in subjects suffering \nfrom acute severe febrile illness. The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, is not a \ncontraindication for vaccination. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use \n \nVaccination should be preceded by a review of the medical history (especially with regard to \nprevious vaccination and possible occurrence of undesirable events). \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.  For \nthis reason, the vaccinee should remain under medical supervision for at least 30 minutes. \n \nIf any of the following events occur in temporal relation to receipt of Quintanrix, the decision to give \nsubsequent doses of a vaccine containing the pertussis component should be carefully considered: \n• Temperature of ≥ 40.0 °C within 48 hours, not due to another identifiable cause. \n• Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours. \n• Persistent crying lasting ≥ 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours. \n• Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days. \nThere may be circumstances, such as a high incidence of pertussis, when the potential benefits \noutweigh possible risks. \n \nQuintanrix should be administered with caution to subjects with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding \ndisorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects. A \nfine needle can be used for the vaccination and firm pressure applied to the site (without rubbing) for \nat least two minutes following administration. \n \nQuintanrix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n4 \n\n \nThe vaccine will not prevent infection caused by other pathogens known to infect the liver such as \nhepatitis A, hepatitis C and hepatitis E virus. \n \nThe HIB component of the vaccine does not protect against diseases due to capsular serotypes other \nthan type b of Haemophilus influenzae or against meningitis caused by other organisms. \n \nA history of febrile convulsions, a family history of convulsions or  Sudden Infant Death Syndrome \n(SIDS) do not constitute a contraindication for the use of Quintanrix. Vaccinees with a history of \nfebrile convulsions should be closely followed up as such adverse events may occur within 2 to 3 \ndays post vaccination. \n \nHIV infection is not considered as a contraindication. The expected immunological response may not \nbe obtained after vaccination of immunosuppressed patients. \n \nSince the capsular polysaccharide antigen is excreted in the urine a positive urine antigen test can be \nobserved within 1-2 weeks following vaccination. Other tests should be performed in order to confirm \nHIB infection during this period. \n \nAntipyretic treatment should be initiated according to local treatment guidelines. \n \nThe potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72h should be considered \nwhen administering immunisation series to very premature infants (born ≤ 28 weeks of gestation) and \nparticularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. \n \nAs the benefit of the vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or \ndelayed.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn paediatric vaccination it is often practice to co-administer different injectable vaccines at separate \ninjection sites, during the same session. \n \nLimited data show that there is no interference with the response to Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) \nand OPV antigens. Although no data are available on the immune response to the Bacille-Calmette-\nGuérin (BCG) antigen, no interference is expected. \n \nAs with other vaccines it may be expected that an adequate response may not be achieved in patients \nreceiving immunosuppressive therapy or patients with immunodeficiency. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nAs Quintanrix is not intended for use in adults, information on the safety of the vaccine when used \nduring pregnancy or lactation is not available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nQuintanrix was administered to approximately 1,340 healthy infants from 6 weeks of age as a primary \nvaccination course in several clinical trials. \n \nIn these trials, the most common reactions occurring after vaccine administration were pain at the \nsite of injection, fever (axillary ≥ 37.5°C; rectal ≥ 38°C) and irritability, which were associated with \nabout 50% of the doses administered. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n5 \n\n \nAdverse reactions are listed below. \n \nFrequencies are reported as: \nVery common:  (>1/10) \nCommon:  (>1/100, <1/10) \nUncommon:  (>1/1,000, <1/100) \nRare:   (>1/10,000, <1/1,000) \nVery rare:  (<1/10,000) including isolated reports \n \nPsychiatric disorders: \nvery common: irritability \n \nNervous system disorders: \nvery common: drowsiness  \nrare: collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsiveness episode), convulsions \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nrare: bronchitis, coughing \n \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nvery common: loss of appetite \nrare: vomiting \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nvery common: pain, redness and swelling, fever (axillary ≥ 37.5°C; rectal ≥ 38°C) \ncommon: induration, fever (axillary > 39°C; rectal > 39.5°C) \n \nQuintanrix was administered as a booster to 435 infants in the second year of life.  As shown with \nother vaccines, the booster dose is potentially associated with an increased incidence of minor adverse \nevents such as fever and local reactions. \n \nAdverse reactions reported after booster vaccination are listed below. \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nvery common: irritability \n \nNervous system disorders: \nvery common: drowsiness  \n \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nvery common: loss of appetite \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nvery common: pain, redness and swelling, fever (axillary ≥ 37.5°C; rectal ≥ 38°C) \ncommon: fever (axillary > 39°C; rectal > 39.5°C) \nuncommon: induration \n \nAllergic reactions, including anaphylactoid reactions and urticaria, have been reported very rarely \nfollowing vaccination with DTP, hepatitis B and HIB containing vaccines. \n \nDuring post marketing surveillance studies with other hepatitis B containing vaccines, serum sickness \nlike disease and thrombocytopenia have been reported very rarely. \n \nThis medicinal product contains thiomersal (an organomercuric compound) as a preservative and \ntherefore it is possible that sensitisation reactions may occur (see section 4.3). \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n6 \n\nApnoea in very premature infants (≤ 28 weeks of gestation) (see section 4.4) \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \nPharmaco-therapeutic group: Bacterial and viral vaccines combined, ATC code JO7CA10 \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nThe immune response after a three-dose primary vaccination course was evaluated in five trials: 297 \ninfants were evaluated after vaccination at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age, 685 after vaccination at 2, 4, \nand 6 months of age and 107 after vaccination at 3, 4 and 5 months of age. Results from different \nstudies show that, overall, 95.5% and 99.9% of subjects had anti-diphtheria and anti-tetanus titres ≥ \n0.1 IU/ml one month after completion of the primary vaccination course. At this time, the percentage \nof infants with anti-PRP titres ≥ 0.15 µg/ml was > 99% and the percentage with anti-HBs titres ≥ 10 \nmIU/ml was 97.3%. More than 99% of subjects were considered to have responded to the pertussis \ncomponent of the vaccine, which was defined as the appearance of antibodies in initially \nseronegative subjects (i.e. subjects with pre-vaccination titres < 15 ELU/ml) or a post-vaccination \ntitre at least equal to pre-vaccination levels in subjects initially seropositive due to maternally-\nderived antibodies. \n \nSeroprotection and vaccine response rates were similar for the three schedules used, with the \nexception of anti-HBs.  The seroprotection rates for anti-HBs (≥10 mlU/ml) observed with the 6, 10, \n14 week schedule was lower as shown in the table below, but is unlikely to be clinically relevant due \nto the small sample size: \n \n\n2, 4, 6 months schedule \nN = 672 \n\n3, 4, 5 months schedule \nN = 107 \n\n6, 10, 14 weeks schedule \nN = 97 \n\n \n98.9% \n\n \n95.3% \n\n \n92.8% \n\n \n \nLimited information exists on the persistence of the immune response after primary vaccination with \nQuintanrix as well as on the immunogenicity of booster doses. Results from one pilot study showed \nthat, for 63 infants primed according to a 6, 10, 14 week schedule, > 80% still had antibodies to \ndiphtheria, tetanus, HBs and PRP at levels considered to be protective. Forty-one percent had \nantibodies to pertussis.

See section 6.5 for the number of doses per vial. \n \nFor excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and suspension for suspension for injection \nThe liquid diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whole cell), hepatitis B (DTPw-HBV) component is a turbid \nwhite suspension. \nThe lyophilised Haemophilus influenzae type b (HIB) component is a white powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nQuintanrix is indicated for primary immunisation of infants (during the first year of life) against \ndiphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae \ntype b and for booster immunisation of young children during the second year of life. \n \nThe use of Quintanrix should be determined on the basis of official recommendations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nPrimary vaccination:  \n \nThe primary vaccination schedule consists of three doses of 0.5 ml to be administered at intervals of \nat least 4 weeks within the first six months of life in accordance with local official recommendations. \nThe first dose can be administered at 6 weeks of age. The following schedules have been studied in \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n10 \n\nclinical trials:  2-4-6 months, 3-4-5 months and 6-10-14 weeks. The 3-5-12 month schedule was not \nevaluated. \n \nQuintanrix can be given to children who have received hepatitis B vaccine at birth. \n \nThe immunoprophylactic measures for hepatitis B should not be modified for children born to \nhepatitis B virus carrying mothers.  This may require separate administration of hepatitis B vaccine \nand should follow official recommendations. \n \nBooster vaccination: \n \nAfter the completion of the primary series, a booster should be administered preferably before the \nend of the second year of life. Booster administration should be in accordance with official \nrecommendations. \n \nQuintanrix may be used to boost responses to DTP, HBV and HIB antigens if its composition is in \naccordance with official recommendations for boosting. The booster dose should preferably be given \nat least 6 months after the last primary dose. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nQuintanrix is for deep intramuscular injection, preferably in the anterolateral thigh. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients. \n \nQuintanrix is contra-indicated if the child has experienced an encephalopathy of unknown aetiology, \noccurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussis containing vaccine.  In these \ncircumstances the vaccination course should be continued with diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B and \nHIB vaccines. \n \nAs with other vaccines, the administration of Quintanrix should be postponed in subjects suffering \nfrom acute severe febrile illness. The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, is not a \ncontraindication for vaccination. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use \n \nVaccination should be preceded by a review of the medical history (especially with regard to \nprevious vaccination and possible occurrence of undesirable events). \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \nFor this reason, the vaccinee should remain under medical supervision for at least 30 minutes. \n \nIf any of the following events occur in temporal relation to receipt of Quintanrix, the decision to give \nsubsequent doses of a vaccine containing the pertussis component should be carefully considered: \n• Temperature of ≥ 40.0 °C within 48 hours, not due to another identifiable cause. \n• Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours. \n• Persistent crying lasting ≥ 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours. \n• Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days. \nThere may be circumstances, such as a high incidence of pertussis, when the potential benefits \noutweigh possible risks. \n \nQuintanrix should be administered with caution to subjects with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding \ndisorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects. A \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n11 \n\nfine needle can be used for the vaccination and firm pressure applied to the site (without rubbing) for \nat least two minutes following administration. \n \nQuintanrix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \n \nThe vaccine will not prevent infection caused by other pathogens known to infect the liver such as \nhepatitis A, hepatitis C and hepatitis E virus. \n \nThe HIB component of the vaccine does not protect against diseases due to capsular serotypes other \nthan type b of Haemophilus influenzae or against meningitis caused by other organisms. \n \nA history of febrile convulsions,a family history of convulsions or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome \n(SIDS) do not constitute a contraindication for the use of Quintanrix. Vaccinees with a history of \nfebrile convulsions should be closely followed up as such adverse events may occur within 2 to 3 \ndays post vaccination. \n \nHIV infection is not considered as a contraindication. The expected immunological response may not \nbe obtained after vaccination of immunosuppressed patients. \n \nSince the capsular polysaccharide antigen is excreted in the urine a positive urine antigen test can be \nobserved within 1-2 weeks following vaccination. Other tests should be performed in order to confirm \nHIB infection during this period. \n \nAntipyretic treatment should be initiated according to local treatment guidelines. \n \nThe potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72h should be considered \nwhen administering immunisation series to very premature infants (born ≤ 28 weeks of gestation) and \nparticularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. \n \nAs the benefit of the vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or \ndelayed.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn paediatric vaccination it is often practice to co-administer different injectable vaccines at separate \ninjection sites, during the same session. \n \nLimited data show that there is no interference with the response to Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) \nand OPV antigens. Although no data are available on the immune response to the Bacille-Calmette-\nGuérin (BCG) antigen, no interference is expected. \n \nAs with other vaccines it may be expected that an adequate response may not be achieved in patients \nreceiving immunosuppressive therapy or patients with immunodeficiency. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nAs Quintanrix is not intended for use in adults, information on the safety of the vaccine when used \nduring pregnancy or lactation is not available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nQuintanrix was administered to approximately 1,340 healthy infants from 6 weeks of age as a primary \nvaccination course in several clinical trials. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n12 \n\n \nIn these trials, the most common reactions occurring after vaccine administration were pain at the \nsite of injection, fever (axillary ≥ 37.5°C; rectal ≥ 38°C) and irritability, which were associated with \nabout 50% of the doses administered. \n \nAdverse reactions are listed below. \n \nFrequencies are reported as: \nVery common:  (>1/10) \nCommon:  (>1/100, <1/10) \nUncommon:  (>1/1,000, <1/100) \nRare:   (>1/10,000, <1/1,000) \nVery rare:  (<1/10,000) including isolated reports \n \nPsychiatric disorders: \nvery common: irritability \n \nNervous system disorders: \nvery common: drowsiness  \nrare: collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsiveness episode), convulsions \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nrare: bronchitis, coughing \n \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nvery common: loss of appetite \nrare: vomiting \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nvery common: pain, redness and swelling, fever (axillary ≥ 37.5°C; rectal ≥ 38°C) \ncommon: induration, fever (axillary > 39°C; rectal > 39.5°C) \n \nQuintanrix was administered as a booster to 435 infants in the second year of life.  As shown with \nother vaccines, the booster dose is potentially associated with an increased incidence of minor adverse \nevents such as fever and local reactions. \n \nAdverse reactions reported after booster vaccination are listed below. \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nvery common: irritability \n \nNervous system disorders: \nvery common: drowsiness  \n \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nvery common: loss of appetite \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nvery common: pain, redness and swelling, fever (axillary ≥ 37.5°C; rectal ≥ 38°C) \ncommon: fever (axillary > 39°C; rectal > 39.5°C) \nuncommon: induration \n \nAllergic reactions, including anaphylactoid reactions and urticaria, have been reported very rarely \nfollowing vaccination with DTP, hepatitis B and HIB containing vaccines. \n \nDuring post marketing surveillance studies with other hepatitis B containing vaccines, serum sickness \nlike disease and thrombocytopenia have been reported very rarely. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n13 \n\n \nThis medicinal product contains thiomersal (an organomercuric compound) as a preservative and \ntherefore it is possible that sensitisation reactions may occur (see section 4.3). \n \nApnoea in very premature infants (≤ 28 weeks of gestation) (see section 4.4) \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \nPharmaco-therapeutic group: Bacterial and viral vaccines combined, ATC code JO7CA10 \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nThe immune response after a three-dose primary vaccination course was evaluated in five trials: 297 \ninfants were evaluated after vaccination at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age, 685 after vaccination at 2, 4, \nand 6 months of age and 107 after vaccination at 3, 4 and 5 months of age. Results from different \nstudies show that, overall, 95.5% and 99.9% of subjects had anti-diphtheria and anti-tetanus titres ≥ \n0.1 IU/ml one month after completion of the primary vaccination course. At this time, the percentage \nof infants with anti-PRP titres ≥ 0.15 µg/ml was > 99% and the percentage with anti-HBs titres ≥ 10 \nmIU/ml was 97.3%. More than 99% of subjects were considered to have responded to the pertussis \ncomponent of the vaccine , which was defined as the appearance of antibodies in initially \nseronegative subjects (i.e. subjects with pre-vaccination titres < 15 ELU/ml) or a post-vaccination \ntitre at least equal to pre-vaccination levels in subjects initially seropositive due to maternally-\nderived antibodies. \n \nSeroprotection and vaccine response rates were similar for the three schedules used, with the \nexception of anti-HBs.  The seroprotection rates for anti-HBs (≥10 mlU/ml) observed with the 6, 10, \n14 week schedule was lower as shown in the table below, but is unlikely to be clinically relevant due \nto the small sample size: \n \n\n2, 4, 6 months schedule \nN = 672 \n\n3, 4, 5 months schedule \nN = 107 \n\n6, 10, 14 weeks schedule \nN = 97 \n\n \n98.9% \n\n \n95.3% \n\n \n92.8% \n\n \n \nLimited information exists on the persistence of the immune response after primary vaccination with \nQuintanrix as well as on the immunogenicity of booster doses. Results from one pilot study showed \nthat, for 63 infants primed according to a 6, 10, 14 week schedule, > 80% still had antibodies to \ndiphtheria, tetanus, HBs and PRP at levels considered to be protective. Forty-one percent had \nantibodies to pertussis. Data from clinical trials show that Quintanrix, when given as a booster dose \nin the second year of life,  induces a greater than 10-fold increase in mean antibody titre with respect \nto prebooster levels for all vaccine components. \n \nIt can be expected that hepatitis D will also be prevented by immunisation with Quintanrix as \nhepatitis D (caused by the delta agent) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n14 \n\nNo preclinical safety testing with the vaccine has been conducted. \n \n \n6.

WHAT QUINTANRIX IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nQuintanrix is a white slightly milky liquid obtained by mixing the vial containing the diphtheria (D), \ntetanus (T), whole cell pertussis (Pw) and hepatitis B (HBV) liquid (DTPw-HBV) with the vial \ncontaining the Haemophilus influenzae type b (HIB) powder.  Both components are presented in a \nglass vial for 1 dose and must be mixed together before your child receives the vaccine. \n \nQuintanrix is available in the following pack sizes:  \n-  pack size of 1 vial of powder plus 1 vial of liquid \n-   pack size of 100 vials of powder plus 100 vials of liquid. \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n34 \n\n \nQuintanrix is a vaccine used in children to prevent five infectious diseases: diphtheria, tetanus \n(lockjaw), pertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b (a type of \nbacteria). The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against \nthese infectious diseases. \n \n\n• Diphtheria: Diphtheria mainly affects the airways and sometimes the skin.  Generally the airways \nbecome inflamed (swollen) causing severe breathing difficulties and sometimes suffocation.  The \nbacteria also release a toxin (poison), which can cause nerve damage, heart problems, and even \ndeath. \n\n \n• Tetanus (Lockjaw): Tetanus bacteria enter the body through cuts, scratches or wounds in the skin.  \n\nWounds that are especially prone to infection are burns, fractures, deep wounds or wounds \ncontaminated with soil, dust, horse manure/dung or wood splinters.  The bacteria release a toxin \n(poison), which can cause muscle stiffness, painful muscle spasms, fits and even death.  The \nmuscle spasms can be strong enough to cause bone fractures of the spine. \n\n \n• Pertussis (Whooping cough): Pertussis is a highly infectious illness.  The disease affects the \n\nairways causing severe spells of coughing that may interfere with normal breathing.  The coughing \nis often accompanied by a “whooping” sound, hence the common name “whooping cough”.  The \ncough may last for 1-2 months or longer.  Pertussis can also cause ear infections, bronchitis which \nmay last a long time, pneumonia, fits, brain damage and even death.   \n\n \n• Hepatitis B: Infection with the hepatitis B virus may cause the liver to become swollen (inflamed).  \n\nThe virus is found in body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, or saliva (spit) of \ninfected people. Signs of the disease may not be seen for 6 weeks to 6 months after infection.  \nSometimes people who have been infected do not look or feel ill.  Others have signs of mild flu, \nbut  some people can become very ill.  They may be extremely tired, and have dark urine, pale \nfaces, yellowish skin and/or eyes (jaundice), and other signs of the disease possibly requiring \nhospitalisation. \n\n \nMost adults fully recover from the disease.  But some people, particularly children, who may not \nhave shown signs of the disease can remain infected.  They are called hepatitis B virus carriers.  \nHepatitis B carriers can infect others throughout their lives. Hepatitis B carriers are at risk of \nserious liver disease, such as cirrhosis (liver scarring) and liver cancer. \n\n \n• Haemophilus influenzae type b (HIB): HIB infection most frequently causes brain inflammation \n\n(swelling).  There will be some type of serious complications such as: mental retardation, cerebral \npalsy, deafness, epilepsy or partial blindness.  HIB infection also causes inflammation of the throat.  \nIt occasionally causes death by suffocation. Less commonly, the bacteria can also infect the blood, \nheart, lungs, bones, joints, and tissues of the eyes and mouth. \n\n \nVaccination is the best way to protect against these diseases. The vaccine cannot cause diphtheria, \ntetanus (lockjaw), pertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis B or Haemophilus influenzae type b \ninfections. \n \nThe hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b components of Quintanrix can only help to protect \nyour child against infections with hepatitis B or Haemophilus influenzae type b viruses. It cannot \nprotect your child against other infections that can affect the liver or against infections due to other \nbacteria than Haemophilus influenzae type b or against meningitis caused by other organisms. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOUR CHILD RECEIVES QUINTANRIX \n \nIn the following cases, Quintanrix should not be given to your child.  You must tell your doctor: \n \n• if your child has experienced any health problems after previous administration of a vaccine. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n35 \n\n• if your child has previously had any allergic reaction to Quintanrix, or any ingredient contained \nin this vaccine.  The active substances and other ingredients in Quintanrix are listed at the \nbeginning of the leaflet.  Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of \nbreath and swelling of the face or tongue. \n\n• if your child has previously had an allergic reaction to any vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, \npertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis B or Haemophilus influenzae type b diseases. \n\n• if your child experienced problems of the nervous system (such as repetitive fits, decrease of \nconsciousness) within 7 days after previous vaccination with a vaccine against pertussis \n(whooping cough) disease. \n\n• if your child has a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C).  In these cases, the \nvaccination will be postponed until your child has recovered. A minor infection such as a cold \nshould not be a problem, but talk to your doctor first. \n\n• if your child has any known allergies. \n \nIn the following cases, your doctor can determine the right time and scheme of vaccination for \nyour child.  Tell your doctor: \n \n• if after previously having Quintanrix or another vaccine against pertussis (whooping cough) \n\ndisease, your child had any problems, especially:  \n♦ A high temperature (over 40°C) within 48 hours of vaccination \n♦ A collapse (floppiness) or shock-like state within 48 hours of vaccination \n♦ Persistent crying lasting 3 hours or more within 48 hours of vaccination \n♦ Seizures/fits with or without a high temperature within 3 days of vaccination \n\n• if your child has a bleeding problem or bruises easily \n• if your child has a tendency to seizures/fits due to a fever, or if there is a history in the family of \n\nthis \n• if your child is taking any other medicine or has recently received any other vaccine.  Your \n\ndoctor will be able to tell you what to do if Quintanrix is to be given with another vaccine or \nmedicine. \n\n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Quintanrix \n \nThis medicinal product contains thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that your child may \nexperience an allergic reaction.  Tell you doctor if your child has any known allergies. \n \n \n3. HOW QUINTANRIX IS GIVEN \n \nYour child will receive a total of three injections with an interval of at least one month between each \none. Each injection is given on a separate visit. The first injection can be given from the age of 6 \nweeks onwards.  You will be informed by the doctor or nurse when you should come back for \nsubsequent injections. \nThe doctor or nurse will give Quintanrix as an injection into the muscle. \n \nYour doctor will advise on the possible need for extra doses. \n \nIf your child misses the visit scheduled for the second or third injection, talk to your doctor and \narrange another visit as soon as possible. \n \nMake sure your child finishes the complete vaccination course of three injections.  If not, your child \nmay not be fully protected against the diseases. \n \nThe vaccine should never be given into a vein. \n \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n36 \n\n4.  POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nAny vaccine can have some side effects. \n \nSide effects that occurred during clinical trials with Quintanrix were as follows: \n \n♦ Very common (more than 1 per 10 doses of vaccine): \n\n• Pain, redness or swelling at the injection site \n• Fever (more than 37.5°C) \n• Irritability \n• Loss of appetite \n• Drowsiness \n\n \n♦ Common (less than 1 per 10 but more than 1 per 100 doses of vaccine): \n\n• Induration (hard lump) \n• Fever (more than 39°C) \n\n \n♦ Rare (less than 1 per 1000 but more than 1 per 10 000 doses of vaccine): \n\n• Bronchitis \n• Coughing \n• Vomiting \n• Collapse (floppiness) or periods of unconsciousness or lack of awareness \n• Fits \n\n \nBleeding or bruising more easily than normal due to a drop in a type of blood cell called platelets \nhave been reported very rarely (less than 1 per 10,000 doses of vaccine) with the hepatitis B \ncomponent of Quintanrix. \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, there is an extremely small risk of allergic reactions.  These may be \nlocal or widespread rashes that may be itchy or blistering, swelling of the eyes and face, difficulty in \nbreathing or swallowing, a sudden drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness. Such reactions \nmay occur before leaving the doctor’s surgery.  However, you should seek immediate treatment in any \nevent. \n \nIf these events continue or become severe, tell your doctor. \n \n\nThis medicinal product contains thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that your child may \nexperience an allergic reaction. \n \n\nIf you notice any side effects not mentioned in this leaflet, please inform your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n\nDo not be alarmed by this list of possible side effects.  It is possible that your child will have no side \neffects from vaccination. \n \n \n5. STORING QUINTANRIX \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light.   \nDo not freeze.  Freezing destroys the vaccine. \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \nDo not use after the expiry date stated on the pack.  The date for last use corresponds to the last day of \nthe month mentioned. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n37 \n\n \n6.

WHAT QUINTANRIX IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nQuintanrix is a white slightly milky liquid obtained by mixing the vial containing the diphtheria (D), \ntetanus (T), whole cell pertussis (Pw) and hepatitis B (HBV) liquid (DTPw-HBV) with the vial \ncontaining the Haemophilus influenzae type b (HIB) powder.  Both components are presented in a \nglass vial for 2 doses or for 10 doses and must be mixed together before your child receives the \nvaccine. \n \nQuintanrix is available in the following pack sizes: \n \nFor 2  doses : \n- pack size of 1 vial of powder plus 1 vial of liquid \n- pack size of 100 vials of powder plus 100 vials of liquid \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n41 \n\n \nFor 10 doses: \n- pack size of 50 vials of powder plus 50 vials of liquid \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \nQuintanrix is a vaccine used in children to prevent five infectious diseases: diphtheria, tetanus \n(lockjaw), pertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b (a type of \nbacteria). The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against \nthese infectious diseases. \n \n\n• Diphtheria: Diphtheria mainly affects the airways and sometimes the skin.  Generally the airways \nbecome inflamed (swollen) causing severe breathing difficulties and sometimes suffocation.  The \nbacteria also release a toxin (poison), which can cause nerve damage, heart problems, and even \ndeath. \n\n \n• Tetanus (Lockjaw): Tetanus bacteria enter the body through cuts, scratches or wounds in the skin.  \n\nWounds that are especially prone to infection are burns, fractures, deep wounds or wounds \ncontaminated with soil, dust, horse manure/dung or wood splinters.  The bacteria release a toxin \n(poison), which can cause muscle stiffness, painful muscle spasms, fits and even death.  The \nmuscle spasms can be strong enough to cause bone fractures of the spine. \n\n \n• Pertussis (Whooping cough): Pertussis is a highly infectious illness.  The disease affects the \n\nairways causing severe spells of coughing that may interfere with normal breathing.  The coughing \nis often accompanied by a “whooping” sound, hence the common name “whooping cough”.  The \ncough may last for 1-2 months or longer.  Pertussis can also cause ear infections, bronchitis which \nmay last a long time, pneumonia, fits, brain damage and even death.   \n\n \n• Hepatitis B: Infection with the hepatitis B virus may cause the liver to become swollen (inflamed).  \n\nThe virus is found in body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, or saliva (spit) of \ninfected people. Signs of the disease may not be seen for 6 weeks to 6 months after infection.  \nSometimes people who have been infected do not look or feel ill.  Others have signs of mild flu, \nbut  some people can become very ill.  They may be extremely tired, and have dark urine, pale \nfaces, yellowish skin and/or eyes (jaundice), and other signs of the disease possibly requiring \nhospitalisation. \n\n \nMost adults fully recover from the disease.  But some people, particularly children, who may not \nhave shown signs of the disease can remain infected.  They are called hepatitis B virus carriers.  \nHepatitis B carriers can infect others throughout their lives. Hepatitis B carriers are at risk of \nserious liver disease, such as cirrhosis (liver scarring) and liver cancer. \n\n \n• Haemophilus influenzae type b (HIB): HIB infection most frequently causes brain inflammation \n\n(swelling).  There will be some type of serious complications such as: mental retardation, cerebral \npalsy, deafness, epilepsy or partial blindness.  HIB infection also causes inflammation of the throat.  \nIt occasionally causes death by suffocation. Less commonly, the bacteria can also infect the blood, \nheart, lungs, bones, joints, and tissues of the eyes and mouth. \n\n \nVaccination is the best way to protect against these diseases. The vaccine cannot cause diphtheria, \ntetanus (lockjaw), pertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis B or Haemophilus influenzae type b \ninfections. \n \nThe hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b components of Quintanrix can only help to protect \nyour child against infections with hepatitis B or Haemophilus influenzae type b viruses. It cannot \nprotect your child against other infections that can affect the liver or against infections due to other \nbacteria than Haemophilus influenzae type b or against meningitis caused by other organisms. \n \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n42 \n\n2. BEFORE YOUR CHILD RECEIVES QUINTANRIX \n \nIn the following cases, Quintanrix should not be given to your child.  You must tell your doctor: \n \n• if your child has experienced any health problems after previous administration of a vaccine. \n• if your child has previously had any allergic reaction to Quintanrix, or any ingredient contained \n\nin this vaccine.  The active substances and other ingredients in Quintanrix are listed at the \nbeginning of the leaflet.  Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of \nbreath and swelling of the face or tongue. \n\n• if your child has previously had an allergic reaction to any vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, \npertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis B or Haemophilus influenzae type b diseases. \n\n• if your child experienced problems of the nervous system (such as repetitive fits, decrease of \nconsciousness) within 7 days after previous vaccination with a vaccine against pertussis \n(whooping cough) disease. \n\n• if your child has a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C).  In these cases, the \nvaccination will be postponed until your child has recovered. A minor infection such as a cold \nshould not be a problem, but talk to your doctor first. \n\n• if your child has any known allergies. \n \nIn the following cases, your doctor can determine the right time and scheme of vaccination for \nyour child.  Tell your doctor: \n \n• if after previously having Quintanrix or another vaccine against pertussis (whooping cough) \n\ndisease, your child had any problems, especially:  \n♦ A high temperature (over 40°C) within 48 hours of vaccination \n♦ A collapse (floppiness) or shock-like state within 48 hours of vaccination \n♦ Persistent crying lasting 3 hours or more within 48 hours of vaccination \n♦ Seizures/fits with or without a high temperature within 3 days of vaccination \n\n• if your child has a bleeding problem or bruises easily \n• if your child has a tendency to seizures/fits due to a fever, or if there is a history in the family of \n\nthis \n• if your child is taking any other medicine or has recently received any other vaccine.  Your \n\ndoctor will be able to tell you what to do if Quintanrix is to be given with another vaccine or \nmedicine. \n\n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Quintanrix \n \nThis medicinal product contains thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that your child may \nexperience an allergic reaction.  Tell you doctor if your child has any known allergies. \n \n \n3. HOW QUINTANRIX IS GIVEN \n \nYour child will receive a total of three injections with an interval of at least one month between each \none. Each injection is given on a separate visit. The first injection can be given from the age of 6 \nweeks onwards.  You will be informed by the doctor or nurse when you should come back for \nsubsequent injections. \nThe doctor or nurse will give Quintanrix as an injection into the muscle. \n \nYour doctor will advise on the possible need for extra doses. \n \nIf your child misses the visit scheduled for the second or third injection, talk to your doctor and \narrange another visit as soon as possible. \n \nMake sure your child finishes the complete vaccination course of three injections.  If not, your child \nmay not be fully protected against the diseases. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl P\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n43 \n\n \nThe vaccine should never be given into a vein. \n \n \n4.  POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nAny vaccine can have some side effects. \n \nSide effects that occurred during clinical trials with Quintanrix were as follows: \n \n♦ Very common (more than 1 per 10 doses of vaccine): \n\n• Pain, redness or swelling at the injection site \n• Fever (more than 37.5°C) \n• Irritability \n• Loss of appetite \n• Drowsiness \n\n \n♦ Common (less than 1 per 10 but more than 1 per 100 doses of vaccine): \n\n• Induration (hard lump) \n• Fever (more than 39°C) \n\n \n♦ Rare (less than 1 per 1000  but more than 1 per 10 000 doses of vaccine): \n\n• Bronchitis \n• Coughing \n• Vomiting \n• Collapse (floppiness) or periods of unconsciousness or lack of awareness \n• Fits \n\n \nBleeding or bruising more easily than normal due to a drop in a type of blood cell called platelets \nhave been reported very rarely (less than 1 per 10,000 doses of vaccine) with the hepatitis B \ncomponent of Quintanrix. \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, there is an extremely small risk of allergic reactions.  These may be \nlocal or widespread rashes that may be itchy or blistering, swelling of the eyes and face, difficulty in \nbreathing or swallowing, a sudden drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness. Such reactions \nmay occur before leaving the doctor’s surgery.  However, you should seek immediate treatment in any \nevent. \n \nIf these events continue or become severe, tell your doctor. \n \n\nThis medicinal product contains thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that your child may \nexperience an allergic reaction. \n \n\nIf you notice any side effects not mentioned in this leaflet, please inform your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n\nDo not be alarmed by this list of possible side effects.  It is possible that your child will have no side \neffects from vaccination. \n \n \n5. STORING QUINTANRIX \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C).  \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light.   \nDo not freeze.

The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, is not a \ncontraindication for vaccination. \n \nIf any of the following events occur in temporal relation to receipt of Quintanrix, the decision to give \nsubsequent doses of a vaccine containing the pertussis component should be carefully considered: \n• Temperature of ≥ 40.0 °C within 48 hours, not due to another identifiable cause. \n• Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours. \n• Persistent crying lasting ≥ 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours. \n• Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days. \nThere may be circumstances, such as a high incidence of pertussis, when the potential benefits \noutweigh possible risks. \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nQuintanrix is for deep intramuscular injection, preferably in the anterolateral thigh. \n \nQuintanrix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tMANUFACTURER OF THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVE SUBSTANCES ANDMANUFACTURING AUTHORISATION HOLDER RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCHRELEASE\n\tCONDITIONS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION\n\tLABELLING\n\tPACKAGE LEAFLET","content_length":80112,"file_size":648067}],"conditional_approval":false,"exceptional_circumstances":false,"indication":"<div> \n <div class=\"ecl-field__body\"> \n  <div class=\"ecl-editor first last\">\n   <p>Quintanrix is indicated for primary immunisation of infants (during the first year of life) against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b and for booster immunisation of young children during the second year of life.<br>The use of Quintanrix should be determined on the basis of official recommendations.</p>\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div>","therapeutic_area":["Hepatitis B","Tetanus","Immunization","Meningitis, Haemophilus","Whooping Cough","Diphtheria"],"contact_address":"Rue de l'Institut, 89\nB-1330 Rixensart\nBelgium","biosimilar":false}
