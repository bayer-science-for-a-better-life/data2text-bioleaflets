NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nSprimeo HCT 150 mg/12.5 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 150 mg aliskiren (as hemifumarate) and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nExcipients: Each tablet contains 25 mg lactose monohydrate and 24.5 mg wheat starch. \n\n \n\nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nFilm-coated tablet \n\n \n\nWhite, biconvex, ovaloid film-coated tablet imprinted with “LCI” on one side and “NVR” on the \n\nother. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nTreatment of essential hypertension in adults. \n\n \n\nSprimeo HCT is indicated in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on aliskiren or \n\nhydrochlorothiazide used alone. \n\n \n\nSprimeo HCT is indicated as substitution therapy in patients adequately controlled with aliskiren and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, given concurrently, at the same dose level as in the combination. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Sprimeo HCT is one tablet per day. Sprimeo HCT should be taken with a \n\nlight meal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. Grapefruit juice should not be taken \n\ntogether with Sprimeo HCT. \n\n \n\nThe antihypertensive effect is largely manifested within 1 week and the maximum effect is generally \n\nseen within 4 weeks. \n\n \n\nPosology in patients not adequately controlled with aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy \n\nIndividual dose titration with each of the two components may be recommended before changing to \n\nthe fixed combination. When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy to the fixed \n\ncombination may be considered. \n\n \n\nSprimeo HCT 150 mg /12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not \n\nadequately controlled with aliskiren 150 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg alone. \n\n \n\nIf blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 2-4 weeks of therapy, the dose may be titrated up to a \n\nmaximum of Sprimeo HCT 300 mg/25 mg daily. Dosing should be individualised and adjusted \n\naccording to the patient’s clinical response. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nPosology as substitution therapy \n\nFor convenience, patients receiving aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide from separate tablets may be \n\nswitched to a fixed combination tablet of Sprimeo HCT containing the same component doses. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 5.2). Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated for \n\nuse in patients with anuria and in patients with severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n\n(GFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). The concomitant use of Sprimeo HCT with angiotensin II receptor \n\nblockers (ARB) or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) is contraindicated in patients \n\nwith renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment \n\n(see section 5.2). Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see \n\nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nElderly patients (over 65 years) \n\nThe recommended starting dose of aliskiren in elderly patients is 150 mg. No clinically meaningful \n\nadditional blood pressure reduction is observed by increasing the dose to 300 mg in the majority of \n\nelderly patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients \n\nSprimeo HCT is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below age 18 due to a lack of \n\ndata on safety and efficacy (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1), or to other \nsulphonamide-derived substances. \n\n History of angioedema with aliskiren. \n\n Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema. \n\n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\n Anuria. \n\n Severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n Refractory hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia and symptomatic hyperuricaemia. \n\n Severe hepatic impairment. \n\n The concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin and itraconazole, two highly potent P-\nglycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, and other potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. quinidine), is \n\ncontraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\n The concomitant use of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with \ndiabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n\n2\n) (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and \n\n5.1). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nHypotension, syncope, stroke, hyperkalaemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal \n\nfailure) have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that \n\naffect this system (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by \n\ncombining aliskiren with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blocker (ARB) is therefore not recommended. \n\n \n\nThe use of aliskiren in combination with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nHeart failure \n\nAliskiren should be used with caution in patients with serious congestive heart failure (New York \n\nHeart Association (NYHA) functional class III-IV). Sprimeo HCT should be used with caution in \n\npatients with heart failure due to limited clinical efficacy and safety data. \n\n \n\nAngioedema \n\nAs with other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, angioedema or symptoms suggestive of \n\nangioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or tongue) have been reported in patients treated \n\nwith aliskiren. \n\n \n\nA number of these patients had a history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema, \n\nwhich in some cases followed use of other medicines that can cause angioedema, including RAAS \n\nblockers (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nPatients with a history of angioedema may be at increased risk of experiencing angioedema during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Caution should therefore be exercised when \n\nprescribing aliskiren to patients with a history of angioedema, and such patients should be closely \n\nmonitored during treatment (see section 4.8) especially at the beginning of the treatment. \n\n \n\nIf angioedema occurs, Sprimeo HCT should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and \n\nmonitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. \n\nWhere there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx adrenaline should be administered. In \n\naddition, measures necessary to maintain patent airways should be provided. \n\n \n\nSodium- and/or volume-depleted patients \n\nIn sodium-depleted and/or volume-depleted patients, such as those receiving high doses of diuretics, \n\nsymptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Sprimeo HCT. Sprimeo HCT \n\nshould be used only after correction of any pre-existing sodium and/or volume depletion. \n\n \n\nElectrolyte imbalance \n\nTreatment with Sprimeo HCT should only start after correction of hypokalaemia and any coexisting \n\nhypomagnesaemia. Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hypokalaemia or exacerbate pre-\n\nexisting hypokalaemia. Thiazide diuretics should be administered with caution in patients with \n\nconditions involving enhanced potassium loss, for example salt-losing nephropathies and prerenal \n\n(cardiogenic) impairment of kidney function. If hypokalaemia develops during hydrochlorothiazide \n\ntherapy Sprimeo HCT should be discontinued until stable correction of the potassium balance. \n\nAlthough hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with \n\naliskiren may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greater in patients \n\nwith cirrhosis of the liver, patients experiencing brisk diuresis, patients with inadequate oral \n\nelectrolyte intake and patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or \n\nadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nConversely, increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in post-marketing \n\nexperience and these may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or \n\nby non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Consistent with standard medical practice, \n\nperiodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is advised if co-administration is \n\nconsidered necessary. The concomitant use of aliskiren and ACEIs or ARBs is contraindicated in \n\npatients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.3, 4.5 \n\nand 4.8). \n\n \n\nThiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hyponatraemia and hypochloroaemic alkalosis or \n\nexacerbate pre-existing hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia, accompanied by neurological symptoms \n\n(nausea, progressive disorientation, apathy) has been observed. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide \n\nshould only be started after correction of pre-existing hyponatraemia. In case severe or rapid \n\nhyponatraemia develops during Sprimeo HCT therapy, the treatment should be discontinued until \n\nnormalisation of natraemia. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nThere is no evidence that Sprimeo HCT would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. \n\nChloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \n\n \n\nAll patients receiving thiazide diuretics should be periodically monitored for imbalances in \n\nelectrolytes, particularly potassium, sodium and magnesium. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \n\nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Sprimeo HCT is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-\n\nexisting hypercalcaemia. Sprimeo HCT should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during \n\ntreatment. Serum levels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. \n\nMarked hypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be \n\ndiscontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation \n\nThiazide diuretics may precipitate azotaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. When Sprimeo \n\nHCT is used in patients with renal impairment, periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes including \n\npotassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment or anuria (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (GFR \n\n≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). \n\n \n\nThere is no experience regarding the administration of Sprimeo HCT in patients who have recently \n\nundergone kidney transplantation. \n\n \n\nAs for other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, caution should be exercised when aliskiren \n\nis given in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction such as hypovolaemia (e.g. \n\ndue to blood loss, severe or prolonged diarrhoea, prolonged vomiting, etc.), heart disease, liver \n\ndisease, diabetes mellitus or kidney disease. The concomitant use of aliskiren and ACEIs or ARBs is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Acute renal failure, \n\nreversible upon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients receiving aliskiren in \n\npost-marketing experience. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, aliskiren should be \n\npromptly discontinued. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver \n\ndisease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. No \n\nadjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. No \n\ndata are available for the use of Sprimeo HCT in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Due to the \n\nhydrochlorothiazide component, Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nThere is no clinical experience with Sprimeo HCT in patients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nModerate P-gp inhibitors \n\nCo-administration of aliskiren 300 mg with ketoconazole 200 mg or verapamil 240 mg resulted in a \n\n76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. Therefore caution should be exercised when \n\naliskiren is administered with moderate P-gp inhibitors such as ketoconazole or verapamil (see section \n\n4.5). \n\n \n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \n\nAs with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral \n\nstenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nRenal artery stenosis and renovascular hypertension \n\nNo controlled clinical data are available on the use of Sprimeo HCT in patients with unilateral or \n\nbilateral renal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, as with other agents acting on \n\nthe renin-angiotensin system, there is an increased risk of renal insufficiency, including acute renal \n\nfailure, when patients with renal artery stenosis are treated with aliskiren. Therefore caution should be \n\nexercised in these patients. If renal failure occurs, treatment should be discontinued. \n\n \n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, have been reported to exacerbate or activate \n\nsystemic lupus erythematosus. \n\n \n\nMetabolic and endocrine effects \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels \n\nof cholesterol and triglycerides, and uric acid. In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral \n\nhypoglycaemic agents may be required. Concomitant use of Sprimeo HCT with ARBs or ACEIs is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated in symptomatic \n\nhyperuricaemia (see section 4.3). Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to \n\nreduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricaemia as well as precipitate gout \n\nin susceptible patients. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \n\nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Sprimeo HCT is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-\n\nexisting hypercalcaemia. Sprimeo HCT should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during \n\ntreatment. Serum levels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. \n\nMarked hypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be \n\ndiscontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nPhotosensitivity \n\nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If \n\nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Sprimeo HCT, it is recommended to stop the \n\ntreatment. If a re-administration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect \n\nexposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA. \n\n \n\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma \n\nHydrochlorothiazide, a sulphonamide, has been associated with an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in \n\nacute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased \n\nvisual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of treatment initiation. \n\nUntreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to \n\ndiscontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatment may need \n\nto be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute \n\nangle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulphonamide or penicillin allergy. \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\nIn the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea, Sprimeo HCT therapy should be stopped. \n\n \n\nAs with any antihypertensive agent, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with ischaemic \n\ncardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients, but are more likely in patients \n\nwith allergy and asthma. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nExcipients \n\nSprimeo HCT contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the \n\nLapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\nSprimeo HCT contains wheat starch. It is suitable for people with coeliac disease. Patients with wheat \n\nallergy (different from coeliac disease) should not take this medicine. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nInformation on Sprimeo HCT interactions \n\nMedicinal products affecting serum potassium levels: The potassium-depleting effect of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide is attenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of aliskiren. However, this effect of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal \n\nproducts associated with potassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, \n\ncorticosteroids, laxatives, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), amphotericin, carbenoxolone, \n\npenicillin G, salicylic acid derivatives). Conversely, concomitant use of other agents affecting the \n\nRAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum potassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, \n\npotassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum \n\npotassium. If co-medication with an agent affecting the level of serum potassium is considered \n\nnecessary, caution is advisable. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated \n\nin patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not \n\nrecommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: Periodic monitoring of serum \n\npotassium is recommended when Sprimeo HCT is administered with medicinal products affected by \n\nserum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). \n\n \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors \n\n(COX-2 inhibitors), acetylsalicylic acid and non-selective NSAIDs: As with other agents acting on the \n\nrenin-angiotensin system, NSAIDs may reduce the anti-hypertensive effect of aliskiren. NSAIDs may \n\nalso weaken the diuretic and antihypertensive activity of hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nIn some patients with compromised renal function (dehydrated patients or elderly patients) aliskiren \n\nand hydrochlorothiazide given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in further deterioration of renal \n\nfunction, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore the use of \n\nSprimeo HCT with an NSAID requires caution, especially in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nOther antihypertensive agents: The antihypertensive effect of Sprimeo HCT may be increased with \n\nthe concomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. \n\n \n\nAdditional information on aliskiren interactions \n\nThe combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus \n\nor renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see \n\nsections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nCompounds that have been investigated in aliskiren clinical pharmacokinetic studies include \n\nacenocoumarol, atenolol, celecoxib, fenofibrate, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate, \n\ndigoxin, metformin, amlodipine, atorvastatin, cimetidine and hydrochlorothiazide. No clinically \n\nrelevant interactions have been identified. As a result no dose adjustment for aliskiren or these co-\n\nadministered medicinal products is necessary. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nP-glycoprotein interactions: MDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system \n\ninvolved in intestinal absorption and biliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies. Rifampicin, \n\nwhich is an inducer of P-gp, reduced aliskiren bioavailability by approximately 50% in a clinical \n\nstudy. Other inducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort) might decrease the bioavailability of aliskiren. \n\nAlthough this has not been investigated for aliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake \n\nof a variety of substrates and P-gp inhibitors can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. \n\nTherefore, P-gp inhibitors may increase tissue levels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug \n\ninteractions at the P-gp site will likely depend on the degree of inhibition of this transporter. \n\n \n\nP-gp potent inhibitors: A single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that \n\nciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) increases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC \n\napproximately 5-fold. The increase may be higher with higher aliskiren doses. In healthy subjects, \n\nitraconazole (100 mg) increases AUC and Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, \n\nrespectively. Therefore, concomitant use of aliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nModerate P-gp inhibitors: Co-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) or verapamil (240 mg) with \n\naliskiren (300 mg) resulted in a 76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. The change in \n\nplasma levels of aliskiren in the presence of ketoconazole or verapamil is expected to be within the \n\nrange that would be achieved if the dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or \n\ntwice the highest recommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled \n\nclinical trials. Preclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances \n\naliskiren gastrointestinal absorption and decreases biliary excretion. Therefore, caution should be \n\nexercised when aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole, verapamil or other moderate P-gp \n\ninhibitors (clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). \n\n \n\nP-gp substrates or weak inhibitors: No relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or \n\ncimetidine have been observed. When administered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren \n\n(300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. \n\n \n\nOrganic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors: Preclinical studies indicate that aliskiren \n\nmight be a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptides. Therefore, the potential exists for \n\ninteractions between OATP inhibitors and aliskiren when administered concomitantly (see interaction \n\nwith Grapefruit juice). \n\n \n\nGrapefruit juice: Administration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and \n\nCmax of aliskiren. Co-administration with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren \n\nAUC and co-administration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. This \n\ndecrease is likely due to an inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of \n\naliskiren by grapefruit juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic \n\nfailure, grapefruit juice should not be taken together with Sprimeo HCT. \n\n \n\nFurosemide: When aliskiren was co-administered with furosemide, the AUC and Cmax of furosemide \n\nwere reduced by 28% and 49%, respectively. It is therefore recommended to monitor the effects when \n\ninitiating and adjusting furosemide therapy to avoid possible underutilisation in clinical situations of \n\nvolume overload. \n\n \n\nWarfarin: The effects of aliskiren on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. \n\n \n\nFood interactions: Meals with a high fat content have been shown to reduce the absorption of aliskiren \n\nsubstantially. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nAdditional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions \n\nWhen administered concurrently, the following medicinal products may interact with thiazide \n\ndiuretics: \n\n \n\nLithium: Renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, therefore the risk of lithium toxicity may \n\nbe increased with hydrochlorothiazide. Co-administration of lithium and hydrochlorothiazide is not \n\nrecommended. If this combination proves essential, careful monitoring of serum lithium level is \n\nrecommended during concomitant use. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products that could induce torsades de pointes: Due to the risk of hypokalaemia, \n\nhydrochlorothiazide should be administered with caution when associated with medicinal products \n\nthat could induce torsades de pointes, in particular Class Ia and Class III antiarrhythmics and some \n\nantipsychotics. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affecting serum sodium level: The hyponatraemic effect of diuretics may be \n\nintensified by concomitant administration of medicinal products such as antidepressants, \n\nantipsychotics, antiepileptics, etc. Caution is indicated in long-term administration of these medicinal \n\nproducts. \n\n \n\nPressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline, adrenaline): Hydrochlorothiazide may reduce the response to \n\npressor amines such as noradrenaline. The clinical significance of this effect is uncertain and not \n\nsufficient to preclude their use. \n\n \n\nDigoxine or other digitalis glycosides: Thiazide-induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia may \n\noccur as undesirable effects, favouring the onset of digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias. \n\n \n\nVitamin D and calcium salts: Administration of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, with \n\nvitamin D or with calcium salts may potentiate the rise in serum calcium. Concomitant use of thiazide \n\ntype diuretics may lead to hypercalcaemia in patients pre-disposed for hypercalcaemia (e.g. \n\nhyperparathyroidism, malignancy, or vitamin-D-mediated conditions) by increasing tubular calcium \n\nreabsorption. \n\n \n\nAntidiabetic agents (e.g. insulin and oral antidiabetic agents): Thiazides may alter glucose tolerance. \n\nDose adjustment of the antidiabetic medicinal product may be necessary (see section 4.4). Metformin \n\nshould be used with caution because of the risk of lactic acidosis induced by possible functional renal \n\nfailure linked to hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nBeta blockers and diazoxide: Concomitant use of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, \n\nwith beta blockers may increase the risk of hyperglycaemia. Thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, may enhance the hyperglycaemic effect of diazoxide. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products used in the treatment of gout: Dose adjustment of uricosuric medicinal products \n\nmay be necessary as hydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase of dose of \n\nprobenecid or sulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, may increase the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol. \n\n \n\nAnticholinergic agents and other medicinal products affecting gastric motility: The bioavailability of \n\nthiazide-type diuretics may be increased by anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, biperiden), \n\napparently due to a decrease in gastrointestinal motility and the stomach emptying rate. Conversely, it \n\nis anticipated that prokinetic substances such as cisapride may decrease the bioavailability of thiazide-\n\ntype diuretics. \n\n \n\nAmantadine: Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may increase the risk of adverse reactions \n\ncaused by amantadine. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nIon exchange resins: Absorption of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, is decreased by \n\ncholestyramine or colestipol. This could result in sub-therapeutic effects of thiazide diuretics. \n\nHowever, staggering the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and resin such that hydrochlorothiazide is \n\nadministered at least 4 hours before or 4-6 hours after the administration of resins would potentially \n\nminimise the interaction. \n\n \n\nCytotoxic agents: Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may reduce the renal excretion of \n\ncytotoxic agents (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their myelosuppressive effects. \n\n \n\nNon-depolarising skeletal muscle relaxants: Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, potentiate the \n\naction of skeletal muscle relaxants such as curare derivatives. \n\n \n\nAlcohol, barbiturates or narcotics: Concomitant administration of thiazide diuretics with subtances \n\nthat also have a blood pressure lowering effect (e.g. by reducing sympathetic central nervous system \n\nactivity or direct vasodilatation) may potentiate orthostatic hypotension. \n\n \n\nMethyldopa: There have been isolated reports of haemolytic anaemia occurring with concomitant use \n\nof hydrochlorothiazide and methyldopa. \n\n \n\nIodine contrasting agents: In case of diuretic-induced dehydration, there is an increased risk of acute \n\nrenal failure, especially with high doses of iodine products. Patients should be rehydrated before \n\nadministration. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women. Aliskiren was not teratogenic in rats or \n\nrabbits (see section 5.3). Other substances that act directly on the RAAS have been associated with \n\nserious foetal malformations and neonatal death when used during second and third trimesters. There \n\nis limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. \n\nAnimal studies are insufficient. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the pharmacological mechanism of action of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, its use during the second and third trimester may compromise foeto-placental \n\nperfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and \n\nthrombocytopenia. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or \n\npre-eclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a \n\nbeneficial effect on the course of the disease. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare \n\nsituations where no other treatment could be used. \n\n \n\nNo specific clinical studies have been performed with this combination, therefore Sprimeo HCT \n\nshould not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy or in women planning to become pregnant \n\nand is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). A switch to a suitable \n\nalternative treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy. If pregnancy is detected \n\nduring therapy, Sprimeo HCT should be discontinued as soon as possible. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether aliskiren is excreted in human milk. Aliskiren was secreted in the milk of \n\nlactating rats. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \n\nintense diuresis can inhibit milk production. \n\n \n\nThe use of Sprimeo HCT during breast-feeding is not recommended. If Sprimeo HCT is used during \n\nbreast-feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nNo studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Sprimeo HCT \n\nis unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use machines. However, when driving vehicles or \n\noperating machinery it must be borne in mind that dizziness or drowsiness may occasionally occur \n\nwhen taking antihypertensive therapy. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nAliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide combination \n\nThe safety of Sprimeo HCT has been evaluated in 9 clinical trials with more than 3,900 patients, \n\nincluding over 700 treated for over 6 months, and 190 for over 1 year. The incidence of adverse \n\nreactions showed no association with gender, age, body mass index, race or ethnicity. Treatment with \n\nSprimeo HCT had an overall incidence of adverse experiences at doses up to 300 mg/25 mg similar to \n\nplacebo. Adverse reactions have generally been mild and transient in nature and have only \n\ninfrequently required discontinuation of therapy. The most common adverse drug reaction observed \n\nwith Sprimeo HCT is diarrhoea. The adverse drug reactions previously reported with one of the \n\nindividual components of Sprimeo HCT (aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide) and listed in the \n\nrespective paragraphs on the individual components may occur with Sprimeo HCT. \n\n \n\nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: very \n\ncommon (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n\n< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Common: Diarrhoea \n\n \n\nDiarrhoea: Diarrhoea is a dose-related adverse drug reaction for aliskiren. In controlled clinical trials, \n\nthe incidence of diarrhoea in Sprimeo HCT-treated patients was 1.3% compared to 1.4% for aliskiren- \n\nor 1.9% for hydrochlorothiazide-treated patients. \n\n \n\nSerum potassium: In a large placebo-controlled clinical trial, the opposite effects of aliskiren (150 mg \n\nor 300 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) on serum potassium approximately balanced \n\neach other in many patients. In other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Periodic \n\ndeterminations of serum potassium to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed in \n\npatients at risk at appropriate intervals (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nAdditional information on individual components \n\nOther adverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components may occur with \n\nSprimeo HCT even if not observed in clinical trials. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nTreatment with Aliskiren up to 300 mg resulted in an overall incidence of adverse reactions similar to \n\nplacebo. Adverse reactions have generally been mild and transient in nature and have only \n\ninfrequently required discontinuation of therapy. The most common adverse drug reaction is \n\ndiarrhoea. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nThe known aliskiren adverse drug reactions are presented in the table below using the same \n\nconvention as described previously for the fixed combination. \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common: Dizziness \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Uncommon: Hypotension \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Common: Diarrhoea \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n Rare: Hypersensitivity reactions \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Uncommon: Rash, severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including toxic \n\nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) and oral mucosal reactions \n\n Rare: Angioedema \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\n Common: Arthralgia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n Uncommon: Acute renal failure, renal impairment \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n Uncommon: Oedema peripheral \n\nInvestigations \n Common: Hyperkalaemia \n\n Rare: Haemoglobin decreased, haematocrit decreased \n\n Rare: Blood creatinine increased \n\n \n\nAngioedema and hypersensitivity reactions have occurred during treatment with aliskiren. In \n\ncontrolled clinical trials, angioedema and hypersensitivity reactions occurred rarely during treatment \n\nwith aliskiren with rates comparable to treatment with placebo or comparators. \n\n \n\nCases of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or \n\ntongue) have also been reported in post-marketing experience. A number of these patients had a \n\nhistory of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema which in some cases was associated \n\nwith the administration of other medicines known to cause angioedema, including RAAS blockers \n\n(ACE inhibitors or ARBs). \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions have also been reported in post-marketing experience. \n\n \n\nIn the event of any signs suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction/angioedema (in particular difficulties \n\nin breathing or swallowing, rash, itching, hives or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/or \n\ntongue, dizziness) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nArthralgia has been reported in post-marketing experience. In some cases this occurred as part of a \n\nhypersensitivity reaction. \n\n \n\nHaemoglobin and haematocrit: Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of \n\napproximately 0.05 mmol/l and 0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed. No patients \n\ndiscontinued therapy due to anaemia. This effect is also seen with other agents acting on the renin-\n\nangiotensin system, such as ACEI and ARBs. \n\n \n\nSerum potassium: Increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren and these may be \n\nexacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by NSAIDs. Consistent with \n\nstandard medical practice, periodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is \n\nadvised if co-administration is considered necessary. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or \n\nACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR \n\n< 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, renal dysfunction and cases of acute renal failure have been reported in \n\npatients at risk (see section 4.4). There have also been reports of peripheral oedema, increase in blood \n\ncreatinine and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including toxic epidermal necrolysis \n\n(TEN) and oral mucosal reactions. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nHydrochlorothiazide has been extensively prescribed for many years, frequently in higher doses than \n\nthose contained in Sprimeo HCT. The following adverse reactions have been reported in patients \n\ntreated with thiazide diuretics alone, including hydrochlorothiazide: \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\n Rare: Thrombocytopenia sometimes with purpura \n\n Very rare: Agranulocytosis, bone marrow depression, haemolytic anaemia, \n\nleucopenia \n\n Not known: Aplastic anaemia \nImmune system disorders \n\n Very rare: Hypersensitivity \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\n Very common: Hypokalaemia \n\n Common: Hyperuricaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hyponatraemia \n\n Rare: Hypercalcaemia, hyperglycaemia, worsening of diabetic metabolic \n\nstate \n\n Very rare: Hypochloraemic alkalosis \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\n Rare: Depression, sleep disturbances \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Rare: Dizziness, headache, paraesthesia \n\nEye disorders \n\n Rare: Visual impairment \n\n Not known: Acute angle-closure glaucoma \n\nCardiac disorders \n\n Rare: Cardiac arrhythmias \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Common: Orthostatic hypotension \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\n Very rare: Respiratory distress (including pneumonitis and pulmonary oedema) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Common: Decreased appetite, mild nausea and vomiting \n\n Rare: Abdominal discomfort, constipation, diarrhoea \n\n Very rare: Pancreatitis \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\n Rare: Intrahepatic cholestasis, jaundice \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Common: Urticaria and other forms of rash \n\n Rare: Photosensitivity reactions \n\n Very rare: Cutaneous lupus erythematosus-like reactions, reactivation of \n\ncutaneous lupus erythematosus, vasculitis necrotising and toxic \n\nepidermal necrolysis \n\n Not known: Erythema multiforme \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\n Not known: Muscle spasm \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\n Not known: Renal dysfunction, acute renal failure \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\n Common: Impotence \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n Not known: Asthenia, pyrexia \n\nInvestigations \n\n Very common: Increases in cholesterol and triglycerides \n\n Rare: Glycosuria \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nNo information is available on the treatment of overdose with Sprimeo HCT. The most likely \n\nmanifestation of overdose would be hypotension, related to the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren. \n\n \n\nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \n\nhypochloraemia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most \n\ncommon signs and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in \n\nmuscle spasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \n\nglycosides or certain antiarrhythmic medicinal products. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, \n\nsupportive treatment should be initiated. \n\n \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis, dialysis \n\nclearance of aliskiren was low (< 2% of oral clearance). Therefore dialysis is not adequate to treat \n\naliskiren over-exposure. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Renin inhibitor (aliskiren) combinations with diuretics \n\n(hydrochlorothiazide), ATC code: C09XA52 \n\nSprimeo HCT combines two antihypertensive compounds to control blood pressure in patients with \n\nessential hypertension: Aliskiren belongs to the class of direct renin inhibitors and hydrochlorothiazide \n\nto the class of thiazide diuretics. The combination of these substances with complementary \n\nmechanisms of action provides an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a \n\ngreater degree than either component alone. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAliskiren is an orally active, non-peptide, potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin. \n\n \n\nBy inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAAS at the point of activation, blocking the \n\nconversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and \n\nangiotensin II. Whereas other agents that inhibit the RAAS (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors \n\n(ACEI) and angiotension II receptor blockers (ARB)) cause a compensatory rise in plasma renin \n\nactivity (PRA), treatment with aliskiren decreases PRA in hypertensive patients by approximately 50 \n\nto 80%. Similar reductions were found when aliskiren was combined with other antihypertensive \n\nagents. The clinical implications of the effects on PRA are not known at the present time. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of aliskiren at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg \n\nprovided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained \n\nover the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a mean peak to \n\ntrough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose. 85 to 90% of the maximal blood-\n\npressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering effect was \n\nsustained during long-term treatment (12 months), and was independent of age, gender, body mass \n\nindex and ethnicity. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nCombination therapy studies are available for aliskiren added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the \n\ncalcium channel blocker amlodipine and the beta blocker atenolol. These combinations were \n\nefficacious and well tolerated. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of aliskiren-based therapy were compared to ramipril-based therapy in a 9-\n\nmonth non-inferiority study in 901 elderly patients (≥ 65 years) with essential systolic hypertension. \n\nAliskiren 150 mg or 300 mg per day or ramipril 5 mg or 10 mg per day were administered for \n\n36 weeks with optional add-on therapy of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) at week 12, and \n\namlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) at week 22. Over the 12 week period, aliskiren monotherapy lowered \n\nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure by 14.0/5.1 mmHg, compared to 11.6/3.6 mmHg for ramipril, \n\nconsistent with aliskiren being non-inferior to ramipril at the dosages chosen and the differences in \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significant. Tolerability was comparable in both \n\ntreatment arms, however cough was more often reported with the ramipril regimen than the aliskiren \n\nregimen (14.2% vs. 4.4%), whilst diarrhoea was more common with the aliskiren regimen than for the \n\nramipril regimen (6.6% vs. 5.0%). \n\n \n\nIn a 8-week study in 754 hypertensive elderly (≥ 65 years) and very elderly patients (30% ≥ 75 years) \n\naliskiren at doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg provided statistically significant superior reduction in \n\nblood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) when compared to placebo. No additional blood pressure \n\nlowering effect was detected with 300 mg aliskiren compared to 150 mg aliskiren. All three doses \n\nwere well tolerated in both elderly and very elderly patients. \n\n \n\nThere has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in \n\ncontrolled clinical studies. With cessation of treatment, blood pressure gradually returned towards \n\nbaseline levels over a period of several weeks, with no evidence of a rebound effect for blood pressure \n\nor PRA. \n\n \n\nIn a 36-week study involving 820 patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, no changes in \n\nventricular remodelling as assessed by left ventricular end systolic volume were detected with \n\naliskiren compared to placebo on top of background therapy. \n\n \n\nThe combined rates of cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, recurrent heart attack, \n\nstroke and resuscitated sudden death were similar in the aliskiren group and the placebo group. \n\nHowever, in patients receiving aliskiren there was a significantly higher rate of hyperkalaemia, \n\nhypotension and kidney dysfunction when compared to the placebo group. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was evaluated for cardiovascular and/or renal benefit in a double-blind placebo controlled \n\nrandomised trial in 8,606 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (evidenced by \n\nproteinuria and/or GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) with or without cardiovascular disease. In most patients \n\narterial blood pressure was well controlled at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of \n\ncardiovascular and renal complications. \n\n \n\nIn this study, aliskiren 300 mg was compared to placebo when added to standard of care which \n\nincluded either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. The \n\nstudy was discontinued prematurely because the participants were unlikely to benefit from aliskiren. \n\nPreliminary study results indicated a hazard ratio for the primary endpoint of 1.09 in favour of placebo \n\n(95% Confidence Interval: 0.97, 1.22, 2-sided p=0.17). In addition, an increased incidence of serious \n\nadverse outcomes was observed with aliskiren compared to placebo for renal complications (4.7% \n\nversus 3.3%), hyperkalaemia (36.9% versus 27.1%), hypotension (18.4% versus 14.6%) and stroke \n\n(2.7% versus 2.0%). The increased incidence of non-fatal stroke was greater in patients with renal \n\ninsufficiency. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nThe site of action of thiazide diuretics is primarily in the renal distal convoluted tubule. It has been \n\nshown that there is a high-affinity receptor in the renal cortex as the primary binding site for the \n\nthiazide diuretic action and inhibition of NaCl transport in the distal convoluted tubule. The mode of \n\naction of thiazides is through inhibition of the Na+Cl- symporter by competing for the Cl- site, thereby \n\naffecting electrolyte reabsorption mechanisms: directly increasing sodium and chloride excretion to an \n\napproximately equal extent, and indirectly by this diuretic action reducing plasma volume, with \n\nconsequent increases in plasma renin activity, aldosterone secretion and urinary potassium loss, and a \n\ndecrease in serum potassium. \n\n \n\nAliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nOver 3,900 hypertensive patients received Sprimeo HCT once daily in clinical trials. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of Sprimeo HCT provided dose-dependent \n\nreductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained over the entire 24-hour \n\ndose interval. The antihypertensive effect is largely manifested within 1 week and the maximum effect \n\nis generally seen within 4 weeks.The blood-pressure-lowering effect was sustained during long-term \n\ntreatment, and was independent of age, gender, body mass index and ethnicity. The antihypertensive \n\neffect of a single dose of the combination persisted for 24 hours. Upon withdrawal of the aliskiren \n\ntreatment (aliskiren with or without hydrochlorothiazide add-on), the return of blood pressure towards \n\nbaseline was gradual (3-4 weeks) with no evidence of the rebound effect. \n\n \n\nSprimeo HCT was studied in a placebo-controlled trial including 2,762 hypertensive patients with \n\ndiastolic blood pressure ≥ 95 mmHg and < 110 mmHg (mean baseline blood pressure of \n\n153.6/99.2 mmHg). In this study, Sprimeo HCT in doses from 150 mg/12.5 mg to 300 mg/25 mg \n\nproduced dose-dependent blood pressure reductions (systolic/diastolic) from 17.6/11.9 mmHg to \n\n21.2/14.3 mmHg, respectively, compared to 7.5/6.9 mmHg with placebo. The greater blood pressure \n\nreductions with these combination doses were also significantly greater than the respective doses of \n\naliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide when used alone. The combination of aliskiren and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide neutralised the reactive increase of PRA caused by hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nWhen administered in hypertensive patients with markedly elevated blood pressure (systolic blood \n\npressure ≥ 160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mmHg), Sprimeo HCT in doses from \n\n150 mg/12.5 mg to 300 mg/25 mg administered without up-titration from monotherapy demonstrated \n\nsignificantly greater systolic/diastolic blood pressure control rates (< 140/90 mmHg) as compared to \n\nthe respective monotherapies. In this population, Sprimeo HCT 150 mg/12.5 mg to 300 mg/25 mg \n\nprovided dose-dependent systolic/diastolic blood pressure reduction from 20.6/12.4 mmHg to \n\n24.8/14.5 mmHg, which were significantly superior to the respective monotherapies. The safety of the \n\ncombination therapy was similar to the respective monotherapies regardless of severity of \n\nhypertension or of the presence or absence of additional cardiovascular risk. Hypotension and related \n\nadverse events were uncommon with the combination treatment, with no increased incidence in \n\nelderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn a study in 880 randomised patients not adequately responsive to aliskiren 300 mg treatment, the \n\ncombination of aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg produced systolic/diastolic blood \n\npressure reductions of 15.8/11.0 mmHg, which were significantly greater than aliskiren 300 mg \n\nmonotherapy. In a study in 722 randomised patients not adequately responsive to hydrochlorothiazide \n\n25 mg treatment, the combination of aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg produced \n\nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure reductions of 16.78/10.7 mmHg, which were significantly greater \n\nthan hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg monotherapy. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nIn another clinical trial, the efficacy and safety of Sprimeo HCT were also assessed in 489 obese \n\nhypertensive patients who did not respond to hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (baseline systolic/diastolic \n\nblood pressure 149.4/96.8 mmHg). In this difficult-to-treat population, Sprimeo HCT provided a blood \n\npressure reduction (systolic/diastolic) of 15.8/11.9 mmHg compared to 15.4/11.3 mmHg for \n\nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 13.6/10.3 mmHg for amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide and \n\n8.6/7.9 mmHg for hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy, with similar safety to hydrochlorothiazide \n\nmonotherapy. \n\n \n\nIn a study in 183 randomised patients with severe hypertension (mean sitting diastolic blood pressure \n\n≥ 105 and < 120 mmHg), aliskiren treatment regimen with optional addition of hydrochlorothiazide \n\n25 mg was shown to be safe and efficacious in reducing blood pressure. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral absorption, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours. The \n\nabsolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3%. Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax \n\nby 85% and AUC by 70%. Steady-state-plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days following \n\nonce-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than with the initial \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is approximately \n\n135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space. Aliskiren \n\nplasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. \n\n \n\nMetabolism and elimination \n\nThe mean half-life is about 40 hours (range 34-41 hours). Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as unchanged \n\ncompound in the faeces (oral radioactive dose recovery = 91%). Approximately 1.4% of the total oral \n\ndose is metabolised. The enzyme responsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4. Approximately 0.6% of \n\nthe dose is recovered in urine following oral administration. Following intravenous administration, the \n\nmean plasma clearance is approximately 9 l/h. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nExposure to aliskiren increased slightly more than in proportion to the increase in dose. After single \n\ndose administration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and \n\n2.6-fold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively. Mechanisms responsible for the deviation from dose \n\nproportionality have not been identified. A possible mechanism is saturation of transporters at the \n\nabsorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe absorption of hydrochlorothiazide, after an oral dose, is rapid (Tmax about 2 h). The increase in \n\nmean AUC is linear and dose proportional in the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\nThe effect of food on hydrochlorothiazide absorption, if any, has little clinical significance. Absolute \n\nbioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide is 70% after oral administration. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe apparent volume of distribution is 4-8 l/kg. Circulating hydrochlorothiazide is bound to serum \n\nproteins (40-70%), mainly serum albumin. Hydrochlorothiazide also accumulates in erythrocytes at \n\napproximately 3 times the level in plasma. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\nMetabolism and elimination \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is eliminated predominantly as unchanged compound. Hydrochlorothiazide is \n\neliminated from plasma with a half-life averaging 6 to 15 hours in the terminal elimination phase. \n\nThere is no change in the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on repeated dosing, and accumulation is \n\nminimal when dosed once daily. There is more than 95% of the absorbed dose being excreted as \n\nunchanged compound in the urine. The renal clearance is composed of passive filtration and active \n\nsecretion into the renal tubule. \n\n \n\nAliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nFollowing oral administration of Sprimeo HCT tablets, the median peak plasma concentration time is \n\nwithin 1 hour for aliskiren and 2.5 hours for hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nThe rate and extent of absorption of Sprimeo HCT are equivalent to the bioavailability of aliskiren and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide when administered as individual monotherapies. Similar food effect was observed \n\nfor Sprimeo HCT as for the individual monotherapies. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in patients \n\nSprimeo HCT has been shown to be effective as a once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult \n\npatients, regardless of gender, age, body mass index and ethnicity. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren are not significantly affected in patients with mild to moderate liver \n\ndisease. Consequently, no initial dose adjustment of Sprimeo HCT is required in patients with mild to \n\nmoderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on patients with severe hepatic impairment treated \n\nby Sprimeo HCT. Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.4). In the presence of renal impairment, mean peak plasma levels and AUC values \n\nof hydrochlorothiazide are increased and the urinary excretion rate is reduced. In patients with mild to \n\nmoderate renal impairment, a 3-fold increase in hydrochlorothiazide AUC has been observed. In \n\npatients with severe renal impairment an 8-fold increase in AUC has been observed. Sprimeo HCT is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with anuria or severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and the \n\nconcomitant use of Sprimeo HCT with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with renal \n\nimpairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease receiving \n\nhaemodialysis. Administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg aliskiren was associated with very \n\nminor changes in the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren (change in Cmax of less than 1.2 fold; increase in \n\nAUC of up to 1.6 fold) compared to matched healthy subjects. Timing of haemodialysis did not \n\nsignificantly alter the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren in ESRD patients. Therefore, if administration of \n\naliskiren in ESRD patients receiving haemodialysis is considered necessary, no dose adjustment is \n\nwarranted in these patients. However, the use of aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nNo initial dose adjustment of Sprimeo HCT is required in elderly patients. Limited data suggest that \n\nthe systemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and hypertensive elderly \n\nsubjects compared to young healthy volunteers. \n\n \n\nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nSafety pharmacology studies with aliskiren did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous, \n\nrespiratory or cardiovascular function. Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were \n\nconsistent with the known local irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of \n\naliskiren. No carcinogenic potential for aliskiren was detected in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month \n\ntransgenic mouse study. One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded in rats at the \n\ndose of 1,500 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. Aliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic \n\npotential, embryo-foetal toxicity or teratogenicity. Fertility, prenatal development and postnatal \n\ndevelopment were unaffected in rats. \n\n \n\nPreclinical evaluations to support the administration of hydrochlorothiazide in humans included in \n\nvitro genotoxicity assays and reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in rodents. Extensive \n\nclinical data are available for hydrochlorothiazide and these are reflected in the relevant sections. \n\n \n\nThe findings observed in the 2-week and 13-week toxicity studies were consistent with those observed \n\npreviously with aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapies. There were no new or unexpected \n\nfindings observed of relevance to human use. Increased cellular vacuolation of the adrenal gland zona \n\nglomerulosa was observed during the 13-week toxicity study in rats. The finding was observed in \n\nanimals treated with hydrochlorothiazide but not in those animals receiving aliskiren alone or vehicle. \n\nThere was no evidence that this finding was enhanced in the aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide \n\ncombination as it was only apparent at a minimal severity in all animals. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Grapefruit juice should not be taken \n\ntogether with Sprimeo HCT. \n\n \n\nThe antihypertensive effect is largely manifested within 1 week and the maximum effect is generally \n\nseen within 4 weeks. \n\n \n\nPosology in patients not adequately controlled with aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy \n\nIndividual dose titration with each of the two components may be recommended before changing to \n\nthe fixed combination. When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy to the fixed \n\ncombination may be considered. \n\n \n\nSprimeo HCT 150 mg /25 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \n\ncontrolled with aliskiren 150 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg alone or by Sprimeo HCT \n\n150 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n \n\nIf blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 2-4 weeks of therapy, the dose may be titrated up to a \n\nmaximum of Sprimeo HCT 300 mg/25 mg daily. Dosing should be individualised and adjusted \n\naccording to the patient’s clinical response. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nPosology as substitution therapy \n\nFor convenience, patients receiving aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide from separate tablets may be \n\nswitched to a fixed combination tablet of Sprimeo HCT containing the same component doses. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 5.2). Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated for \n\nuse in patients with anuria and in patients with severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n\n(GFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). The concomitant use of Sprimeo HCT with angiotensin II receptor \n\nblockers (ARB) or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) is contraindicated in patients \n\nwith renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment \n\n(see section 5.2). Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see \n\nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nElderly patients (over 65 years) \n\nThe recommended starting dose of aliskiren in elderly patients is 150 mg. No clinically meaningful \n\nadditional blood pressure reduction is observed by increasing the dose to 300 mg in the majority of \n\nelderly patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients \n\nSprimeo HCT is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below age 18 due to a lack of \n\ndata on safety and efficacy (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1), or to other \nsulphonamide-derived substances. \n\n History of angioedema with aliskiren. \n\n Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema. \n\n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\n Anuria. \n\n Severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n Refractory hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia and symptomatic hyperuricaemia. \n\n Severe hepatic impairment. \n\n The concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin and itraconazole, two highly potent P-\nglycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, and other potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. quinidine), is \n\ncontraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\n The concomitant use of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with \ndiabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n\n2\n) (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and \n\n5.1). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nHypotension, syncope, stroke, hyperkalaemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal \n\nfailure) have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that \n\naffect this system (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by \n\ncombining aliskiren with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blocker (ARB) is therefore not recommended. \n\n \n\nThe use of aliskiren in combination with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\nHeart failure \n\nAliskiren should be used with caution in patients with serious congestive heart failure (New York \n\nHeart Association (NYHA) functional class III-IV). Sprimeo HCT should be used with caution in \n\npatients with heart failure due to limited clinical efficacy and safety data. \n\n \n\nAngioedema \n\nAs with other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, angioedema or symptoms suggestive of \n\nangioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or tongue) have been reported in patients treated \n\nwith aliskiren. \n\n \n\nA number of these patients had a history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema, \n\nwhich in some cases followed use of other medicines that can cause angioedema, including RAAS \n\nblockers (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nPatients with a history of angioedema may be at increased risk of experiencing angioedema during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Caution should therefore be exercised when \n\nprescribing aliskiren to patients with a history of angioedema, and such patients should be closely \n\nmonitored during treatment (see section 4.8) especially at the beginning of the treatment. \n\n \n\nIf angioedema occurs, Sprimeo HCT should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and \n\nmonitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. \n\nWhere there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx adrenaline should be administered. In \n\naddition, measures necessary to maintain patent airways should be provided. \n\n \n\nSodium- and/or volume-depleted patients \n\nIn sodium-depleted and/or volume-depleted patients, such as those receiving high doses of diuretics, \n\nsymptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Sprimeo HCT. Sprimeo HCT \n\nshould be used only after correction of any pre-existing sodium and/or volume depletion. \n\n \n\nElectrolyte imbalance \n\nTreatment with Sprimeo HCT should only start after correction of hypokalaemia and any coexisting \n\nhypomagnesaemia. Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hypokalaemia or exacerbate pre-\n\nexisting hypokalaemia. Thiazide diuretics should be administered with caution in patients with \n\nconditions involving enhanced potassium loss, for example salt-losing nephropathies and prerenal \n\n(cardiogenic) impairment of kidney function. If hypokalaemia develops during hydrochlorothiazide \n\ntherapy Sprimeo HCT should be discontinued until stable correction of the potassium balance. \n\nAlthough hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with \n\naliskiren may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greater in patients \n\nwith cirrhosis of the liver, patients experiencing brisk diuresis, patients with inadequate oral \n\nelectrolyte intake and patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or \n\nadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nConversely, increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in post-marketing \n\nexperience and these may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or \n\nby non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Consistent with standard medical practice, \n\nperiodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is advised if co-administration is \n\nconsidered necessary. The concomitant use of aliskiren and ACEIs or ARBs is contraindicated in \n\npatients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.3, 4.5 \n\nand 4.8). \n\n \n\nThiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hyponatraemia and hypochloroaemic alkalosis or \n\nexacerbate pre-existing hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia, accompanied by neurological symptoms \n\n(nausea, progressive disorientation, apathy) has been observed. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide \n\nshould only be started after correction of pre-existing hyponatraemia. In case severe or rapid \n\nhyponatraemia develops during Sprimeo HCT therapy, the treatment should be discontinued until \n\nnormalisation of natraemia. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\nThere is no evidence that Sprimeo HCT would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. \n\nChloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \n\n \n\nAll patients receiving thiazide diuretics should be periodically monitored for imbalances in \n\nelectrolytes, particularly potassium, sodium and magnesium. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \n\nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Sprimeo HCT is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-\n\nexisting hypercalcaemia. Sprimeo HCT should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during \n\ntreatment. Serum levels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. \n\nMarked hypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be \n\ndiscontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation \n\nThiazide diuretics may precipitate azotaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. When Sprimeo \n\nHCT is used in patients with renal impairment, periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes including \n\npotassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment or anuria (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (GFR \n\n≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). \n\n \n\nThere is no experience regarding the administration of Sprimeo HCT in patients who have recently \n\nundergone kidney transplantation. \n\n \n\nAs for other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, caution should be exercised when aliskiren \n\nis given in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction such as hypovolaemia (e.g. \n\ndue to blood loss, severe or prolonged diarrhoea, prolonged vomiting, etc.), heart disease, liver \n\ndisease, diabetes mellitus or kidney disease. The concomitant use of aliskiren and ACEIs or ARBs is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Acute renal failure, \n\nreversible upon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients receiving aliskiren in \n\npost-marketing experience. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, aliskiren should be \n\npromptly discontinued. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver \n\ndisease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. No \n\nadjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. No \n\ndata are available for the use of Sprimeo HCT in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Due to the \n\nhydrochlorothiazide component, Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nThere is no clinical experience with Sprimeo HCT in patients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nModerate P-gp inhibitors \n\nCo-administration of aliskiren 300 mg with ketoconazole 200 mg or verapamil 240 mg resulted in a \n\n76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. Therefore caution should be exercised when \n\naliskiren is administered with moderate P-gp inhibitors such as ketoconazole or verapamil (see section \n\n4.5). \n\n \n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \n\nAs with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral \n\nstenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\nRenal artery stenosis and renovascular hypertension \n\nNo controlled clinical data are available on the use of Sprimeo HCT in patients with unilateral or \n\nbilateral renal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, as with other agents acting on \n\nthe renin-angiotensin system, there is an increased risk of renal insufficiency, including acute renal \n\nfailure, when patients with renal artery stenosis are treated with aliskiren. Therefore caution should be \n\nexercised in these patients. If renal failure occurs, treatment should be discontinued. \n\n \n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, have been reported to exacerbate or activate \n\nsystemic lupus erythematosus. \n\n \n\nMetabolic and endocrine effects \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels \n\nof cholesterol and triglycerides, and uric acid. In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral \n\nhypoglycaemic agents may be required. Concomitant use of Sprimeo HCT with ARBs or ACEIs is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated in symptomatic \n\nhyperuricaemia (see section 4.3). Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to \n\nreduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricaemia as well as precipitate gout \n\nin susceptible patients. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \n\nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Sprimeo HCT is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-\n\nexisting hypercalcaemia. Sprimeo HCT should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during \n\ntreatment. Serum levels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. \n\nMarked hypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be \n\ndiscontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nPhotosensitivity \n\nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If \n\nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Sprimeo HCT, it is recommended to stop the \n\ntreatment. If a re-administration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect \n\nexposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA. \n\n \n\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma \n\nHydrochlorothiazide, a sulphonamide, has been associated with an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in \n\nacute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased \n\nvisual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of treatment initiation. \n\nUntreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to \n\ndiscontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatment may need \n\nto be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute \n\nangle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulphonamide or penicillin allergy. \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\nIn the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea, Sprimeo HCT therapy should be stopped. \n\n \n\nAs with any antihypertensive agent, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with ischaemic \n\ncardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients, but are more likely in patients \n\nwith allergy and asthma. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\nExcipients \n\nSprimeo HCT contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the \n\nLapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\nSprimeo HCT contains wheat starch. It is suitable for people with coeliac disease. Patients with wheat \n\nallergy (different from coeliac disease) should not take this medicine. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nInformation on Sprimeo HCT interactions \n\nMedicinal products affecting serum potassium levels: The potassium-depleting effect of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide is attenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of aliskiren. However, this effect of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal \n\nproducts associated with potassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, \n\ncorticosteroids, laxatives, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), amphotericin, carbenoxolone, \n\npenicillin G, salicylic acid derivatives). Conversely, concomitant use of other agents affecting the \n\nRAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum potassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, \n\npotassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum \n\npotassium. If co-medication with an agent affecting the level of serum potassium is considered \n\nnecessary, caution is advisable. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated \n\nin patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not \n\nrecommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: Periodic monitoring of serum \n\npotassium is recommended when Sprimeo HCT is administered with medicinal products affected by \n\nserum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). \n\n \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors \n\n(COX-2 inhibitors), acetylsalicylic acid and non-selective NSAIDs: As with other agents acting on the \n\nrenin-angiotensin system, NSAIDs may reduce the anti-hypertensive effect of aliskiren. NSAIDs may \n\nalso weaken the diuretic and antihypertensive activity of hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nIn some patients with compromised renal function (dehydrated patients or elderly patients) aliskiren \n\nand hydrochlorothiazide given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in further deterioration of renal \n\nfunction, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore the use of \n\nSprimeo HCT with an NSAID requires caution, especially in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nOther antihypertensive agents: The antihypertensive effect of Sprimeo HCT may be increased with \n\nthe concomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. \n\n \n\nAdditional information on aliskiren interactions \n\nThe combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus \n\nor renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see \n\nsections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nCompounds that have been investigated in aliskiren clinical pharmacokinetic studies include \n\nacenocoumarol, atenolol, celecoxib, fenofibrate, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate, \n\ndigoxin, metformin, amlodipine, atorvastatin, cimetidine and hydrochlorothiazide. No clinically \n\nrelevant interactions have been identified. As a result no dose adjustment for aliskiren or these co-\n\nadministered medicinal products is necessary. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\nP-glycoprotein interactions: MDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system \n\ninvolved in intestinal absorption and biliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies. Rifampicin, \n\nwhich is an inducer of P-gp, reduced aliskiren bioavailability by approximately 50% in a clinical \n\nstudy. Other inducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort) might decrease the bioavailability of aliskiren. \n\nAlthough this has not been investigated for aliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake \n\nof a variety of substrates and P-gp inhibitors can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. \n\nTherefore, P-gp inhibitors may increase tissue levels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug \n\ninteractions at the P-gp site will likely depend on the degree of inhibition of this transporter. \n\n \n\nP-gp potent inhibitors: A single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that \n\nciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) increases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC \n\napproximately 5-fold. The increase may be higher with higher aliskiren doses. In healthy subjects, \n\nitraconazole (100 mg) increases AUC and Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, \n\nrespectively. Therefore, concomitant use of aliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nModerate P-gp inhibitors: Co-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) or verapamil (240 mg) with \n\naliskiren (300 mg) resulted in a 76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. The change in \n\nplasma levels of aliskiren in the presence of ketoconazole or verapamil is expected to be within the \n\nrange that would be achieved if the dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or \n\ntwice the highest recommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled \n\nclinical trials. Preclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances \n\naliskiren gastrointestinal absorption and decreases biliary excretion. Therefore, caution should be \n\nexercised when aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole, verapamil or other moderate P-gp \n\ninhibitors (clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). \n\n \n\nP-gp substrates or weak inhibitors: No relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or \n\ncimetidine have been observed. When administered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren \n\n(300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. \n\n \n\nOrganic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors: Preclinical studies indicate that aliskiren \n\nmight be a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptides. Therefore, the potential exists for \n\ninteractions between OATP inhibitors and aliskiren when administered concomitantly (see interaction \n\nwith Grapefruit juice). \n\n \n\nGrapefruit juice: Administration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and \n\nCmax of aliskiren. Co-administration with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren \n\nAUC and co-administration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. This \n\ndecrease is likely due to an inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of \n\naliskiren by grapefruit juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic \n\nfailure, grapefruit juice should not be taken together with Sprimeo HCT. \n\n \n\nFurosemide: When aliskiren was co-administered with furosemide, the AUC and Cmax of furosemide \n\nwere reduced by 28% and 49%, respectively. It is therefore recommended to monitor the effects when \n\ninitiating and adjusting furosemide therapy to avoid possible underutilisation in clinical situations of \n\nvolume overload. \n\n \n\nWarfarin: The effects of aliskiren on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. \n\n \n\nFood interactions: Meals with a high fat content have been shown to reduce the absorption of aliskiren \n\nsubstantially. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\nAdditional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions \n\nWhen administered concurrently, the following medicinal products may interact with thiazide \n\ndiuretics: \n\n \n\nLithium: Renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, therefore the risk of lithium toxicity may \n\nbe increased with hydrochlorothiazide. Co-administration of lithium and hydrochlorothiazide is not \n\nrecommended. If this combination proves essential, careful monitoring of serum lithium level is \n\nrecommended during concomitant use. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products that could induce torsades de pointes: Due to the risk of hypokalaemia, \n\nhydrochlorothiazide should be administered with caution when associated with medicinal products \n\nthat could induce torsades de pointes, in particular Class Ia and Class III antiarrhythmics and some \n\nantipsychotics. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affecting serum sodium level: The hyponatraemic effect of diuretics may be \n\nintensified by concomitant administration of medicinal products such as antidepressants, \n\nantipsychotics, antiepileptics, etc. Caution is indicated in long-term administration of these medicinal \n\nproducts. \n\n \n\nPressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline, adrenaline): Hydrochlorothiazide may reduce the response to \n\npressor amines such as noradrenaline. The clinical significance of this effect is uncertain and not \n\nsufficient to preclude their use. \n\n \n\nDigoxine or other digitalis glycosides: Thiazide-induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia may \n\noccur as undesirable effects, favouring the onset of digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias. \n\n \n\nVitamin D and calcium salts: Administration of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, with \n\nvitamin D or with calcium salts may potentiate the rise in serum calcium. Concomitant use of thiazide \n\ntype diuretics may lead to hypercalcaemia in patients pre-disposed for hypercalcaemia (e.g. \n\nhyperparathyroidism, malignancy, or vitamin-D-mediated conditions) by increasing tubular calcium \n\nreabsorption. \n\n \n\nAntidiabetic agents (e.g. insulin and oral antidiabetic agents): Thiazides may alter glucose tolerance. \n\nDose adjustment of the antidiabetic medicinal product may be necessary (see section 4.4). Metformin \n\nshould be used with caution because of the risk of lactic acidosis induced by possible functional renal \n\nfailure linked to hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nBeta blockers and diazoxide: Concomitant use of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, \n\nwith beta blockers may increase the risk of hyperglycaemia. Thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, may enhance the hyperglycaemic effect of diazoxide. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products used in the treatment of gout: Dose adjustment of uricosuric medicinal products \n\nmay be necessary as hydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase of dose of \n\nprobenecid or sulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, may increase the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol. \n\n \n\nAnticholinergic agents and other medicinal products affecting gastric motility: The bioavailability of \n\nthiazide-type diuretics may be increased by anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, biperiden), \n\napparently due to a decrease in gastrointestinal motility and the stomach emptying rate. Conversely, it \n\nis anticipated that prokinetic substances such as cisapride may decrease the bioavailability of thiazide-\n\ntype diuretics. \n\n \n\nAmantadine: Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may increase the risk of adverse reactions \n\ncaused by amantadine. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\nIon exchange resins: Absorption of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, is decreased by \n\ncholestyramine or colestipol. This could result in sub-therapeutic effects of thiazide diuretics. \n\nHowever, staggering the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and resin such that hydrochlorothiazide is \n\nadministered at least 4 hours before or 4-6 hours after the administration of resins would potentially \n\nminimise the interaction. \n\n \n\nCytotoxic agents: Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may reduce the renal excretion of \n\ncytotoxic agents (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their myelosuppressive effects. \n\n \n\nNon-depolarising skeletal muscle relaxants: Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, potentiate the \n\naction of skeletal muscle relaxants such as curare derivatives. \n\n \n\nAlcohol, barbiturates or narcotics: Concomitant administration of thiazide diuretics with subtances \n\nthat also have a blood pressure lowering effect (e.g. by reducing sympathetic central nervous system \n\nactivity or direct vasodilatation) may potentiate orthostatic hypotension. \n\n \n\nMethyldopa: There have been isolated reports of haemolytic anaemia occurring with concomitant use \n\nof hydrochlorothiazide and methyldopa. \n\n \n\nIodine contrasting agents: In case of diuretic-induced dehydration, there is an increased risk of acute \n\nrenal failure, especially with high doses of iodine products. Patients should be rehydrated before \n\nadministration. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women. Aliskiren was not teratogenic in rats or \n\nrabbits (see section 5.3). Other substances that act directly on the RAAS have been associated with \n\nserious foetal malformations and neonatal death when used during second and third trimesters. There \n\nis limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. \n\nAnimal studies are insufficient. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the pharmacological mechanism of action of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, its use during the second and third trimester may compromise foeto-placental \n\nperfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and \n\nthrombocytopenia. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or \n\npre-eclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a \n\nbeneficial effect on the course of the disease. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare \n\nsituations where no other treatment could be used. \n\n \n\nNo specific clinical studies have been performed with this combination, therefore Sprimeo HCT \n\nshould not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy or in women planning to become pregnant \n\nand is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). A switch to a suitable \n\nalternative treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy. If pregnancy is detected \n\nduring therapy, Sprimeo HCT should be discontinued as soon as possible. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether aliskiren is excreted in human milk. Aliskiren was secreted in the milk of \n\nlactating rats. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \n\nintense diuresis can inhibit milk production. \n\n \n\nThe use of Sprimeo HCT during breast-feeding is not recommended. If Sprimeo HCT is used during \n\nbreast-feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nNo studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Sprimeo HCT \n\nis unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use machines. However, when driving vehicles or \n\noperating machinery it must be borne in mind that dizziness or drowsiness may occasionally occur \n\nwhen taking antihypertensive therapy. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nAliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide combination \n\nThe safety of Sprimeo HCT has been evaluated in 9 clinical trials with more than 3,900 patients, \n\nincluding over 700 treated for over 6 months, and 190 for over 1 year. The incidence of adverse \n\nreactions showed no association with gender, age, body mass index, race or ethnicity. Treatment with \n\nSprimeo HCT had an overall incidence of adverse experiences at doses up to 300 mg/25 mg similar to \n\nplacebo. Adverse reactions have generally been mild and transient in nature and have only \n\ninfrequently required discontinuation of therapy. The most common adverse drug reaction observed \n\nwith Sprimeo HCT is diarrhoea. The adverse drug reactions previously reported with one of the \n\nindividual components of Sprimeo HCT (aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide) and listed in the \n\nrespective paragraphs on the individual components may occur with Sprimeo HCT. \n\n \n\nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: very \n\ncommon (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n\n< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Common: Diarrhoea \n\n \n\nDiarrhoea: Diarrhoea is a dose-related adverse drug reaction for aliskiren. In controlled clinical trials, \n\nthe incidence of diarrhoea in Sprimeo HCT-treated patients was 1.3% compared to 1.4% for aliskiren- \n\nor 1.9% for hydrochlorothiazide-treated patients. \n\n \n\nSerum potassium: In a large placebo-controlled clinical trial, the opposite effects of aliskiren (150 mg \n\nor 300 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) on serum potassium approximately balanced \n\neach other in many patients. In other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Periodic \n\ndeterminations of serum potassium to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed in \n\npatients at risk at appropriate intervals (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nAdditional information on individual components \n\nOther adverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components may occur with \n\nSprimeo HCT even if not observed in clinical trials. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nTreatment with Aliskiren up to 300 mg resulted in an overall incidence of adverse reactions similar to \n\nplacebo. Adverse reactions have generally been mild and transient in nature and have only \n\ninfrequently required discontinuation of therapy. The most common adverse drug reaction is \n\ndiarrhoea. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\nThe known aliskiren adverse drug reactions are presented in the table below using the same \n\nconvention as described previously for the fixed combination. \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common: Dizziness \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Uncommon: Hypotension \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Common: Diarrhoea \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n Rare: Hypersensitivity reactions \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Uncommon: Rash, severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including toxic \n\nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) and oral mucosal reactions \n\n Rare: Angioedema \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\n Common: Arthralgia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n Uncommon: Acute renal failure, renal impairment \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n Uncommon: Oedema peripheral \n\nInvestigations \n Common: Hyperkalaemia \n\n Rare: Haemoglobin decreased, haematocrit decreased \n\n Rare: Blood creatinine increased \n\n \n\nAngioedema and hypersensitivity reactions have occurred during treatment with aliskiren. In \n\ncontrolled clinical trials, angioedema and hypersensitivity reactions occurred rarely during treatment \n\nwith aliskiren with rates comparable to treatment with placebo or comparators. \n\n \n\nCases of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or \n\ntongue) have also been reported in post-marketing experience. A number of these patients had a \n\nhistory of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema which in some cases was associated \n\nwith the administration of other medicines known to cause angioedema, including RAAS blockers \n\n(ACE inhibitors or ARBs). \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions have also been reported in post-marketing experience. \n\n \n\nIn the event of any signs suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction/angioedema (in particular difficulties \n\nin breathing or swallowing, rash, itching, hives or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/or \n\ntongue, dizziness) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nArthralgia has been reported in post-marketing experience. In some cases this occurred as part of a \n\nhypersensitivity reaction. \n\n \n\nHaemoglobin and haematocrit: Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of \n\napproximately 0.05 mmol/l and 0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed. No patients \n\ndiscontinued therapy due to anaemia. This effect is also seen with other agents acting on the renin-\n\nangiotensin system, such as ACEI and ARBs. \n\n \n\nSerum potassium: Increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren and these may be \n\nexacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by NSAIDs. Consistent with \n\nstandard medical practice, periodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is \n\nadvised if co-administration is considered necessary. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or \n\nACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR \n\n< 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, renal dysfunction and cases of acute renal failure have been reported in \n\npatients at risk (see section 4.4). There have also been reports of peripheral oedema, increase in blood \n\ncreatinine and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including toxic epidermal necrolysis \n\n(TEN) and oral mucosal reactions. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nHydrochlorothiazide has been extensively prescribed for many years, frequently in higher doses than \n\nthose contained in Sprimeo HCT. The following adverse reactions have been reported in patients \n\ntreated with thiazide diuretics alone, including hydrochlorothiazide: \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\n Rare: Thrombocytopenia sometimes with purpura \n\n Very rare: Agranulocytosis, bone marrow depression, haemolytic anaemia, \n\nleucopenia \n\n Not known: Aplastic anaemia \nImmune system disorders \n\n Very rare: Hypersensitivity \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\n Very common: Hypokalaemia \n\n Common: Hyperuricaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hyponatraemia \n\n Rare: Hypercalcaemia, hyperglycaemia, worsening of diabetic metabolic \n\nstate \n\n Very rare: Hypochloraemic alkalosis \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\n Rare: Depression, sleep disturbances \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Rare: Dizziness, headache, paraesthesia \n\nEye disorders \n\n Rare: Visual impairment \n\n Not known: Acute angle-closure glaucoma \n\nCardiac disorders \n\n Rare: Cardiac arrhythmias \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Common: Orthostatic hypotension \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\n Very rare: Respiratory distress (including pneumonitis and pulmonary oedema) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Common: Decreased appetite, mild nausea and vomiting \n\n Rare: Abdominal discomfort, constipation, diarrhoea \n\n Very rare: Pancreatitis \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\n Rare: Intrahepatic cholestasis, jaundice \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Common: Urticaria and other forms of rash \n\n Rare: Photosensitivity reactions \n\n Very rare: Cutaneous lupus erythematosus-like reactions, reactivation of \n\ncutaneous lupus erythematosus, vasculitis necrotising and toxic \n\nepidermal necrolysis \n\n Not known: Erythema multiforme \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\n Not known: Muscle spasm \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\n Not known: Renal dysfunction, acute renal failure \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\n \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\n Common: Impotence \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n Not known: Asthenia, pyrexia \n\nInvestigations \n\n Very common: Increases in cholesterol and triglycerides \n\n Rare: Glycosuria \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nNo information is available on the treatment of overdose with Sprimeo HCT. The most likely \n\nmanifestation of overdose would be hypotension, related to the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren. \n\n \n\nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \n\nhypochloraemia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most \n\ncommon signs and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in \n\nmuscle spasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \n\nglycosides or certain antiarrhythmic medicinal products. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, \n\nsupportive treatment should be initiated. \n\n \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis, dialysis \n\nclearance of aliskiren was low (< 2% of oral clearance). Therefore dialysis is not adequate to treat \n\naliskiren over-exposure. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Renin inhibitor (aliskiren) combinations with diuretics \n\n(hydrochlorothiazide), ATC code: C09XA52 \n\nSprimeo HCT combines two antihypertensive compounds to control blood pressure in patients with \n\nessential hypertension: Aliskiren belongs to the class of direct renin inhibitors and hydrochlorothiazide \n\nto the class of thiazide diuretics. The combination of these substances with complementary \n\nmechanisms of action provides an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a \n\ngreater degree than either component alone. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAliskiren is an orally active, non-peptide, potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin. \n\n \n\nBy inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAAS at the point of activation, blocking the \n\nconversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and \n\nangiotensin II. Whereas other agents that inhibit the RAAS (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors \n\n(ACEI) and angiotension II receptor blockers (ARB)) cause a compensatory rise in plasma renin \n\nactivity (PRA), treatment with aliskiren decreases PRA in hypertensive patients by approximately 50 \n\nto 80%. Similar reductions were found when aliskiren was combined with other antihypertensive \n\nagents. The clinical implications of the effects on PRA are not known at the present time. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of aliskiren at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg \n\nprovided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained \n\nover the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a mean peak to \n\ntrough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose. 85 to 90% of the maximal blood-\n\npressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering effect was \n\nsustained during long-term treatment (12 months), and was independent of age, gender, body mass \n\nindex and ethnicity. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\nCombination therapy studies are available for aliskiren added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the \n\ncalcium channel blocker amlodipine and the beta blocker atenolol. These combinations were \n\nefficacious and well tolerated. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of aliskiren-based therapy were compared to ramipril-based therapy in a 9-\n\nmonth non-inferiority study in 901 elderly patients (≥ 65 years) with essential systolic hypertension. \n\nAliskiren 150 mg or 300 mg per day or ramipril 5 mg or 10 mg per day were administered for \n\n36 weeks with optional add-on therapy of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) at week 12, and \n\namlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) at week 22. Over the 12 week period, aliskiren monotherapy lowered \n\nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure by 14.0/5.1 mmHg, compared to 11.6/3.6 mmHg for ramipril, \n\nconsistent with aliskiren being non-inferior to ramipril at the dosages chosen and the differences in \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significant. Tolerability was comparable in both \n\ntreatment arms, however cough was more often reported with the ramipril regimen than the aliskiren \n\nregimen (14.2% vs. 4.4%), whilst diarrhoea was more common with the aliskiren regimen than for the \n\nramipril regimen (6.6% vs. 5.0%). \n\n \n\nIn a 8-week study in 754 hypertensive elderly (≥ 65 years) and very elderly patients (30% ≥ 75 years) \n\naliskiren at doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg provided statistically significant superior reduction in \n\nblood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) when compared to placebo. No additional blood pressure \n\nlowering effect was detected with 300 mg aliskiren compared to 150 mg aliskiren. All three doses \n\nwere well tolerated in both elderly and very elderly patients. \n\n \n\nThere has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in \n\ncontrolled clinical studies. With cessation of treatment, blood pressure gradually returned towards \n\nbaseline levels over a period of several weeks, with no evidence of a rebound effect for blood pressure \n\nor PRA. \n\n \n\nIn a 36-week study involving 820 patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, no changes in \n\nventricular remodelling as assessed by left ventricular end systolic volume were detected with \n\naliskiren compared to placebo on top of background therapy. \n\n \n\nThe combined rates of cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, recurrent heart attack, \n\nstroke and resuscitated sudden death were similar in the aliskiren group and the placebo group. \n\nHowever, in patients receiving aliskiren there was a significantly higher rate of hyperkalaemia, \n\nhypotension and kidney dysfunction when compared to the placebo group. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was evaluated for cardiovascular and/or renal benefit in a double-blind placebo controlled \n\nrandomised trial in 8,606 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (evidenced by \n\nproteinuria and/or GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) with or without cardiovascular disease. In most patients \n\narterial blood pressure was well controlled at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of \n\ncardiovascular and renal complications. \n\n \n\nIn this study, aliskiren 300 mg was compared to placebo when added to standard of care which \n\nincluded either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. The \n\nstudy was discontinued prematurely because the participants were unlikely to benefit from aliskiren. \n\nPreliminary study results indicated a hazard ratio for the primary endpoint of 1.09 in favour of placebo \n\n(95% Confidence Interval: 0.97, 1.22, 2-sided p=0.17). In addition, an increased incidence of serious \n\nadverse outcomes was observed with aliskiren compared to placebo for renal complications (4.7% \n\nversus 3.3%), hyperkalaemia (36.9% versus 27.1%), hypotension (18.4% versus 14.6%) and stroke \n\n(2.7% versus 2.0%). The increased incidence of non-fatal stroke was greater in patients with renal \n\ninsufficiency. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nThe site of action of thiazide diuretics is primarily in the renal distal convoluted tubule. It has been \n\nshown that there is a high-affinity receptor in the renal cortex as the primary binding site for the \n\nthiazide diuretic action and inhibition of NaCl transport in the distal convoluted tubule. The mode of \n\naction of thiazides is through inhibition of the Na+Cl- symporter by competing for the Cl- site, thereby \n\naffecting electrolyte reabsorption mechanisms: directly increasing sodium and chloride excretion to an \n\napproximately equal extent, and indirectly by this diuretic action reducing plasma volume, with \n\nconsequent increases in plasma renin activity, aldosterone secretion and urinary potassium loss, and a \n\ndecrease in serum potassium. \n\n \n\nAliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nOver 3,900 hypertensive patients received Sprimeo HCT once daily in clinical trials. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of Sprimeo HCT provided dose-dependent \n\nreductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained over the entire 24-hour \n\ndose interval. The antihypertensive effect is largely manifested within 1 week and the maximum effect \n\nis generally seen within 4 weeks.The blood-pressure-lowering effect was sustained during long-term \n\ntreatment, and was independent of age, gender, body mass index and ethnicity. The antihypertensive \n\neffect of a single dose of the combination persisted for 24 hours. Upon withdrawal of the aliskiren \n\ntreatment (aliskiren with or without hydrochlorothiazide add-on), the return of blood pressure towards \n\nbaseline was gradual (3-4 weeks) with no evidence of the rebound effect. \n\n \n\nSprimeo HCT was studied in a placebo-controlled trial including 2,762 hypertensive patients with \n\ndiastolic blood pressure ≥ 95 mmHg and < 110 mmHg (mean baseline blood pressure of \n\n153.6/99.2 mmHg). In this study, Sprimeo HCT in doses from 150 mg/12.5 mg to 300 mg/25 mg \n\nproduced dose-dependent blood pressure reductions (systolic/diastolic) from 17.6/11.9 mmHg to \n\n21.2/14.3 mmHg, respectively, compared to 7.5/6.9 mmHg with placebo. The greater blood pressure \n\nreductions with these combination doses were also significantly greater than the respective doses of \n\naliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide when used alone. The combination of aliskiren and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide neutralised the reactive increase of PRA caused by hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nWhen administered in hypertensive patients with markedly elevated blood pressure (systolic blood \n\npressure ≥ 160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mmHg), Sprimeo HCT in doses from \n\n150 mg/12.5 mg to 300 mg/25 mg administered without up-titration from monotherapy demonstrated \n\nsignificantly greater systolic/diastolic blood pressure control rates (< 140/90 mmHg) as compared to \n\nthe respective monotherapies. In this population, Sprimeo HCT 150 mg/12.5 mg to 300 mg/25 mg \n\nprovided dose-dependent systolic/diastolic blood pressure reduction from 20.6/12.4 mmHg to \n\n24.8/14.5 mmHg, which were significantly superior to the respective monotherapies. The safety of the \n\ncombination therapy was similar to the respective monotherapies regardless of severity of \n\nhypertension or of the presence or absence of additional cardiovascular risk. Hypotension and related \n\nadverse events were uncommon with the combination treatment, with no increased incidence in \n\nelderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn a study in 880 randomised patients not adequately responsive to aliskiren 300 mg treatment, the \n\ncombination of aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg produced systolic/diastolic blood \n\npressure reductions of 15.8/11.0 mmHg, which were significantly greater than aliskiren 300 mg \n\nmonotherapy. In a study in 722 randomised patients not adequately responsive to hydrochlorothiazide \n\n25 mg treatment, the combination of aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg produced \n\nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure reductions of 16.78/10.7 mmHg, which were significantly greater \n\nthan hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg monotherapy. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\nIn another clinical trial, the efficacy and safety of Sprimeo HCT were also assessed in 489 obese \n\nhypertensive patients who did not respond to hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (baseline systolic/diastolic \n\nblood pressure 149.4/96.8 mmHg). In this difficult-to-treat population, Sprimeo HCT provided a blood \n\npressure reduction (systolic/diastolic) of 15.8/11.9 mmHg compared to 15.4/11.3 mmHg for \n\nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 13.6/10.3 mmHg for amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide and \n\n8.6/7.9 mmHg for hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy, with similar safety to hydrochlorothiazide \n\nmonotherapy. \n\n \n\nIn a study in 183 randomised patients with severe hypertension (mean sitting diastolic blood pressure \n\n≥ 105 and < 120 mmHg), aliskiren treatment regimen with optional addition of hydrochlorothiazide \n\n25 mg was shown to be safe and efficacious in reducing blood pressure. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral absorption, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours. The \n\nabsolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3%. Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax \n\nby 85% and AUC by 70%. Steady-state-plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days following \n\nonce-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than with the initial \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is approximately \n\n135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space. Aliskiren \n\nplasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. \n\n \n\nMetabolism and elimination \n\nThe mean half-life is about 40 hours (range 34-41 hours). Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as unchanged \n\ncompound in the faeces (oral radioactive dose recovery = 91%). Approximately 1.4% of the total oral \n\ndose is metabolised. The enzyme responsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4. Approximately 0.6% of \n\nthe dose is recovered in urine following oral administration. Following intravenous administration, the \n\nmean plasma clearance is approximately 9 l/h. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nExposure to aliskiren increased slightly more than in proportion to the increase in dose. After single \n\ndose administration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and \n\n2.6-fold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively. Mechanisms responsible for the deviation from dose \n\nproportionality have not been identified. A possible mechanism is saturation of transporters at the \n\nabsorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe absorption of hydrochlorothiazide, after an oral dose, is rapid (Tmax about 2 h). The increase in \n\nmean AUC is linear and dose proportional in the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\nThe effect of food on hydrochlorothiazide absorption, if any, has little clinical significance. Absolute \n\nbioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide is 70% after oral administration. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe apparent volume of distribution is 4-8 l/kg. Circulating hydrochlorothiazide is bound to serum \n\nproteins (40-70%), mainly serum albumin. Hydrochlorothiazide also accumulates in erythrocytes at \n\napproximately 3 times the level in plasma. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\nMetabolism and elimination \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is eliminated predominantly as unchanged compound. Hydrochlorothiazide is \n\neliminated from plasma with a half-life averaging 6 to 15 hours in the terminal elimination phase. \n\nThere is no change in the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on repeated dosing, and accumulation is \n\nminimal when dosed once daily. There is more than 95% of the absorbed dose being excreted as \n\nunchanged compound in the urine. The renal clearance is composed of passive filtration and active \n\nsecretion into the renal tubule. \n\n \n\nAliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nFollowing oral administration of Sprimeo HCT tablets, the median peak plasma concentration time is \n\nwithin 1 hour for aliskiren and 2.5 hours for hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nThe rate and extent of absorption of Sprimeo HCT are equivalent to the bioavailability of aliskiren and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide when administered as individual monotherapies. Similar food effect was observed \n\nfor Sprimeo HCT as for the individual monotherapies. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in patients \n\nSprimeo HCT has been shown to be effective as a once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult \n\npatients, regardless of gender, age, body mass index and ethnicity. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren are not significantly affected in patients with mild to moderate liver \n\ndisease. Consequently, no initial dose adjustment of Sprimeo HCT is required in patients with mild to \n\nmoderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on patients with severe hepatic impairment treated \n\nby Sprimeo HCT. Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.4). In the presence of renal impairment, mean peak plasma levels and AUC values \n\nof hydrochlorothiazide are increased and the urinary excretion rate is reduced. In patients with mild to \n\nmoderate renal impairment, a 3-fold increase in hydrochlorothiazide AUC has been observed. In \n\npatients with severe renal impairment an 8-fold increase in AUC has been observed. Sprimeo HCT is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with anuria or severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and the \n\nconcomitant use of Sprimeo HCT with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with renal \n\nimpairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease receiving \n\nhaemodialysis. Administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg aliskiren was associated with very \n\nminor changes in the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren (change in Cmax of less than 1.2 fold; increase in \n\nAUC of up to 1.6 fold) compared to matched healthy subjects. Timing of haemodialysis did not \n\nsignificantly alter the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren in ESRD patients. Therefore, if administration of \n\naliskiren in ESRD patients receiving haemodialysis is considered necessary, no dose adjustment is \n\nwarranted in these patients. However, the use of aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nNo initial dose adjustment of Sprimeo HCT is required in elderly patients. Limited data suggest that \n\nthe systemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and hypertensive elderly \n\nsubjects compared to young healthy volunteers. \n\n \n\nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nSafety pharmacology studies with aliskiren did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous, \n\nrespiratory or cardiovascular function. Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were \n\nconsistent with the known local irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of \n\naliskiren. No carcinogenic potential for aliskiren was detected in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month \n\ntransgenic mouse study. One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded in rats at the \n\ndose of 1,500 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. Aliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic \n\npotential, embryo-foetal toxicity or teratogenicity. Fertility, prenatal development and postnatal \n\ndevelopment were unaffected in rats. \n\n \n\nPreclinical evaluations to support the administration of hydrochlorothiazide in humans included in \n\nvitro genotoxicity assays and reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in rodents. Extensive \n\nclinical data are available for hydrochlorothiazide and these are reflected in the relevant sections. \n\n \n\nThe findings observed in the 2-week and 13-week toxicity studies were consistent with those observed \n\npreviously with aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapies. There were no new or unexpected \n\nfindings observed of relevance to human use. Increased cellular vacuolation of the adrenal gland zona \n\nglomerulosa was observed during the 13-week toxicity study in rats. The finding was observed in \n\nanimals treated with hydrochlorothiazide but not in those animals receiving aliskiren alone or vehicle. \n\nThere was no evidence that this finding was enhanced in the aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide \n\ncombination as it was only apparent at a minimal severity in all animals. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 300 mg aliskiren (as hemifumarate) and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nExcipients: Each tablet contains 25 mg lactose monohydrate and 24.5 mg wheat starch. \n\n \n\nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nFilm-coated tablet \n\n \n\nViolet white, biconvex, ovaloid film-coated tablet imprinted with “CVI” on one side and “NVR” on \n\nthe other. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nTreatment of essential hypertension in adults. \n\n \n\nSprimeo HCT is indicated in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on aliskiren or \n\nhydrochlorothiazide used alone. \n\n \n\nSprimeo HCT is indicated as substitution therapy in patients adequately controlled with aliskiren and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, given concurrently, at the same dose level as in the combination. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Sprimeo HCT is one tablet per day. Sprimeo HCT should be taken with a \n\nlight meal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. Grapefruit juice should not be taken \n\ntogether with Sprimeo HCT. \n\n \n\nThe antihypertensive effect is largely manifested within 1 week and the maximum effect is generally \n\nseen within 4 weeks. \n\n \n\nPosology in patients not adequately controlled with aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy \n\nIndividual dose titration with each of the two components may be recommended before changing to \n\nthe fixed combination. When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy to the fixed \n\ncombination may be considered. \n\n \n\nSprimeo HCT 300 mg /12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not \n\nadequately controlled with aliskiren 300 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg alone or by Sprimeo HCT \n\n150 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n \n\nIf blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 2-4 weeks of therapy, the dose may be titrated up to a \n\nmaximum of Sprimeo HCT 300 mg/25 mg daily. Dosing should be individualised and adjusted \n\naccording to the patient’s clinical response. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\nPosology as substitution therapy \n\nFor convenience, patients receiving aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide from separate tablets may be \n\nswitched to a fixed combination tablet of Sprimeo HCT containing the same component doses. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 5.2). Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated for \n\nuse in patients with anuria and in patients with severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n\n(GFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). The concomitant use of Sprimeo HCT with angiotensin II receptor \n\nblockers (ARB) or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) is contraindicated in patients \n\nwith renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment \n\n(see section 5.2). Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see \n\nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nElderly patients (over 65 years) \n\nThe recommended starting dose of aliskiren in elderly patients is 150 mg. No clinically meaningful \n\nadditional blood pressure reduction is observed by increasing the dose to 300 mg in the majority of \n\nelderly patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients \n\nSprimeo HCT is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below age 18 due to a lack of \n\ndata on safety and efficacy (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1), or to other \nsulphonamide-derived substances. \n\n History of angioedema with aliskiren. \n\n Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema. \n\n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\n Anuria. \n\n Severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n Refractory hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia and symptomatic hyperuricaemia. \n\n Severe hepatic impairment. \n\n The concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin and itraconazole, two highly potent P-\nglycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, and other potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. quinidine), is \n\ncontraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\n The concomitant use of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with \ndiabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n\n2\n) (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and \n\n5.1). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nHypotension, syncope, stroke, hyperkalaemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal \n\nfailure) have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that \n\naffect this system (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by \n\ncombining aliskiren with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blocker (ARB) is therefore not recommended. \n\n \n\nThe use of aliskiren in combination with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\nHeart failure \n\nAliskiren should be used with caution in patients with serious congestive heart failure (New York \n\nHeart Association (NYHA) functional class III-IV). Sprimeo HCT should be used with caution in \n\npatients with heart failure due to limited clinical efficacy and safety data. \n\n \n\nAngioedema \n\nAs with other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, angioedema or symptoms suggestive of \n\nangioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or tongue) have been reported in patients treated \n\nwith aliskiren. \n\n \n\nA number of these patients had a history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema, \n\nwhich in some cases followed use of other medicines that can cause angioedema, including RAAS \n\nblockers (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nPatients with a history of angioedema may be at increased risk of experiencing angioedema during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Caution should therefore be exercised when \n\nprescribing aliskiren to patients with a history of angioedema, and such patients should be closely \n\nmonitored during treatment (see section 4.8) especially at the beginning of the treatment. \n\n \n\nIf angioedema occurs, Sprimeo HCT should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and \n\nmonitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. \n\nWhere there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx adrenaline should be administered. In \n\naddition, measures necessary to maintain patent airways should be provided. \n\n \n\nSodium- and/or volume-depleted patients \n\nIn sodium-depleted and/or volume-depleted patients, such as those receiving high doses of diuretics, \n\nsymptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Sprimeo HCT. Sprimeo HCT \n\nshould be used only after correction of any pre-existing sodium and/or volume depletion. \n\n \n\nElectrolyte imbalance \n\nTreatment with Sprimeo HCT should only start after correction of hypokalaemia and any coexisting \n\nhypomagnesaemia. Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hypokalaemia or exacerbate pre-\n\nexisting hypokalaemia. Thiazide diuretics should be administered with caution in patients with \n\nconditions involving enhanced potassium loss, for example salt-losing nephropathies and prerenal \n\n(cardiogenic) impairment of kidney function. If hypokalaemia develops during hydrochlorothiazide \n\ntherapy Sprimeo HCT should be discontinued until stable correction of the potassium balance. \n\nAlthough hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with \n\naliskiren may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greater in patients \n\nwith cirrhosis of the liver, patients experiencing brisk diuresis, patients with inadequate oral \n\nelectrolyte intake and patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or \n\nadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nConversely, increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in post-marketing \n\nexperience and these may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or \n\nby non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Consistent with standard medical practice, \n\nperiodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is advised if co-administration is \n\nconsidered necessary. The concomitant use of aliskiren and ACEIs or ARBs is contraindicated in \n\npatients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.3, 4.5 \n\nand 4.8). \n\n \n\nThiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hyponatraemia and hypochloroaemic alkalosis or \n\nexacerbate pre-existing hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia, accompanied by neurological symptoms \n\n(nausea, progressive disorientation, apathy) has been observed. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide \n\nshould only be started after correction of pre-existing hyponatraemia. In case severe or rapid \n\nhyponatraemia develops during Sprimeo HCT therapy, the treatment should be discontinued until \n\nnormalisation of natraemia. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\nThere is no evidence that Sprimeo HCT would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. \n\nChloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \n\n \n\nAll patients receiving thiazide diuretics should be periodically monitored for imbalances in \n\nelectrolytes, particularly potassium, sodium and magnesium. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \n\nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Sprimeo HCT is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-\n\nexisting hypercalcaemia. Sprimeo HCT should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during \n\ntreatment. Serum levels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. \n\nMarked hypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be \n\ndiscontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation \n\nThiazide diuretics may precipitate azotaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. When Sprimeo \n\nHCT is used in patients with renal impairment, periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes including \n\npotassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment or anuria (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (GFR \n\n≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). \n\n \n\nThere is no experience regarding the administration of Sprimeo HCT in patients who have recently \n\nundergone kidney transplantation. \n\n \n\nAs for other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, caution should be exercised when aliskiren \n\nis given in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction such as hypovolaemia (e.g. \n\ndue to blood loss, severe or prolonged diarrhoea, prolonged vomiting, etc.), heart disease, liver \n\ndisease, diabetes mellitus or kidney disease. The concomitant use of aliskiren and ACEIs or ARBs is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Acute renal failure, \n\nreversible upon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients receiving aliskiren in \n\npost-marketing experience. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, aliskiren should be \n\npromptly discontinued. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver \n\ndisease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. No \n\nadjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. No \n\ndata are available for the use of Sprimeo HCT in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Due to the \n\nhydrochlorothiazide component, Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nThere is no clinical experience with Sprimeo HCT in patients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nModerate P-gp inhibitors \n\nCo-administration of aliskiren 300 mg with ketoconazole 200 mg or verapamil 240 mg resulted in a \n\n76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. Therefore caution should be exercised when \n\naliskiren is administered with moderate P-gp inhibitors such as ketoconazole or verapamil (see section \n\n4.5). \n\n \n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \n\nAs with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral \n\nstenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n\nRenal artery stenosis and renovascular hypertension \n\nNo controlled clinical data are available on the use of Sprimeo HCT in patients with unilateral or \n\nbilateral renal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, as with other agents acting on \n\nthe renin-angiotensin system, there is an increased risk of renal insufficiency, including acute renal \n\nfailure, when patients with renal artery stenosis are treated with aliskiren. Therefore caution should be \n\nexercised in these patients. If renal failure occurs, treatment should be discontinued. \n\n \n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, have been reported to exacerbate or activate \n\nsystemic lupus erythematosus. \n\n \n\nMetabolic and endocrine effects \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels \n\nof cholesterol and triglycerides, and uric acid. In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral \n\nhypoglycaemic agents may be required. Concomitant use of Sprimeo HCT with ARBs or ACEIs is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated in symptomatic \n\nhyperuricaemia (see section 4.3). Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to \n\nreduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricaemia as well as precipitate gout \n\nin susceptible patients. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \n\nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Sprimeo HCT is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-\n\nexisting hypercalcaemia. Sprimeo HCT should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during \n\ntreatment. Serum levels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. \n\nMarked hypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be \n\ndiscontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nPhotosensitivity \n\nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If \n\nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Sprimeo HCT, it is recommended to stop the \n\ntreatment. If a re-administration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect \n\nexposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA. \n\n \n\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma \n\nHydrochlorothiazide, a sulphonamide, has been associated with an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in \n\nacute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased \n\nvisual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of treatment initiation. \n\nUntreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to \n\ndiscontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatment may need \n\nto be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute \n\nangle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulphonamide or penicillin allergy. \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\nIn the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea, Sprimeo HCT therapy should be stopped. \n\n \n\nAs with any antihypertensive agent, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with ischaemic \n\ncardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients, but are more likely in patients \n\nwith allergy and asthma. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\nExcipients \n\nSprimeo HCT contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the \n\nLapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\nSprimeo HCT contains wheat starch. It is suitable for people with coeliac disease. Patients with wheat \n\nallergy (different from coeliac disease) should not take this medicine. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nInformation on Sprimeo HCT interactions \n\nMedicinal products affecting serum potassium levels: The potassium-depleting effect of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide is attenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of aliskiren. However, this effect of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal \n\nproducts associated with potassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, \n\ncorticosteroids, laxatives, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), amphotericin, carbenoxolone, \n\npenicillin G, salicylic acid derivatives). Conversely, concomitant use of other agents affecting the \n\nRAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum potassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, \n\npotassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum \n\npotassium. If co-medication with an agent affecting the level of serum potassium is considered \n\nnecessary, caution is advisable. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated \n\nin patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not \n\nrecommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: Periodic monitoring of serum \n\npotassium is recommended when Sprimeo HCT is administered with medicinal products affected by \n\nserum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). \n\n \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors \n\n(COX-2 inhibitors), acetylsalicylic acid and non-selective NSAIDs: As with other agents acting on the \n\nrenin-angiotensin system, NSAIDs may reduce the anti-hypertensive effect of aliskiren. NSAIDs may \n\nalso weaken the diuretic and antihypertensive activity of hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nIn some patients with compromised renal function (dehydrated patients or elderly patients) aliskiren \n\nand hydrochlorothiazide given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in further deterioration of renal \n\nfunction, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore the use of \n\nSprimeo HCT with an NSAID requires caution, especially in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nOther antihypertensive agents: The antihypertensive effect of Sprimeo HCT may be increased with \n\nthe concomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. \n\n \n\nAdditional information on aliskiren interactions \n\nThe combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus \n\nor renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see \n\nsections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nCompounds that have been investigated in aliskiren clinical pharmacokinetic studies include \n\nacenocoumarol, atenolol, celecoxib, fenofibrate, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate, \n\ndigoxin, metformin, amlodipine, atorvastatin, cimetidine and hydrochlorothiazide. No clinically \n\nrelevant interactions have been identified. As a result no dose adjustment for aliskiren or these co-\n\nadministered medicinal products is necessary. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\nP-glycoprotein interactions: MDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system \n\ninvolved in intestinal absorption and biliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies. Rifampicin, \n\nwhich is an inducer of P-gp, reduced aliskiren bioavailability by approximately 50% in a clinical \n\nstudy. Other inducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort) might decrease the bioavailability of aliskiren. \n\nAlthough this has not been investigated for aliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake \n\nof a variety of substrates and P-gp inhibitors can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. \n\nTherefore, P-gp inhibitors may increase tissue levels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug \n\ninteractions at the P-gp site will likely depend on the degree of inhibition of this transporter. \n\n \n\nP-gp potent inhibitors: A single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that \n\nciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) increases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC \n\napproximately 5-fold. The increase may be higher with higher aliskiren doses. In healthy subjects, \n\nitraconazole (100 mg) increases AUC and Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, \n\nrespectively. Therefore, concomitant use of aliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nModerate P-gp inhibitors: Co-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) or verapamil (240 mg) with \n\naliskiren (300 mg) resulted in a 76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. The change in \n\nplasma levels of aliskiren in the presence of ketoconazole or verapamil is expected to be within the \n\nrange that would be achieved if the dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or \n\ntwice the highest recommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled \n\nclinical trials. Preclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances \n\naliskiren gastrointestinal absorption and decreases biliary excretion. Therefore, caution should be \n\nexercised when aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole, verapamil or other moderate P-gp \n\ninhibitors (clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). \n\n \n\nP-gp substrates or weak inhibitors: No relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or \n\ncimetidine have been observed. When administered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren \n\n(300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. \n\n \n\nOrganic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors: Preclinical studies indicate that aliskiren \n\nmight be a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptides. Therefore, the potential exists for \n\ninteractions between OATP inhibitors and aliskiren when administered concomitantly (see interaction \n\nwith Grapefruit juice). \n\n \n\nGrapefruit juice: Administration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and \n\nCmax of aliskiren. Co-administration with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren \n\nAUC and co-administration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. This \n\ndecrease is likely due to an inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of \n\naliskiren by grapefruit juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic \n\nfailure, grapefruit juice should not be taken together with Sprimeo HCT. \n\n \n\nFurosemide: When aliskiren was co-administered with furosemide, the AUC and Cmax of furosemide \n\nwere reduced by 28% and 49%, respectively. It is therefore recommended to monitor the effects when \n\ninitiating and adjusting furosemide therapy to avoid possible underutilisation in clinical situations of \n\nvolume overload. \n\n \n\nWarfarin: The effects of aliskiren on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. \n\n \n\nFood interactions: Meals with a high fat content have been shown to reduce the absorption of aliskiren \n\nsubstantially. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\nAdditional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions \n\nWhen administered concurrently, the following medicinal products may interact with thiazide \n\ndiuretics: \n\n \n\nLithium: Renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, therefore the risk of lithium toxicity may \n\nbe increased with hydrochlorothiazide. Co-administration of lithium and hydrochlorothiazide is not \n\nrecommended. If this combination proves essential, careful monitoring of serum lithium level is \n\nrecommended during concomitant use. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products that could induce torsades de pointes: Due to the risk of hypokalaemia, \n\nhydrochlorothiazide should be administered with caution when associated with medicinal products \n\nthat could induce torsades de pointes, in particular Class Ia and Class III antiarrhythmics and some \n\nantipsychotics. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affecting serum sodium level: The hyponatraemic effect of diuretics may be \n\nintensified by concomitant administration of medicinal products such as antidepressants, \n\nantipsychotics, antiepileptics, etc. Caution is indicated in long-term administration of these medicinal \n\nproducts. \n\n \n\nPressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline, adrenaline): Hydrochlorothiazide may reduce the response to \n\npressor amines such as noradrenaline. The clinical significance of this effect is uncertain and not \n\nsufficient to preclude their use. \n\n \n\nDigoxine or other digitalis glycosides: Thiazide-induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia may \n\noccur as undesirable effects, favouring the onset of digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias. \n\n \n\nVitamin D and calcium salts: Administration of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, with \n\nvitamin D or with calcium salts may potentiate the rise in serum calcium. Concomitant use of thiazide \n\ntype diuretics may lead to hypercalcaemia in patients pre-disposed for hypercalcaemia (e.g. \n\nhyperparathyroidism, malignancy, or vitamin-D-mediated conditions) by increasing tubular calcium \n\nreabsorption. \n\n \n\nAntidiabetic agents (e.g. insulin and oral antidiabetic agents): Thiazides may alter glucose tolerance. \n\nDose adjustment of the antidiabetic medicinal product may be necessary (see section 4.4). Metformin \n\nshould be used with caution because of the risk of lactic acidosis induced by possible functional renal \n\nfailure linked to hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nBeta blockers and diazoxide: Concomitant use of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, \n\nwith beta blockers may increase the risk of hyperglycaemia. Thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, may enhance the hyperglycaemic effect of diazoxide. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products used in the treatment of gout: Dose adjustment of uricosuric medicinal products \n\nmay be necessary as hydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase of dose of \n\nprobenecid or sulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, may increase the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol. \n\n \n\nAnticholinergic agents and other medicinal products affecting gastric motility: The bioavailability of \n\nthiazide-type diuretics may be increased by anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, biperiden), \n\napparently due to a decrease in gastrointestinal motility and the stomach emptying rate. Conversely, it \n\nis anticipated that prokinetic substances such as cisapride may decrease the bioavailability of thiazide-\n\ntype diuretics. \n\n \n\nAmantadine: Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may increase the risk of adverse reactions \n\ncaused by amantadine. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\nIon exchange resins: Absorption of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, is decreased by \n\ncholestyramine or colestipol. This could result in sub-therapeutic effects of thiazide diuretics. \n\nHowever, staggering the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and resin such that hydrochlorothiazide is \n\nadministered at least 4 hours before or 4-6 hours after the administration of resins would potentially \n\nminimise the interaction. \n\n \n\nCytotoxic agents: Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may reduce the renal excretion of \n\ncytotoxic agents (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their myelosuppressive effects. \n\n \n\nNon-depolarising skeletal muscle relaxants: Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, potentiate the \n\naction of skeletal muscle relaxants such as curare derivatives. \n\n \n\nAlcohol, barbiturates or narcotics: Concomitant administration of thiazide diuretics with subtances \n\nthat also have a blood pressure lowering effect (e.g. by reducing sympathetic central nervous system \n\nactivity or direct vasodilatation) may potentiate orthostatic hypotension. \n\n \n\nMethyldopa: There have been isolated reports of haemolytic anaemia occurring with concomitant use \n\nof hydrochlorothiazide and methyldopa. \n\n \n\nIodine contrasting agents: In case of diuretic-induced dehydration, there is an increased risk of acute \n\nrenal failure, especially with high doses of iodine products. Patients should be rehydrated before \n\nadministration. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women. Aliskiren was not teratogenic in rats or \n\nrabbits (see section 5.3). Other substances that act directly on the RAAS have been associated with \n\nserious foetal malformations and neonatal death when used during second and third trimesters. There \n\nis limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. \n\nAnimal studies are insufficient. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the pharmacological mechanism of action of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, its use during the second and third trimester may compromise foeto-placental \n\nperfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and \n\nthrombocytopenia. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or \n\npre-eclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a \n\nbeneficial effect on the course of the disease. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare \n\nsituations where no other treatment could be used. \n\n \n\nNo specific clinical studies have been performed with this combination, therefore Sprimeo HCT \n\nshould not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy or in women planning to become pregnant \n\nand is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). A switch to a suitable \n\nalternative treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy. If pregnancy is detected \n\nduring therapy, Sprimeo HCT should be discontinued as soon as possible. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether aliskiren is excreted in human milk. Aliskiren was secreted in the milk of \n\nlactating rats. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \n\nintense diuresis can inhibit milk production. \n\n \n\nThe use of Sprimeo HCT during breast-feeding is not recommended. If Sprimeo HCT is used during \n\nbreast-feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nNo studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Sprimeo HCT \n\nis unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use machines. However, when driving vehicles or \n\noperating machinery it must be borne in mind that dizziness or drowsiness may occasionally occur \n\nwhen taking antihypertensive therapy. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nAliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide combination \n\nThe safety of Sprimeo HCT has been evaluated in 9 clinical trials with more than 3,900 patients, \n\nincluding over 700 treated for over 6 months, and 190 for over 1 year. The incidence of adverse \n\nreactions showed no association with gender, age, body mass index, race or ethnicity. Treatment with \n\nSprimeo HCT had an overall incidence of adverse experiences at doses up to 300 mg/25 mg similar to \n\nplacebo. Adverse reactions have generally been mild and transient in nature and have only \n\ninfrequently required discontinuation of therapy. The most common adverse drug reaction observed \n\nwith Sprimeo HCT is diarrhoea. The adverse drug reactions previously reported with one of the \n\nindividual components of Sprimeo HCT (aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide) and listed in the \n\nrespective paragraphs on the individual components may occur with Sprimeo HCT. \n\n \n\nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: very \n\ncommon (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n\n< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Common: Diarrhoea \n\n \n\nDiarrhoea: Diarrhoea is a dose-related adverse drug reaction for aliskiren. In controlled clinical trials, \n\nthe incidence of diarrhoea in Sprimeo HCT-treated patients was 1.3% compared to 1.4% for aliskiren- \n\nor 1.9% for hydrochlorothiazide-treated patients. \n\n \n\nSerum potassium: In a large placebo-controlled clinical trial, the opposite effects of aliskiren (150 mg \n\nor 300 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) on serum potassium approximately balanced \n\neach other in many patients. In other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Periodic \n\ndeterminations of serum potassium to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed in \n\npatients at risk at appropriate intervals (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nAdditional information on individual components \n\nOther adverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components may occur with \n\nSprimeo HCT even if not observed in clinical trials. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nTreatment with Aliskiren up to 300 mg resulted in an overall incidence of adverse reactions similar to \n\nplacebo. Adverse reactions have generally been mild and transient in nature and have only \n\ninfrequently required discontinuation of therapy. The most common adverse drug reaction is \n\ndiarrhoea. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\nThe known aliskiren adverse drug reactions are presented in the table below using the same \n\nconvention as described previously for the fixed combination. \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common: Dizziness \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Uncommon: Hypotension \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Common: Diarrhoea \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n Rare: Hypersensitivity reactions \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Uncommon: Rash, severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including toxic \n\nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) and oral mucosal reactions \n\n Rare: Angioedema \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\n Common: Arthralgia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n Uncommon: Acute renal failure, renal impairment \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n Uncommon: Oedema peripheral \n\nInvestigations \n Common: Hyperkalaemia \n\n Rare: Haemoglobin decreased, haematocrit decreased \n\n Rare: Blood creatinine increased \n\n \n\nAngioedema and hypersensitivity reactions have occurred during treatment with aliskiren. In \n\ncontrolled clinical trials, angioedema and hypersensitivity reactions occurred rarely during treatment \n\nwith aliskiren with rates comparable to treatment with placebo or comparators. \n\n \n\nCases of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or \n\ntongue) have also been reported in post-marketing experience. A number of these patients had a \n\nhistory of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema which in some cases was associated \n\nwith the administration of other medicines known to cause angioedema, including RAAS blockers \n\n(ACE inhibitors or ARBs). \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions have also been reported in post-marketing experience. \n\n \n\nIn the event of any signs suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction/angioedema (in particular difficulties \n\nin breathing or swallowing, rash, itching, hives or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/or \n\ntongue, dizziness) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nArthralgia has been reported in post-marketing experience. In some cases this occurred as part of a \n\nhypersensitivity reaction. \n\n \n\nHaemoglobin and haematocrit: Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of \n\napproximately 0.05 mmol/l and 0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed. No patients \n\ndiscontinued therapy due to anaemia. This effect is also seen with other agents acting on the renin-\n\nangiotensin system, such as ACEI and ARBs. \n\n \n\nSerum potassium: Increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren and these may be \n\nexacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by NSAIDs. Consistent with \n\nstandard medical practice, periodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is \n\nadvised if co-administration is considered necessary. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or \n\nACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR \n\n< 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, renal dysfunction and cases of acute renal failure have been reported in \n\npatients at risk (see section 4.4). There have also been reports of peripheral oedema, increase in blood \n\ncreatinine and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including toxic epidermal necrolysis \n\n(TEN) and oral mucosal reactions. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nHydrochlorothiazide has been extensively prescribed for many years, frequently in higher doses than \n\nthose contained in Sprimeo HCT. The following adverse reactions have been reported in patients \n\ntreated with thiazide diuretics alone, including hydrochlorothiazide: \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\n Rare: Thrombocytopenia sometimes with purpura \n\n Very rare: Agranulocytosis, bone marrow depression, haemolytic anaemia, \n\nleucopenia \n\n Not known: Aplastic anaemia \nImmune system disorders \n\n Very rare: Hypersensitivity \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\n Very common: Hypokalaemia \n\n Common: Hyperuricaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hyponatraemia \n\n Rare: Hypercalcaemia, hyperglycaemia, worsening of diabetic metabolic \n\nstate \n\n Very rare: Hypochloraemic alkalosis \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\n Rare: Depression, sleep disturbances \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Rare: Dizziness, headache, paraesthesia \n\nEye disorders \n\n Rare: Visual impairment \n\n Not known: Acute angle-closure glaucoma \n\nCardiac disorders \n\n Rare: Cardiac arrhythmias \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Common: Orthostatic hypotension \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\n Very rare: Respiratory distress (including pneumonitis and pulmonary oedema) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Common: Decreased appetite, mild nausea and vomiting \n\n Rare: Abdominal discomfort, constipation, diarrhoea \n\n Very rare: Pancreatitis \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\n Rare: Intrahepatic cholestasis, jaundice \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Common: Urticaria and other forms of rash \n\n Rare: Photosensitivity reactions \n\n Very rare: Cutaneous lupus erythematosus-like reactions, reactivation of \n\ncutaneous lupus erythematosus, vasculitis necrotising and toxic \n\nepidermal necrolysis \n\n Not known: Erythema multiforme \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\n Not known: Muscle spasm \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\n Not known: Renal dysfunction, acute renal failure \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n\n \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\n Common: Impotence \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n Not known: Asthenia, pyrexia \n\nInvestigations \n\n Very common: Increases in cholesterol and triglycerides \n\n Rare: Glycosuria \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nNo information is available on the treatment of overdose with Sprimeo HCT. The most likely \n\nmanifestation of overdose would be hypotension, related to the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren. \n\n \n\nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \n\nhypochloraemia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most \n\ncommon signs and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in \n\nmuscle spasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \n\nglycosides or certain antiarrhythmic medicinal products. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, \n\nsupportive treatment should be initiated. \n\n \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis, dialysis \n\nclearance of aliskiren was low (< 2% of oral clearance). Therefore dialysis is not adequate to treat \n\naliskiren over-exposure. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Renin inhibitor (aliskiren) combinations with diuretics \n\n(hydrochlorothiazide), ATC code: C09XA52 \n\nSprimeo HCT combines two antihypertensive compounds to control blood pressure in patients with \n\nessential hypertension: Aliskiren belongs to the class of direct renin inhibitors and hydrochlorothiazide \n\nto the class of thiazide diuretics. The combination of these substances with complementary \n\nmechanisms of action provides an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a \n\ngreater degree than either component alone. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAliskiren is an orally active, non-peptide, potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin. \n\n \n\nBy inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAAS at the point of activation, blocking the \n\nconversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and \n\nangiotensin II. Whereas other agents that inhibit the RAAS (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors \n\n(ACEI) and angiotension II receptor blockers (ARB)) cause a compensatory rise in plasma renin \n\nactivity (PRA), treatment with aliskiren decreases PRA in hypertensive patients by approximately 50 \n\nto 80%. Similar reductions were found when aliskiren was combined with other antihypertensive \n\nagents. The clinical implications of the effects on PRA are not known at the present time. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of aliskiren at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg \n\nprovided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained \n\nover the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a mean peak to \n\ntrough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose. 85 to 90% of the maximal blood-\n\npressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering effect was \n\nsustained during long-term treatment (12 months), and was independent of age, gender, body mass \n\nindex and ethnicity. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\nCombination therapy studies are available for aliskiren added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the \n\ncalcium channel blocker amlodipine and the beta blocker atenolol. These combinations were \n\nefficacious and well tolerated. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of aliskiren-based therapy were compared to ramipril-based therapy in a 9-\n\nmonth non-inferiority study in 901 elderly patients (≥ 65 years) with essential systolic hypertension. \n\nAliskiren 150 mg or 300 mg per day or ramipril 5 mg or 10 mg per day were administered for \n\n36 weeks with optional add-on therapy of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) at week 12, and \n\namlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) at week 22. Over the 12 week period, aliskiren monotherapy lowered \n\nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure by 14.0/5.1 mmHg, compared to 11.6/3.6 mmHg for ramipril, \n\nconsistent with aliskiren being non-inferior to ramipril at the dosages chosen and the differences in \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significant. Tolerability was comparable in both \n\ntreatment arms, however cough was more often reported with the ramipril regimen than the aliskiren \n\nregimen (14.2% vs. 4.4%), whilst diarrhoea was more common with the aliskiren regimen than for the \n\nramipril regimen (6.6% vs. 5.0%). \n\n \n\nIn a 8-week study in 754 hypertensive elderly (≥ 65 years) and very elderly patients (30% ≥ 75 years) \n\naliskiren at doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg provided statistically significant superior reduction in \n\nblood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) when compared to placebo. No additional blood pressure \n\nlowering effect was detected with 300 mg aliskiren compared to 150 mg aliskiren. All three doses \n\nwere well tolerated in both elderly and very elderly patients. \n\n \n\nThere has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in \n\ncontrolled clinical studies. With cessation of treatment, blood pressure gradually returned towards \n\nbaseline levels over a period of several weeks, with no evidence of a rebound effect for blood pressure \n\nor PRA. \n\n \n\nIn a 36-week study involving 820 patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, no changes in \n\nventricular remodelling as assessed by left ventricular end systolic volume were detected with \n\naliskiren compared to placebo on top of background therapy. \n\n \n\nThe combined rates of cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, recurrent heart attack, \n\nstroke and resuscitated sudden death were similar in the aliskiren group and the placebo group. \n\nHowever, in patients receiving aliskiren there was a significantly higher rate of hyperkalaemia, \n\nhypotension and kidney dysfunction when compared to the placebo group. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was evaluated for cardiovascular and/or renal benefit in a double-blind placebo controlled \n\nrandomised trial in 8,606 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (evidenced by \n\nproteinuria and/or GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) with or without cardiovascular disease. In most patients \n\narterial blood pressure was well controlled at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of \n\ncardiovascular and renal complications. \n\n \n\nIn this study, aliskiren 300 mg was compared to placebo when added to standard of care which \n\nincluded either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. The \n\nstudy was discontinued prematurely because the participants were unlikely to benefit from aliskiren. \n\nPreliminary study results indicated a hazard ratio for the primary endpoint of 1.09 in favour of placebo \n\n(95% Confidence Interval: 0.97, 1.22, 2-sided p=0.17). In addition, an increased incidence of serious \n\nadverse outcomes was observed with aliskiren compared to placebo for renal complications (4.7% \n\nversus 3.3%), hyperkalaemia (36.9% versus 27.1%), hypotension (18.4% versus 14.6%) and stroke \n\n(2.7% versus 2.0%). The increased incidence of non-fatal stroke was greater in patients with renal \n\ninsufficiency. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nThe site of action of thiazide diuretics is primarily in the renal distal convoluted tubule. It has been \n\nshown that there is a high-affinity receptor in the renal cortex as the primary binding site for the \n\nthiazide diuretic action and inhibition of NaCl transport in the distal convoluted tubule. The mode of \n\naction of thiazides is through inhibition of the Na+Cl- symporter by competing for the Cl- site, thereby \n\naffecting electrolyte reabsorption mechanisms: directly increasing sodium and chloride excretion to an \n\napproximately equal extent, and indirectly by this diuretic action reducing plasma volume, with \n\nconsequent increases in plasma renin activity, aldosterone secretion and urinary potassium loss, and a \n\ndecrease in serum potassium. \n\n \n\nAliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nOver 3,900 hypertensive patients received Sprimeo HCT once daily in clinical trials. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of Sprimeo HCT provided dose-dependent \n\nreductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained over the entire 24-hour \n\ndose interval. The antihypertensive effect is largely manifested within 1 week and the maximum effect \n\nis generally seen within 4 weeks.The blood-pressure-lowering effect was sustained during long-term \n\ntreatment, and was independent of age, gender, body mass index and ethnicity. The antihypertensive \n\neffect of a single dose of the combination persisted for 24 hours. Upon withdrawal of the aliskiren \n\ntreatment (aliskiren with or without hydrochlorothiazide add-on), the return of blood pressure towards \n\nbaseline was gradual (3-4 weeks) with no evidence of the rebound effect. \n\n \n\nSprimeo HCT was studied in a placebo-controlled trial including 2,762 hypertensive patients with \n\ndiastolic blood pressure ≥ 95 mmHg and < 110 mmHg (mean baseline blood pressure of \n\n153.6/99.2 mmHg). In this study, Sprimeo HCT in doses from 150 mg/12.5 mg to 300 mg/25 mg \n\nproduced dose-dependent blood pressure reductions (systolic/diastolic) from 17.6/11.9 mmHg to \n\n21.2/14.3 mmHg, respectively, compared to 7.5/6.9 mmHg with placebo. The greater blood pressure \n\nreductions with these combination doses were also significantly greater than the respective doses of \n\naliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide when used alone. The combination of aliskiren and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide neutralised the reactive increase of PRA caused by hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nWhen administered in hypertensive patients with markedly elevated blood pressure (systolic blood \n\npressure ≥ 160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mmHg), Sprimeo HCT in doses from \n\n150 mg/12.5 mg to 300 mg/25 mg administered without up-titration from monotherapy demonstrated \n\nsignificantly greater systolic/diastolic blood pressure control rates (< 140/90 mmHg) as compared to \n\nthe respective monotherapies. In this population, Sprimeo HCT 150 mg/12.5 mg to 300 mg/25 mg \n\nprovided dose-dependent systolic/diastolic blood pressure reduction from 20.6/12.4 mmHg to \n\n24.8/14.5 mmHg, which were significantly superior to the respective monotherapies. The safety of the \n\ncombination therapy was similar to the respective monotherapies regardless of severity of \n\nhypertension or of the presence or absence of additional cardiovascular risk. Hypotension and related \n\nadverse events were uncommon with the combination treatment, with no increased incidence in \n\nelderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn a study in 880 randomised patients not adequately responsive to aliskiren 300 mg treatment, the \n\ncombination of aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg produced systolic/diastolic blood \n\npressure reductions of 15.8/11.0 mmHg, which were significantly greater than aliskiren 300 mg \n\nmonotherapy. In a study in 722 randomised patients not adequately responsive to hydrochlorothiazide \n\n25 mg treatment, the combination of aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg produced \n\nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure reductions of 16.78/10.7 mmHg, which were significantly greater \n\nthan hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg monotherapy. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\nIn another clinical trial, the efficacy and safety of Sprimeo HCT were also assessed in 489 obese \n\nhypertensive patients who did not respond to hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (baseline systolic/diastolic \n\nblood pressure 149.4/96.8 mmHg). In this difficult-to-treat population, Sprimeo HCT provided a blood \n\npressure reduction (systolic/diastolic) of 15.8/11.9 mmHg compared to 15.4/11.3 mmHg for \n\nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 13.6/10.3 mmHg for amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide and \n\n8.6/7.9 mmHg for hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy, with similar safety to hydrochlorothiazide \n\nmonotherapy. \n\n \n\nIn a study in 183 randomised patients with severe hypertension (mean sitting diastolic blood pressure \n\n≥ 105 and < 120 mmHg), aliskiren treatment regimen with optional addition of hydrochlorothiazide \n\n25 mg was shown to be safe and efficacious in reducing blood pressure. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral absorption, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours. The \n\nabsolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3%. Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax \n\nby 85% and AUC by 70%. Steady-state-plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days following \n\nonce-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than with the initial \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is approximately \n\n135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space. Aliskiren \n\nplasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. \n\n \n\nMetabolism and elimination \n\nThe mean half-life is about 40 hours (range 34-41 hours). Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as unchanged \n\ncompound in the faeces (oral radioactive dose recovery = 91%). Approximately 1.4% of the total oral \n\ndose is metabolised. The enzyme responsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4. Approximately 0.6% of \n\nthe dose is recovered in urine following oral administration. Following intravenous administration, the \n\nmean plasma clearance is approximately 9 l/h. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nExposure to aliskiren increased slightly more than in proportion to the increase in dose. After single \n\ndose administration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and \n\n2.6-fold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively. Mechanisms responsible for the deviation from dose \n\nproportionality have not been identified. A possible mechanism is saturation of transporters at the \n\nabsorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe absorption of hydrochlorothiazide, after an oral dose, is rapid (Tmax about 2 h). The increase in \n\nmean AUC is linear and dose proportional in the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\nThe effect of food on hydrochlorothiazide absorption, if any, has little clinical significance. Absolute \n\nbioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide is 70% after oral administration. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe apparent volume of distribution is 4-8 l/kg. Circulating hydrochlorothiazide is bound to serum \n\nproteins (40-70%), mainly serum albumin. Hydrochlorothiazide also accumulates in erythrocytes at \n\napproximately 3 times the level in plasma. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n\nMetabolism and elimination \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is eliminated predominantly as unchanged compound. Hydrochlorothiazide is \n\neliminated from plasma with a half-life averaging 6 to 15 hours in the terminal elimination phase. \n\nThere is no change in the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on repeated dosing, and accumulation is \n\nminimal when dosed once daily. There is more than 95% of the absorbed dose being excreted as \n\nunchanged compound in the urine. The renal clearance is composed of passive filtration and active \n\nsecretion into the renal tubule. \n\n \n\nAliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nFollowing oral administration of Sprimeo HCT tablets, the median peak plasma concentration time is \n\nwithin 1 hour for aliskiren and 2.5 hours for hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nThe rate and extent of absorption of Sprimeo HCT are equivalent to the bioavailability of aliskiren and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide when administered as individual monotherapies. Similar food effect was observed \n\nfor Sprimeo HCT as for the individual monotherapies. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in patients \n\nSprimeo HCT has been shown to be effective as a once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult \n\npatients, regardless of gender, age, body mass index and ethnicity. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren are not significantly affected in patients with mild to moderate liver \n\ndisease. Consequently, no initial dose adjustment of Sprimeo HCT is required in patients with mild to \n\nmoderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on patients with severe hepatic impairment treated \n\nby Sprimeo HCT. Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.4). In the presence of renal impairment, mean peak plasma levels and AUC values \n\nof hydrochlorothiazide are increased and the urinary excretion rate is reduced. In patients with mild to \n\nmoderate renal impairment, a 3-fold increase in hydrochlorothiazide AUC has been observed. In \n\npatients with severe renal impairment an 8-fold increase in AUC has been observed. Sprimeo HCT is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with anuria or severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and the \n\nconcomitant use of Sprimeo HCT with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with renal \n\nimpairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease receiving \n\nhaemodialysis. Administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg aliskiren was associated with very \n\nminor changes in the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren (change in Cmax of less than 1.2 fold; increase in \n\nAUC of up to 1.6 fold) compared to matched healthy subjects. Timing of haemodialysis did not \n\nsignificantly alter the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren in ESRD patients. Therefore, if administration of \n\naliskiren in ESRD patients receiving haemodialysis is considered necessary, no dose adjustment is \n\nwarranted in these patients. However, the use of aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nNo initial dose adjustment of Sprimeo HCT is required in elderly patients. Limited data suggest that \n\nthe systemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and hypertensive elderly \n\nsubjects compared to young healthy volunteers. \n\n \n\nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nSafety pharmacology studies with aliskiren did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous, \n\nrespiratory or cardiovascular function. Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were \n\nconsistent with the known local irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of \n\naliskiren. No carcinogenic potential for aliskiren was detected in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month \n\ntransgenic mouse study. One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded in rats at the \n\ndose of 1,500 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. Aliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic \n\npotential, embryo-foetal toxicity or teratogenicity. Fertility, prenatal development and postnatal \n\ndevelopment were unaffected in rats. \n\n \n\nPreclinical evaluations to support the administration of hydrochlorothiazide in humans included in \n\nvitro genotoxicity assays and reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in rodents. Extensive \n\nclinical data are available for hydrochlorothiazide and these are reflected in the relevant sections. \n\n \n\nThe findings observed in the 2-week and 13-week toxicity studies were consistent with those observed \n\npreviously with aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapies. There were no new or unexpected \n\nfindings observed of relevance to human use. Increased cellular vacuolation of the adrenal gland zona \n\nglomerulosa was observed during the 13-week toxicity study in rats. The finding was observed in \n\nanimals treated with hydrochlorothiazide but not in those animals receiving aliskiren alone or vehicle. \n\nThere was no evidence that this finding was enhanced in the aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide \n\ncombination as it was only apparent at a minimal severity in all animals. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nTreatment of essential hypertension in adults. \n\n \n\nSprimeo HCT is indicated in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on aliskiren or \n\nhydrochlorothiazide used alone. \n\n \n\nSprimeo HCT is indicated as substitution therapy in patients adequately controlled with aliskiren and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, given concurrently, at the same dose level as in the combination. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Sprimeo HCT is one tablet per day. Sprimeo HCT should be taken with a \n\nlight meal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. Grapefruit juice should not be taken \n\ntogether with Sprimeo HCT. \n\n \n\nThe antihypertensive effect is largely manifested within 1 week and the maximum effect is generally \n\nseen within 4 weeks. \n\n \n\nPosology in patients not adequately controlled with aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy \n\nIndividual dose titration with each of the two components may be recommended before changing to \n\nthe fixed combination. When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy to the fixed \n\ncombination may be considered. \n\n \n\nSprimeo HCT 300 mg /25 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \n\ncontrolled with aliskiren 300 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg alone or by Sprimeo HCT \n\n300 mg/12.5 mg or Sprimeo HCT 150 mg/25 mg. \n\n \n\nIf blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 2-4 weeks of therapy, the dose may be titrated up to a \n\nmaximum of Sprimeo HCT 300 mg/25 mg daily. Dosing should be individualised and adjusted \n\naccording to the patient’s clinical response. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n\nPosology as substitution therapy \n\nFor convenience, patients receiving aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide from separate tablets may be \n\nswitched to a fixed combination tablet of Sprimeo HCT containing the same component doses. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 5.2). Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated for \n\nuse in patients with anuria and in patients with severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n\n(GFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). The concomitant use of Sprimeo HCT with angiotensin II receptor \n\nblockers (ARB) or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) is contraindicated in patients \n\nwith renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment \n\n(see section 5.2). Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see \n\nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nElderly patients (over 65 years) \n\nThe recommended starting dose of aliskiren in elderly patients is 150 mg. No clinically meaningful \n\nadditional blood pressure reduction is observed by increasing the dose to 300 mg in the majority of \n\nelderly patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients \n\nSprimeo HCT is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below age 18 due to a lack of \n\ndata on safety and efficacy (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1), or to other \nsulphonamide-derived substances. \n\n History of angioedema with aliskiren. \n\n Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema. \n\n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\n Anuria. \n\n Severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n Refractory hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia and symptomatic hyperuricaemia. \n\n Severe hepatic impairment. \n\n The concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin and itraconazole, two highly potent P-\nglycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, and other potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. quinidine), is \n\ncontraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\n The concomitant use of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with \ndiabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n\n2\n) (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and \n\n5.1). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nHypotension, syncope, stroke, hyperkalaemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal \n\nfailure) have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that \n\naffect this system (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by \n\ncombining aliskiren with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blocker (ARB) is therefore not recommended. \n\n \n\nThe use of aliskiren in combination with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n\nHeart failure \n\nAliskiren should be used with caution in patients with serious congestive heart failure (New York \n\nHeart Association (NYHA) functional class III-IV). Sprimeo HCT should be used with caution in \n\npatients with heart failure due to limited clinical efficacy and safety data. \n\n \n\nAngioedema \n\nAs with other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, angioedema or symptoms suggestive of \n\nangioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or tongue) have been reported in patients treated \n\nwith aliskiren. \n\n \n\nA number of these patients had a history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema, \n\nwhich in some cases followed use of other medicines that can cause angioedema, including RAAS \n\nblockers (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nPatients with a history of angioedema may be at increased risk of experiencing angioedema during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Caution should therefore be exercised when \n\nprescribing aliskiren to patients with a history of angioedema, and such patients should be closely \n\nmonitored during treatment (see section 4.8) especially at the beginning of the treatment. \n\n \n\nIf angioedema occurs, Sprimeo HCT should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and \n\nmonitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. \n\nWhere there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx adrenaline should be administered. In \n\naddition, measures necessary to maintain patent airways should be provided. \n\n \n\nSodium- and/or volume-depleted patients \n\nIn sodium-depleted and/or volume-depleted patients, such as those receiving high doses of diuretics, \n\nsymptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Sprimeo HCT. Sprimeo HCT \n\nshould be used only after correction of any pre-existing sodium and/or volume depletion. \n\n \n\nElectrolyte imbalance \n\nTreatment with Sprimeo HCT should only start after correction of hypokalaemia and any coexisting \n\nhypomagnesaemia. Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hypokalaemia or exacerbate pre-\n\nexisting hypokalaemia. Thiazide diuretics should be administered with caution in patients with \n\nconditions involving enhanced potassium loss, for example salt-losing nephropathies and prerenal \n\n(cardiogenic) impairment of kidney function. If hypokalaemia develops during hydrochlorothiazide \n\ntherapy Sprimeo HCT should be discontinued until stable correction of the potassium balance. \n\nAlthough hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with \n\naliskiren may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greater in patients \n\nwith cirrhosis of the liver, patients experiencing brisk diuresis, patients with inadequate oral \n\nelectrolyte intake and patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or \n\nadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nConversely, increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in post-marketing \n\nexperience and these may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or \n\nby non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Consistent with standard medical practice, \n\nperiodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is advised if co-administration is \n\nconsidered necessary. The concomitant use of aliskiren and ACEIs or ARBs is contraindicated in \n\npatients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.3, 4.5 \n\nand 4.8). \n\n \n\nThiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hyponatraemia and hypochloroaemic alkalosis or \n\nexacerbate pre-existing hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia, accompanied by neurological symptoms \n\n(nausea, progressive disorientation, apathy) has been observed. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide \n\nshould only be started after correction of pre-existing hyponatraemia. In case severe or rapid \n\nhyponatraemia develops during Sprimeo HCT therapy, the treatment should be discontinued until \n\nnormalisation of natraemia. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n62 \n\nThere is no evidence that Sprimeo HCT would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. \n\nChloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \n\n \n\nAll patients receiving thiazide diuretics should be periodically monitored for imbalances in \n\nelectrolytes, particularly potassium, sodium and magnesium. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \n\nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Sprimeo HCT is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-\n\nexisting hypercalcaemia. Sprimeo HCT should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during \n\ntreatment. Serum levels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. \n\nMarked hypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be \n\ndiscontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation \n\nThiazide diuretics may precipitate azotaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. When Sprimeo \n\nHCT is used in patients with renal impairment, periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes including \n\npotassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment or anuria (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (GFR \n\n≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). \n\n \n\nThere is no experience regarding the administration of Sprimeo HCT in patients who have recently \n\nundergone kidney transplantation. \n\n \n\nAs for other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, caution should be exercised when aliskiren \n\nis given in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction such as hypovolaemia (e.g. \n\ndue to blood loss, severe or prolonged diarrhoea, prolonged vomiting, etc.), heart disease, liver \n\ndisease, diabetes mellitus or kidney disease. The concomitant use of aliskiren and ACEIs or ARBs is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Acute renal failure, \n\nreversible upon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients receiving aliskiren in \n\npost-marketing experience. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, aliskiren should be \n\npromptly discontinued. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver \n\ndisease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. No \n\nadjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. No \n\ndata are available for the use of Sprimeo HCT in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Due to the \n\nhydrochlorothiazide component, Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nThere is no clinical experience with Sprimeo HCT in patients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nModerate P-gp inhibitors \n\nCo-administration of aliskiren 300 mg with ketoconazole 200 mg or verapamil 240 mg resulted in a \n\n76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. Therefore caution should be exercised when \n\naliskiren is administered with moderate P-gp inhibitors such as ketoconazole or verapamil (see section \n\n4.5). \n\n \n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \n\nAs with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral \n\nstenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n\nRenal artery stenosis and renovascular hypertension \n\nNo controlled clinical data are available on the use of Sprimeo HCT in patients with unilateral or \n\nbilateral renal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, as with other agents acting on \n\nthe renin-angiotensin system, there is an increased risk of renal insufficiency, including acute renal \n\nfailure, when patients with renal artery stenosis are treated with aliskiren. Therefore caution should be \n\nexercised in these patients. If renal failure occurs, treatment should be discontinued. \n\n \n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, have been reported to exacerbate or activate \n\nsystemic lupus erythematosus. \n\n \n\nMetabolic and endocrine effects \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels \n\nof cholesterol and triglycerides, and uric acid. In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral \n\nhypoglycaemic agents may be required. Concomitant use of Sprimeo HCT with ARBs or ACEIs is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated in symptomatic \n\nhyperuricaemia (see section 4.3). Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to \n\nreduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricaemia as well as precipitate gout \n\nin susceptible patients. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \n\nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Sprimeo HCT is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-\n\nexisting hypercalcaemia. Sprimeo HCT should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during \n\ntreatment. Serum levels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. \n\nMarked hypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be \n\ndiscontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nPhotosensitivity \n\nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If \n\nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Sprimeo HCT, it is recommended to stop the \n\ntreatment. If a re-administration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect \n\nexposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA. \n\n \n\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma \n\nHydrochlorothiazide, a sulphonamide, has been associated with an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in \n\nacute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased \n\nvisual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of treatment initiation. \n\nUntreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to \n\ndiscontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatment may need \n\nto be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute \n\nangle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulphonamide or penicillin allergy. \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\nIn the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea, Sprimeo HCT therapy should be stopped. \n\n \n\nAs with any antihypertensive agent, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with ischaemic \n\ncardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients, but are more likely in patients \n\nwith allergy and asthma. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n64 \n\nExcipients \n\nSprimeo HCT contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the \n\nLapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\nSprimeo HCT contains wheat starch. It is suitable for people with coeliac disease. Patients with wheat \n\nallergy (different from coeliac disease) should not take this medicine. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nInformation on Sprimeo HCT interactions \n\nMedicinal products affecting serum potassium levels: The potassium-depleting effect of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide is attenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of aliskiren. However, this effect of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal \n\nproducts associated with potassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, \n\ncorticosteroids, laxatives, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), amphotericin, carbenoxolone, \n\npenicillin G, salicylic acid derivatives). Conversely, concomitant use of other agents affecting the \n\nRAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum potassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, \n\npotassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum \n\npotassium. If co-medication with an agent affecting the level of serum potassium is considered \n\nnecessary, caution is advisable. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated \n\nin patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not \n\nrecommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: Periodic monitoring of serum \n\npotassium is recommended when Sprimeo HCT is administered with medicinal products affected by \n\nserum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). \n\n \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors \n\n(COX-2 inhibitors), acetylsalicylic acid and non-selective NSAIDs: As with other agents acting on the \n\nrenin-angiotensin system, NSAIDs may reduce the anti-hypertensive effect of aliskiren. NSAIDs may \n\nalso weaken the diuretic and antihypertensive activity of hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nIn some patients with compromised renal function (dehydrated patients or elderly patients) aliskiren \n\nand hydrochlorothiazide given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in further deterioration of renal \n\nfunction, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore the use of \n\nSprimeo HCT with an NSAID requires caution, especially in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nOther antihypertensive agents: The antihypertensive effect of Sprimeo HCT may be increased with \n\nthe concomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. \n\n \n\nAdditional information on aliskiren interactions \n\nThe combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus \n\nor renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see \n\nsections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nCompounds that have been investigated in aliskiren clinical pharmacokinetic studies include \n\nacenocoumarol, atenolol, celecoxib, fenofibrate, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate, \n\ndigoxin, metformin, amlodipine, atorvastatin, cimetidine and hydrochlorothiazide. No clinically \n\nrelevant interactions have been identified. As a result no dose adjustment for aliskiren or these co-\n\nadministered medicinal products is necessary. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n65 \n\nP-glycoprotein interactions: MDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system \n\ninvolved in intestinal absorption and biliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies. Rifampicin, \n\nwhich is an inducer of P-gp, reduced aliskiren bioavailability by approximately 50% in a clinical \n\nstudy. Other inducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort) might decrease the bioavailability of aliskiren. \n\nAlthough this has not been investigated for aliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake \n\nof a variety of substrates and P-gp inhibitors can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. \n\nTherefore, P-gp inhibitors may increase tissue levels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug \n\ninteractions at the P-gp site will likely depend on the degree of inhibition of this transporter. \n\n \n\nP-gp potent inhibitors: A single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that \n\nciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) increases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC \n\napproximately 5-fold. The increase may be higher with higher aliskiren doses. In healthy subjects, \n\nitraconazole (100 mg) increases AUC and Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, \n\nrespectively. Therefore, concomitant use of aliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nModerate P-gp inhibitors: Co-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) or verapamil (240 mg) with \n\naliskiren (300 mg) resulted in a 76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. The change in \n\nplasma levels of aliskiren in the presence of ketoconazole or verapamil is expected to be within the \n\nrange that would be achieved if the dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or \n\ntwice the highest recommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled \n\nclinical trials. Preclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances \n\naliskiren gastrointestinal absorption and decreases biliary excretion. Therefore, caution should be \n\nexercised when aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole, verapamil or other moderate P-gp \n\ninhibitors (clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). \n\n \n\nP-gp substrates or weak inhibitors: No relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or \n\ncimetidine have been observed. When administered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren \n\n(300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. \n\n \n\nOrganic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors: Preclinical studies indicate that aliskiren \n\nmight be a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptides. Therefore, the potential exists for \n\ninteractions between OATP inhibitors and aliskiren when administered concomitantly (see interaction \n\nwith Grapefruit juice). \n\n \n\nGrapefruit juice: Administration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and \n\nCmax of aliskiren. Co-administration with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren \n\nAUC and co-administration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. This \n\ndecrease is likely due to an inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of \n\naliskiren by grapefruit juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic \n\nfailure, grapefruit juice should not be taken together with Sprimeo HCT. \n\n \n\nFurosemide: When aliskiren was co-administered with furosemide, the AUC and Cmax of furosemide \n\nwere reduced by 28% and 49%, respectively. It is therefore recommended to monitor the effects when \n\ninitiating and adjusting furosemide therapy to avoid possible underutilisation in clinical situations of \n\nvolume overload. \n\n \n\nWarfarin: The effects of aliskiren on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. \n\n \n\nFood interactions: Meals with a high fat content have been shown to reduce the absorption of aliskiren \n\nsubstantially. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n66 \n\nAdditional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions \n\nWhen administered concurrently, the following medicinal products may interact with thiazide \n\ndiuretics: \n\n \n\nLithium: Renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, therefore the risk of lithium toxicity may \n\nbe increased with hydrochlorothiazide. Co-administration of lithium and hydrochlorothiazide is not \n\nrecommended. If this combination proves essential, careful monitoring of serum lithium level is \n\nrecommended during concomitant use. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products that could induce torsades de pointes: Due to the risk of hypokalaemia, \n\nhydrochlorothiazide should be administered with caution when associated with medicinal products \n\nthat could induce torsades de pointes, in particular Class Ia and Class III antiarrhythmics and some \n\nantipsychotics. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affecting serum sodium level: The hyponatraemic effect of diuretics may be \n\nintensified by concomitant administration of medicinal products such as antidepressants, \n\nantipsychotics, antiepileptics, etc. Caution is indicated in long-term administration of these medicinal \n\nproducts. \n\n \n\nPressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline, adrenaline): Hydrochlorothiazide may reduce the response to \n\npressor amines such as noradrenaline. The clinical significance of this effect is uncertain and not \n\nsufficient to preclude their use. \n\n \n\nDigoxine or other digitalis glycosides: Thiazide-induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia may \n\noccur as undesirable effects, favouring the onset of digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias. \n\n \n\nVitamin D and calcium salts: Administration of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, with \n\nvitamin D or with calcium salts may potentiate the rise in serum calcium. Concomitant use of thiazide \n\ntype diuretics may lead to hypercalcaemia in patients pre-disposed for hypercalcaemia (e.g. \n\nhyperparathyroidism, malignancy, or vitamin-D-mediated conditions) by increasing tubular calcium \n\nreabsorption. \n\n \n\nAntidiabetic agents (e.g. insulin and oral antidiabetic agents): Thiazides may alter glucose tolerance. \n\nDose adjustment of the antidiabetic medicinal product may be necessary (see section 4.4). Metformin \n\nshould be used with caution because of the risk of lactic acidosis induced by possible functional renal \n\nfailure linked to hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nBeta blockers and diazoxide: Concomitant use of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, \n\nwith beta blockers may increase the risk of hyperglycaemia. Thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, may enhance the hyperglycaemic effect of diazoxide. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products used in the treatment of gout: Dose adjustment of uricosuric medicinal products \n\nmay be necessary as hydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase of dose of \n\nprobenecid or sulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, may increase the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol. \n\n \n\nAnticholinergic agents and other medicinal products affecting gastric motility: The bioavailability of \n\nthiazide-type diuretics may be increased by anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, biperiden), \n\napparently due to a decrease in gastrointestinal motility and the stomach emptying rate. Conversely, it \n\nis anticipated that prokinetic substances such as cisapride may decrease the bioavailability of thiazide-\n\ntype diuretics. \n\n \n\nAmantadine: Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may increase the risk of adverse reactions \n\ncaused by amantadine. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n67 \n\nIon exchange resins: Absorption of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, is decreased by \n\ncholestyramine or colestipol. This could result in sub-therapeutic effects of thiazide diuretics. \n\nHowever, staggering the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and resin such that hydrochlorothiazide is \n\nadministered at least 4 hours before or 4-6 hours after the administration of resins would potentially \n\nminimise the interaction. \n\n \n\nCytotoxic agents: Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may reduce the renal excretion of \n\ncytotoxic agents (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their myelosuppressive effects. \n\n \n\nNon-depolarising skeletal muscle relaxants: Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, potentiate the \n\naction of skeletal muscle relaxants such as curare derivatives. \n\n \n\nAlcohol, barbiturates or narcotics: Concomitant administration of thiazide diuretics with subtances \n\nthat also have a blood pressure lowering effect (e.g. by reducing sympathetic central nervous system \n\nactivity or direct vasodilatation) may potentiate orthostatic hypotension. \n\n \n\nMethyldopa: There have been isolated reports of haemolytic anaemia occurring with concomitant use \n\nof hydrochlorothiazide and methyldopa. \n\n \n\nIodine contrasting agents: In case of diuretic-induced dehydration, there is an increased risk of acute \n\nrenal failure, especially with high doses of iodine products. Patients should be rehydrated before \n\nadministration. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women. Aliskiren was not teratogenic in rats or \n\nrabbits (see section 5.3). Other substances that act directly on the RAAS have been associated with \n\nserious foetal malformations and neonatal death when used during second and third trimesters. There \n\nis limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. \n\nAnimal studies are insufficient. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the pharmacological mechanism of action of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, its use during the second and third trimester may compromise foeto-placental \n\nperfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and \n\nthrombocytopenia. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or \n\npre-eclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a \n\nbeneficial effect on the course of the disease. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare \n\nsituations where no other treatment could be used. \n\n \n\nNo specific clinical studies have been performed with this combination, therefore Sprimeo HCT \n\nshould not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy or in women planning to become pregnant \n\nand is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). A switch to a suitable \n\nalternative treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy. If pregnancy is detected \n\nduring therapy, Sprimeo HCT should be discontinued as soon as possible. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n68 \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether aliskiren is excreted in human milk. Aliskiren was secreted in the milk of \n\nlactating rats. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \n\nintense diuresis can inhibit milk production. \n\n \n\nThe use of Sprimeo HCT during breast-feeding is not recommended. If Sprimeo HCT is used during \n\nbreast-feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nNo studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Sprimeo HCT \n\nis unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use machines. However, when driving vehicles or \n\noperating machinery it must be borne in mind that dizziness or drowsiness may occasionally occur \n\nwhen taking antihypertensive therapy. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nAliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide combination \n\nThe safety of Sprimeo HCT has been evaluated in 9 clinical trials with more than 3,900 patients, \n\nincluding over 700 treated for over 6 months, and 190 for over 1 year. The incidence of adverse \n\nreactions showed no association with gender, age, body mass index, race or ethnicity. Treatment with \n\nSprimeo HCT had an overall incidence of adverse experiences at doses up to 300 mg/25 mg similar to \n\nplacebo. Adverse reactions have generally been mild and transient in nature and have only \n\ninfrequently required discontinuation of therapy. The most common adverse drug reaction observed \n\nwith Sprimeo HCT is diarrhoea. The adverse drug reactions previously reported with one of the \n\nindividual components of Sprimeo HCT (aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide) and listed in the \n\nrespective paragraphs on the individual components may occur with Sprimeo HCT. \n\n \n\nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: very \n\ncommon (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n\n< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Common: Diarrhoea \n\n \n\nDiarrhoea: Diarrhoea is a dose-related adverse drug reaction for aliskiren. In controlled clinical trials, \n\nthe incidence of diarrhoea in Sprimeo HCT-treated patients was 1.3% compared to 1.4% for aliskiren- \n\nor 1.9% for hydrochlorothiazide-treated patients. \n\n \n\nSerum potassium: In a large placebo-controlled clinical trial, the opposite effects of aliskiren (150 mg \n\nor 300 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) on serum potassium approximately balanced \n\neach other in many patients. In other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Periodic \n\ndeterminations of serum potassium to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed in \n\npatients at risk at appropriate intervals (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nAdditional information on individual components \n\nOther adverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components may occur with \n\nSprimeo HCT even if not observed in clinical trials. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nTreatment with Aliskiren up to 300 mg resulted in an overall incidence of adverse reactions similar to \n\nplacebo. Adverse reactions have generally been mild and transient in nature and have only \n\ninfrequently required discontinuation of therapy. The most common adverse drug reaction is \n\ndiarrhoea. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n69 \n\n \n\nThe known aliskiren adverse drug reactions are presented in the table below using the same \n\nconvention as described previously for the fixed combination. \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common: Dizziness \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Uncommon: Hypotension \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Common: Diarrhoea \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n Rare: Hypersensitivity reactions \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Uncommon: Rash, severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including toxic \n\nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) and oral mucosal reactions \n\n Rare: Angioedema \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\n Common: Arthralgia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n Uncommon: Acute renal failure, renal impairment \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n Uncommon: Oedema peripheral \n\nInvestigations \n Common: Hyperkalaemia \n\n Rare: Haemoglobin decreased, haematocrit decreased \n\n Rare: Blood creatinine increased \n\n \n\nAngioedema and hypersensitivity reactions have occurred during treatment with aliskiren. In \n\ncontrolled clinical trials, angioedema and hypersensitivity reactions occurred rarely during treatment \n\nwith aliskiren with rates comparable to treatment with placebo or comparators. \n\n \n\nCases of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or \n\ntongue) have also been reported in post-marketing experience. A number of these patients had a \n\nhistory of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema which in some cases was associated \n\nwith the administration of other medicines known to cause angioedema, including RAAS blockers \n\n(ACE inhibitors or ARBs). \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions have also been reported in post-marketing experience. \n\n \n\nIn the event of any signs suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction/angioedema (in particular difficulties \n\nin breathing or swallowing, rash, itching, hives or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/or \n\ntongue, dizziness) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nArthralgia has been reported in post-marketing experience. In some cases this occurred as part of a \n\nhypersensitivity reaction. \n\n \n\nHaemoglobin and haematocrit: Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of \n\napproximately 0.05 mmol/l and 0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed. No patients \n\ndiscontinued therapy due to anaemia. This effect is also seen with other agents acting on the renin-\n\nangiotensin system, such as ACEI and ARBs. \n\n \n\nSerum potassium: Increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren and these may be \n\nexacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by NSAIDs. Consistent with \n\nstandard medical practice, periodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is \n\nadvised if co-administration is considered necessary. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or \n\nACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR \n\n< 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n70 \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, renal dysfunction and cases of acute renal failure have been reported in \n\npatients at risk (see section 4.4). There have also been reports of peripheral oedema, increase in blood \n\ncreatinine and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including toxic epidermal necrolysis \n\n(TEN) and oral mucosal reactions. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nHydrochlorothiazide has been extensively prescribed for many years, frequently in higher doses than \n\nthose contained in Sprimeo HCT. The following adverse reactions have been reported in patients \n\ntreated with thiazide diuretics alone, including hydrochlorothiazide: \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\n Rare: Thrombocytopenia sometimes with purpura \n\n Very rare: Agranulocytosis, bone marrow depression, haemolytic anaemia, \n\nleucopenia \n\n Not known: Aplastic anaemia \nImmune system disorders \n\n Very rare: Hypersensitivity \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\n Very common: Hypokalaemia \n\n Common: Hyperuricaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hyponatraemia \n\n Rare: Hypercalcaemia, hyperglycaemia, worsening of diabetic metabolic \n\nstate \n\n Very rare: Hypochloraemic alkalosis \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\n Rare: Depression, sleep disturbances \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Rare: Dizziness, headache, paraesthesia \n\nEye disorders \n\n Rare: Visual impairment \n\n Not known: Acute angle-closure glaucoma \n\nCardiac disorders \n\n Rare: Cardiac arrhythmias \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Common: Orthostatic hypotension \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\n Very rare: Respiratory distress (including pneumonitis and pulmonary oedema) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Common: Decreased appetite, mild nausea and vomiting \n\n Rare: Abdominal discomfort, constipation, diarrhoea \n\n Very rare: Pancreatitis \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\n Rare: Intrahepatic cholestasis, jaundice \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Common: Urticaria and other forms of rash \n\n Rare: Photosensitivity reactions \n\n Very rare: Cutaneous lupus erythematosus-like reactions, reactivation of \n\ncutaneous lupus erythematosus, vasculitis necrotising and toxic \n\nepidermal necrolysis \n\n Not known: Erythema multiforme \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\n Not known: Muscle spasm \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\n Not known: Renal dysfunction, acute renal failure \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n71 \n\n \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\n Common: Impotence \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n Not known: Asthenia, pyrexia \n\nInvestigations \n\n Very common: Increases in cholesterol and triglycerides \n\n Rare: Glycosuria \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nNo information is available on the treatment of overdose with Sprimeo HCT. The most likely \n\nmanifestation of overdose would be hypotension, related to the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren. \n\n \n\nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \n\nhypochloraemia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most \n\ncommon signs and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in \n\nmuscle spasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \n\nglycosides or certain antiarrhythmic medicinal products. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, \n\nsupportive treatment should be initiated. \n\n \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis, dialysis \n\nclearance of aliskiren was low (< 2% of oral clearance). Therefore dialysis is not adequate to treat \n\naliskiren over-exposure. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Renin inhibitor (aliskiren) combinations with diuretics \n\n(hydrochlorothiazide), ATC code: C09XA52 \n\nSprimeo HCT combines two antihypertensive compounds to control blood pressure in patients with \n\nessential hypertension: Aliskiren belongs to the class of direct renin inhibitors and hydrochlorothiazide \n\nto the class of thiazide diuretics. The combination of these substances with complementary \n\nmechanisms of action provides an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a \n\ngreater degree than either component alone. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAliskiren is an orally active, non-peptide, potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin. \n\n \n\nBy inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAAS at the point of activation, blocking the \n\nconversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and \n\nangiotensin II. Whereas other agents that inhibit the RAAS (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors \n\n(ACEI) and angiotension II receptor blockers (ARB)) cause a compensatory rise in plasma renin \n\nactivity (PRA), treatment with aliskiren decreases PRA in hypertensive patients by approximately 50 \n\nto 80%. Similar reductions were found when aliskiren was combined with other antihypertensive \n\nagents. The clinical implications of the effects on PRA are not known at the present time. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of aliskiren at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg \n\nprovided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained \n\nover the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a mean peak to \n\ntrough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose. 85 to 90% of the maximal blood-\n\npressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering effect was \n\nsustained during long-term treatment (12 months), and was independent of age, gender, body mass \n\nindex and ethnicity. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n72 \n\nCombination therapy studies are available for aliskiren added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the \n\ncalcium channel blocker amlodipine and the beta blocker atenolol. These combinations were \n\nefficacious and well tolerated. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of aliskiren-based therapy were compared to ramipril-based therapy in a 9-\n\nmonth non-inferiority study in 901 elderly patients (≥ 65 years) with essential systolic hypertension. \n\nAliskiren 150 mg or 300 mg per day or ramipril 5 mg or 10 mg per day were administered for \n\n36 weeks with optional add-on therapy of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) at week 12, and \n\namlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) at week 22. Over the 12 week period, aliskiren monotherapy lowered \n\nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure by 14.0/5.1 mmHg, compared to 11.6/3.6 mmHg for ramipril, \n\nconsistent with aliskiren being non-inferior to ramipril at the dosages chosen and the differences in \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significant. Tolerability was comparable in both \n\ntreatment arms, however cough was more often reported with the ramipril regimen than the aliskiren \n\nregimen (14.2% vs. 4.4%), whilst diarrhoea was more common with the aliskiren regimen than for the \n\nramipril regimen (6.6% vs. 5.0%). \n\n \n\nIn a 8-week study in 754 hypertensive elderly (≥ 65 years) and very elderly patients (30% ≥ 75 years) \n\naliskiren at doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg provided statistically significant superior reduction in \n\nblood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) when compared to placebo. No additional blood pressure \n\nlowering effect was detected with 300 mg aliskiren compared to 150 mg aliskiren. All three doses \n\nwere well tolerated in both elderly and very elderly patients. \n\n \n\nThere has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in \n\ncontrolled clinical studies. With cessation of treatment, blood pressure gradually returned towards \n\nbaseline levels over a period of several weeks, with no evidence of a rebound effect for blood pressure \n\nor PRA. \n\n \n\nIn a 36-week study involving 820 patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, no changes in \n\nventricular remodelling as assessed by left ventricular end systolic volume were detected with \n\naliskiren compared to placebo on top of background therapy. \n\n \n\nThe combined rates of cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, recurrent heart attack, \n\nstroke and resuscitated sudden death were similar in the aliskiren group and the placebo group. \n\nHowever, in patients receiving aliskiren there was a significantly higher rate of hyperkalaemia, \n\nhypotension and kidney dysfunction when compared to the placebo group. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was evaluated for cardiovascular and/or renal benefit in a double-blind placebo controlled \n\nrandomised trial in 8,606 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (evidenced by \n\nproteinuria and/or GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) with or without cardiovascular disease. In most patients \n\narterial blood pressure was well controlled at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of \n\ncardiovascular and renal complications. \n\n \n\nIn this study, aliskiren 300 mg was compared to placebo when added to standard of care which \n\nincluded either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. The \n\nstudy was discontinued prematurely because the participants were unlikely to benefit from aliskiren. \n\nPreliminary study results indicated a hazard ratio for the primary endpoint of 1.09 in favour of placebo \n\n(95% Confidence Interval: 0.97, 1.22, 2-sided p=0.17). In addition, an increased incidence of serious \n\nadverse outcomes was observed with aliskiren compared to placebo for renal complications (4.7% \n\nversus 3.3%), hyperkalaemia (36.9% versus 27.1%), hypotension (18.4% versus 14.6%) and stroke \n\n(2.7% versus 2.0%). The increased incidence of non-fatal stroke was greater in patients with renal \n\ninsufficiency. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n73 \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nThe site of action of thiazide diuretics is primarily in the renal distal convoluted tubule. It has been \n\nshown that there is a high-affinity receptor in the renal cortex as the primary binding site for the \n\nthiazide diuretic action and inhibition of NaCl transport in the distal convoluted tubule. The mode of \n\naction of thiazides is through inhibition of the Na+Cl- symporter by competing for the Cl- site, thereby \n\naffecting electrolyte reabsorption mechanisms: directly increasing sodium and chloride excretion to an \n\napproximately equal extent, and indirectly by this diuretic action reducing plasma volume, with \n\nconsequent increases in plasma renin activity, aldosterone secretion and urinary potassium loss, and a \n\ndecrease in serum potassium. \n\n \n\nAliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nOver 3,900 hypertensive patients received Sprimeo HCT once daily in clinical trials. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of Sprimeo HCT provided dose-dependent \n\nreductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained over the entire 24-hour \n\ndose interval. The antihypertensive effect is largely manifested within 1 week and the maximum effect \n\nis generally seen within 4 weeks.The blood-pressure-lowering effect was sustained during long-term \n\ntreatment, and was independent of age, gender, body mass index and ethnicity. The antihypertensive \n\neffect of a single dose of the combination persisted for 24 hours. Upon withdrawal of the aliskiren \n\ntreatment (aliskiren with or without hydrochlorothiazide add-on), the return of blood pressure towards \n\nbaseline was gradual (3-4 weeks) with no evidence of the rebound effect. \n\n \n\nSprimeo HCT was studied in a placebo-controlled trial including 2,762 hypertensive patients with \n\ndiastolic blood pressure ≥ 95 mmHg and < 110 mmHg (mean baseline blood pressure of \n\n153.6/99.2 mmHg). In this study, Sprimeo HCT in doses from 150 mg/12.5 mg to 300 mg/25 mg \n\nproduced dose-dependent blood pressure reductions (systolic/diastolic) from 17.6/11.9 mmHg to \n\n21.2/14.3 mmHg, respectively, compared to 7.5/6.9 mmHg with placebo. The greater blood pressure \n\nreductions with these combination doses were also significantly greater than the respective doses of \n\naliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide when used alone. The combination of aliskiren and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide neutralised the reactive increase of PRA caused by hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nWhen administered in hypertensive patients with markedly elevated blood pressure (systolic blood \n\npressure ≥ 160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mmHg), Sprimeo HCT in doses from \n\n150 mg/12.5 mg to 300 mg/25 mg administered without up-titration from monotherapy demonstrated \n\nsignificantly greater systolic/diastolic blood pressure control rates (< 140/90 mmHg) as compared to \n\nthe respective monotherapies. In this population, Sprimeo HCT 150 mg/12.5 mg to 300 mg/25 mg \n\nprovided dose-dependent systolic/diastolic blood pressure reduction from 20.6/12.4 mmHg to \n\n24.8/14.5 mmHg, which were significantly superior to the respective monotherapies. The safety of the \n\ncombination therapy was similar to the respective monotherapies regardless of severity of \n\nhypertension or of the presence or absence of additional cardiovascular risk. Hypotension and related \n\nadverse events were uncommon with the combination treatment, with no increased incidence in \n\nelderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn a study in 880 randomised patients not adequately responsive to aliskiren 300 mg treatment, the \n\ncombination of aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg produced systolic/diastolic blood \n\npressure reductions of 15.8/11.0 mmHg, which were significantly greater than aliskiren 300 mg \n\nmonotherapy. In a study in 722 randomised patients not adequately responsive to hydrochlorothiazide \n\n25 mg treatment, the combination of aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg produced \n\nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure reductions of 16.78/10.7 mmHg, which were significantly greater \n\nthan hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg monotherapy. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n74 \n\nIn another clinical trial, the efficacy and safety of Sprimeo HCT were also assessed in 489 obese \n\nhypertensive patients who did not respond to hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (baseline systolic/diastolic \n\nblood pressure 149.4/96.8 mmHg). In this difficult-to-treat population, Sprimeo HCT provided a blood \n\npressure reduction (systolic/diastolic) of 15.8/11.9 mmHg compared to 15.4/11.3 mmHg for \n\nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 13.6/10.3 mmHg for amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide and \n\n8.6/7.9 mmHg for hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy, with similar safety to hydrochlorothiazide \n\nmonotherapy. \n\n \n\nIn a study in 183 randomised patients with severe hypertension (mean sitting diastolic blood pressure \n\n≥ 105 and < 120 mmHg), aliskiren treatment regimen with optional addition of hydrochlorothiazide \n\n25 mg was shown to be safe and efficacious in reducing blood pressure. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nAliskiren \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral absorption, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours. The \n\nabsolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3%. Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax \n\nby 85% and AUC by 70%. Steady-state-plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days following \n\nonce-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than with the initial \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is approximately \n\n135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space. Aliskiren \n\nplasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. \n\n \n\nMetabolism and elimination \n\nThe mean half-life is about 40 hours (range 34-41 hours). Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as unchanged \n\ncompound in the faeces (oral radioactive dose recovery = 91%). Approximately 1.4% of the total oral \n\ndose is metabolised. The enzyme responsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4. Approximately 0.6% of \n\nthe dose is recovered in urine following oral administration. Following intravenous administration, the \n\nmean plasma clearance is approximately 9 l/h. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nExposure to aliskiren increased slightly more than in proportion to the increase in dose. After single \n\ndose administration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and \n\n2.6-fold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively. Mechanisms responsible for the deviation from dose \n\nproportionality have not been identified. A possible mechanism is saturation of transporters at the \n\nabsorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe absorption of hydrochlorothiazide, after an oral dose, is rapid (Tmax about 2 h). The increase in \n\nmean AUC is linear and dose proportional in the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\nThe effect of food on hydrochlorothiazide absorption, if any, has little clinical significance. Absolute \n\nbioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide is 70% after oral administration. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe apparent volume of distribution is 4-8 l/kg. Circulating hydrochlorothiazide is bound to serum \n\nproteins (40-70%), mainly serum albumin. Hydrochlorothiazide also accumulates in erythrocytes at \n\napproximately 3 times the level in plasma. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n75 \n\nMetabolism and elimination \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is eliminated predominantly as unchanged compound. Hydrochlorothiazide is \n\neliminated from plasma with a half-life averaging 6 to 15 hours in the terminal elimination phase. \n\nThere is no change in the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on repeated dosing, and accumulation is \n\nminimal when dosed once daily. There is more than 95% of the absorbed dose being excreted as \n\nunchanged compound in the urine. The renal clearance is composed of passive filtration and active \n\nsecretion into the renal tubule. \n\n \n\nAliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nFollowing oral administration of Sprimeo HCT tablets, the median peak plasma concentration time is \n\nwithin 1 hour for aliskiren and 2.5 hours for hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nThe rate and extent of absorption of Sprimeo HCT are equivalent to the bioavailability of aliskiren and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide when administered as individual monotherapies. Similar food effect was observed \n\nfor Sprimeo HCT as for the individual monotherapies. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in patients \n\nSprimeo HCT has been shown to be effective as a once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult \n\npatients, regardless of gender, age, body mass index and ethnicity. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren are not significantly affected in patients with mild to moderate liver \n\ndisease. Consequently, no initial dose adjustment of Sprimeo HCT is required in patients with mild to \n\nmoderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on patients with severe hepatic impairment treated \n\nby Sprimeo HCT. Sprimeo HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.4). In the presence of renal impairment, mean peak plasma levels and AUC values \n\nof hydrochlorothiazide are increased and the urinary excretion rate is reduced. In patients with mild to \n\nmoderate renal impairment, a 3-fold increase in hydrochlorothiazide AUC has been observed. In \n\npatients with severe renal impairment an 8-fold increase in AUC has been observed. Sprimeo HCT is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with anuria or severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and the \n\nconcomitant use of Sprimeo HCT with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with renal \n\nimpairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease receiving \n\nhaemodialysis. Administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg aliskiren was associated with very \n\nminor changes in the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren (change in Cmax of less than 1.2 fold; increase in \n\nAUC of up to 1.6 fold) compared to matched healthy subjects. Timing of haemodialysis did not \n\nsignificantly alter the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren in ESRD patients. Therefore, if administration of \n\naliskiren in ESRD patients receiving haemodialysis is considered necessary, no dose adjustment is \n\nwarranted in these patients. However, the use of aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nNo initial dose adjustment of Sprimeo HCT is required in elderly patients. Limited data suggest that \n\nthe systemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and hypertensive elderly \n\nsubjects compared to young healthy volunteers. \n\n \n\nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n76 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nSafety pharmacology studies with aliskiren did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous, \n\nrespiratory or cardiovascular function. Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were \n\nconsistent with the known local irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of \n\naliskiren. No carcinogenic potential for aliskiren was detected in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month \n\ntransgenic mouse study. One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded in rats at the \n\ndose of 1,500 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. Aliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic \n\npotential, embryo-foetal toxicity or teratogenicity. Fertility, prenatal development and postnatal \n\ndevelopment were unaffected in rats. \n\n \n\nPreclinical evaluations to support the administration of hydrochlorothiazide in humans included in \n\nvitro genotoxicity assays and reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in rodents. Extensive \n\nclinical data are available for hydrochlorothiazide and these are reflected in the relevant sections. \n\n \n\nThe findings observed in the 2-week and 13-week toxicity studies were consistent with those observed \n\npreviously with aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapies. There were no new or unexpected \n\nfindings observed of relevance to human use. Increased cellular vacuolation of the adrenal gland zona \n\nglomerulosa was observed during the 13-week toxicity study in rats. The finding was observed in \n\nanimals treated with hydrochlorothiazide but not in those animals receiving aliskiren alone or vehicle. \n\nThere was no evidence that this finding was enhanced in the aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide \n\ncombination as it was only apparent at a minimal severity in all animals. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Further information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. WHAT SPRIMEO HCT IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n\n \n\nSprimeo HCT tablets contain two active substances, called aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide. Both of \n\nthese substances help to control high blood pressure (hypertension). \n\n \n\nAliskiren is a substance that belongs to a new group of medicines called renin inhibitors. These reduce \n\nthe amount of angiotensin II the body can make. Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to tighten, which \n\nmakes blood pressure higher. Lowering the amount of angiotensin II allows the blood vessels to relax; \n\nthis lowers blood pressure. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of medicines called thiazide diuretics. Hydrochlorothiazide \n\nincreases urine output, which also lowers blood pressure. \n\n \n\nHigh blood pressure increases the workload of the heart and arteries. If this continues for a long time, \n\nit can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart and kidneys, and may result in a stroke, heart \n\nfailure, heart attack or kidney failure. Lowering the blood pressure to a normal level reduces the risk of \n\ndeveloping these disorders. \n\n \n\nSprimeo HCT is used to treat high blood pressure. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n137 \n\n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE SPRIMEO HCT \n\n \n\nDo not take Sprimeo HCT \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide, to sulphonamide-derived \n\nmedicines (medicines used to treat chest or urinary infections) or to any of the other ingredients \n\nof Sprimeo HCT. If you think you may be allergic, do not take Sprimeo HCT and ask your \n\ndoctor for advice. \n\n- if you have experienced the following forms of angioedema (difficulties in breathing or \nswallowing, or swelling of the face, hands and feet, eyes, lips and/or tongue): \n\n- angioedema when taking aliskiren \n- hereditary angioedema \n- angioedema without any known cause. \n\n- if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Sprimeo HCT in early \npregnancy – see Pregnancy section.) \n\n- if you are between three and nine months pregnant. \n- if you have serious liver or serious kidney problems. \n- if you are unable to produce urine (anuria). \n- if the level of potassium or sodium in your blood is too low despite treatment. \n- if the level of calcium in your blood is too high despite treatment. \n- if you have gout (uric acid crystals in the joints). \n- if you are taking ciclosporin (a medicine used in transplantation to prevent organ rejection or for \n\nother conditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis), itraconazole (a medicine used to \n\ntreat fungal infections) or quinidine (a medicine used to correct heart rhythm). \n\n- if you have diabetes mellitus or impaired kidney function and you are treated with either of the \nfollowing classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an “angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor” such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril etc. \nor \n\n- an “angiotensin 2 receptor blocker” such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan etc. \nIf any of the above applies to you, do not take Sprimeo HCT and talk to your doctor. \n \n\nTake special care with Sprimeo HCT \n- if you have impaired kidney function, your doctor will carefully consider whether Sprimeo HCT \n\nis suitable for you and may wish to monitor you carefully. \n\n- if you have had a kidney transplant. \n- if you suffer from liver problems. \n- if you suffer from heart problems. \n- if you experience angioedema (difficulties in breathing, or swallowing, or swelling of the face, \n\nhands and feet, eyes, lips and/or tongue). If this happens, stop taking Sprimeo HCT and contact \n\nyour doctor. \n\n- if you have diabetes (high level of sugar in your blood). \n- if you have a high level of cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood. \n- if you suffer from a disease called lupus erythematosus (also called “lupus” or “SLE”). \n- if you suffer from allergy or asthma. \n- if you are taking either of the following classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an “angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor” such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril etc. \n\nor \n\n- an “angiotensin 2 receptor blocker” such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan etc. \n\n- if you are on a low-salt diet. \n- if you have signs and symptoms such as abnormal thirst, dry mouth, general weakness, \n\ndrowsiness, muscle pain or cramps, nausea, vomiting, or an abnormally fast heart beat which \n\nmay indicate an excessive effect of hydrochlorothiazide (contained in Sprimeo HCT). \n\n- if you experience skin reactions such as rash after sun exposure. \n- if you experience a decrease in vision or eye pain. These could be symptoms of an increase of \n\npressure in your eye and can happen within hours to weeks of taking Sprimeo HCT.

Your doctor will normally \n\nadvise you to stop taking Sprimeo HCT before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are \n\npregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Sprimeo HCT. Sprimeo HCT is not \n\nrecommended during pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may \n\ncause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Sprimeo HCT is not \n\nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for \n\nyou if you wish to breast-feed. \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nAs with many other medicines used to treat high blood pressure, this medicine may make you feel \n\ndizzy.

HOW TO TAKE SPRIMEO HCT \n\n \n\nAlways take Sprimeo HCT exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nThe usual dose of Sprimeo HCT is one tablet a day. Swallow the tablet whole with some water. You \n\nshould take Sprimeo HCT with a light meal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. You \n\nshould not take Sprimeo HCT together with grapefruit juice. During your treatment, your doctor may \n\nadjust your dose depending on your blood pressure response. \n\n \n\nSprimeo HCT may have been prescribed to you because your previous treatment did not lower your \n\nblood pressure enough. If this is the case, your doctor will tell you how to switch from that treatment \n\nto Sprimeo HCT. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Sprimeo HCT than you should \nIf you have accidentally taken too many Sprimeo HCT tablets, talk to a doctor immediately. You may \n\nrequire medical attention. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Sprimeo HCT \nIf you forget to take a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as you remember and then take the next \n\ndose at its usual time. If it is almost time for your next dose you should simply take the next tablet at \n\nthe usual time. Do not take a double dose (two tablets at once) to make up for a forgotten tablet. \n\n \n\nDo not stop taking this medicine, even if you are feeling well (unless your doctor tells you to do so). \n\nPeople who have high blood pressure often do not notice any signs of the problem. Many may feel \n\nquite normal. It is very important that you take this medicine exactly as your doctor tells you to get the \n\nbest results and reduce the risk of side effects. Keep your appointments with the doctor even if you are \n\nfeeling well. \n\nIf you have further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n140 \n\n \n\n4.
