NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nClopidogrel BMS 75 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 75 mg of clopidogrel (as hydrogen sulphate). \nExcipients: each tablet contains 3 mg lactose and 3.3 mg hydrogenated castor oil. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3.  PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nPink, round, biconvex, engraved with «75» on one side and «1171» on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nClopidogrel is indicated in adults for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in: \n \n• Patients suffering from myocardial infarction (from a few days until less than 35 days), \n\nischaemic stroke (from 7 days until less than 6 months) or established peripheral arterial disease. \n \n• Patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome: \n\n- Non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave \nmyocardial infarction), including patients undergoing a stent placement following \npercutaneous coronary intervention, in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). \n\n- ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction, in combination with ASA in medically \ntreated patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy. \n\n \nFor further information please refer to section 5.1. \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n• Adults and elderly \n \n\nClopidogrel should be given as a single daily dose of 75 mg with or without food.  \n \nIn patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome: \n\n− Non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave \nmyocardial infarction): clopidogrel treatment should be initiated with a single 300-mg \nloading dose and then continued at 75 mg once a day (with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) \n75 mg-325 mg daily). Since higher doses of ASA were associated with higher bleeding \nrisk it is recommended that the dose of ASA should not be higher than 100 mg. The \noptimal duration of treatment has not been formally established. Clinical trial data \nsupport use up to 12 months, and the maximum benefit was seen at 3 months (see \nsection 5.1). \n\n- ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction: clopidogrel should be given as a \nsingle daily dose of 75 mg initiated with a 300-mg loading dose in combination with \nASA and with or without thrombolytics. For patients over 75 years of age clopidogrel \nshould be initiated without a loading dose. Combined therapy should be started as early \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n3 \n\nas possible after symptoms start and continued for at least four weeks. The benefit of the \ncombination of clopidogrel with ASA beyond four weeks has not been studied in this \nsetting (see section 5.1). \n\n \n• Pharmacogenetics \n\nCYP2C19 poor metaboliser status is associated with diminished response to clopidogrel. The \noptimal dose regimen for poor metabolisers has yet to be determined (see section 5.2). \n \n\n• Paediatric patients \nThe safety and efficacy of clopidogrel in children and adolescents have not yet been established. \n\n \n• Renal impairment \n\nTherapeutic experience is limited in patients with renal impairment (see section 4.4). \n \n\n• Hepatic impairment \nTherapeutic experience is limited in patients with moderate hepatic disease who may have \nbleeding diatheses (see section 4.4). \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n• Severe liver impairment. \n• Active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial haemorrhage. \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \nDue to the risk of bleeding and haematological undesirable effects, blood cell count determination \nand/or other appropriate testing should be promptly considered whenever clinical symptoms suggestive \nof bleeding arise during the course of treatment (see section 4.8). As with other antiplatelet agents, \nclopidogrel should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding from \ntrauma, surgery or other pathological conditions and in patients receiving treatment with ASA, heparin, \nglycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including Cox-2 \ninhibitors. Patients should be followed carefully for any signs of bleeding including occult bleeding, \nespecially during the first weeks of treatment and/or after invasive cardiac procedures or surgery. The \nconcomitant administration of clopidogrel with oral anticoagulants is not recommended since it may \nincrease the intensity of bleedings (see section 4.5). \n \nIf a patient is to undergo elective surgery and antiplatelet effect is temporarily not desirable, \nclopidogrel should be discontinued 7 days prior to surgery. Patients should inform physicians and \ndentists that they are taking clopidogrel before any surgery is scheduled and before any new medicinal \nproduct is taken. Clopidogrel prolongs bleeding time and should be used with caution in patients who \nhave lesions with a propensity to bleed (particularly gastrointestinal and intraocular). \n \nPatients should be told that it might take longer than usual to stop bleeding when they take clopidogrel \n(alone or in combination with ASA), and that they should report any unusual bleeding (site or duration) \nto their physician.  \n \nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been reported very rarely following the use of \nclopidogrel, sometimes after a short exposure. It is characterised by thrombocytopenia and \nmicroangiopathic haemolytic anaemia associated with either neurological findings, renal dysfunction \nor fever. TTP is a potentially fatal condition requiring prompt treatment including plasmapheresis. \n \nIn view of the lack of data, clopidogrel cannot be recommended during the first 7 days after acute \nischaemic stroke. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n4 \n\nPharmacogenetics: Based on literature data, patients with genetically reduced CYP2C19 function have \nlower systemic exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel and diminished antiplatelet responses, \nand generally exhibit higher cardiovascular event rates following myocardial infarction than do \npatients with normal CYP2C19 function (see section 5.2). \n \nSince clopidogrel is metabolised to its active metabolite partly by CYP2C19, use of drugs that inhibit \nthe activity of this enzyme would be expected to result in reduced drug levels of the active metabolite \nof clopidogrel and a reduction in clinical efficacy. Concomitant use of drugs that inhibit CYP2C19 \nshould be discouraged (see section 4.5 for a list of CYP2C19 inhibitors, see also section 5.2).  \nAlthough the evidence of CYP2C19 inhibition varies within the class of Proton Pump Inhibitors, \nclinical studies suggest an interaction between clopidogrel and possibly all members of this class. \nTherefore, concomitant use of Proton Pump Inhibitors should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. \nThere is no evidence that other drugs that reduce stomach acid such as H2 blockers or antacids \ninterfere with antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel. \n \nTherapeutic experience with clopidogrel is limited in patients with renal impairment. Therefore \nclopidogrel should be used with caution in these patients (see section 4.2). \n \nExperience is limited in patients with moderate hepatic disease who may have bleeding diatheses. \nClopidogrel should therefore be used with caution in this population (see section 4.2). \n \nClopidogrel BMS contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the \nLapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \nThis medicinal product contains hydrogenated castor oil which may cause stomach upset and \ndiarrhoea. \n \n4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nOral anticoagulants: the concomitant administration of clopidogrel with oral anticoagulants is not \nrecommended since it may increase the intensity of bleedings (see section 4.4). \n \nGlycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors: clopidogrel should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk \nof increased bleeding from trauma, surgery or other pathological conditions that receive concomitant \nglycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (see section 4.4). \n \nAcetylsalicylic acid (ASA): ASA did not modify the clopidogrel-mediated inhibition of ADP-induced \nplatelet aggregation, but clopidogrel potentiated the effect of ASA on collagen-induced platelet \naggregation. However, concomitant administration of 500 mg of ASA twice a day for one day did not \nsignificantly increase the prolongation of bleeding time induced by clopidogrel intake. A \npharmacodynamic interaction between clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid is possible, leading to \nincreased risk of bleeding. Therefore, concomitant use should be undertaken with caution (see section \n4.4). However, clopidogrel and ASA have been administered together for up to one year (see section \n5.1). \n \nHeparin: in a clinical study conducted in healthy subjects, clopidogrel did not necessitate modification \nof the heparin dose or alter the effect of heparin on coagulation. Co-administration of heparin had no \neffect on the inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by clopidogrel. A pharmacodynamic interaction \nbetween clopidogrel and heparin is possible, leading to increased risk of bleeding. Therefore, \nconcomitant use should be undertaken with caution (see section 4.4). \n \nThrombolytics: the safety of the concomitant administration of clopidogrel, fibrin or non-fibrin specific \nthrombolytic agents and heparins was assessed in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The \nincidence of clinically significant bleeding was similar to that observed when thrombolytic agents and \nheparin are co-administered with ASA (see section 4.8) \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n5 \n\nNSAIDs: in a clinical study conducted in healthy volunteers, the concomitant administration of \nclopidogrel and naproxen increased occult gastrointestinal blood loss. However, due to the lack of \ninteraction studies with other NSAIDs it is presently unclear whether there is an increased risk of \ngastrointestinal bleeding with all NSAIDs. Consequently, NSAIDs including Cox-2 inhibitors and \nclopidogrel should be co-administered with caution (see section 4.4). \n \nOther concomitant therapy:  \nSince clopidogrel is metabolised to its active metabolite partly by CYP2C19, use of drugs that inhibit \nthe activity of this enzyme would be expected to result in reduced drug levels of the active metabolite \nof clopidogrel and a reduction in clinical efficacy. Concomitant use of drugs that inhibit CYP2C19  \nshould be discouraged (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nDrugs that inhibit CYP2C19 include omeprazole and esomeprazole, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, \nmoclobemide, voriconazole, fluconazole, ticlopidine, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine, carbamazepine, \noxcarbazepine and chloramphenicol. \n \nProton Pump Inhibitors: \nAlthough the evidence of CYP2C19 inhibition varies within the class of Proton Pump Inhibitors, \nclinical studies suggest an interaction between clopidogrel and possibly all members of this class. \nTherefore, concomitant use of Proton Pump Inhibitors should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. \nThere is no evidence that other drugs that reduce stomach acid such as H2 blockers or antacids \ninterfere with antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel. \n \nA number of other clinical studies have been conducted with clopidogrel and other concomitant \nmedicinal products to investigate the potential for pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions. \nNo clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidogrel was \nco-administered with atenolol, nifedipine, or both atenolol and nifedipine. Furthermore, the \npharmacodynamic activity of clopidogrel was not significantly influenced by the co-administration of \nphenobarbital, cimetidine, or oestrogen. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of digoxin or theophylline were not modified by the co-administration of \nclopidogrel. Antacids did not modify the extent of clopidogrel absorption. \n \nData from studies with human liver microsomes indicated that the carboxylic acid metabolite of \nclopidogrel could inhibit the activity of Cytochrome P450 2C9. This could potentially lead to increased \nplasma levels of medicinal products such as phenytoin and tolbutamide and the NSAIDs, which are \nmetabolised by Cytochrome P450 2C9. Data from the CAPRIE study indicate that phenytoin and \ntolbutamide can be safely co-administered with clopidogrel. \n \nApart from the specific medicinal product interaction information described above, interaction studies \nwith clopidogrel and some medicinal products commonly administered in patients with \natherothrombotic disease have not been performed. However, patients entered into clinical trials with \nclopidogrel received a variety of concomitant medicinal products including diuretics, beta blockers, \nACEI, calcium antagonists, cholesterol lowering agents, coronary vasodilators, antidiabetic agents \n(including insulin), antiepileptic agents, and GPIIb/IIIa antagonists without evidence of clinically \nsignificant adverse interactions. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nAs no clinical data on exposure to clopidogrel during pregnancy are available, it is preferable not to \nuse clopidogrel during pregnancy as a precautionary measure. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, \nembryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n6 \n\nIt is unknown whether clopidogrel is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of clopidogrel in breast milk. As a precautionary measure, breast-feeding should not be \ncontinued during treatment with Clopidogrel BMS.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nClopidogrel has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nClopidogrel has been evaluated for safety in more than 42,000 patients who have participated in \nclinical studies, including over 9,000 patients treated for 1 year or more. The clinically relevant \nadverse reactions observed in the CAPRIE, CURE, CLARITY and COMMIT studies are discussed \nbelow. Overall, clopidogrel 75 mg/day was comparable to ASA 325 mg/day in CAPRIE regardless of \nage, gender and race. In addition to clinical studies experience, adverse reactions have been \nspontaneously reported. \n \nBleeding is the most common reaction reported both in clinical studies as well as in post-marketing \nexperience where it was mostly reported during the first month of treatment. \n \nIn CAPRIE, in patients treated with either clopidogrel or ASA, the overall incidence of any bleeding \nwas 9.3%. The incidence of severe cases was 1.4% for clopidogrel and 1.6% for ASA. \n \nIn CURE, the major bleeding event rate for clopidogrel+ASA was dose-dependent on ASA (<100mg: \n2.6%; 100-200mg: 3.5%; >200mg: 4.9%) as was the major bleeding event rate for placebo+ASA \n(<100mg: 2.0%; 100-200mg: 2.3%; >200mg: 4.0%). The risk of bleeding (life-threatening, major, \nminor, other) decreased during the course of the trial: 0-1 months (clopidogrel: 9.6%; placebo: 6.6%), \n1-3 months (clopidogrel: 4.5%; placebo: 2.3%), 3-6 months (clopidogrel: 3.8%; placebo: 1.6%), \n6-9 months (clopidogrel: 3.2%; placebo: 1.5%), 9-12 months (clopidogrel: 1.9%; placebo: 1.0%). \nThere was no excess in major bleeds with clopidogrel + ASA within 7 days after coronary bypass graft \nsurgery in patients who stopped therapy more than five days prior to surgery (4.4% clopidogrel+ASA \nvs. 5.3% placebo+ASA). In patients who remained on therapy within five days of bypass graft surgery, \nthe event rate was 9.6% for clopidogrel+ASA, and 6.3% for placebo+ASA. \n \nIn CLARITY, there was an overall increase in bleeding in the clopidogrel + ASA group (17.4%) vs. \nthe placebo + ASA group (12.9%).The incidence of major bleeding was similar between groups (1.3% \nversus 1.1% for the clopidogrel + ASA and the placebo + ASA groups, respectively). This was \nconsistent across subgroups of patients defined by baseline characteristics, and type of fibrinolytic or \nheparin therapy.  \n \nIn COMMIT, the overall rate of noncerebral major bleeding or cerebral bleeding was low and similar \nin both groups (0.6% versus 0.5% in the clopidogrel + ASA and the placebo + ASA groups, \nrespectively). \n \nAdverse reactions that occurred either during clinical studies or that were spontaneously reported are \npresented in the table below. Their frequency is defined using the following conventions: common \n(≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: platelet aggregation inhibitors excl. heparin, ATC Code: B01AC-04.  \n \nClopidogrel is a prodrug, one of whose metabolites is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel \nmust be metabolised by CYP450 enzymes to produce the active metabolite that inhibits platelet \naggregation. The active metabolite of clopidogrel selectively inhibits the binding of adenosine \ndiphosphate (ADP) to its platelet P2Y12 receptor and the subsequent ADP-mediated activation of the \nglycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation. Due to the irreversible \nbinding, platelets exposed are affected for the remainder of their lifespan (approximately 7-10 days) \nand recovery of normal platelet function occurs at a rate consistent with platelet turnover. Platelet \naggregation induced by agonists other than ADP is also inhibited by blocking the amplification of \nplatelet activation by released ADP. \n \nBecause the active metabolite is formed by CYP450 enzymes, some of which are polymorphic or \nsubject to inhibition by other drugs, not all patients will have adequate platelet inhibition. \n \nRepeated doses of 75 mg per day produced substantial inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation \nfrom the first day; this increased progressively and reached steady state between Day 3 and Day 7. At \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n9 \n\nsteady state, the average inhibition level observed with a dose of 75 mg per day was between 40% and \n60%. Platelet aggregation and bleeding time gradually returned to baseline values, generally within \n5 days after treatment was discontinued. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of clopidogrel have been evaluated in 4 double-blind studies involving over \n80,000 patients: the CAPRIE study, a comparison of clopidogrel to ASA, and the CURE, CLARITY \nand COMMIT studies comparing clopidogrel to placebo, both medicinal products given in \ncombination with ASA and other standard therapy. \n \nRecent myocardial infarction (MI), recent stroke or established peripheral arterial disease \n \nThe CAPRIE study included 19,185 patients with atherothrombosis as manifested by recent \nmyocardial infarction (<35 days), recent ischaemic stroke (between 7 days and 6 months) or \nestablished peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Patients were randomised to clopidogrel 75 mg/day or \nASA 325 mg/day, and were followed for 1 to 3 years. In the myocardial infarction subgroup, most of \nthe patients received ASA for the first few days following the acute myocardial infarction. \n \nClopidogrel significantly reduced the incidence of new ischaemic events (combined end point of \nmyocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and vascular death) when compared to ASA. In the intention to \ntreat analysis, 939 events were observed in the clopidogrel group and 1,020 events with ASA (relative \nrisk reduction (RRR) 8.7%, [95% CI: 0.2 to 16.4]; p = 0.045), which corresponds, for every \n1,000 patients treated for 2 years, to 10 [CI: 0 to 20] additional patients being prevented from \nexperiencing a new ischaemic event. Analysis of total mortality as a secondary endpoint did not show \nany significant difference between clopidogrel (5.8%) and ASA (6.0%). \n \nIn a subgroup analysis by qualifying condition (myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, and PAD) the \nbenefit appeared to be strongest (achieving statistical significance at p = 0.003) in patients enrolled due \nto PAD (especially those who also had a history of myocardial infarction) (RRR = 23.7%; CI: 8.9 to \n36.2) and weaker (not significantly different from ASA) in stroke patients (RRR = 7.3%; CI: -5.7 to \n18.7 [p=0.258]). In patients who were enrolled in the trial on the sole basis of a recent myocardial \ninfarction, clopidogrel was numerically inferior, but not statistically different from ASA (RRR = \n-4.0%; CI: -22.5 to 11.7 [p=0.639]). In addition, a subgroup analysis by age suggested that the benefit \nof clopidogrel in patients over 75 years was less than that observed in patients ≤75 years. \n \nSince the CAPRIE trial was not powered to evaluate efficacy of individual subgroups, it is not clear \nwhether the differences in relative risk reduction across qualifying conditions are real, or a result of \nchance. \n \nAcute coronary syndrome \n \nThe CURE study included 12,562 patients with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome \n(unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction), and presenting within 24 hours of onset of the \nmost recent episode of chest pain or symptoms consistent with ischaemia. Patients were required to \nhave either ECG changes compatible with new ischaemia or elevated cardiac enzymes or troponin I or \nT to at least twice the upper limit of normal. Patients were randomised to clopidogrel (300 mg loading \ndose followed by 75 mg/day, N=6,259) or placebo (N=6,303), both given in combination with ASA \n(75-325 mg once daily) and other standard therapies. Patients were treated for up to one year. In \nCURE, 823 (6.6%) patients received concomitant GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist therapy. Heparins \nwere administered in more than 90% of the patients and the relative rate of bleeding between \nclopidogrel and placebo was not significantly affected by the concomitant heparin therapy.  \n \nThe number of patients experiencing the primary endpoint [cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial \ninfarction (MI), or stroke] was 582 (9.3%) in the clopidogrel-treated group and 719 (11.4%) in the \nplacebo-treated group, a 20% relative risk reduction (95% CI of 10%-28%; p=0.00009) for the \nclopidogrel-treated group (17% relative risk reduction when patients were treated conservatively, 29% \nwhen they underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with or without stent \nand 10% when they underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)). New cardiovascular events \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n10 \n\n(primary endpoint) were prevented, with relative risk reductions of 22% (CI: 8.6, 33.4), 32% (CI: 12.8, \n46.4), 4% (CI: -26.9, 26.7), 6% (CI: -33.5, 34.3) and 14% (CI: -31.6, 44.2), during the 0-1, 1-3, 3-6, \n6-9 and 9-12 month study intervals, respectively. Thus, beyond 3 months of treatment, the benefit \nobserved in the clopidogrel + ASA group was not further increased, whereas the risk of haemorrhage \npersisted (see section 4.4).  \n \nThe use of clopidogrel in CURE was associated with a decrease in the need of thrombolytic therapy \n(RRR = 43.3%; CI: 24.3%, 57.5%) and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (RRR = 18.2%; CI: 6.5%, 28.3%). \n\n \nThe number of patients experiencing the co-primary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke or refractory \nischaemia) was 1,035 (16.5%) in the clopidogrel-treated group and 1,187 (18.8%) in the placebo-\ntreated group, a 14% relative risk reduction (95% CI of 6%-21%, p=0.0005) for the clopidogrel-treated \ngroup. This benefit was mostly driven by the statistically significant reduction in the incidence of MI \n[287 (4.6%) in the clopidogrel treated group and 363 (5.8%) in the placebo treated group]. There was \nno observed effect on the rate of rehospitalisation for unstable angina. \n \nThe results obtained in populations with different characteristics (e.g. unstable angina or non-Q-wave \nMI, low to high risk levels, diabetes, need for revascularisation, age, gender, etc.) were consistent with \nthe results of the primary analysis. In particular, in a post-hoc analysis in 2,172 patients (17% of the \ntotal CURE population) who underwent stent placement (Stent-CURE), the data showed that \nclopidogrel compared to placebo, demonstrated a significant RRR of 26.2% favouring clopidogrel for \nthe co-primary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke) and also a significant RRR of 23.9% for the second co-\nprimary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke or refractory ischaemia). Moreover, the safety profile of \nclopidogrel in this subgroup of patients did not raise any particular concern. Thus, the results from this \nsubset are in line with the overall trial results.  \n \nThe benefits observed with clopidogrel were independent of other acute and long-term cardiovascular \ntherapies (such as heparin/LMWH, GPIIb/IIIa antagonists, lipid lowering medicinal products, beta \nblockers, and ACE-inhibitors). The efficacy of clopidogrel was observed independently of the dose of \nASA (75-325 mg once daily). \n \nIn patients with acute ST-segment elevation MI, safety and efficacy of clopidogrel have been \nevaluated in 2 randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, CLARITY and COMMIT. \n \nThe CLARITY trial included 3,491 patients presenting within 12 hours of the onset of a ST elevation \nMI and planned for thrombolytic therapy. Patients received clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose, \nfollowed by 75 mg/day, n=1,752) or placebo (n=1,739), both in combination with ASA (150 to \n325 mg as a loading dose, followed by 75 to 162 mg/day), a fibrinolytic agent and, when appropriate, \nheparin. The patients were followed for 30 days. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of the \ncomposite of an occluded infarct-related artery on the predischarge angiogram, or death or recurrent \nMI before coronary angiography. For patients who did not undergo angiography, the primary endpoint \nwas death or recurrent myocardial infarction by Day 8 or by hospital discharge. The patient population \nincluded 19.7% women and 29.2% patients ≥ 65 years. A total of 99.7% of patients received \nfibrinolytics (fibrin specific: 68.7%, non-fibrin specific: 31.1%), 89.5% heparin, 78.7% beta blockers, \n54.7% ACE inhibitors and 63% statins. \n \nFifteen percent (15.0%) of patients in the clopidogrel group and 21.7% in the placebo group reached \nthe primary endpoint, representing an absolute reduction of 6.7% and a 36 % odds reduction in favor \nof clopidogrel (95% CI: 24, 47%; p < 0.001), mainly related to a reduction in occluded infarct-related \narteries. This benefit was consistent across all prespecified subgroups including patients’ age and \ngender, infarct location, and type of fibrinolytic or heparin used. \n \nThe 2x2 factorial design COMMIT trial included 45,852 patients presenting within 24 hours of the \nonset of the symptoms of suspected MI with supporting ECG abnormalities (i.e. ST elevation, ST \ndepression or left bundle-branch block). Patients received clopidogrel (75 mg/day, n=22,961) or \nplacebo (n=22,891), in combination with ASA (162 mg/day), for 28 days or until hospital discharge. \nThe co-primary endpoints were death from any cause and the first occurrence of re-infarction, stroke \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n11 \n\nor death. The population included 27.8% women, 58.4% patients ≥ 60 years (26% ≥ 70 years) and \n54.5% patients who received fibrinolytics. \n \nClopidogrel significantly reduced the relative risk of death from any cause by 7% (p = 0.029), and the \nrelative risk of the combination of re-infarction, stroke or death by 9% (p = 0.002), representing an \nabsolute reduction of 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively. This benefit was consistent across age, gender and \nwith or without fibrinolytics, and was observed as early as 24 hours. \n \n5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nAfter single and repeated oral doses of 75 mg per day, clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed. Mean peak \nplasma levels of unchanged clopidogrel (approximately 2.2-2.5 ng/ml after a single 75 mg oral dose) \noccurred approximately 45 minutes after dosing. Absorption is at least 50%, based on urinary excretion \nof clopidogrel metabolites. \n \nDistribution \nClopidogrel and the main circulating (inactive) metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma \nproteins (98% and 94% respectively). The binding is non-saturable in vitro over a wide concentration \nrange. \n \nMetabolism \nClopidogrel is extensively metabolised by the liver. In vitro and in vivo, clopidogrel is metabolised \naccording to two main metabolic pathways: one mediated by esterases and leading to hydrolysis into \nits inactive carboxylic acid derivative (85% of circulating metabolites), and one mediated by multiple \ncytochromes P450. Clopidogrel is first metabolised to a 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite. \nSubsequent metabolism of the 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite results in formation of the \nactive metabolite, a thiol derivative of clopidogrel. In vitro, this metabolic pathway is mediated by \nCYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 and CYP2B6. The active thiol metabolite which has been isolated \nin vitro, binds rapidly and irreversibly to platelet receptors, thus inhibiting platelet aggregation. \n \nElimination \nFollowing an oral dose of 14C-labelled clopidogrel in man, approximately 50% was excreted in the \nurine and approximately 46% in the faeces in the 120-hour interval after dosing. After a single oral \ndose of 75 mg, clopidogrel has a half-life of approximately 6 hours. The elimination half-life of the \nmain circulating (inactive) metabolite was 8 hours after single and repeated administration. \n \nPharmacogenetics \nSeveral polymorphic CYP450 enzymes activate clopidogrel. CYP2C19 is involved in the formation of \nboth the active metabolite and the 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite. Clopidogrel active \nmetabolite pharmacokinetics and antiplatelet effects, as measured by ex vivo platelet aggregation \nassays, differ according to CYP2C19 genotype. The CYP2C19*1 allele corresponds to fully functional \nmetabolism while the CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 alleles correspond to reduced metabolism. The \nCYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 alleles account for 85% of reduced function alleles in whites and 99% in \nAsians. Other alleles associated with reduced metabolism include CYP2C19*4, *5, *6, *7, and *8, but \nthese are less frequent in the general population. Published frequencies for the common CYP2C19 \nphenotypes and genotypes are listed in the table below.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n12 \n\nCYP2C19 Phenotype and Genotype Frequency \n\n    Frequency (%) \n\n White (n=1356) Black (n=966) Chinese (n=573) \n\nExtensive metabolism: CYP2C19*1/*1  74  66  38  \n\nIntermediate metabolism: CYP2C19*1/*2 or *1/*3  26  29  50  \n\nPoor metabolism: CYP2C19*2/*2, *2/*3 or *3/*3  2  4  14  \n\n \nTo date, the impact of CYP2C19 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite of \nclopidogrel has been evaluated in 227 subjects from 7 reported studies. Reduced CYP2C19 \nmetabolism in intermediate and poor metabolisers decreased the Cmax and AUC of the active metabolite \nby 30-50% following 300- or 600-mg loading doses and 75-mg maintenance doses. Lower active \nmetabolite exposure results in less platelet inhibition or higher residual platelet reactivity. To date, \ndiminished antiplatelet responses to clopidogrel have been described for intermediate and poor \nmetabolisers in 21 reported studies involving 4,520 subjects. The relative difference in antiplatelet \nresponse between genotype groups varies across studies depending on the method used to evaluate \nresponse, but is typically greater than 30%. \n \nThe association between CYP2C19 genotype and clopidogrel treatment outcome was evaluated in 2 \npost hoc clinical trial analyses (substudies of CLARITY [n=465] and TRITON-TIMI 38 [n=1,477]) \nand 5 cohort studies (total n=6,489). In CLARITY and one of the cohort studies (n=765; Trenk), \ncardiovascular event rates did not differ significantly by genotype. In TRITON-TIMI 38 and 3 of the \ncohort studies (n= 3,516; Collet, Sibbing, Giusti), patients with an impaired metaboliser status \n(intermediate and poor combined) had a higher rate of cardiovascular events (death, myocardial \ninfarction, and stroke) or stent thrombosis compared to extensive metabolisers. In the fifth cohort study \n(n=2,208; Simon), the increased event rate was observed only in poor metabolisers. \n \nPharmacogenetic testing can identify genotypes associated with variability in CYP2C19 activity. \n \nThere may be genetic variants of other CYP450 enzymes with effects on the ability to form the active \nmetabolite of clopidogrel. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite of clopidogrel is not known in these special populations. \n \nRenal impairment \nAfter repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day in subjects with severe renal disease (creatinine \nclearance from 5 to 15 ml/min), inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was lower (25%) than \nthat observed in healthy subjects, however, the prolongation of bleeding time was similar to that seen \nin healthy subjects receiving 75 mg of clopidogrel per day. In addition, clinical tolerance was good in \nall patients. \n \nHepatic impairment \nAfter repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day for 10 days in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment, inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was similar to that observed in healthy \nsubjects. The mean bleeding time prolongation was also similar in the two groups. \n \nRace \nThe prevalence of CYP2C19 alleles that result in intermediate and poor CYP2C19 metabolism differs \naccording to race/ethnicity (see Pharmacogenetics). From literature, limited data in Asian populations \nare available to assess the clinical implication of genotyping of this CYP on clinical outcome events. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n13 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nDuring non clinical studies in rat and baboon, the most frequently observed effects were liver changes. \nThese occurred at doses representing at least 25 times the exposure seen in humans receiving the \nclinical dose of 75 mg/day and were a consequence of an effect on hepatic metabolising enzymes. No \neffect on hepatic metabolising enzymes was observed in humans receiving clopidogrel at the \ntherapeutic dose. \n \nAt very high doses, a poor gastric tolerability (gastritis, gastric erosions and/or vomiting) of \nclopidogrel was also reported in rat and baboon. \n \nThere was no evidence of carcinogenic effect when clopidogrel was administered for 78 weeks to mice \nand 104 weeks to rats when given at doses up to 77 mg/kg per day (representing at least 25 times the \nexposure seen in humans receiving the clinical dose of 75 mg/day). \n \nClopidogrel has been tested in a range of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies, and showed no \ngenotoxic activity. \n \nClopidogrel was found to have no effect on the fertility of male and female rats and was not \nteratogenic in either rats or rabbits. When given to lactating rats, clopidogrel caused a slight delay in \nthe development of the offspring. Specific pharmacokinetic studies performed with radiolabelled \nclopidogrel have shown that the parent compound or its metabolites are excreted in the milk. \nConsequently, a direct effect (slight toxicity), or an indirect effect (low palatability) cannot be \nexcluded.  \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nClopidogrel BMS 300 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 300 mg of clopidogrel (as hydrogen sulphate). \nExcipients: each tablet contains 12 mg lactose and 13.2 mg hydrogenated castor oil.  \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3.  PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nPink, oblong, engraved with «300» on one side and «1332» on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nClopidogrel is indicated in adults for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in: \n \n• Patients suffering from myocardial infarction (from a few days until less than 35 days), \n\nischaemic stroke (from 7 days until less than 6 months) or established peripheral arterial disease. \n \n• Patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome: \n\n- Non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave \nmyocardial infarction), including patients undergoing a stent placement following \npercutaneous coronary intervention, in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). \n\n- ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction, in combination with ASA in medically \ntreated patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy. \n\n \nFor further information please refer to section 5.1. \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n• Adults and elderly \n\n \nThis 300 mg tablet of clopidogrel is intended for use as a loading dose in patients suffering from \nacute coronary syndrome: \n\n− Non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave \nmyocardial infarction): clopidogrel treatment should be initiated with a single 300 mg \nloading dose and then continued at 75 mg once a day (with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) \n75 mg-325 mg daily). Since higher doses of ASA were associated with higher bleeding \nrisk it is recommended that the dose of ASA should not be higher than 100 mg. The \noptimal duration of treatment has not been formally established. Clinical trial data \nsupport use up to 12 months, and the maximum benefit was seen at 3 months (see \nsection 5.1). \n\n− ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction: clopidogrel should be given as a \nsingle daily dose of 75 mg initiated with a 300-mg loading dose in combination with \nASA and with or without thrombolytics. For patients over 75 years of age clopidogrel, \nshould be initiated without a loading dose. Combined therapy should be started as early \nas possible after symptoms start and continued for at least four weeks. The benefit of the \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n16 \n\ncombination of clopidogrel with ASA beyond four weeks has not been studied in this \nsetting (see section 5.1). \n \n\nFor the maintenance dose, clopidogrel should be given as a single daily dose of 75 mg with or \nwithout food. For this dose, tablets containing 75 mg are available.  \n\n \n• Pharmacogenetics \n\nCYP2C19 poor metaboliser status is associated with diminished response to clopidogrel. The \noptimal dose regimen for poor metabolisers has yet to be determined (see section 5.2). \n\n \n• Paediatric patients \n The safety and efficacy of clopidogrel in children and adolescents have not yet been established. \n \n• Renal impairment \n\nTherapeutic experience is limited in patients with renal impairment (see section 4.4). \n \n• Hepatic impairment \n\nTherapeutic experience is limited in patients with moderate hepatic disease who may have \nbleeding diatheses (see section 4.4). \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n• Severe liver impairment. \n• Active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial haemorrhage. \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \nDue to the risk of bleeding and haematological undesirable effects, blood cell count determination \nand/or other appropriate testing should be promptly considered whenever clinical symptoms suggestive \nof bleeding arise during the course of treatment (see section 4.8). As with other antiplatelet agents, \nclopidogrel should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding from \ntrauma, surgery or other pathological conditions and in patients receiving treatment with ASA, heparin, \nglycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including Cox-2 \ninhibitors. Patients should be followed carefully for any signs of bleeding including occult bleeding, \nespecially during the first weeks of treatment and/or after invasive cardiac procedures or surgery. The \nconcomitant administration of clopidogrel with oral anticoagulants is not recommended since it may \nincrease the intensity of bleedings (see section 4.5). \n \nIf a patient is to undergo elective surgery and antiplatelet effect is temporarily not desirable, \nclopidogrel should be discontinued 7 days prior to surgery. Patients should inform physicians and \ndentists that they are taking clopidogrel before any surgery is scheduled and before any new medicinal \nproduct is taken. Clopidogrel prolongs bleeding time and should be used with caution in patients who \nhave lesions with a propensity to bleed (particularly gastrointestinal and intraocular).  \n \nPatients should be told that it might take longer than usual to stop bleeding when they take clopidogrel \n(alone or in combination with ASA), and that they should report any unusual bleeding (site or duration) \nto their physician.  \n \nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been reported very rarely following the use of \nclopidogrel, sometimes after a short exposure. It is characterised by thrombocytopenia and \nmicroangiopathic haemolytic anaemia associated with either neurological findings, renal dysfunction \nor fever. TTP is a potentially fatal condition requiring prompt treatment including plasmapheresis. \n \nIn view of the lack of data, clopidogrel cannot be recommended during the first 7 days after acute \nischaemic stroke. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n17 \n\n \nPharmacogenetics: Based on literature data, patients with genetically reduced CYP2C19 function have \nlower systemic exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel and diminished antiplatelet responses, \nand generally exhibit higher cardiovascular event rates following myocardial infarction than do \npatients with normal CYP2C19 function (see section 5.2). \n \nSince clopidogrel is metabolised to its active metabolite partly by CYP2C19, use of drugs that inhibit \nthe activity of this enzyme would be expected to result in reduced drug levels of the active metabolite \nof clopidogrel and a reduction in clinical efficacy. Concomitant use of drugs that inhibit CYP2C19 \nshould be discouraged (see section 4.5 for a list of CYP2C19 inhibitors, see also section 5.2).  \nAlthough the evidence of CYP2C19 inhibition varies within the class of Proton Pump Inhibitors, \nclinical studies suggest an interaction between clopidogrel and possibly all members of this class. \nTherefore, concomitant use of Proton Pump Inhibitors should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. \nThere is no evidence that other drugs that reduce stomach acid such as H2 blockers or antacids \ninterfere with antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel. \n \nTherapeutic experience with clopidogrel is limited in patients with renal impairment. Therefore \nclopidogrel should be used with caution in these patients (see section 4.2). \n \nExperience is limited in patients with moderate hepatic disease who may have bleeding diatheses. \nClopidogrel should therefore be used with caution in this population (see section 4.2). \n \nClopidogrel BMS contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the \nLapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \nThis medicinal product contains hydrogenated castor oil which may cause stomach upset and \ndiarrhoea. \n \n4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nOral anticoagulants: the concomitant administration of clopidogrel with oral anticoagulants is not \nrecommended since it may increase the intensity of bleedings (see section 4.4). \n \nGlycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors: clopidogrel should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk \nof increased bleeding from trauma, surgery or other pathological conditions that receive concomitant \nglycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (see section 4.4). \n \nAcetylsalicylic acid (ASA): ASA did not modify the clopidogrel-mediated inhibition of ADP-induced \nplatelet aggregation, but clopidogrel potentiated the effect of ASA on collagen-induced platelet \naggregation. However, concomitant administration of 500 mg of ASA twice a day for one day did not \nsignificantly increase the prolongation of bleeding time induced by clopidogrel intake. A \npharmacodynamic interaction between clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid is possible, leading to \nincreased risk of bleeding. Therefore, concomitant use should be undertaken with caution (see section \n4.4). However, clopidogrel and ASA have been administered together for up to one year (see section \n5.1). \n \nHeparin: in a clinical study conducted in healthy subjects, clopidogrel did not necessitate modification \nof the heparin dose or alter the effect of heparin on coagulation. Co-administration of heparin had no \neffect on the inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by clopidogrel. A pharmacodynamic interaction \nbetween clopidogrel and heparin is possible, leading to increased risk of bleeding. Therefore, \nconcomitant use should be undertaken with caution (see section 4.4). \n \nThrombolytics: the safety of the concomitant administration of clopidogrel, fibrin or non-fibrin specific \nthrombolytic agents and heparins was assessed in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The \nincidence of clinically significant bleeding was similar to that observed when thrombolytic agents and \nheparin are co-administered with ASA (see section 4.8) \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n18 \n\nNSAIDs: in a clinical study conducted in healthy volunteers, the concomitant administration of \nclopidogrel and naproxen increased occult gastrointestinal blood loss. However, due to the lack of \ninteraction studies with other NSAIDs it is presently unclear whether there is an increased risk of \ngastrointestinal bleeding with all NSAIDs. Consequently, NSAIDs including Cox-2 inhibitors and \nclopidogrel should be co-administered with caution (see section 4.4). \n \nOther concomitant therapy:  \nSince clopidogrel is metabolised to its active metabolite partly by CYP2C19, use of drugs that inhibit \nthe activity of this enzyme would be expected to result in reduced drug levels of the active metabolite \nof clopidogrel and a reduction in clinical efficacy. Concomitant use of drugs that inhibit CYP2C19 \nshould be discouraged (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nDrugs that inhibit CYP2C19 include omeprazole and esomeprazole, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, \nmoclobemide, voriconazole, fluconazole, ticlopidine, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine, carbamazepine, \noxcarbazepine and chloramphenicol. \n \nProton Pump Inhibitors: \nAlthough the evidence of CYP2C19 inhibition varies within the class of Proton Pump Inhibitors, \nclinical studies suggest an interaction between clopidogrel and possibly all members of this class. \nTherefore, concomitant use of Proton Pump Inhibitors should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. \nThere is no evidence that other drugs that reduce stomach acid such as H2 blockers or antacids \ninterfere with antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel. \n \nA number of other clinical studies have been conducted with clopidogrel and other concomitant \nmedicinal products to investigate the potential for pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions. \nNo clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidogrel was co-\nadministered with atenolol, nifedipine, or both atenolol and nifedipine. Furthermore, the \npharmacodynamic activity of clopidogrel was not significantly influenced by the co-administration of \nphenobarbital, cimetidine or oestrogen. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of digoxin or theophylline were not modified by the co-administration of \nclopidogrel. Antacids did not modify the extent of clopidogrel absorption. \n \nData from studies with human liver microsomes indicated that the carboxylic acid metabolite of \nclopidogrel could inhibit the activity of Cytochrome P450 2C9. This could potentially lead to increased \nplasma levels of medicinal products such as phenytoin and tolbutamide and the NSAIDs, which are \nmetabolised by Cytochrome P450 2C9. Data from the CAPRIE study indicate that phenytoin and \ntolbutamide can be safely co-administered with clopidogrel. \n \nApart from the specific medicinal product interaction information described above, interaction studies \nwith clopidogrel and some medicinal products commonly administered in patients with \natherothrombotic disease have not been performed. However, patients entered into clinical trials with \nclopidogrel received a variety of concomitant medicinal products including diuretics, beta blockers, \nACEI, calcium antagonists, cholesterol lowering agents, coronary vasodilators, antidiabetic agents \n(including insulin), antiepileptic agents and GPIIb/IIIa antagonists without evidence of clinically \nsignificant adverse interactions. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nAs no clinical data on exposure to clopidogrel during pregnancy are available, it is preferable not to \nuse clopidogrel during pregnancy as a precautionary measure. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, \nembryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n19 \n\nIt is unknown whether clopidogrel is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of clopidogrel in breast milk. As a precautionary measure, breast-feeding should not be \ncontinued during treatment with Clopidogrel BMS. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nClopidogrel has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nClopidogrel has been evaluated for safety in more than 42,000 patients who have participated in \nclinical studies, including over 9,000 patients treated for 1 year or more. The clinically relevant \nadverse reactions observed in the CAPRIE, CURE, CLARITY and COMMIT studies are discussed \nbelow. Overall, clopidogrel 75 mg/day was comparable to ASA 325 mg/day in CAPRIE regardless of \nage, gender and race. In addition to clinical studies experience, adverse reactions have been \nspontaneously reported. \n \nBleeding is the most common reaction reported both in clinical studies as well as in post-marketing \nexperience where it was mostly reported during the first month of treatment. \n \nIn CAPRIE, in patients treated with either clopidogrel or ASA, the overall incidence of any bleeding \nwas 9.3%. The incidence of severe cases was 1.4% for clopidogrel and 1.6% for ASA. \n \nIn CURE, the major bleeding event rate for clopidogrel+ASA was dose-dependent on ASA (<100mg: \n2.6%; 100-200mg: 3.5%; >200mg: 4.9%) as was the major bleeding event rate for placebo+ASA \n(<100mg: 2.0%; 100-200mg: 2.3%; >200mg: 4.0%). The risk of bleeding (life-threatening, major, \nminor, other) decreased during the course of the trial: 0-1 months (clopidogrel: 9.6%; placebo: 6.6%), \n1-3 months (clopidogrel: 4.5%; placebo: 2.3%), 3-6 months (clopidogrel: 3.8%; placebo: 1.6%), \n6-9 months (clopidogrel: 3.2%; placebo: 1.5%), 9-12 months (clopidogrel: 1.9%; placebo: 1.0%). \nThere was no excess in major bleeds with clopidogrel + ASA within 7 days after coronary bypass graft \nsurgery in patients who stopped therapy more than five days prior to surgery (4.4% clopidogrel+ASA \nvs. 5.3% placebo+ASA). In patients who remained on therapy within five days of bypass graft surgery, \nthe event rate was 9.6% for clopidogrel+ASA, and 6.3% for placebo+ASA. \n \nIn CLARITY, there was an overall increase in bleeding in the clopidogrel + ASA group (17.4%) vs. \nthe placebo + ASA group (12.9%).The incidence of major bleeding was similar between groups (1.3% \nversus 1.1% for the clopidogrel + ASA and the placebo + ASA groups, respectively). This was \nconsistent across subgroups of patients defined by baseline characteristics, and type of fibrinolytic or \nheparin therapy.  \n \nIn COMMIT, the overall rate of noncerebral major bleeding or cerebral bleeding was low and similar \nin both groups (0.6% versus 0.5% in the clopidogrel + ASA and the placebo + ASA groups, \nrespectively). \n \nAdverse reactions that occurred either during clinical studies or that were spontaneously reported are \npresented in the table below. Their frequency is defined using the following conventions: common \n(≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000). Within each system organ class, adverse drug reactions are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n20 \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very rare \n\nBlood and the \nlymphatic system \ndisorders \n\n Thrombocytopenia,\nleucopenia, \neosinophilia \n\nNeutropenia, \nincluding \nsevere \nneutropenia \n\nThrombotic \nthrombocytopenic \npurpura (TTP) (see \nsection 4.4), aplastic \nanaemia, pancytopenia, \nagranulocytosis, severe \nthrombocytopenia, \ngranulocytopenia, \nanaemia \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n   Serum sickness, \nanaphylactoid \nreactions \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n   Hallucinations, \nconfusion \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n Intracranial \nbleeding (some \ncases were \nreported with fatal \noutcome), \nheadache, \nparaesthesia, \ndizziness \n\n Taste disturbances \n\nEye disorders  Eye bleeding \n(conjunctival, \nocular, retinal) \n \n\n  \n\nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders \n\n  Vertigo  \n\nVascular disorders Haematoma  \n \n\n Serious haemorrhage, \nhaemorrhage of \noperative wound, \nvasculitis, hypotension \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\nEpistaxis   Respiratory tract \nbleeding (haemoptysis, \npulmonary \nhaemorrhage), \nbronchospasm, \ninterstitial pneumonitis \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nGastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage, \ndiarrhoea, \nabdominal \npain, dyspepsia \n\nGastric ulcer and \nduodenal ulcer, \ngastritis, vomiting, \nnausea, \nconstipation, \nflatulence \n\nRetroperitoneal \nhaemorrhage \n\nGastrointestinal and \nretroperitoneal \nhaemorrhage with fatal \noutcome, pancreatitis, \ncolitis (including \nulcerative or \nlymphocytic colitis), \nstomatitis \n\nHepato-biliary \ndisorders \n\n   Acute liver failure, \nhepatitis, abnormal \nliver function test \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n21 \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very rare \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nBruising Rash, pruritus, skin \nbleeding (purpura) \n\n Bullous dermatitis \n(toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis, Stevens \nJohnson Syndrome, \nerythema multiforme), \nangioedema, rash \nerythematous, \nurticaria, eczema, \nlichen planus  \n\nMusculoskeletal, \nconnective tissue \nand bone disorders \n\n   Musculo-skeletal \nbleeding \n(haemarthrosis), \narthritis, arthralgia, \nmyalgia \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\n Haematuria  Glomerulonephritis, \nblood creatinine \nincreased \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nBleeding at \npuncture site \n\n  Fever  \n\nInvestigations  Bleeding time \nprolonged, \nneutrophil count \ndecreased, platelet \ncount decreased \n\n  \n\n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdose following clopidogrel administration may lead to prolonged bleeding time and subsequent \nbleeding complications.

If prompt correction of \nprolonged bleeding time is required, platelet transfusion may reverse the effects of clopidogrel. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: platelet aggregation inhibitors excl. heparin, ATC Code: B01AC-04.  \n \nClopidogrel is a prodrug, one of whose metabolites is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel \nmust be metabolised by CYP450 enzymes to produce the active metabolite that inhibits platelet \naggregation. The active metabolite of clopidogrel selectively inhibits the binding of adenosine \ndiphosphate (ADP) to its platelet P2Y12 receptor and the subsequent ADP-mediated activation of the \nglycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation. Due to the irreversible \nbinding, platelets exposed are affected for the remainder of their lifespan (approximately 7-10 days) \nand recovery of normal platelet function occurs at a rate consistent with platelet turnover. Platelet \naggregation induced by agonists other than ADP is also inhibited by blocking the amplification of \nplatelet activation by released ADP. \n \nBecause the active metabolite is formed by CYP450 enzymes, some of which are polymorphic or \nsubject to inhibition by other drugs, not all patients will have adequate platelet inhibition. \n \nRepeated doses of 75 mg per day produced substantial inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation \nfrom the first day; this increased progressively and reached steady state between Day 3 and Day 7. At \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n22 \n\nsteady state, the average inhibition level observed with a dose of 75 mg per day was between 40% and \n60%. Platelet aggregation and bleeding time gradually returned to baseline values, generally within \n5 days after treatment was discontinued. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of clopidogrel have been evaluated in 4 double-blind studies involving over \n80,000 patients: the CAPRIE study, a comparison of clopidogrel to ASA, and the CURE, CLARITY \nand COMMIT studies comparing clopidogrel to placebo, both medicinal products given in \ncombination with ASA and other standard therapy. \n \nRecent myocardial infarction (MI), recent stroke or established peripheral arterial disease \n \nThe CAPRIE study included 19,185 patients with atherothrombosis as manifested by recent \nmyocardial infarction (<35 days), recent ischaemic stroke (between 7 days and 6 months) or \nestablished peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Patients were randomised to clopidogrel 75 mg/day or \nASA 325 mg/day, and were followed for 1 to 3 years. In the myocardial infarction subgroup, most of \nthe patients received ASA for the first few days following the acute myocardial infarction. \n \nClopidogrel significantly reduced the incidence of new ischaemic events (combined end point of \nmyocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and vascular death) when compared to ASA. In the intention to \ntreat analysis, 939 events were observed in the clopidogrel group and 1,020 events with ASA (relative \nrisk reduction (RRR) 8.7%, [95% CI: 0.2 to 16.4]; p = 0.045), which corresponds, for every \n1,000 patients treated for 2 years, to 10 [CI: 0 to 20] additional patients being prevented from \nexperiencing a new ischaemic event. Analysis of total mortality as a secondary endpoint did not show \nany significant difference between clopidogrel (5.8%) and ASA (6.0%). \n \nIn a subgroup analysis by qualifying condition (myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, and PAD) the \nbenefit appeared to be strongest (achieving statistical significance at p = 0.003) in patients enrolled due \nto PAD (especially those who also had a history of myocardial infarction) (RRR = 23.7%; CI: 8.9 to \n36.2) and weaker (not significantly different from ASA) in stroke patients (RRR = 7.3%; CI: -5.7 to \n18.7 [p=0.258]). In patients who were enrolled in the trial on the sole basis of a recent myocardial \ninfarction, clopidogrel was numerically inferior, but not statistically different from ASA (RRR = \n-4.0%; CI: -22.5 to 11.7 [p=0.639]). In addition, a subgroup analysis by age suggested that the benefit \nof clopidogrel in patients over 75 years was less than that observed in patients ≤75 years. \n \nSince the CAPRIE trial was not powered to evaluate efficacy of individual subgroups, it is not clear \nwhether the differences in relative risk reduction across qualifying conditions are real, or a result of \nchance. \n \nAcute coronary syndrome \n \nThe CURE study included 12,562 patients with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome \n(unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction), and presenting within 24 hours of onset of the \nmost recent episode of chest pain or symptoms consistent with ischaemia. Patients were required to \nhave either ECG changes compatible with new ischaemia or elevated cardiac enzymes or troponin I or \nT to at least twice the upper limit of normal. Patients were randomised to clopidogrel (300 mg loading \ndose followed by 75 mg/day, N=6,259) or placebo (N=6,303), both given in combination with ASA \n(75-325 mg once daily) and other standard therapies. Patients were treated for up to one year. In \nCURE, 823 (6.6%) patients received concomitant GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist therapy. Heparins \nwere administered in more than 90% of the patients and the relative rate of bleeding between \nclopidogrel and placebo was not significantly affected by the concomitant heparin therapy.  \n \nThe number of patients experiencing the primary endpoint [cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial \ninfarction (MI), or stroke] was 582 (9.3%) in the clopidogrel-treated group and 719 (11.4%) in the \nplacebo-treated group, a 20% relative risk reduction (95% CI of 10%-28%; p=0.00009) for the \nclopidogrel-treated group (17% relative risk reduction when patients were treated conservatively, 29% \nwhen they underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with or without stent \nand 10% when they underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)). New cardiovascular events \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n23 \n\n(primary endpoint) were prevented, with relative risk reductions of 22% (CI: 8.6, 33.4), 32% (CI: 12.8, \n46.4), 4% (CI: -26.9, 26.7), 6% (CI: -33.5, 34.3) and 14% (CI: -31.6, 44.2), during the 0-1, 1-3, 3-6, \n6-9 and 9-12 month study intervals, respectively. Thus, beyond 3 months of treatment, the benefit \nobserved in the clopidogrel + ASA group was not further increased, whereas the risk of haemorrhage \npersisted (see section 4.4).  \n \nThe use of clopidogrel in CURE was associated with a decrease in the need of thrombolytic therapy \n(RRR = 43.3%; CI: 24.3%, 57.5%) and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (RRR = 18.2%; CI: 6.5%, 28.3%). \n\n \nThe number of patients experiencing the co-primary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke or refractory \nischaemia) was 1,035 (16.5%) in the clopidogrel-treated group and 1,187 (18.8%) in the \nplacebo-treated group, a 14% relative risk reduction (95% CI of 6%-21%, p=0.0005) for the \nclopidogrel-treated group. This benefit was mostly driven by the statistically significant reduction in \nthe incidence of MI [287 (4.6%) in the clopidogrel treated group and 363 (5.8%) in the placebo treated \ngroup]. There was no observed effect on the rate of rehospitalisation for unstable angina. \n \nThe results obtained in populations with different characteristics (e.g. unstable angina or non-Q-wave \nMI, low to high risk levels, diabetes, need for revascularisation, age, gender, etc.) were consistent with \nthe results of the primary analysis. In particular, in a post-hoc analysis in 2,172 patients (17% of the \ntotal CURE population) who underwent stent placement (Stent-CURE), the data showed that \nclopidogrel compared to placebo, demonstrated a significant RRR of 26.2% favouring clopidogrel for \nthe co-primary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke) and also a significant RRR of 23.9% for the second co-\nprimary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke or refractory ischaemia). Moreover, the safety profile of \nclopidogrel in this subgroup of patients did not raise any particular concern. Thus, the results from this \nsubset are in line with the overall trial results. \n \nThe benefits observed with clopidogrel were independent of other acute and long-term cardiovascular \ntherapies (such as heparin/LMWH, GPIIb/IIIa antagonists, lipid lowering medicinal products, beta \nblockers, and ACE-inhibitors). The efficacy of clopidogrel was observed independently of the dose of \nASA (75-325 mg once daily). \n \nIn patients with acute ST-segment elevation MI, safety and efficacy of clopidogrel have been \nevaluated in 2 randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, CLARITY and COMMIT. \n \nThe CLARITY trial included 3,491 patients presenting within 12 hours of the onset of a ST elevation \nMI and planned for thrombolytic therapy. Patients received clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose, \nfollowed by 75 mg/day, n=1,752) or placebo (n=1,739), both in combination with ASA (150 to \n325 mg as a loading dose, followed by 75 to 162 mg/day), a fibrinolytic agent and, when appropriate, \nheparin. The patients were followed for 30 days. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of the \ncomposite of an occluded infarct-related artery on the predischarge angiogram, or death or recurrent \nMI before coronary angiography. For patients who did not undergo angiography, the primary endpoint \nwas death or recurrent myocardial infarction by Day 8 or by hospital discharge. The patient population \nincluded 19.7% women and 29.2% patients ≥ 65 years. A total of 99.7% of patients received \nfibrinolytics (fibrin specific: 68.7%, non-fibrin specific: 31.1%), 89.5% heparin, 78.7% beta blockers, \n54.7% ACE inhibitors and 63% statins. \n \nFifteen percent (15.0%) of patients in the clopidogrel group and 21.7% in the placebo group reached \nthe primary endpoint, representing an absolute reduction of 6.7% and a 36 % odds reduction in favor \nof clopidogrel (95% CI: 24, 47%; p < 0.001), mainly related to a reduction in occluded infarct-related \narteries. This benefit was consistent across all prespecified subgroups including patients’ age and \ngender, infarct location, and type of fibrinolytic or heparin used. \n \nThe 2x2 factorial design COMMIT trial included 45,852 patients presenting within 24 hours of the \nonset of the symptoms of suspected MI with supporting ECG abnormalities (i.e. ST elevation, ST \ndepression or left bundle-branch block). Patients received clopidogrel (75 mg/day, n=22,961) or \nplacebo (n=22,891), in combination with ASA (162 mg/day), for 28 days or until hospital discharge. \nThe co-primary endpoints were death from any cause and the first occurrence of re-infarction, stroke \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n24 \n\nor death. The population included 27.8% women, 58.4% patients ≥ 60 years (26% ≥ 70 years) and \n54.5% patients who received fibrinolytics. \n \nClopidogrel significantly reduced the relative risk of death from any cause by 7% (p = 0.029), and the \nrelative risk of the combination of re-infarction, stroke or death by 9% (p = 0.002), representing an \nabsolute reduction of 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively. This benefit was consistent across age, gender and \nwith or without fibrinolytics, and was observed as early as 24 hours. \n \n5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nAfter single and repeated oral doses of 75 mg per day, clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed. Mean peak \nplasma levels of unchanged clopidogrel (approximately 2.2-2.5 ng/ml after a single 75 mg oral dose) \noccurred approximately 45 minutes after dosing. Absorption is at least 50%, based on urinary excretion \nof clopidogrel metabolites. \n \nDistribution \nClopidogrel and the main circulating (inactive) metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma \nproteins (98% and 94% respectively). The binding is non-saturable in vitro over a wide concentration \nrange. \n \nMetabolism \nClopidogrel is extensively metabolised by the liver. In vitro and in vivo, clopidogrel is metabolised \naccording to two main metabolic pathways: one mediated by esterases and leading to hydrolysis into \nits inactive carboxylic acid derivative (85% of circulating metabolites), and one mediated by multiple \ncytochromes P450. Clopidogrel is first metabolised to a 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite. \nSubsequent metabolism of the 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite results in formation of the \nactive metabolite, a thiol derivative of clopidogrel. In vitro, this metabolic pathway is mediated by \nCYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 and CYP2B6. The active thiol metabolite which has been isolated \nin vitro, binds rapidly and irreversibly to platelet receptors, thus inhibiting platelet aggregation. \n \nElimination \nFollowing an oral dose of 14C-labelled clopidogrel in man, approximately 50% was excreted in the \nurine and approximately 46% in the faeces in the 120-hour interval after dosing. After a single oral \ndose of 75 mg, clopidogrel has a half-life of approximately 6 hours. The elimination half-life of the \nmain circulating (inactive) metabolite was 8 hours after single and repeated administration. \n \nPharmacogenetics \nSeveral polymorphic CYP450 enzymes activate clopidogrel. CYP2C19 is involved in the formation of \nboth the active metabolite and the 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite. Clopidogrel active \nmetabolite pharmacokinetics and antiplatelet effects, as measured by ex vivo platelet aggregation \nassays, differ according to CYP2C19 genotype. The CYP2C19*1 allele corresponds to fully functional \nmetabolism while the CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 alleles correspond to reduced metabolism. The \nCYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 alleles account for 85% of reduced function alleles in whites and 99% in \nAsians. Other alleles associated with reduced metabolism include CYP2C19*4, *5, *6, *7, and *8, but \nthese are less frequent in the general population. Published frequencies for the common CYP2C19 \nphenotypes and genotypes are listed in the table below.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n25 \n\nCYP2C19 Phenotype and Genotype Frequency \n\n    Frequency (%) \n\n White (n=1356) Black (n=966) Chinese (n=573) \n\nExtensive metabolism: CYP2C19*1/*1  74  66  38  \n\nIntermediate metabolism: CYP2C19*1/*2 or *1/*3  26  29  50  \n\nPoor metabolism: CYP2C19*2/*2, *2/*3 or *3/*3  2  4  14  \n\n \nTo date, the impact of CYP2C19 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite of \nclopidogrel has been evaluated in 227 subjects from 7 reported studies. Reduced CYP2C19 \nmetabolism in intermediate and poor metabolisers decreased the Cmax and AUC of the active metabolite \nby 30-50% following 300- or 600-mg loading doses and 75-mg maintenance doses. Lower active \nmetabolite exposure results in less platelet inhibition or higher residual platelet reactivity. To date, \ndiminished antiplatelet responses to clopidogrel have been described for intermediate and poor \nmetabolisers in 21 reported studies involving 4,520 subjects. The relative difference in antiplatelet \nresponse between genotype groups varies across studies depending on the method used to evaluate \nresponse, but is typically greater than 30%. \n \nThe association between CYP2C19 genotype and clopidogrel treatment outcome was evaluated in 2 \npost hoc clinical trial analyses (substudies of CLARITY [n=465] and TRITON-TIMI 38 [n=1,477]) \nand 5 cohort studies (total n=6,489). In CLARITY and one of the cohort studies (n=765; Trenk), \ncardiovascular event rates did not differ significantly by genotype. In TRITON-TIMI 38 and 3 of the \ncohort studies (n= 3,516; Collet, Sibbing, Giusti), patients with an impaired metaboliser status \n(intermediate and poor combined) had a higher rate of cardiovascular events (death, myocardial \ninfarction, and stroke) or stent thrombosis compared to extensive metabolisers. In the fifth cohort study \n(n=2,208; Simon), the increased event rate was observed only in poor metabolisers. \n \nPharmacogenetic testing can identify genotypes associated with variability in CYP2C19 activity. \n \nThere may be genetic variants of other CYP450 enzymes with effects on the ability to form the active \nmetabolite of clopidogrel. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite of clopidogrel is not known in these special populations. \n \nRenal impairment \nAfter repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day in subjects with severe renal disease (creatinine \nclearance from 5 to 15 ml/min), inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was lower (25%) than \nthat observed in healthy subjects, however, the prolongation of bleeding time was similar to that seen \nin healthy subjects receiving 75 mg of clopidogrel per day. In addition, clinical tolerance was good in \nall patients. \n \nHepatic impairment \nAfter repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day for 10 days in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment, inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was similar to that observed in healthy \nsubjects. The mean bleeding time prolongation was also similar in the two groups. \n \nRace \nThe prevalence of CYP2C19 alleles that result in intermediate and poor CYP2C19 metabolism differs \naccording to race/ethnicity (see Pharmacogenetics). From literature, limited data in Asian populations \nare available to assess the clinical implication of genotyping of this CYP on clinical outcome events. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n26 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nDuring non clinical studies in rat and baboon, the most frequently observed effects were liver changes. \nThese occurred at doses representing at least 25 times the exposure seen in humans receiving the \nclinical dose of 75 mg/day and were a consequence of an effect on hepatic metabolising enzymes. No \neffect on hepatic metabolising enzymes was observed in humans receiving clopidogrel at the \ntherapeutic dose. \n \nAt very high doses, a poor gastric tolerability (gastritis, gastric erosions and/or vomiting) of \nclopidogrel was also reported in rat and baboon. \n \nThere was no evidence of carcinogenic effect when clopidogrel was administered for 78 weeks to mice \nand 104 weeks to rats when given at doses up to 77 mg/kg per day (representing at least 25 times the \nexposure seen in humans receiving the clinical dose of 75 mg/day). \n \nClopidogrel has been tested in a range of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies, and showed no \ngenotoxic activity. \n \nClopidogrel was found to have no effect on the fertility of male and female rats and was not \nteratogenic in either rats or rabbits. When given to lactating rats, clopidogrel caused a slight delay in \nthe development of the offspring. Specific pharmacokinetic studies performed with radiolabelled \nclopidogrel have shown that the parent compound or its metabolites are excreted in the milk. \nConsequently, a direct effect (slight toxicity), or an indirect effect (low palatability) cannot be \nexcluded.  \n \n \n6.

Further information \n \n \n1.  WHAT CLOPIDOGREL BMS IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nClopidogrel BMS belongs to a group of medicines called antiplatelet medicinal products. Platelets are \nvery small structures in the blood, smaller than red or white blood cells, which clump together during \nblood clotting. By preventing this clumping, antiplatelet medicinal products reduce the chances of \nblood clots forming (a process called thrombosis). \n \nClopidogrel BMS is taken to prevent blood clots (thrombi) forming in hardened blood vessels \n(arteries), a process known as atherothrombosis, which can lead to atherothrombotic events (such as \nstroke, heart attack, or death).  \n \nYou have been prescribed Clopidogrel BMS to help prevent blood clots and reduce the risk of these \nsevere events because: \n- You have a condition of hardening of arteries (also known as atherosclerosis), and \n- You have previously experienced a heart attack, stroke or have a condition known as peripheral \n\narterial disease, or \n- You have experienced a severe type of chest pain known as ‘unstable angina’ or ‘myocardial \n\ninfarction’ (heart attack). For the treatment of this condition your doctor may have placed a stent \nin the blocked or narrowed artery to restore effective blood flow. You should also be given \nacetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain and lower fever \nas well as to prevent blood clotting) by your doctor. \n\n \n \n2.  BEFORE YOU TAKE CLOPIDOGREL BMS \n \nDo not take Clopidogrel BMS:  \n• If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to clopidogrel or any of the other ingredients of Clopidogrel \n\nBMS; \n• If you have a medical condition that is currently causing bleeding such as a stomach ulcer or \n\nbleeding within the brain; \n• If you suffer from severe liver disease. \n\n \nIf you think any of these apply to you, or if you are in any doubt at all, consult your doctor before \ntaking Clopidogrel BMS.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n42 \n\nTake special care with Clopidogrel BMS: \nIf any of the situations mentioned below apply to you, you should tell your doctor before taking \nClopidogrel BMS: \n• if you have a risk of bleeding such as  \n\n- a medical condition that puts you at risk of internal bleeding (such as a stomach ulcer) \n- a blood disorder that makes you prone to internal bleeding (bleeding inside any tissues, organs \n\nor joints of your body). \n- a recent serious injury \n- a recent surgery (including dental) \n- a planned surgery (including dental) in the next seven days \n\n• if you have had a clot in an artery of your brain (ischaemic stroke) which occurred within the \nlast seven days  \n\n• if you are taking another type of medicine (see ‘Taking other medicines’).  \n• if you have kidney or liver disease  \n \nWhile you are taking Clopidogrel BMS: \n• You should tell your doctor if a surgery (including dental) is planned. \n• You should also tell your doctor immediately if you develop a medical condition that includes \n\nfever and bruising under the skin that may appear as red pinpoint dots, with or without \nunexplained extreme tiredness, confusion, yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice) (see section 4 \n‘POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS’). \n\n• If you cut or injure yourself, it may take longer than usual for bleeding to stop. This is linked to \nthe way your medicine works as it prevents the ability of blood clots to form. For minor cuts and \ninjuries e.g., cutting yourself, shaving, this is usually of no concern. However, if you are \nconcerned by your bleeding, you should contact your doctor straightaway (see section 4 \n‘POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS’). \n\n• Your doctor may order blood tests. \n• You should tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any side effect not listed in section 4 \n\n‘POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS’ or if you notice that a side effect gets serious. \n \nClopidogrel BMS is not intended for use in children or adolescents. \n \nTaking other medicines:  \nSome other medicines may influence the use of Clopidogrel BMS or vice versa.  \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nThe use of oral anticoagulants (medicines used to reduce blood clotting) with Clopidogrel BMS is not \nrecommended. \n \nYou should specifically tell your doctor if you take a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, usually \nused to treat painful and/or inflammatory conditions of muscle or joints, or if you take heparin or any \nother medicine used to reduce blood clotting, or if you take a proton pump inhibitor (e.g, omeprazole) \nfor upset stomach. \n \nIf you have experienced severe chest pain (unstable angina or heart attack), you may be prescribed \nClopidogrel BMS in combination with acetylsalicylic acid, a substance present in many medicines \nused to relieve pain and lower fever. An occasional use of acetylsalicylic acid (no more than 1,000 mg \nin any 24 hour period) should generally not cause a problem, but prolonged use in other circumstances \nshould be discussed with your doctor. \n \nTaking Clopidogrel BMS with food and drink \nClopidogrel BMS may be taken with or without food. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n43 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIt is preferable not to use this product during pregnancy and breast-feeding. \n \nIf you are pregnant or suspect that you are pregnant, you should tell your doctor or your pharmacist \nbefore taking Clopidogrel BMS. If you become pregnant while taking Clopidogrel BMS, consult your \ndoctor immediately as it is recommended not to take clopidogrel while you are pregnant.  \n \nWhile taking Clopidogrel BMS, consult your doctor about the breast-feeding of a baby. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines: \nClopidogrel BMS is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or to use machines. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Clopidogrel BMS: \nClopidogrel BMS contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance \nto some sugars (e.g. lactose), contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \nClopidogrel BMS also contains hydrogenated castor oil which may cause stomach upset or diarrhoea. \n \n \n3.  HOW TO TAKE CLOPIDOGREL BMS  \n \nAlways take Clopidogrel BMS exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nIf you have experienced severe chest pain (unstable angina or heart attack), your doctor may give you \n300 mg of Clopidogrel BMS (1 tablet of 300 mg or 4 tablets of 75 mg) once at the start of treatment. \nThen, the usual dose is one 75-mg tablet of Clopidogrel BMS per day to be taken orally with or \nwithout food, and at the same time each day. \n \nYou should take Clopidogrel BMS for as long as your doctor continues to prescribe it.  \n \nIf you take more Clopidogrel BMS than you should: \nContact your doctor or the nearest hospital emergency department because of the increased risk of \nbleeding. \n \nIf you forget to take Clopidogrel BMS: \nIf you forget to take a dose of Clopidogrel BMS, but remember within 12 hours of your usual time, \ntake your tablet straightaway and then take your next tablet at the usual time.  \n \nIf you forget for more than 12 hours, simply take the next single dose at the usual time. Do not take a \ndouble dose to make up for the forgotten individual doses.  \n \nFor the 7, 14, 28 and 84 tablets pack sizes, you can check the day on which you last took a tablet of \nClopidogrel BMS by referring to the calendar printed on the blister. \n \nIf you stop taking Clopidogrel BMS:  \nDo not stop the treatment. Contact your doctor or pharmacist before stopping. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n44 \n\n4.  POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Clopidogrel BMS can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nContact your doctor immediately if you experience: \n\n- fever, signs of infection or extreme tiredness. These may be due to rare decrease of some \nblood cells. \n\n- signs of liver problems such as yellowing of the skin and/or the eyes (jaundice), whether or \nnot associated with bleeding which appears under the skin as red pinpoint dots and/or \nconfusion (see section 2 ‘Take special care with Clopidogrel BMS’). \n\n- swelling in the mouth or skin disorders such as rashes and itching, blisters of the skin.
