NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nUcedane 200 mg dispersible tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 200 mg of carglumic acid. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nDispersible tablet. \nThe tablets are rod-shaped, white and biconvex with three score lines on both sides and engraving \n\u201cL/L/L/L\u201d on one side. \nThe tablet can be divided into four equal doses. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nUcedane is indicated in treatment of hyperammonaemia due to N-acetylglutamate synthase primary \ndeficiency. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nUcedane treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of metabolic disorders. \n \nPosology \n \nBased on clinical experience, the treatment may be started as early as the first day of life. The initial \ndaily dose should be 100 mg/kg, up to 250 mg/kg if necessary. \nIt should then be adjusted individually in order to maintain normal ammonia plasma levels (see \nsection 4.4). \nIn the long term, it may not be necessary to increase the dose according to body weight as long \nas adequate metabolic control is achieved; daily doses range from 10 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg. \n \nCarglumic acid responsiveness test \nIt is recommended to test individual responsiveness to carglumic acid before initiating any long \nterm treatment. As examples: \n- In a comatose child, start with a dose of 100 to 250 mg/kg/day and measure ammonia plasma \n\nconcentration at least before each administration; it should normalise within a few hours \nafter starting Ucedane. \n\n- In a patient with moderate hyperammonaemia, administer a test dose of 100 to \n200 mg/kg/day for 3 days with a constant protein intake and perform repeated \ndeterminations of ammonia plasma concentration (before and 1 hour after a meal); adjust \nthe dose in order to maintain normal ammonia plasma levels. \n\n \nMethod of administration \n \nThis medicine is for oral use ONLY (ingestion or via nasogastric tube using a syringe, if necessary). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nBased on pharmacokinetic data and clinical experience, it is recommended to divide the total daily \ndose into two to four intakes to be given before meals or feedings. The breaking of the tablets in \nhalves allows most of the required posology adjustments. Occasionally, the use of quarter tablets may \nalso be useful to adjust the posology prescribed by the physician.  \n \nThe tablets must be dispersed in a minimum of 5-10 mL of water and ingested immediately or \nadministered by fast push through a syringe via a nasogastric tube. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nBreast-feeding during the use of carglumic acid is contraindicated (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTherapeutic monitoring \nPlasma levels of ammonia and amino acids should be maintained within normal limits. \nAs very few data on the safety of carglumic acid are available, systematic surveillance of liver, \nrenal, cardiac functions and haematological parameters is recommended. \n \nNutritional management \nProtein restriction and arginine supplementation may be indicated in case of low protein \ntolerance. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo specific interaction studies have been performed. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor carglumic acid no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \nAnimal studies have revealed minimal developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Caution should \nbe exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nBreast-feeding \nAlthough it is not known whether carglumic acid is secreted into human milk, it has been \nshown to be present in the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). Therefore, breast-feeding during \nthe use of carglumic acid is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nReported adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies \nare defined as: very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10) and uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to \n<1/100) 100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data). \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reaction \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon bradycardia \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Uncommon diarrhea, vomiting \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nCommon increased sweating \n\nNot known rash \n\nGeneral disorders and \nAdministration site conditions Uncommon pyrexia \n\nInvestigations Uncommon increased transaminases \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn one patient treated with carglumic acid, where the dose was increased up to 750 mg/kg/day, \nsymptoms of intoxication occurred which can be characterised as a sympathomimetic reaction: \ntachycardia, profuse sweating, increased bronchial secretion, increased body temperature and \nrestlessness. These symptoms resolved once the dose was reduced. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Amino acids and derivatives; ATC code: A16AA05. \n \nMechanism of action \nCarglumic acid is a structural analogue of N-acetylglutamate, which is the naturally occurring \nactivator of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, the first enzyme of the urea cycle. \nCarglumic acid has been shown in vitro to activate liver carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. \nDespite a lower affinity of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase for carglumic acid than for N-\nacetylglutamate, carglumic acid has been shown in vivo to stimulate carbamoyl phosphate \nsynthetase and to be much more effective than N-acetylglutamate in protecting against ammonia \nintoxication in rats. This could be explained by the following observations: \ni) The mitochondrial membrane is more readily permeable for carglumic acid than for N-\nacetylglutamate \nii) Carglumic acid is more resistant than N-acetylglutamate to hydrolysis by aminoacylase present \nin the cytosol. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nOther studies have been conducted in rats under different experimental conditions leading to \nincreased ammonia availability (starvation, protein-free or high-protein diet). Carglumic acid was \nshown to decrease blood ammonia levels and increase urea levels in blood and urine, whereas \nthe liver content of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase activators was significantly increased. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nIn patients with N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency, carglumic acid was shown to induce a rapid \nnormalisation of plasma ammonia levels, usually within 24 hours. When the treatment was \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\ninstituted before any permanent brain damage, patients exhibited normal growth and \npsychomotor development. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of carglumic acid has been studied in healthy male volunteers using both \nradiolabelled and unlabelled product. \n \nAbsorption \nAfter a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg body weight, approximately 30% of carglumic acid is \nestimated to be absorbed. At that dose-level, in 12 volunteers given carglumic acid tablets, plasma \nconcentration peaked at 2.6 \u03bcg/mL (median; range 1.8-4.8) after 3 hours (median; range 2-4). \n \nDistribution \nThe plasma elimination curve of carglumic acid is biphasic with a rapid phase over the first \n12 hours after administration followed by a slow phase (terminal half-life up to 28 hours). \nDiffusion into erythrocytes is non-existent. Protein binding has not been determined. \n \nMetabolism \nA proportion of carglumic acid is metabolised. It is suggested that depending on its activity, the \nintestinal bacterial flora may contribute to the initiation of the degradation process, thus leading \nto a variable extent of metabolism of the molecule. One metabolite that has been identified in the \nfaeces is glutamic acid. Metabolites are detectable in plasma with a peak at 36-48 hours and a \nvery slow decline (half-life around 100 hours). \nThe end product of carglumic acid metabolism is carbon dioxide, which is eliminated through the \nlungs. \n \nElimination \nAfter a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg body weight, 9% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the \nurine and up to 60% in the faeces. \n \nPlasma levels of carglumic acid were measured in patients of all age categories, from newborn \ninfants to adolescents, treated with various daily doses (7\u2013122 mg/kg/day). Their range was \nconsistent with those measured in healthy adults, even in newborn infants. Whatever the daily \ndose, they were slowly declining over 15 hours to levels around 100 ng/mL. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSafety pharmacology studies have shown that carglumic acid administered orally at doses of \n250, 500, 1000 mg/kg had no statistically significant effect on respiration, central nervous \nsystem and cardiovascular system. \n\nCarglumic acid showed no significant mutagenic activity in a battery of genotoxicity tests \nperformed in vitro (Ames test, human lymphocyte metaphase analysis) and in vivo \n(micronucleus test in rat). \n\nSingle doses of carglumic acid up to 2800 mg/kg orally and 239 mg/kg intravenously did not \ninduce any mortality or abnormal clinical signs in adult rats. In newborn rats receiving daily \ncarglumic acid by oral gavage for 18 days as well as in young rats receiving daily carglumic acid \nfor 26 weeks, the No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) was established at 500 mg/kg/day and the \nNo Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was established at 1000 mg/kg/day. \n\nNo adverse effects have been observed on male or female fertility. In rats and rabbits no \nevidence has been seen of embryotoxicity, foetotoxicity or teratogenicity up to maternotoxic doses \nleading to fifty times exposure as compared to humans in rats and seven times in rabbits. \nCarglumic acid is secreted in the milk of lactating rats and although developmental parameters \nwere unaffected, there were some effects on body weight / body weight gain of pups breast-fed \nby dams treated with 500 mg/kg/day and a higher mortality of pups from dams treated with \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\n2000 mg/kg/day, a dose that caused maternotoxicity. The maternal systemic exposures after 500 \nand 2000 mg/kg/day were twenty five times and seventy times the expected human exposure. \n\nNo carcinogenicity study has been conducted with carglumic acid. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm \n\nthem, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, or pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Ucedane is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you take Ucedane \n3. How to take Ucedane  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Ucedane  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Ucedane is and what it is used for \n \nUcedane can help eliminating excessive ammonia plasma levels (elevated ammonia level in \nthe blood). Ammonia is especially toxic for the brain and leads, in severe cases, to reduced \nlevels of consciousness and to coma. \nHyperammonaemia may be due to the lack of a specific liver enzyme N- acetylglutamate \nsynthase. Patients with this rare disorder are not able to eliminate nitrogen waste, which \nbuilds up after eating protein.  \nThis disorder persists during the entire life of the affected patient and therefore the need for this \ntreatment is lifelong. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Ucedane  \n \nDo not take Ucedane: \n- if you are allergic to carglumic acid or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6); \n- during breast-feeding. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ucedane. \n \nUcedane treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of metabolic disorders. \n \nYour doctor will evaluate your individual responsiveness to carglumic acid before initiating any long \nterm treatment. \nThe dose should be individually adjusted in order to maintain normal ammonia plasma levels. \n \nYour doctor may prescribe supplemental arginine or restrict your protein intake. \n \nIn order to follow-up your condition and your treatment, your doctor may examine your liver, your \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nkidneys, your heart and your blood on a regular basis. \n \nOther medicines and Ucedane \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nUcedane with food and drink \nUcedane must be taken orally before meals or feedings. \nThe tablets must be dispersed in a minimum of 5 to 10 mL of water and taken immediately.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nThe effects of Ucedane on pregnancy and the unborn child are not known. Consult your doctor for \nadvice if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. \nThe excretion of carglumic acid into breast milk has not been studied in women. Nevertheless, as \ncarglumic acid has been shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats with potential toxic effects \nfor their fed pups, you must not breast-feed your baby if you are taking Ucedane. \n \nDriving and using machines \nEffects on the ability to drive and use machines are not known. \n \n \n3. How to take Ucedane \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe initial daily dose is usually 100 mg per kilogram of body weight, up to a maximum of 250 mg \nper kilogram of body weight (for example, if you weight 10 kg, you should take 1 g per day, or 5 \ntablets of 200 mg). In the long term, the daily dose usually ranges from 10 mg to 100 mg per \nkilogram of body weight.  \n \nYour doctor will determine the dose suitable to you in order to maintain normal ammonia levels in \nyour blood. \n \nUcedane should ONLY be administered by mouth or via a feeding tube into the stomach (using a \nsyringe, if necessary). \n \nWhen the patient is in hyperammonaemic coma, Ucedane is administered by fast push through a \nsyringe via the tube set up and used to feed you. \n \nIf you take more Ucedane than you should \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice. \n \nIf you forget to take Ucedane \nDo not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses. \n \nIf you stop taking Ucedane \nDo not stop Ucedane without informing your doctor.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n  Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):  \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\n\u2022 increased sweating \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):  \n\u2022 bradycardia (decreased frequency of the heart),  \n\u2022 diarrhoea,  \n\u2022 fever,  \n\u2022 increased transaminases (liver enzymes),  \n\u2022 vomiting \n \nNot known side effects (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 rash \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or, pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety \nof this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Ucedane \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the blister and carton.
