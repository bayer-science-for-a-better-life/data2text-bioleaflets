QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nSuliqua 100 units/ml + 50 microgram/ml solution for injection in a pre-filled pen  \nEach pre-filled pen contains 300 units of insulin glargine* and 150 micrograms lixisenatide in 3 ml \nsolution. \nEach ml contains 100 units of insulin glargine and 50 micrograms lixisenatide. \nEach dose step contains 1 unit of insulin glargine and 0.5 micrograms of lixisenatide \n \nSuliqua 100 units/ml + 33 microgram/ml solution for injection in a pre-filled pen  \nEach pre-filled pen contains 300 units of insulin glargine and 100 micrograms lixisenatide in 3 ml \nsolution. \nEach ml contains 100 units of insulin glargine and 33 micrograms lixisenatide. \nEach dose step contains 1 unit of insulin glargine and 0.33 micrograms of lixisenatide \n \n*Insulin glargine is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n \nThe dose window on the pen shows the number of dose steps. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effects:  \nEach ml contains 2.7 milligrams of metacresol. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection  \n \nClear colourless solution. \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSuliqua is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus to \nimprove glycaemic control as an adjunct to diet and exercise in addition to metformin with or without \nSGLT-2 inhibitors. (For study results with respect to effect on glycaemic control, and the populations \nstudied, see section 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nSuliqua is available in two pens, providing different dosing options, i.e. Suliqua (10-40) pen, Suliqua \n(30-60) pen respectively. The differentiation between the pen strengths is based on the dose range of \nthe pen. \n \n\n Suliqua 100 units/ml + 50 micrograms/ml pre-filled pen delivers dose steps from 10-40 units of \ninsulin glargine in combination with 5-20 mcg lixisenatide (Suliqua (10-40) pen). \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n Suliqua 100 units/ml + 33 micrograms/ml pre-filled pen delivers dose steps from 30-60 units of \ninsulin glargine in combination with 10-20 mcg lixisenatide (Suliqua (30-60) pen). \n\n \nTo avoid medication errors, the prescriber must make sure that the correct strength and number of dose \nsteps is stated in the prescription (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nThe dose must be individualised based on clinical response and is titrated based on the patient’s need \nfor insulin. The lixisenatide dose is increased or decreased along with insulin glargine dose and also \ndepends on which pen is used. \n \nStarting dose  \n \nTherapy with basal insulin or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist or oral glucose \nlowering medicinal product other than metformin and SGLT-2 inhibitors should be discontinued prior \nto initiation of Suliqua.  \n \nThe starting dose of Suliqua is based on previous anti-diabetic treatment, and in order not to exceed \nthe recommended lixisenatide starting dose of 10 mcg: \n \n \n Previous therapy \n Insulin naïve \n\npatients (Oral anti-\ndiabetic treatment \nor GLP-1 receptor \n\nagonist) \n\nInsulin glargine \n(100 units/ml)** \n≥20 to <30 units \n\nInsulin glargine \n(100 units/ml)** \n≥30 to ≤60 units \n\n \nStarting \ndose  \nand pen \n\nSuliqua \n(10-40) pen \n \n\n10 dose steps \n(10 units/5 mcg)* \n\n20 dose steps \n(20 units/10 mcg)* \n\n \n\nSuliqua \n(30-60) pen \n\n  30 dose steps \n(30 units/10 mcg)* \n\n* units insulin glargine (100 units/ml)/mcg lixisenatide \n \n** If a different basal insulin was used: \n For twice daily basal insulin or insulin glargine (300 units/ml), the total daily dose previously \n\nused should be reduced by 20% to choose the Suliqua starting dose. \n For any other basal insulin the same rule as for insulin glargine (100 units/ml) should be applied \n\n \nThe maximum daily dose is 60 units insulin glargine and 20 mcg lixisenatide corresponding to 60 dose \nsteps.  \n \nSuliqua should be injected once a day within one hour prior to a meal. It is preferable that the prandial \ninjection is performed before the same meal every day, when the most convenient meal has been \nchosen. \n \nDosage titration  \nSuliqua is to be dosed in accordance with the individual patient's need for insulin. It is recommended \nto optimise glycaemic control via dose adjustment based on fasting plasma glucose (see section 5.1). \nClose glucose monitoring is recommended during the transfer and in the following weeks. \n \n If the patient starts with the Suliqua (10-40) pen, the dose may be titrated up to 40 dose steps with \n\nthis pen. \n For doses >40 dose steps/day titration must be continued with Suliqua (30-60) pen. \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n If the patient starts with the Suliqua (30-60) pen, the dose may be titrated up to 60 dose steps with \nthis pen.  \n\n For total daily doses >60 dose steps/day, Suliqua must not be used. \n \nPatients adjusting the amount or timing of dosing should only do so under medical supervision with \nappropriate glucose monitoring (see section 4.4).  \n \nSpecial population \n \nElderly (≥65 years old) \nSuliqua can be used in elderly patients. The dose should be adjusted on an individual basis, based on \nglucose monitoring. In the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady \ndecrease in insulin requirements. For lixisenatide no dose adjustment is required based on age. The \ntherapeutic experience of Suliqua in patients ≥75 years of age is limited. \n \nRenal impairment \nSuliqua is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment and end-stage renal disease as \nthere is no sufficient therapeutic experience with use of lixisenatide.  \nNo dose adjustment is required for lixisenatide in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.  \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism.  \nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment using Suliqua, frequent glucose monitoring and \ndose adjustment may be necessary. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment of lixisenatide is needed in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). In \npatients with hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced capacity for \ngluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. Frequent glucose monitoring and dose adjustment \nmay be necessary for Suliqua in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Suliqua in the paediatric population. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nSuliqua is to be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, deltoid, or thigh.  \n \nThe injection sites should be rotated within the same region (abdomen, deltoid, or thigh) from one \ninjection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and/or cutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients should be instructed to always use a new needle. The re-use of insulin pen needles increases \nthe risk of blocked needles, which may cause under- or overdosing. In the event of blocked needles, \npatients must follow the instructions described in the Instructions for Use accompanying the package \nleaflet (see section 6.6). \n \nSuliqua must not be drawn from the cartridge of the pre-filled pen into a syringe to avoid dosing errors \nand potential overdose (see section 4.4). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSuliqua should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of diabetic \nketoacidosis. \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \nHypoglycaemia \n \nHypoglycaemia was the most frequently reported observed adverse reaction during treatment with \nSuliqua (see section 4.8). Hypoglycaemia may occur if the dose of Suliqua is higher than required.  \n \nFactors increasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \nnecessitate dose adjustment. These factors include: \n- change in the injection area \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors) \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea) \n- inadequate food intake \n- missed meals \n- alcohol consumption \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders, (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency) \n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \n- lixisenatide and/or insulin in combination with a sulfonylurea may result in an increased risk of \n\nhypoglycaemia. Therefore Suliqua should not be given in combination with a sulfonylurea.  \n \nThe dose of Suliqua must be individualised based on clinical response and is titrated based on the \npatient’s need for insulin (see section 4.2). \n \nAcute pancreatitis \n \nUse of GLP-1 receptor agonists has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. There \nhave been few reported events of acute pancreatitis with lixisenatide although a causal relationship has \nnot been established. Patients should be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis: \npersistent, severe abdominal pain. If pancreatitis is suspected, Suliqua should be discontinued; if acute \npancreatitis is confirmed, lixisenatide should not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients \nwith a history of pancreatitis. \n \nSevere gastrointestinal disease \n \nUse of GLP-1 receptor agonists may be associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Suliqua has \nnot been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, including severe gastroparesis and \ntherefore, the use of Suliqua is not recommended in these patients.   \n \nSevere renal impairment \n \nThere is no therapeutic experience in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less \nthan 30 ml/min) or end-stage renal disease. Use is not recommended in patients with severe renal \nimpairment or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nConcomitant medicinal products \n \nThe delay of gastric emptying with lixisenatide may reduce the rate of absorption of orally \nadministered medicinal products. Suliqua should be used with caution in patients receiving oral \nmedicinal products that require rapid gastrointestinal absorption, require careful clinical monitoring or \nhave a narrow therapeutic ratio. Specific recommendations regarding intake of such medicinal \nproducts are given in section 4.5. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nDehydration \n \nPatients treated with Suliqua should be advised of the potential risk of dehydration in relation to \ngastrointestinal adverse reactions and take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. \n \nAntibody formation \n \nAdministration of Suliqua may cause formation of antibodies against insulin glargine and/or \nlixisenatide. In rare cases, the presence of such antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the Suliqua \ndose in order to correct a tendency for hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia. \n \nAvoidance of medication errors \n \nPatients must be instructed to always check the pen label before each injection to avoid accidental \nmix-ups between the two different strengths of Suliqua and mix-ups with other injectable diabetes \nmedicinal products. \nTo avoid dosing errors and potential overdose, neither the patients nor healthcare professionals should \never use a syringe to draw the medicinal product from the cartridge in the pre-filled pen into a syringe. \n \nPopulations not studied \n \nSuliqua has not been studied in combination with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, \nsulfonylureas, glinides, and pioglitazone. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially \n'sodium-free'. \nThis medicinal product contains metacresol, which may cause allergic reactions. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies with Suliqua have been performed. The information given below is based on \nstudies with the monocomponents.  \n \nPharmacodynamic interactions \n \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of Suliqua. \n \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme \n(ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, \npentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens, phenothiazine derivatives, \nsomatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, \nterbutaline), thyroid hormones, atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. clozapine and \nolanzapine) and protease inhibitors. \n \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia, which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n \nLixisenatide is a peptide and is not metabolised by cytochrome P450. In in vitro studies, lixisenatide \ndid not affect the activity of cytochrome P450 isozymes or human transporters tested. \nNo pharmacokinetic interactions are known for insulin glargine. \n \nEffect of gastric emptying on oral medicinal products \nThe delay of gastric emptying with lixisenatide may reduce the rate of absorption of orally \nadministered medicinal products. Patients receiving medicinal products of either a narrow therapeutic \nratio or medicinal products that require careful clinical monitoring should be followed closely, \nespecially at the time of initiation of lixisenatide treatment. These medicinal products should be taken \nin a standardised way in relation to lixisenatide. If such medicinal products are to be administered with \nfood, patients should be advised to, if possible, take them with a meal when lixisenatide is not \nadministered. \n \nFor oral medicinal products that are particularly dependent on threshold concentrations for efficacy, \nsuch as antibiotics, patients should be advised to take those medicinal products at least 1 hour before \nor 4 hours after lixisenatide injection. \n \nGastro-resistant formulations containing substances sensitive to stomach degradation, should be \nadministered 1 hour before or 4 hours after lixisenatide injection.  \n \nParacetamol \nParacetamol was used as a model medicinal product to evaluate the effect of lixisenatide on gastric \nemptying. Following administration of a single dose of paracetamol 1000 mg, paracetamol AUC and \nt1/2 were unchanged whatever the timing of its administration (before or after the lixisenatide \ninjection). When administered 1 or 4 hours after 10 mcg lixisenatide, Cmax of paracetamol was \ndecreased by 29% and 31%, respectively and median tmax was delayed by 2.0 and 1.75 hours, \nrespectively. A further delay in tmax and a reduced Cmax of paracetamol have been predicted with the \n20 mcg maintenance dose. \nNo effects on paracetamol Cmax and tmax were observed when paracetamol was administered 1 hour \nbefore lixisenatide. \n \nBased on these results, no dose adjustment for paracetamol is required but the delayed tmax observed \nwhen paracetamol is administered 1-4 hours after lixisenatide should be taken into account when a \nrapid onset of action is required for efficacy. \n \nOral contraceptives \nFollowing administration of a single dose of an oral contraceptive medicinal product (ethinylestradiol \n0.03 mg/levonorgestrel 0.15 mg) 1 hour before or 11 hours after 10 mcg lixisenatide, the Cmax, AUC, \nt1/2 and tmax of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel were unchanged. \n \nAdministration of the oral contraceptive 1 hour or 4 hours after lixisenatide did not affect AUC and \nt1/2 of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel, whereas Cmax of ethinylestradiol was decreased by 52% and \n39%, respectively and Cmax of levonorgestrel was decreased by 46% and 20%, respectively and \nmedian tmax was delayed by 1 to 3 hours. \nThe reduction in Cmax is of limited clinical relevance and no dose adjustment for oral contraceptives is \nrequired. \n \nAtorvastatin \nWhen lixisenatide 20 mcg and atorvastatin 40 mg were co-administered in the morning for 6 days, the \nexposure to atorvastatin was not affected, while Cmax was decreased by 31% and tmax was delayed by \n3.25 hours. \n \nNo such increase for tmax was observed when atorvastatin was administered in the evening and \nlixisenatide in the morning but the AUC and Cmax of atorvastatin were increased by 27% and 66%, \nrespectively. \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n \nThese changes are not clinically relevant and, therefore, no dose adjustment for atorvastatin is required \nwhen co-administered with lixisenatide. \n \nWarfarin and other coumarin derivatives \nAfter concomitant administration of warfarin 25 mg with repeated dosing of lixisenatide 20 mcg, there \nwere no effects on AUC or INR (International Normalised Ratio) while Cmax was reduced by 19% and \ntmax was delayed by 7 hours. \nBased on these results, no dose adjustment for warfarin is required when co-administered with \nlixisenatide; however, frequent monitoring of INR in patients on warfarin and/or coumarin derivatives \nis recommended at the time of initiation or ending of lixisenatide treatment. \n \nDigoxin \nAfter concomitant administration of lixisenatide 20 mcg and digoxin 0.25 mg at steady state, the AUC \nof digoxin was not affected. The tmax of digoxin was delayed by 1.5 hour and the Cmax was reduced by \n26%. \nBased on these results, no dose adjustment for digoxin is required when co-administered with \nlixisenatide. \n \nRamipril \nAfter concomitant administration of lixisenatide 20 mcg and ramipril 5 mg during 6 days, the AUC of \nramipril was increased by 21% while the Cmax was decreased by 63%. The AUC and Cmax of the active \nmetabolite (ramiprilat) were not affected. The tmax of ramipril and ramiprilat were delayed by \napproximately 2.5 hours. \nBased on these results, no dose adjustment for ramipril is required when co-administered with \nlixisenatide. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nSuliqua is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies with use of Suliqua, \ninsulin glargine, or lixisenatide.  \n \nA large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) with insulin \nglargine indicate no specific adverse effects of insulin glargine on pregnancy and no specific \nmalformative nor foeto/neonatal toxicity of insulin glargine. Animal data do not indicate reproductive \ntoxicity with insulin glargine.  \nThere are no adequate data from the use of lixisenatide in pregnant women. Studies with lixisenatide \nin animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \nSuliqua should not be used during pregnancy. If a patient wishes to become pregnant, or pregnancy \noccurs, treatment with Suliqua should be discontinued. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether insulin glargine or lixisenatide is excreted in human milk. Suliqua should not \nbe used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies with lixisenatide or insulin glargine do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect \nto fertility.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSuliqua has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. However, the patient's \nability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia or, \nfor example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in situations where these \nabilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving and using \nmachines. This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning \nsymptoms of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered \nwhether it is advisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions during treatment with Suliqua were hypoglycaemia \nand gastrointestinal adverse reactions (see section 'Description of selected adverse reactions' below). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \nclass and in order of decreasing frequency (very common: ≥1/10; common: ≥1/100 to <1/10; \nuncommon: ≥1/1,000 to <1/100; rare: ≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000; very rare: <1/10,000; not known: cannot \nbe estimated from the available data). \n \nSystem organ class Frequency \n  Very common Common Uncommon Not Known \nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n  Nasopharyngitis \nUpper respiratory tract \ninfection\n\n \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n    Urticaria   \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nHypoglycaemia    \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nDizziness Headache   \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea \nDiarrhoea \nVomiting \n\nDyspepsia \nAbdominal pain \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n   Cutaneous amyloidosis\nLipodystrophy\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\n Injection site \nreactions \n\nFatigue \n \n\n \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nHypoglycaemia \nThe following table describes the rate of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (≤3.9 mmol/L) and \nsevere hypoglycaemia for both Suliqua and the comparator. \n\n \nDocumented symptomatic or severe hypoglycaemic adverse reactions \n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n Insulin naïve patients Switch from basal \ninsulin \n\nSwitch from GLP-1 receptor \nagonist \n\n Suliqua Insulin\nglargine\n\nLixisenatide Suliqua Insulin \nglargine \n\nSuliqua GLP-1 receptor \nagonist \n\nN 469 467 233 365 365 255 256\nDocumented symptomatic \nhypoglycaemia* \n\n   \n \n\nPatients with event, \n n (%) \n\n120  \n(25.6%) \n\n110  \n(23.6%) \n\n15  \n(6.4%) \n\n146  \n(40.0) \n\n155  \n(42.5) \n\n71 \n(27.8%) \n\n6 \n(2.3%) \n\nEvents per patient-year,  \nn 1.44 1.22 0.34 3.03 4.22 1.54 0.08 \n\nSevere hypoglycaemia**         \n\nEvents per patient-year,  \nn 0 <0.01 0 0.02 <0.01 \n\n<0.01 0 \n\n* Documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia was an event during which typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia \nwere accompanied by a measured plasma glucose concentration of ≤3.9 mmol/L. \n** Severe symptomatic hypoglycaemia was an event requiring assistance of another person to actively \nadminister carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders  \nGastrointestinal adverse reactions (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea) were frequently reported adverse \nreactions during the treatment period. In patients treated with Suliqua, the incidence of related nausea, \ndiarrhoea and vomiting was 8.4%, 2.2% and 2.2%, respectively. Gastrointestinal adverse reactions \nwere mostly mild and transient in nature.  \n \nImmune system disorders \nAllergic reactions (urticaria) possibly related with Suliqua have been reported in 0.3% of patients. \nCases of generalised allergic reaction including anaphylactic reaction and angioedema have been \nreported during marketed use of insulin glargine and lixisenatide.  \n \nImmunogenicity  \nAdministration of Suliqua may cause formation of antibodies against insulin glargine and/or \nlixisenatide. \n \nThe incidence of formation of anti-insulin glargine antibodies was 21.0% and 26.2%. In approximately \n93% of the patients, anti-insulin glargine antibodies showed cross-reactivity to human insulin. The \nincidence of formation of anti-lixisenatide antibodies was approximately 43%. Neither status for anti-\ninsulin glargine antibodies nor for anti-lixisenatide antibodies had a clinically relevant impact on \nsafety or efficacy. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nLipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site of insulins and delay local \ninsulin absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to \nreduce or prevent these reactions. \n \nInjection site reactions \nSome (1.7%) patients taking insulin containing therapy, including Suliqua have experienced erythema, \nlocal oedema, and pruritus at the site of injection.  \n \nHeart rate \nIncrease in heart rate has been reported with GLP-1 receptor agonist use and a transient increase was \nalso observed in some studies with lixisenatide. No increase in mean heart rate was seen in all Phase 3 \nstudies with Suliqua. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose  \n \nHypoglycaemia and gastrointestinal adverse reactions may develop if a patient is dosed with more \nSuliqua than required. \n \nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \nof the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \nMore severe episodes of hypoglycaemia with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated \nwith intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained \ncarbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after \napparent clinical recovery. \n \nIn case of gastrointestinal adverse reactions, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated \naccording to the patient’s clinical signs and symptoms. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, long-acting. \nATC Code: A10AE54. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nSuliqua combines two active substances with complementary mechanisms of action to improve \nglycaemic control: insulin glargine, a basal insulin analogue (mainly targeting fasting plasma glucose), \nand lixisenatide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist (mainly targeting postprandial glucose). \n \nInsulin glargine  \nThe primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin \nand its analogues lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal \nmuscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, \nand enhances protein synthesis.  \n \nLixisenatide  \nLixisenatide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist. The GLP-1 receptor is the target for native GLP-1, an \nendogenous incretin hormone that potentiates glucose-dependent insulin secretion from beta cells and \nsuppresses glucagon from alpha cells in the pancreas.  \nLixisenatide stimulates insulin secretion when blood glucose is increased but not at normoglycaemia, \nwhich limits the risk of hypoglycaemia. In parallel, glucagon secretion is suppressed. In case of \nhypoglycaemia, the rescue mechanism of glucagon secretion is preserved. A postprandial injection of \nLixisenatide also slows gastric emptying thereby reducing the rate at which meal-derived glucose is \nabsorbed and appears in the circulation. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nPharmacodynamic effects  \n \nSuliqua \nThe combination of insulin glargine and lixisenatide has no impact on the pharmacodynamics of \ninsulin glargine. The impact of the combination of insulin glargine and lixisenatide on the \npharmacodynamics of lixisenatide has not been studied in phase 1 studies.  \nConsistent with a relatively constant concentration/time profile of insulin glargine over 24 hours with \nno pronounced peak when administered alone, the glucose utilisation rate/time profile was similar \nwhen given in the insulin glargine/lixisenatide combination.  \nThe time course of action of insulins, including Suliqua, may vary between individuals and within the \nsame individual.  \n \nInsulin glargine  \nIn clinical studies with insulin glargine (100 units/ml) the glucose-lowering effect on a molar basis \n(i.e., when given at the same doses) of intravenous insulin glargine is approximately the same as that \nfor human insulin.  \n \nLixisenatide  \nIn a 28-day placebo-controlled study in patients with type 2 diabetes 5 to 20 mcg lixisenatide resulted \nin a statistically significant decreases in postprandial blood glucose after breakfast, lunch and dinner. \n \nGastric emptying  \nFollowing a standardised labelled test meal, in the study referred to above, it was confirmed that \nlixisenatide slows gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate of postprandial glucose absorption. The \nslowing effect of gastric emptying was maintained at the end of the study.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of Suliqua on glycaemic control were evaluated in three randomised \nclinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus:  \n\n Add-on to metformin [Insulin Naïve] \n Switch from basal insulin \n Switch from GLP-1 receptor agonist  \n\n \nIn each of the active-controlled trials, treatment with Suliqua produced clinically and statistically \nsignificant improvements in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). \nReaching lower HbA1c levels and achieving greater HbA1c reduction did not increase rates of \nhypoglycaemia with combination treatment versus insulin glargine alone (see section 4.8). \n \nIn the Add-on to metformin clinical study the treatment was started at 10 dose steps (10 units insulin \nglargine and 5 mcg lixisenatide). In the switch from basal insulin clinical study the starting dose was \n20 dose steps (20 units insulin glargine and 10 mcg lixisenatide) or 30 dose steps, (30 units insulin \nglargine and 10 mcg lixisenatide), see section 4.2, depending on the previous insulin dose. In both \nstudies the dose was titrated once weekly, based on fasting self-measured plasma glucose values. \n \nAdd-on to metformin [insulin naïve] \n \nClinical study in patients with Type 2 diabetes insufficiently controlled on OAD treatment \nA total of 1170 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomised in an open label, 30-week, active-\ncontrolled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Suliqua compared to the individual components, \ninsulin glargine (100 units/ml) and lixisenatide (20 mcg).  \n \nPatients with type 2 diabetes, treated with metformin alone or metformin and a second OAD treatment \nthat could be a sulfonylurea or a glinide or a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor or a \ndipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and who were not adequately controlled with this treatment \n(HbA1c range 7.5% to 10% for patients previously treated with metformin alone and 7.0% to 9% for \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\npatients previously treated with metformin and a second oral anti-diabetic treatment) entered a run-in \nperiod for 4 weeks. During this run-in phase metformin treatment was optimised and any other OADs \nwere discontinued. At the end of the run-in period, patients who remained inadequately controlled \n(HbA1c between 7% and 10%) were randomised to either Suliqua, insulin glargine or lixisenatide. Of \nthe 1479 patients who started the run-in phase, 1170 were randomised. The main reasons for not \nentering the randomized phase were FPG value >13.9 mmol/L and HbA1c value <7% or >10% at the \nend of the run-in phase \n \nThe randomised type 2 diabetes population had the following characteristics: Mean age was 58.4 years \nwith the majority (57.1%) being aged of 50 to 64 years, and 50.6 percent were male. The mean BMI at \nbaseline was 31.7 kg/m2 with 63.4% of patients having a BMI ≥30 kg/m2. The mean duration of \ndiabetes was approximately 9 years. Metformin was a mandatory background therapy and 58% of \npatients received a second OAD at screening, being a sulfonylurea in 54% of patients. \n \nAt Week 30, Suliqua provided statistically significant improvement in HbA1c (p-value <0.0001) \ncompared to the individual components. In a pre-specified analysis of this primary endpoint, the \ndifferences observed were consistent with regard to baseline HbA1c (<8% or ≥8%) or baseline OAD \nuse (metformin alone or metformin plus second OAD). \nSee table and figure below for the other endpoints in the study.  \n \nResults at 30 weeks - Add-on to metformin clinical study (mITT population) \n Suliqua Insulin glargine Lixisenatide \n\nNumber of subjects (mITT)  468 466 233 \n\nHbA1c (%)     \nBaseline (mean; post run-in phase)  8.1 8.1 8.1 \nEnd of study (mean)  6.5 6.8 7.3 \n\n LS change from baseline (mean) -1.6 -1.3 -0.9 \n\nDifference vs. insulin glargine \n[95% confidence interval]  \n(p-value) \n\n -0.3 \n[-0.4, -0.2] \n(<0.0001) \n\n \n\nDifference vs. lixisenatide  \n[95% confidence interval]  \n(p-value) \n\n  -0.8 \n[-0.9, -0.7] \n(<0.0001) \n\nNumber of Patients (%) reaching HbA1c \n<7% at week 30*  \n\n345 (74%) 277 (59%) 77 (33%) \n\nFasting plasma glucose (mmol/L)     \nBaseline (mean) 9.88 9.75 9.79 \nEnd of study (mean) 6.32 6.53  8.27  \nLS change from baseline (mean)  -3.46 -3.27 -1.50 \nLS difference versus glargine (mean) \n[95% confidence interval] \n(p-value) \n\n -0.19 \n[-0.420 to 0.038] \n\n(0.1017) \n\n \n\nLS difference versus lixisenatide (mean)  \n[95% confidence interval] \n(p-value) \n\n  -1.96 \n[-2.246 to -1.682] \n\n(<0.0001) \n2 hour PPG (mmol/L)** \n \n\n   \n\nBaseline (mean) 15.19  14.61 14.72  \nEnd of study (mean) 9.15  11.35  9.99  \nLS change from baseline  -5.68  \n\n \n-3.31 \n\n \n-4.58 \n\n \nLS difference versus glargine (mean)  -2.38  \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n[95% confidence interval] (-2.79 to -1.96) \nLS difference versus lixisenatide (mean)  \n[95% confidence interval] \n\n  -1.10   \n(-1.63 to -0.57) \n\nMean body weight (kg)     \nBaseline (mean)  89.4 89.8 90.8 \nLS change from baseline (mean) -0.3 1.1 -2.3 \nComparison versus insulin glargine  \n[95% confidence interval]  \n(p-value) \n\n -1.4 \n[-1.9 to -0.9] \n\n(<0.0001) \n\n \n\nComparison versus lixisenatide  \n[95% confidence interval]*  \n\n  2.01 \n[1.4 to 2.6] \n\nNumber (%) of patients achieving HbA1c \n<7.0% with no body weight gain at week \n30  \n\n202  \n(43.2%) \n\n117  \n(25.1%) \n\n65  \n(27.9%) \n\nProportion difference vs. insulin glargine  \n[95% confidence interval]  \n(p-value) \n\n 18.1 \n[12.2 to 24.0] \n\n(<0.0001) \n\n \n\nProportion difference vs. lixisenatide \n[95% confidence interval]*  \n\n  15.2 \n[8.1 to 22.4] \n\nInsulin glargine daily dose    \nLS insulin dose at week 30 (mean)  39.8 40.5 NA \n\n*Not included in the pre-specified step-down testing procedure \n**2 hour PPG minus the pre-meal glucose value \n \n\nFigure: Mean HbA1c (%) by visit during 30-week randomised treatment period - mITT \npopulation \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nPatients in the Suliqua group reported a statistically significantly greater decrease in the average \n7-point self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) profile from baseline to Week 30 (-3.35 mmol/L) \ncompared to patients in the insulin glargine group (-2.66 mmol/L; difference -0.69 mmol/L) and \npatients in the lixisenatide group (-1.95 mmol/L; difference -1.40 mmol/L) (p<0.0001 for both \ncomparisons). At all time points, 30-week mean plasma glucose values were lower in the Suliqua \ngroup than in both the insulin glargine group and the lixisenatide group, with the only exception of the \npre-breakfast value which was similar between the Suliqua group and the insulin glargine group.   \n \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nSwitch from basal insulin \n \nClinical study in patients with Type 2 diabetes insufficiently controlled on basal insulin \nA total of 736 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a randomised, 30-week, active-controlled, \nopen-label, 2-treatment arm, parallel-group, multicentre study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of \nSuliqua compared to insulin glargine (100 units/ml).  \n\nPatients screened had type 2 diabetes were treated with basal insulin for at least 6 months, receiving a \nstable daily dose of between 15 and 40 U alone or combined with 1 or 2 OADs (metformin or a \nsulfonylurea or a glinide or a SGLT-2 inhibitor or a DPP-4 inhibitor), had an HbA1c between 7.5% \nand 10% (mean HbA1c of 8.5% at screening) and a FPG less than or equal to 10.0 mmol/L or \n11.1 mmol/L depending on their previous anti-diabetic treatment. \n \nAfter screening, eligible patients (n=1018) entered a 6 week run-in phase where patients remained on \nor switched to insulin glargine, in case they took another basal insulin, and had their insulin dose \ntitrated/stabilised while continuing metformin (if previously taken). Any other OADs were \ndiscontinued.  \nAt the end of the run-in period, patients with an HbA1c between 7 and 10% , FPG ≤7.77 mmol/L and \ninsulin glargine daily dose of 20 to 50 units, were randomised to either Suliqua (n=367) or insulin \nglargine (n=369). \n \nThis type 2 diabetes population had the following characteristics: mean age was 60.0 years with the \nmajority (56.3%) being aged of 50 to 64 years, and 53.3 percent were female. The mean BMI at \nbaseline was 31.1 kg/m2 with 57.3% of patients having a BMI ≥30 kg/m2. The mean diabetes duration \nwas approximately 12 years and the mean duration of previous basal insulin treatment was \napproximately 3 years. At screening 64.4% of patients were receiving insulin glargine as basal insulin \nand 95.0% received at least 1 concomitant OAD.  \nAt Week 30, Suliqua provided statistically significant improvement in HbA1c (p-value <0.0001) \ncompared to insulin glargine.  \nSee table and figure below for the other endpoints in the study. \n \nResults at 30 weeks -Study Type 2 Diabetes Uncontrolled on Basal Insulin mITT population \n Suliqua Insulin glargine \n\nNumber of subjects (mITT) 366 365 \n\nHbA1c (%)   \n   \nBaseline (mean; post run-in phase)   8.1 8.1 \nEnd of treatment (mean)  6.9 7.5 \n\nLS change from baseline (mean)   -1.1 -0.6 \n\nDifference versus insulin glargine \n[95% confidence interval]  \n(p-value) \n\n-0.5 \n[-0.6, -0.4] \n(<0.0001) \n\nPatients [n (%)] reaching HbA1c <7% at week 30*  201 (54.9%) 108 (29.6%) \nFasting plasma glucose (mmol/L)    \n\nBaseline (mean) 7.33 7.32 \nEnd of study (mean) 6.78 6.69 \nLS change from baseline (mean) -0.35 -0.46 \nDifference versus insulin glargine \n[95% confidence interval] \n\n0.11 \n(-0.21 to 0.43) \n\n2 hour PPG (mmol/L)** \n \n\n  \n\nBaseline (mean) 14.85 14.97  \nEnd of study (mean) 9.91  13.41  \nLS change from baseline (mean) -4.72  -1.39 \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n  \nLS difference versus glargine (mean) \n[95% confidence interval] \n\n-3.33 \n(-3.89 to -2.77) \n\nMean body weight (kg)    \nBaseline (mean)  87.8 87.1 \nLS change from baseline (mean) -0.7 0.7 \nComparison versus  insulin glargine  \n[95% confidence interval]  \n(p-value) \n\n-1.4 \n[-1.8 to -0.9] \n\n(<0.0001) \nNumber (%) of patients achieving HbA1c< 7.0% \nwith no body weight gain at week 30 \n\n125  \n(34.2%) \n\n49  \n(13.4%) \n\nProportion difference versus insulin glargine  \n[95%  confidence interval]  \n(p-value) \n\n20.8 \n[15.0 to 26.7] \n\n(<0.0001) \nInsulin glargine daily dose   \n\nBaseline (mean)  35.0 35.2 \nEndpoint (mean)  46.7 46.7 \nLS insulin dose change at week 30 (mean) 10.6 10.9 \n*Not included in the pre-specified step-down testing procedure \n**2 hour PPG minus the pre-meal glucose value \n\n \n \nFigure:  Mean HbA1c (%) by visit during 30-week randomised treatment period - mITT \npopulation  \n \n \n\n \n \n \nSwitch from GLP-1 receptor agonist \n \nClinical study in patients with Type 2 diabetes insufficiently controlled on GLP-1 receptor agonist \nThe efficacy and safety of Suliqua compared to unchanged pre-trial GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment \nwere studied in a 26-week, randomized, open-label trial. The trial included 514 patients with type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus inadequately controlled (HbA1c level of 7% to 9% both inclusive) while treated for \nat least 4 months with liraglutide or exenatide or for at least 6 months with dulaglutide, albiglutide or \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nexenatide extended release, all at maximal tolerated dose, and metformin alone or in combination with \npioglitazone, a SGLT-2 inhibitor or both. Eligible patients were randomized to either receive Suliqua \nor to continue their previous GLP-1 receptor agonist both on top of their previous oral anti-diabetic \ntreatment.  \n\nAt screening, 59.7% of the subjects received a once or twice-daily GLP-1 receptor agonist and 40.3% \nreceived a once weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist. At screening, 6.6% of the subjects received \npioglitazone, and 10.1% a SGLT-2 inhibitor in combination with metformin. The study population had \nthe following characteristics: mean age was 59.6 years, 52.5% of the subjects were male. The mean \nduration of diabetes was 11 years, the mean duration of previous GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment \nwas 1.9 years, the mean BMI was approximately 32.9 kg/m2, mean eGFR was 87.3 ml/min/1.73 m2 \nand 90.7% of patients had an eGFR ≥60 ml/min.  \n\nAt week 26, Suliqua provided statistically significant improvement in HbA1c (p <0.0001). A pre-\nspecified analysis by GLP-1 receptor agonist subtype (once/twice daily or weekly formulation) used at \nscreening showed that HbA1c change at week 26 was similar for each subgroup and consistent with \nthe primary analysis for the overall population. The mean daily dose of Suliqua at Week 26 was 43.5 \ndose steps. \n \nSee table and figure below for the other endpoints in the study.  \n \nResults at 26 weeks -Study Type 2 Diabetes Uncontrolled on GLP-1 receptor agonist mITT population  \n Suliqua GLP-1 receptor agonist  \n\nNumber of subjects (mITT)   252 253 \nHbA1c (%)  \nBaseline (mean; post run-in phase)    7.8 7.8 \n\nEnd of treatment (mean)                    6.7 7.4 \n\nLS change from baseline (mean)       -1.0 -0.4 \n\nDifference versus GLP-1 receptor agonist   \n[95% confidence interval]  \n(p-value) \n\n-0.6 [-0.8, -0.5] \n (<0.0001) \n\nPatients [n (%)] reaching HbA1c <7% at week 26  156 (61.9%) 65 (25.7%) \nProportion difference (95% confidence interval) vs \nGLP-1 receptor agonist\n\n36.1% (28.1% to 44.0%) \n\np-value <.0001 \nFasting plasma glucose (mmol/L)    \n\nBaseline (mean)      9.06 9.45 \nEnd of study (mean)    6.86 8.66 \n\nLS change from baseline (mean)    -2.28 -0.60 \nDifference versus GLP-1 receptor agonist   \n[95% confidence interval] \n\n(p-value) \n\n-1.67 \n(-2.00 to -1.34) \n\n(<0.0001) \n2 hour PPG (mmol/L)*     \nBaseline (mean)            13.60 13.78 \nEnd of study (mean)     9.68 12.59 \nLS change from baseline (mean)     -4.0 -1.11 \n\nLS difference versus GLP-1 receptor agonist (mean) \n[95% confidence interval]                                  \n(p-value)  \n\n-2.9 \n(-3.42 to -2.28) \n\n(<0.0001)  \nMean body weight (kg)  \nBaseline (mean) 93.01 95.49 \nLS change from baseline (mean) 1.89 -1.14 \nComparison versus  GLP-1 receptor agonist \n[95% confidence interval]  \n(p-value) \n\n-3.03 \n(2.417 to 3.643) \n\n(<0.0001) \n*2 hour PPG minus the pre-meal glucose value \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\nFigure: Mean HbA1c (%) by visit during 26-week randomized treatment period- mITT \npopulation  \n \n\n \n \nConcomitant use of Suliqua with SGLT-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) \n \nThe concomitant use of Suliqua with SGLT2i is supported by subgroup analyses from three Phase 3 \nrandomized clinical trials (119 patients on the insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio combination \n(FRC) who also received SGLT2i).  \n \nOne study conducted in Europe and North America included data from 26 patients (10.1%) who \nconcomitantly received insulin glargine/lixisenatide FRC, metformin and an SGLT2i. Two more \nPhase 3 studies from the dedicated Japanese clinical development program performed in patients not \nreaching sufficient glycaemic control on OADs provided data for 59 patients (22.7%) and 34 patients \n(21.1%), respectively, who concomitantly received SGLT2i and insulin glargine/lixisenatide FRC. \n \nThe data from these 3 studies show that initiation of Suliqua in patients inadequately controlled with a \ntreatment including SGLT2i leads to improved change in HbA1c versus the comparators. There was \nno increased risk of hypoglycemia and no relevant differences in the overall safety profile in SGLT2i \nusers compared to non-users. \n \nCardiovascular outcome studies \n \nThe cardiovascular safety of insulin glargine and lixisenatide has been established in the ORIGIN and \nELIXA clinical trials, respectively. No dedicated cardiovascular outcome trial has been conducted \nwith Suliqua. \n \nInsulin glargine  \nThe Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention trial (i.e., ORIGIN) was an open-label, \nrandomised, 12,537 patient study that compared LANTUS to standard care on the time to first \noccurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE). MACE was defined as the composite of \nCV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke. The median duration of study follow-up \nwas 6.2 years. The incidence of MACE was similar between LANTUS and standard care in ORIGIN \n[Hazard Ratio (95% CI) for MACE; 1.02 (0.94, 1.11)].  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\nLixisenatide  \nThe ELIXA study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study that \nevaluated cardiovascular (CV) outcomes during treatment with lixisenatide in patients (n=6068) with \ntype 2 diabetes mellitus after a recent Acute Coronary Syndrome. The primary composite efficacy \nendpoint was the time to the first occurrence of any of the following events: Cardiovascular death, \nnon-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalisation for unstable angina.  The median \nduration of study follow-up was 25.8 and 25.7 months in the lixisenatide group and the placebo group, \nrespectively.  \n \nThe incidence of the primary endpoint was similar in the lixisenatide (13.4%) and placebo (13.2%) \ngroups: the hazard ratio (HR) for lixisenatide versus placebo was 1.017, with an associated 2-sided \n95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.886 to 1.168.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nSuliqua in all subsets of the paediatric population for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe insulin glargine/lixisenatide ratio has no relevant impact on the PK of insulin glargine and \nlixisenatide in Suliqua.  \n \nAfter subcutaneous administration of insulin glargine/lixisenatide combinations to patients with type 1 \ndiabetes, insulin glargine showed no pronounced peak. Exposure to insulin glargine following \nadministration of the insulin glargine/lixisenatide combination was 86-88 % compared to \nadministration of separate simultaneous injections of insulin glargine and lixisenatide. This difference \nis not considered clinically relevant. \n \nAfter subcutaneous administration of insulin glargine/lixisenatide combinations to patients with type 1 \ndiabetes, the median tmax of lixisenatide was in the range of 2.5 to 3.0 hours. AUC was comparable \nwhile there was a small decrease in Cmax of lixisenatide of 22-34% compared with separate \nsimultaneous administration of insulin glargine and lixisenatide, which is not likely to be clinically \nsignificant.  \n \nThere are no clinically relevant differences in the rate of absorption when lixisenatide as monotherapy \nis administered subcutaneously in the abdomen, deltoid, or thigh.  \n \nDistribution \n  \nLixisenatide has a low level (55%) of binding to human proteins. The apparent volume of distribution \nof lixisenatide after subcutaneous administration of insulin glargine/lixisenatide combinations (Vz/F) \nis approximately 100 L. The apparent volume of distribution of insulin glargine after subcutaneous \nadministration of the insulin glargine/lixisenatide combinations (Vss/F) is approximately 1700 L. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \n \nA metabolism study in diabetic patients who received insulin glargine alone indicates that insulin \nglargine is rapidly metabolised at the carboxyl terminus of the B chain to form two active metabolites, \nM1 (21A-Gly-insulin) and M2 (21A-Gly-des-30B-Thr-insulin). In plasma, the principal circulating \ncompound is the metabolite M1. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic findings indicate that the \neffect of the subcutaneous injection with insulin glargine is principally based on exposure to M1.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\nAs a peptide, lixisenatide is eliminated through glomerular filtration, followed by tubular reabsorption \nand subsequent metabolic degradation, resulting in smaller peptides and amino acids, which are \nreintroduced in the protein metabolism. After multiple-dose administration in patients with type 2 \ndiabetes, mean terminal half-life was approximately 3 hours and the mean apparent clearance (CL/F) \nabout 35 L/h. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nIn subjects with mild (creatinine clearance calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula 60-90 ml/min), \nmoderate (creatinine clearance 30-60 ml/min) and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n15-30 ml/min) AUC of lixisenatide was increased by 46%, 51% and 87%, respectively.  \nInsulin glargine has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. In patients with renal \nimpairment, however, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin metabolism.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nAs lixisenatide is cleared primarily by the kidney, no pharmacokinetic study has been performed in \npatients with acute or chronic hepatic impairment. Hepatic dysfunction is not expected to affect the \npharmacokinetics of lixisenatide. \nInsulin glargine has not been studied in diabetes patients with hepatic impairment. In patients with \nhepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced capacity for \ngluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n \nAge, Race, Gender and Body weight  \nInsulin glargine  \nEffect of age, race, and gender on the pharmacokinetics of insulin glargine has not been evaluated. In \ncontrolled clinical trials in adults with insulin glargine (100 units/ml), subgroup analyses based on age, \nrace, and gender did not show differences in safety and efficacy.  \n \nLixisenatide  \nAge has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lixisenatide. In a pharmacokinetic \nstudy in elderly non-diabetic subjects, administration of lixisenatide 20 mcg resulted in a mean \nincrease of lixisenatide AUC by 29% in the elderly population (11 subjects aged 65 to 74 years and \n7 subjects aged ≥75 years) compared to 18 subjects aged 18 to 45 years, likely related to reduced renal \nfunction in the older age group.  \n \nEthnic origin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lixisenatide based on the \nresults of pharmacokinetic studies in Caucasian, Japanese and Chinese subjects. \n \nGender has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lixisenatide  \n \nBody weight has no clinically relevant effect on lixisenatide AUC.  \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nIn the presence of anti-lixisenatide antibodies, lixisenatide exposure and variability in exposure are \nmarkedly increased regardless of the dose level. \n \nPaediatric population \nNo studies have been performed with Suliqua in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNo animal studies have been conducted with the combination of insulin glargine and lixisenatide to \nevaluate repeated dose toxicity, carcinogenesis, genotoxicity, or toxicity to reproduction. \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\n \nInsulin glargine \nNon-clinical data for insulin glargine reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional \nstudies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to \nreproduction. \n \nLixisenatide \nIn 2-year subcutaneous carcinogenicity studies, non-lethal C-cell thyroid tumours were seen in rats \nand mice and are considered to be caused by a non-genotoxic GLP-1 receptor-mediated mechanism to \nwhich rodents are particularly sensitive. C-cell hyperplasia and adenoma were seen at all doses in rats \nand a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) could be not defined. In mice, these effects occurred \nat exposure ratio above 9.3-fold when compared to human exposure at the therapeutic dose. No C-cell \ncarcinoma was observed in mice and C-cell carcinoma occurred in rats with an exposure ratio relative \nto exposure at human therapeutic dose of about 900-fold.  \nIn 2-year subcutaneous carcinogenicity study in mice, 3 cases of adenocarcinoma in the endometrium \nwere seen in the mid dose group with a statistically significant increase, corresponding to an exposure \nratio of 97-fold. No treatment-related effect was demonstrated. \n \nAnimal studies did not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to male and female fertility in rats. \nReversible testicular and epididymal lesions were seen in dogs treated with lixisenatide. No related \neffect on spermatogenesis was seen in healthy men. \nIn embryo-foetal development studies, malformations, growth retardation, ossification retardation and \nskeletal effects were observed in rats at all doses (5-fold exposure ratio compared to human exposure) \nand in rabbits at high doses (32-fold exposure ratio compared to human exposure) of lixisenatide. In \nboth species, there was a slight maternal toxicity consisting of low food consumption and reduced \nbody weight. Neonatal growth was reduced in male rats exposed to high doses of lixisenatide during \nlate gestation and lactation, with a slightly increased pup mortality observed. \n \n \n6.

What Suliqua is and what it is used for \n \nSuliqua is an injectable diabetes medicine that contains two active substances: \n insulin glargine: a long-acting type of insulin which helps control blood sugar (glucose) \n\nthroughout the day. \n lixisenatide: a “GLP-1 analogue” that helps the body produce its own additional insulin in \n\nresponse to increases in blood sugar, and slows the absorption of sugar from foods \n \nSuliqua is used to treat adults with type 2 diabetes, to help control blood sugar levels when they are \ntoo high. It is given, with metformin, when other medicines are not enough on their own to control \nyour blood sugar levels.  \n \nIf you use another anti diabetic medicine, discuss with your doctor whether, you should stop using that \nmedicine when starting Suliqua. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Suliqua  \n \nDo not use Suliqua:  \n if you are allergic to insulin glargine or lixisenatide or to any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Suliqua if: \n you have type 1 diabetes, as Suliqua is used for type 2 diabetes and this medicine will not be \n\nright for you. \n you have diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes that occurs when the body is unable \n\nto use glucose because there is not enough insulin) since this medicine will not be right for you.  \n you have a severe stomach or gut problem such as a disease of the muscles of the stomach \n\ncalled “gastroparesis” which results in delayed stomach emptying. Since Suliqua may cause \nstomach side effects, the medicine has not been studied in patients with severe stomach or gut \nproblems. Please see the information regarding medicines that should not stay too long in your \nstomach in the section Other medicines and Suliqua.     \n\n you have severe kidney disease or you are on dialysis as the use of this medicine will not be \nrecommended.  \n\n \nFollow closely your doctor’s instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and \nphysical activity (physical work and exercise) and injection technique. \n \nBe especially aware of the following: \n Too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). If your blood sugar is too low, follow the guidance for \n\nhypoglycaemia (see information in the box at the end of this leaflet). \n Too high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia). If your blood sugar is too high, follow the guidance for \n\nhyperglycaemia (see information in the box at the end of this leaflet). \n Ensure that you use the right medicine. You must always check the label before each injection \n\nto avoid mix-ups between Suliqua and other insulins. \n If you have poor eyesight, please see section 3. \n \nWhile using this medicine be aware of the following and talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse \nbefore using Suliqua: \n severe pain in your stomach area (abdomen) that will not go away. This could be a sign of \n\ninflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis). \n loss of fluids from your body (dehydration) e.g. in case of vomiting and diarrhoea. It is \n\nimportant to avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids, especially during the first weeks of \ntreatment with Suliqua. \n\n \nTravel \nTalk to your doctor before travelling. You may need to talk about: \n If your medicine is available in the country you are visiting. \n How to arrange the supply of your medicine, needles and other items. \n How to correctly store your medicine while travelling. \n The time you eat meals and use your medicine. \n The possible effects of changing to different time zones. \n Any health risks in the countries you will visit. \n What you should do in an emergency if you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThere is no experience with Suliqua in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years; therefore, the \nuse of Suliqua is not recommended in this age group. \n  \nOther medicines and Suliqua  \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using have recently used or might use any other \nmedicines.  \n \nSome medicines can change your blood sugar level. This may mean your Suliqua dose has to change. \nSo, before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it will affect your blood sugar and what action, if any, \nyou need to take. You also need to be careful when you stop taking a medicine. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\nThe effect of some medicines you swallow might be affected by Suliqua. Some medicines such as \nantibiotics, oral contraceptives, statins (medicines like atorvastatin to lower cholesterol), acid-resistant \ntablets or capsules that should not stay too long in your stomach may need to be taken at least one \nhour before or four hours after your Suliqua injection.  \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: \n Any other medicine to treat diabetes. \n Disopyramide, for some heart problems. \n Fluoxetine, for depression. \n Sulphonamide antibiotics, to treat infections. \n Fibrates, for lowering high levels of blood fats. \n Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), for depression or Parkinson´s disease. \n Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, for heart problems or high blood pressure. \n Medicines to relieve pain and lower fever, such as pentoxifylline, propoxyphene and salicylates \n\n(such as acetylsalicylic acid). \n Pentamidine, for some parasite infections. This may cause too low blood sugar which is \n\nsometimes followed by too high blood sugar. \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \n Corticosteroids such as cortisone and prednisolone, for inflammation. \n Danazol, for endometriosis. \n Diazoxide, for high blood pressure. \n Protease inhibitors, for HIV. \n Diuretics, for high blood pressure or fluid retention. \n Glucagon, for very low blood sugar. \n Isoniazid, for tuberculosis. \n Somatropin, a growth hormone. \n Thyroid hormones, for thyroid gland problems.  \n Oestrogens and progestogens, such as in the contraceptive pill for birth control or use of \n\noestrogens for bone loss (osteoporosis).  \n Clozapine, olanzapine and phenothiazine derivatives, for mental health problems. \n Sympathomimetic medicines such as epinephrine (adrenaline), salbutamol and terbutaline, for \n\nasthma. \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n Beta-blockers or clonidine, for high blood pressure. \n Lithium salts, for mental health problems. \n \n\nMedicine that may reduce warning signs of low blood sugar \nBeta-blockers and some other medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, reserpine – for high blood \npressure) may make it harder to recognise warning signs of your low blood sugar levels \n(hypoglycaemia). It can even hide or stop the first signs that your blood sugar is too low. \n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nusing this medicine. \n \nWarfarin or other anticoagulants \nTell your doctor if you are taking warfarin or other anticoagulants (medicines used to prevent clotting \nof the blood) as you might need to have more frequent blood tests (called ‘International Normalised \nRatio’ or INR test) to check your blood clotting. \n \nSuliqua with alcohol \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. You should check your blood sugar \nlevel more often. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nSuliqua should not be used during pregnancy. It is not known if Suliqua harms your unborn child.  \nSuliqua should not be used if breast-feeding. It is not known if Suliqua passes into your milk.  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nHaving too low or too high blood sugar (see information in the box at the end of this leaflet) can affect \nyour ability to drive and use tools or machines. Your concentration may be affected. This could be \ndangerous to yourself and others.  \n \nAsk your doctor whether you can drive if: \n Your blood sugar is often too low. \n You find it hard to recognise when your blood sugar is too low. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Suliqua \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose. This means it is essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \nThis medicine contains metacresol which may cause allergic reactions. \n \n \n3. How to use Suliqua  \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Your doctor may tell you to use a \ndifferent dose of Suliqua compared to your previous insulin dose. Check with your doctor, pharmacist \nor nurse if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your lifestyle, your blood sugar tests and your previous insulin use, your doctor will tell you: \n How much Suliqua you need each day and at what time. \n When to check your blood sugar level and if you need to carry out urine tests.  \n When you may need a higher or lower dose. \n\n \nYour doctor may tell you to use Suliqua with other medicines for high blood sugar. \n \nHow much to use \nSuliqua 100 units/ml + 50 micrograms/ml pre-filled pen: \n This pen provides a dose of 10 to 40 dose steps in one injection, in steps of 1 dose step.  \n Each dose step you dial contains 1 unit of insulin glargine and 0.5 micrograms of lixisenatide.  \n \nYour dose of Suliqua is administered as ‘dose steps’. The dose window on the pen shows the number \nof dose steps. \n \nDo not inject a dose lower than 10 dose steps. Do not inject a dose higher than 40 dose steps. \nIf a dose greater than 40 dose steps is needed, your doctor will prescribe a different strength. For dose \nsteps from 30-60 units, Suliqua 100 units/ml + 33 micrograms/ml solution for injection in a pre-filled \npen is available. \n \nMany factors may affect your blood sugar level. You should know what they are so that you can take \nthe right action if your blood sugar level changes and help stop it becoming too high or too low. See \nthe box at the end of this leaflet for more information. \n \nUse in elderly patients (65 years and older) \nIf you are 65 years or older, talk to your doctor as you may need a lower dose. \n \nIf you have kidney or liver problems \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\nIf you have kidney or liver problems, talk to your doctor as you may need a lower dose. \n \nWhen to inject Suliqua \nUse Suliqua once a day, within 1 hour before a meal. Preferably inject Suliqua before the same meal \nevery day, when you have chosen the most convenient way. \n \nBefore injecting Suliqua  \n Always follow the “Instructions for use” that come with this package leaflet. \n If you do not follow all of these instructions, you may get too much or too little of Suliqua. \n \nTo avoid mistakes, always check the medicine pack and label on the pen before each injection to make \nsure you have the correct pen, especially if you inject more than one medicine.  \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nOther important information about using the pre-filled pens \n Always use a new needle for each injection. The re-use of needles increases the risk of blocked \n\nneedles which may cause under- or overdosing. Dispose of the needle safely after each use. \n To prevent infection being passed from one person to another, pens should never be used for \n\nmore than one person, even when the needle is changed  \n Only use needles that are compatible with Suliqua pen (see “Instructions for Use”). \n A safety test must be performed before each injection. \n If you think your pen is damaged, do not use it. Get a new one. Do not try to repair the pen.  \n Throw away the used needle in a sharps container, or as told by your pharmacist or local \n\nauthority. \n \nHow to inject \n Suliqua is injected under the skin (subcutaneous use or “SC”). \n Inject it into the front of your thighs, upper arms or the front of your waist (abdomen).  \n Change the place within the area you inject each day. This will reduce the risk of developing \n\ndents or lumps at the site (for more information, see “Other side effects” in section 4). \n \nDo not use Suliqua:   \n in a vein. This will change the way it works and may cause your blood sugar to become too low. \n if there are particles in the Suliqua. The solution should be clear, colourless and water-like.  \n \nNever use a syringe to remove the solution from the pen to avoid dosing errors and potential overdose. \n \nIf the pen is damaged, has not been stored correctly, if you are not sure that it is working properly or \nyou notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse: \n throw the pen away and use a new one. \n talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you think you have a problem with your pen.  \n \nIf you use more Suliqua than you should \nIf you have injected too much of this medicine, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar and eat more food to prevent your blood sugar getting too \nlow (hypoglycaemia). If your blood sugar gets too low, see the advice in the box at the end of this \nleaflet. \n \nIf you forget to use Suliqua  \nIf you have missed a dose of Suliqua or if you have not injected enough insulin, your blood sugar level \nmay become too high (hyperglycaemia):  \nWhen needed, Suliqua can be injected before the next meal. \n Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n Do not use two injections per day \n Check your blood sugar and then inject your next dose at the usual time. \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\n For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nIf you stop using Suliqua  \nDo not stop using this medicine without talking to your doctor. If you do, it could lead to very high \nblood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and a build-up of acid in the blood (ketoacidosis).  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIf you notice signs of your blood sugar being too low (hypoglycaemia), take action to increase your \nblood sugar level straightaway (see the box at the end of this leaflet). \nHypoglycaemia can be very serious and is very common with medicines containing insulin (may \naffect more than 1 in 10 people). \nLow blood sugar means that there is not enough sugar in your blood. \nIf your blood sugar falls too low, you may pass out (become unconscious). \nIf blood sugar remains very low for too long it may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. \nFor more information, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nOther side effects \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you notice any of the following side effects: \n Skin changes at the injection site:  \nIf you inject insulin too often at the same place, the skin may either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken \n(lipohypertrophy). Also lumps under the skin caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid may \noccur (cutaneous amyloidosis). It is not known, how often these events occur. The insulin may not \nwork very well. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes. \n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people  \n\n Feeling dizzy \n Feeling sick (Nausea) \n Vomiting \n Diarrhoea \n Skin and allergic reactions at the injection site: The signs may include reddening, \n\nunusually intense pain when injecting, itching, hives, swelling or inflammation. This can \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually disappear in a \nfew days to a few weeks. \n\n \nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people  \n\n Cold, runny nose, sore throat  \n Hives (urticaria) \n Headache \n Indigestion (dyspepsia) \n Stomach ache \n Tiredness \n\nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, feeling sleepy or passing out (becoming unconscious) may be signs of a serious condition \n(ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.  \n \nWhat to do if you experience hyperglycaemia  \n Test your blood sugar level and, if it is high, as agreed with your doctor or nurse, test your urine \n\nfor ketones as soon as you notice any of the above signs \n Contact your doctor straight away if you have severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis. This must \n\nalways be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. \n \nHypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may pass out (become unconscious). Serious \nhypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You should \nlearn to recognise the signs when your blood sugar is falling – so you can take action to stop it getting \nworse.  \n \nReasons why hypoglycaemia may happen: \nExamples include: \n You inject too much Suliqua. \n You miss meals or delay them. \n You do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrates than normal – artificial \n\nsweeteners are not carbohydrates. \n You drink alcohol – especially when you have not eaten much. \n You lose carbohydrates from being sick (vomiting) or diarrhoea. \n You are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity. \n You are recovering from an injury, operation or other stress. \n You are recovering from an illness or from fever. \n \n You are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Suliqua\"). \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to happen if: \n You have just started Suliqua treatment– if low blood sugar occurs, it may be more likely to \n\nhappen in the morning.  \n Your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable. \n You change the area where you inject Suliqua. For example from the thigh to the upper arm. \n You have severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning signs of hypoglycaemia  \nThe first signs may be in your body generally. Examples of signs that your blood sugar level is falling \ntoo much or too fast include: sweating, clammy skin, feeling anxious, fast or irregular heartbeat, high \nblood pressure and palpitations. These signs often develop before the signs of a low sugar level in the \nbrain.  \n \nOther signs include: headaches, feeling very hungry, feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting), \nfeeling tired, sleepy, restless, sleeping problems, aggressive behaviour, difficulty concentrating, slow \nreactions, depression, feeling confused, difficulty speaking (sometimes total loss of speech), changes \nin your sight, trembling, being unable to move (paralysis), tingling in the hands or arms, feeling numb \nand tingling often around the mouth, feeling dizzy, loss of self-control, being unable to look after \nyourself, fits, passing out. \n \nWhen the signs of hypoglycaemia may be less clear: \nThe first warning signs of hypoglycaemia may change, be weaker or missing altogether if: \n You are elderly. \n You have had diabetes for a long time. \n You have a certain type of nerve damage (called “diabetic autonomic neuropathy”). \n You have recently had too low blood sugar (for example the day before). \n Your low blood sugar comes on slowly. \n Your low blood sugar is always around “normal” or your diabetes control has greatly improved \n\nrecently.  \n You have recently changed from animal insulin to a manufactured insulin, like there is in \n\nSuliqua. \n You are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nSuliqua\").  \nIn such cases, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even pass out) before you know what is \nhappening. Be familiar with your warning signs. If necessary, you might need to test your blood sugar \nmore often. This can help to spot mild hypoglycaemic episodes. If you find it difficult to recognise \nyour warning signs, you should avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would \nbe put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat to do if you experience hypoglycaemia? \n \n1. Do not inject Suliqua. Take about 15 to 20 grams sugar straight away - such as glucose, sugar \n\ncubes or a sugary drink. Drink or foods that contain artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) do \nnot help treat low blood sugar.  \n\n2. You might then need to eat something (such as bread or pasta) that will raise your blood sugar \nover a longer time, especially if your next meal is not due. Ask your doctor or nurse if you are \nnot sure which foods you should eat. \nWith Suliqua, it may take longer to recover from low blood sugar because it contains a \nlong-acting insulin (insulin glargine). \n\n \n \n3. Test your blood glucose levels after 10-15 minutes after taking sugar. If blood glucose levels are \n\nstill too low (<4 mmol/L) or hypoglycaemia comes back take another 15 to 20 gram of sugar. \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\n4. Speak to a doctor straightaway if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia, or it comes \nback again. \n\n \nWhat other people should do if you have hypoglycaemia \n \nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues to get medical help straightaway if you are not able to \nswallow or if you pass out (become unconscious).  \nYou will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These \ninjections should be given even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n \nYou should test your blood sugar straightaway after taking glucose to check that you really have \nhypoglycaemia. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\nSuliqua 100 units/ml + 50 micrograms/ml solution for injection in a pre-filled pen \n(10-40).  \n \nINSTRUCTIONS FOR USE \n \nRead the Package Leaflet and these Instructions for Use first \n \n \nSuliqua (10-40) pen contains insulin glargine and lixisenatide.  The combination of medicinal \nproducts in this pen is for the daily injection of 10 to 40 dose steps of Suliqua. \n \n \n\n- Never re-use needles. If you do, you might not get your full dose (underdosing) or get too \nmuch (overdosing) as the needle could block. \n\n- Never use a syringe to remove medicine from your pen. If you do, you may not get the \ncorrect amount of medicine. \n\n \nKeep these Instructions For Use for future reference. \n \nImportant information \n \n•  Never share your pen – it is only for you. \n•  Never use your pen if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. \n•  Always perform a safety test. See STEP 3. \n•  Always carry a spare pen and spare needles in case they get lost or stop working. \n•  Always check the label of the pen before use to make sure you have the correct pen. \n\n \nLearn to inject: \n \n•  Talk with your healthcare provider about how to inject, before using your pen. \n•  Ask for help if you have problems handling the pen, for example if you have problems with \n\nyour sight. \n•  Read all of these instructions before using your pen. If you do not follow all of these \n\ninstructions, you may get too much or too little medicine. \n \nNeed help? \n \nIf you have any questions about Suliqua, the pen or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse or call the local sanofi-aventis number given at the end of the Package Leaflet (see other side). \n \n \nExtra items you will need: \n \n•  a new sterile needle (see STEP 2).   \n•  a sharps container for used needles and pens. (see Throwing your pen away). \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\n \nPlaces to inject \n \n\n \n \n \nGet to know your pen \n \n\n  \n \n    *You will not see the plunger until you have injected a few doses \n \nSTEP 1: Check your pen \n \nTake a new pen out of the refrigerator at least 1 hour before you inject. Injecting cold medication is \nmore painful. \n \n\nA. Check the name and expiry date on the label of your pen. \n•  Make sure you have the correct medicine.  This pen is peach coloured with an orange \n\ninjection button. \n•  Do not use this pen if you need a daily dose less than 10 dose steps or if you need \n\nmore than 40 dose steps.  Discuss with your doctor which pen is suitable for your \nneeds. \n\n•  Do not use your pen after the expiry date. \n \n\n \n\nUpper arms \n\nStomach \n\nThighs \n\nCartridge holder Plunger* Dose window Dose pointer \n\nDose selector \n\nInjection  \nbutton \n\nProduct name Scale Rubber seal Pen cap \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\n \nB. Pull off the pen cap. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nC. Check that the medicine is clear. \n•  Do not use the pen if the medicine looks cloudy, coloured or contains particles. \n\n \n\n \n \nSTEP 2: Attach a new needle \n \n•  Do not reuse needles.  Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps stop \n\nblocked needles, contamination, and infection.  \n•  Always use needles that are compatible for use with Suliqua pen. \n\n \nA. Take a new needle and peel off the protective seal. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nB. Keep the needle straight and screw it onto the pen until fixed. Do not over-tighten. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n\n \nC. Pull off the outer needle cap. Keep this for later. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nD. Pull off the inner needle cap and throw away. \n \n\n \n \nHandling needles \n•  Take care when handling needles to prevent needle injury and cross-infection. \n\n \nSTEP 3: Do a safety test \n \nAlways do a safety test before each injection to: \n•  Check your pen and the needle to make sure they are working properly \n•  Make sure that you get the correct dose. \n\n \nA. Select 2 dose steps by turning the dose selector until the dose pointer is at the 2 mark. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n\n \nB. Press the injection button all the way in. \n\n•  When medicine comes out of the needle tip, your pen is working correctly, the dose \nselector will be reset to “0”. \n\n \n\n \n \n \nIf no liquid appears: \n•  You may need to repeat this step up to 3 times before seeing medicine. \n•  If no medicine comes out after the third time, the needle may be blocked. If this happens: \n\n– change the needle (see STEP 6 and STEP 2), \n– then repeat the safety test (STEP 3). \n\n•  Do not use your pen if there is still no medicine coming out of the needle tip. Use a new pen. \n•  Do not use a syringe to remove medicine from your pen. \n\n \nIf you see air bubbles \n•  You may see air bubbles in the medicine. This is normal, they will not harm you. \n\n \nSTEP 4: Select the dose \n \n•  Use this pen only to inject single daily doses from 10 to 40 dose steps. \n•  Do not select a dose or press the injection button without a needle attached.  This may damage \n\nyour pen. \n \n\nA. Make sure a needle is attached and the dose is set to ‘0’. \n \n\n \n \n\nB. Turn the dose selector until the dose pointer lines up with your dose. \n•  If you turn past your dose, you can turn back down. \n•  If there are not enough dose steps left in your pen for your dose, the dose selector will stop \n\nat the number of dose steps left. \n•  If you cannot select your full prescribed dose, use a new pen or inject the remaining dose \n\nsteps and use a new pen to complete your dose. Only in this case, it is okay to inject a \npartial dose of less than 10 dose steps. Always use another Suliqua (10-40) pen to \ncomplete your dose and no other pen. \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\n \nHow to read the dose window \n•  Do not use the pen if your single daily dose is less than 10 dose steps, shown as white \n\nnumbers on a black background. \n\n \n\n  \n \nUnits of medicine in your pen \n•  Your pen contains a total of 300 dose steps. You can select your dose in steps of 1 dose step. \n•  Do not use this pen if you need a single daily dose that is less than 10 dose steps, or more than \n\n40 dose steps. \n•  Each pen contains more than 1 dose. \n\n \nSTEP 5: Inject the dose \n \n•  If you find it hard to press the injection button in, do not force it as this may break your pen.   \n\n \n•  Change the needle (see STEP 6 Remove the needle and STEP 2 Attach a new needle) then \n\ndo a safety test (see STEP 3). \n•  If you still find it hard to press in, get a new pen. \n•  Do not use a syringe to remove medicine from your pen. \n\n \nA. Choose a place to inject as shown in the picture above. \n\n \nB. Push the needle into your skin as shown by your healthcare provider. \n\n•  Do not touch the injection button yet. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n\n \nC. Place your thumb on the injection button. Then press all the way in and hold. \n\n•  Do not press at an angle.  Your thumb could block the dose selector from turning. \n \n\n \n \n\nD. Keep the injection button held in and when you see \"0\" in the dose window, slowly count \nto 10. \n•  This will make sure you get your full dose. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nE. After holding and slowly counting to 10, release the injection button. Then remove the \nneedle from your skin. \n\n \n \nSTEP 6: Remove the needle \n \n•  Take care when handling needles to prevent needle injury and cross-infection. \n•  Do not put the inner needle cap back on. \n\n \nA. Grip the widest part of the outer needle cap.  Keep the needle straight and guide it into \n\nthe outer needle cap back. Then push firmly on. \n•  The needle can puncture the cap if it is recapped at an angle. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\n \nB. Grip and squeeze the widest part of the outer needle cap. Turn your pen several times with \n\nyour other hand to remove the needle. \n•  Try again if the needle does not come off the first time. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nC. Throw away the used needle in a puncture resistant container (see “Throwing your pen \naway” at the end of these Instructions for Use). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nD. Put your pen cap back on. \n•  Do not put the pen back in the refrigerator. \n\n \n\n \n \nHow to store your pen \n \nBefore first use \n•  Keep new pens in the refrigerator between 2°C to 8°C. \n•  Do not freeze. \n\n \nAfter first use \n•  Keep your pen at room temperature, below 25°C \n•  Do not put your pen back in the refrigerator. \n•  Do not store your pen with the needle attached. \n•  Store the pen with your pen cap on. \n•  Only use your pen for up to 28 days after its first use. \n\n \nHow to care for your pen \n \nHandle your pen with care \n•  If you think that your pen may be damaged, do not try to fix it.  Use a new one. \n\n \nProtect your pen from dust and dirt \n•  You can clean the outside of your pen by wiping it with a damp cloth (water only).  Do not \n\nsoak, wash or lubricate the pen. This may damage it. \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n\n \nThrowing your pen away \n\n Remove the needle before throwing your pen away. \n Throw away your used pen as instructed by your pharmacist or local authority. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\nPackage leaflet: information for the user \n \n\nSuliqua 100 units/ml + 33 micrograms/ml solution for injection in a pre-filled pen \nInsulin glargine + lixisenatide \n\n \n This medicine is subject to additional monitoring.

What you need to know before you use Suliqua  \n3. How to use Suliqua  \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Suliqua  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Suliqua is and what it is used for \n \nSuliqua is an injectable diabetes medicine that contains two active substances: \n insulin glargine: a long acting type of insulin which helps control blood sugar (glucose) \n\nthroughout the day. \n Lixisenatide:  a “GLP-1 analogue” that helps the body produce its own additional insulin in \n\nresponse to increases in blood sugar, and slows the absorption of sugar from foods. \n \nSuliqua is used to treat adults with type 2 diabetes, to help control blood sugar levels when they are \ntoo high. \n \nIt is given with metformin, when other medicines are not enough on their own to control your blood \nsugar levels. \n \nIf you use another anti-diabetic medicine, discuss with your doctor whether you should stop using that \nmedicine when starting Suliqua. \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Suliqua  \n \nDo not use Suliqua:  \n if you are allergic to insulin glargine or lixisenatide or to any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Suliqua if \n you have type 1 diabetes, as Suliqua is used for type 2 diabetes and this medicine will not be \n\nright for you.  \n you have diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes that occurs when the body is unable \n\nto use glucose because there is not enough insulin) since this medicine will not be right for you.  \n you have a severe stomach or gut problem such as a disease of the muscles of the stomach \n\ncalled “gastroparesis” which results in delayed stomach emptying. Since Suliqua may cause \nstomach side effects, the medicine has not been studied in patients with severe stomach or gut \nproblems. Please see the information regarding medicines that should not stay too long in your \nstomach in the section Other medicines and Suliqua.  \n\n you have severe kidney disease or you are on dialysis as the use of this medicine will not be \nrecommended  \n\n \nFollow closely your doctor’s instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and \nphysical activity (physical work and exercise) and injection technique. \n \nBe especially aware of the following: \n Too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). If your blood sugar is too low, follow the guidance for \n\nhypoglycaemia (see information in the box at the end of this leaflet). \n Too high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia). If your blood sugar is too high, follow the guidance for \n\nhyperglycaemia (see information in the box at the end of this leaflet). \n Ensure that you use the right medicine. You must always check the label before each injection \n\nto avoid mix-ups between Suliqua and other insulins. \n If you have poor eyesight, please see section 3. \n \nWhile using this medicine be aware of the following and talk to doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nusing Suliqua: \n severe pain in your stomach area (abdomen) that will not go away. This could be a sign of \n\ninflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis). \n loss of fluids from your body (dehydration) e.g. in case of vomiting and diarrhoea. It is \n\nimportant to avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids, especially during the first weeks of \ntreatment with Suliqua. \n\n \nTravel \nTalk to your doctor before travelling. You may need to talk about: \n If your medicine is available in the country you are visiting. \n How to arrange the supply of your medicine, needles and other items. \n How to correctly store your medicine while travelling. \n The time you eat meals and use your medicine. \n The possible effects of changing to different time zones. \n Any health risks in the countries you will visit. \n What you should do in an emergency if you feel unwell or become ill. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThere is no experience with Suliqua in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years, therefore, the \nuse of Suliqua is not recommended in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Suliqua  \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other \nmedicines.  \n \nSome medicines can change your blood sugar level. This may mean your Suliqua dose has to change. \nSo, before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it will affect your blood sugar and what action, if any, \nyou need to take. You also need to be careful when you stop taking a medicine. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n\nThe effect of some medicines you swallow might be affected by Suliqua. Some medicines such as \nantibiotics, oral contraceptives, statins (medicines like atorvastatin to lower cholesterol) acid resistant \ntablets or capsules that should not stay too long in your stomach may need to be taken at least one hour \nbefore or four hours after your Suliqua injection.  \n \nYour blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: \n Any other medicine to treat diabetes. \n Disopyramide, for some heart problems. \n Fluoxetine, for depression. \n Sulphonamide antibiotics, to treat infections. \n Fibrates, for lowering high levels of blood fats. \n Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), for depression or Parkinson´s disease. \n Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, for heart problems or high blood pressure. \n Medicines to relieve pain and lower fever, such as pentoxifylline, propoxyphene and salicylates \n\n(such as acetylsalicylic acid). \n Pentamidine, for some parasite infections. This may cause too low blood sugar which is \n\nsometimes followed by too high blood sugar. \n \nYour blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \n Corticosteroids such as cortisone and prednisolone, for inflammation. \n Danazol, for endometriosis. \n Diazoxide, for high blood pressure. \n Protease inhibitors, for HIV. \n Diuretics, for high blood pressure or fluid retention. \n Glucagon, for very low blood sugar. \n Isoniazid, for tuberculosis. \n Somatropin, a growth hormone. \n Thyroid hormones, for thyroid gland problems.  \n Oestrogens and progestogens, such as in the contraceptive pill for birth control or use of \n\noestrogens for bone loss (osteoporosis).  \n Clozapine, olanzapine and phenothiazine derivatives, for mental health problems. \n Sympathomimetic medicines such as epinephrine (adrenaline), salbutamol and terbutaline, for \n\nasthma. \n \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n Beta-blockers or clonidine, for high blood pressure. \n Lithium salts, for mental health problems. \n \n\nMedicine that may reduce warning signs of low blood sugar \nBeta-blockers and some other medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, reserpine, for high blood \npressure) may make it harder to recognise warning signs of your low blood sugar levels \n(hypoglycaemia). It can even hide or stop the first signs that your blood sugar is too low. \n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nusing this medicine. \n \nWarfarin or other anticoagulants \nTell your doctor if you are taking warfarin or other anticoagulants (medicines used to prevent clotting \nof the blood) as you might need to have more frequent blood tests (called ‘International Normalised \nRatio’ or INR test) to check your blood clotting. \n \nSuliqua with alcohol \nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. You should check your blood sugar \nlevel more often. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nSuliqua should not be used during pregnancy. It is not known if Suliqua harms your unborn child.  \nSuliqua should not be used if breast-feeding. It is not known if Suliqua passes into your milk.  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nHaving too low or too high blood sugar (see information in the box at the end of this leaflet) can affect \nyour ability to drive and use tools or machines. Your concentration may be affected. This could be \ndangerous to yourself and others.  \n \nAsk your doctor whether you can drive if: \n Your blood sugar is often too low. \n You find it hard to recognise when your blood sugar is too low. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Suliqua \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose. This means it is essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \nThis medicine contains metacresol which may cause allergic reactions. \n \n \n3. How to use Suliqua  \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Your doctor may tell you to use a \ndifferent dose of Suliqua compared to your previous insulin dose. Check with your doctor, pharmacist \nor nurse if you are not sure. \n \nBased on your lifestyle, your blood sugar tests and your previous insulin use, your doctor will tell you: \n How much Suliqua you need each day and at what time. \n When to check your blood sugar level and if you need to carry out urine tests.  \n When you may need a higher or lower dose. \n\n \nYour doctor may tell you to use Suliqua with other medicines for high blood sugar. \n \nHow much to use \nThe Suliqua 100 units/ml + 33 micrograms/ml pre-filled SoloStar pen: \n This pen provides a dose of 30 to 60 dose steps in one injection, in steps of 1 dose step.  \n Each dose step of Suliqua you dial contains 1 unit of insulin glargine and 0.33 micrograms of \n\nlixisenatide.  \n \nYour dose of Suliqua is administered as ‘dose steps’. The dose window on the pen shows the number \nof dose steps. \n \nDo not inject a dose lower than 30 dose steps. If a dose lower than 30 dose steps is needed, use the \nSuliqua 100 units/ml + 50 micrograms pre-filled pen (Suliqua (10-40) pen. \n \nDo not inject a dose greater than 60 dose steps. \n \nMany factors may affect your blood sugar level. You should know what they are so that you can take \nthe right action if your blood sugar level changes and help stop it becoming too high or too low. See \nthe box at the end of this leaflet for more information. \n \nUse in elderly patients (65 years and over) \nIf you are 65 years or older, talk to your doctor as you may need a lower dose. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n\nIf you have kidney or liver problems \nIf you have kidney or liver problems, talk to your doctor as you may need a lower dose. \n \nWhen to inject Suliqua \nUse Suliqua once a day, within 1 hour before a meal. Preferably inject Suliqua before the same meal \nevery day, when you have chosen the most convenient way. \n \nBefore injecting Suliqua  \n Always follow the “Instructions for use” that come with this package leaflet. \n If you do not follow all of these instructions, you may get too much or too little of Suliqua. \n \nTo avoid mistakes, always check the medicine pack and label on the pen before each injection to make \nsure you have the correct pen, especially if you inject more than one medicine. Ask your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nOther important information about using the pre-filled pens \n Always use a new needle for each injection. The re-use of needles increases the risk of blocked \n\nneedles which may cause under- or overdosing. Dispose of the needle safely after each use. \n To prevent infection being passed from one person to another, pens should never be used for more \n\nthan one person, even when the needle is changed  \n Only use needles that are compatible for use with Suliqua pen (see “Instructions for Use”). \n A safety test must be performed before each injection. \n If you think your pen is damaged, do not use it. Get a new one. Do not try to repair the pen.  \n Throw away the used needle in a sharps container, or as told by your pharmacist or local authority. \n \nHow to inject \n Suliqua is injected under the skin (subcutaneous use or “SC”). \n Inject it into the front of your thighs, upper arms or the front of your waist (abdomen).  \n Change the place within the area you inject each day. This will reduce the risk of developing \n\ndents or lumps at the site (for more information, see “Other side effects” in section 4). \n \nDo not use Suliqua:   \n in a vein. This will change the way it works and may cause your blood sugar to become too low. \n if there are particles in the Suliqua. The solution should be clear, colourless and water-like.  \n \nNever use a syringe to remove the solution from the pen to avoid dosing errors and potential overdose. \n \nIf the pen is damaged, has not been stored correctly, if you are not sure that it is working properly or \nyou notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse: \n throw the pen away and use a new one. \n talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you think you have a problem with your pen.  \n \nIf you use more Suliqua than you should \nIf you have injected too much of this medicine, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar and eat more food to prevent your blood sugar getting too \nlow (hypoglycaemia). If your blood sugar gets too low, see the advice in the box at the end of this \nleaflet. \n \nIf you forget to use Suliqua  \nIf you have missed a dose of Suliqua or if you have not injected enough insulin, your blood sugar level \nmay become too high (hyperglycaemia):  \nWhen needed, Suliqua can be injected before the next meal. \n Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n Do not take two injections per day \n Check your blood sugar and then inject your next dose at the usual time. \n\n\n\n \n\n62 \n\n For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nIf you stop using Suliqua  \nDo not stop using this medicine without talking to your doctor. If you do, it could lead to very high \nblood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and a build-up of acid in the blood (ketoacidosis).  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIf you notice signs of your blood sugar being too low (hypoglycaemia), take action to increase your \nblood sugar level straight away (see the box at the end of this leaflet). \nHypoglycaemia can be very serious and is very common with medicine containing insulin (may affect \nmore than 1 in 10 people). \nLow blood sugar means that there is not enough sugar in your blood. \nIf your blood sugar falls too low, you may pass out (become unconscious). \nIf blood sugar remains very low for too long it may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. \nFor more information, see the box at the end of this leaflet. \n \nOther side effects \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you notice any of the following side effects: \n Skin changes at the injection site:  \nIf you inject insulin too often at the same place, the skin may either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken \n(lipohypertrophy). Also lumps under the skin caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid may \noccur (cutaneous amyloidosis). It is not known, how often these events occur. The insulin may not \nwork very well. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes. \n \n Common: may affect up to 1 in 10 people  \n\n Feeling dizzy \n Feeling sick (Nausea) \n Vomiting \n Diarrhoea \n Skin and allergic reactions at the injection site: The signs may include reddening, \n\nunusually intense pain when injecting, itching, hives, swelling or inflammation. This can \nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually disappear in a \nfew days to a few weeks. \n\n Uncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people  \n Cold, runny nose, sore throat  \n Hives (urticaria) \n Headache. \n Indigestion (dyspepsia) \n Stomach ache \n Tiredness \n\n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n\n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \nbreathing, feeling sleepy or passing out (becoming unconscious) may be signs of a serious condition \n(ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.  \n \nWhat to do if you experience hyperglycaemia  \n Test your blood sugar level and, if it is high and as agreed with your doctor or nurse, test your \n\nurine for ketones as soon as you notice any of the above signs \n Contact your doctor straight away if you have severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis. This must \n\nalways be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. \n \nHypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels) \n \nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may pass out (become unconscious). Serious \nhypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You should \nlearn to recognise the signs when your blood sugar is falling – so you can take action to stop it getting \nworse.  \n \nReasons why hypoglycaemia may happen: \nExamples include: \n You inject too much Suliqua. \n You miss meals or delay them. \n You do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrates than normal – artificial \n\nsweeteners are not carbohydrates. \n You drink alcohol – especially when you have not eaten much. \n You lose carbohydrates from being sick (vomiting) or diarrhoea. \n You are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity. \n You are recovering from an injury, operation or other stress. \n You are recovering from an illness or from fever. \n You are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Suliqua\"). \n\n\n\n \n\n67 \n\n \nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to happen if: \n You have just started Suliqua treatment – if low blood sugar occurs, it may be more likely to \n\nhappen in the morning.  \n Your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable. \n You change the area where you inject Suliqua. For example from the thigh to the upper arm. \n You have severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \nWarning signs of hypoglycaemia  \nThe first signs may be in your body generally. Examples of signs that your blood sugar level is falling \ntoo much or too fast include: sweating, clammy skin, feeling anxious, fast or irregular heartbeat, high \nblood pressure and palpitations. These signs often develop before the signs of a low sugar level in the \nbrain.  \n \nOther signs include: headaches, feeling very hungry, feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting), \nfeeling tired, sleepy, restless, sleeping problems, aggressive behaviour, difficulty concentrating, slow \nreactions, depression, feeling confused, difficulty speaking (sometimes total loss of speech), changes \nin your sight, trembling, being unable to move (paralysis), tingling in the hands or arms, feeling numb \nand tingling often around the mouth, feeling dizzy, loss of self-control, being unable to look after \nyourself, fits, passing out. \n \nWhen the signs of hypoglycaemia may be less clear: \nThe first warning signs of hypoglycaemia may change, be weaker or missing altogether if: \n You are elderly. \n You have had diabetes for a long time. \n You have a certain type of nerve damage (called “diabetic autonomic neuropathy”). \n You have recently had too low blood sugar (for example the day before). \n Your low blood sugar comes on slowly. \n Your low blood sugar is always around “normal” or your diabetes control has greatly improved \n\nrecently.  \n You have recently changed from animal insulin to a manufactured insulin, like there is in \n\nSuliqua. \n You are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nSuliqua\").  \nIn such cases, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even pass out) before you know what is \nhappening. Be familiar with your warning signs. If necessary, you might need to test your blood sugar \nmore often. This can help to spot mild hypoglycaemic episodes. If you find it difficult to recognise \nyour warning signs, you should avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would \nbe put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nWhat to do if you experience hypoglycaemia? \n \n1. Do not inject Suliqua. Take about 15 to 20 grams sugar straight away - such as glucose, sugar \n\ncubes or a sugary drink. Do not drink or eat foods that contain artificial sweeteners (such as diet \ndrinks do not help treat low blood sugar. \n\n2. You might the need to eat something (such as bread or pasta) that will raise your blood sugar \nover a longer time, especially if your next meal is not due. Ask your doctor or nurse if you are \nnot sure which foods you should eat. \nWith Suliqua, it may take longer to recover from low blood sugar because it contains a \nlong-acting insulin (insulin glargine). \n\n \n \n3. Test your blood glucose levels after 10-15 minutes after taking sugar.
