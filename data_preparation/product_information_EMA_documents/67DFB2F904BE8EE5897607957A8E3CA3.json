CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) \n\non maintenance dialysis therapy.  \n\n \n\nCinacalcet Mylan may be used as part of a therapeutic regimen including phosphate binders and/or \n\nvitamin D sterols, as appropriate (see section 5.1).  \n\n \n\nReduction of hypercalcaemia in patients with:  \n\n• parathyroid carcinoma.  \n• primary HPT for whom parathyroidectomy would be indicated on the basis of serum calcium \n\nlevels (as defined by relevant treatment guidelines), but in whom parathyroidectomy is not \n\nclinically appropriate or is contraindicated. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nSecondary hyperparathyroidism: \n\n \n\nAdults and elderly (> 65 years) \n\nThe recommended starting dose for adults is 30 mg once per day. Cinacalcet should be titrated every 2 \n\nto 4 weeks to a maximum dose of 180 mg once daily to achieve a target parathyroid hormone (PTH) in \n\ndialysis patients of between 150-300 pg/ml (15.9-31.8 pmol/l) in the intact PTH (iPTH) assay. PTH \n\nlevels should be assessed at least 12 hours after dosing with cinacalcet. Reference should be made to \n\ncurrent treatment guidelines.  \n\n \n\nPTH should be measured 1 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment of cinacalcet. PTH should be \n\nmonitored approximately every 1-3 months during maintenance. Either the intact PTH (iPTH) or bio-\nintact PTH (biPTH) may be used to measure PTH levels; treatment with cinacalcet does not alter the \n\nrelationship between iPTH and biPTH.  \n\n \n\nDose adjustment based on serum calcium levels \n\nCorrected serum calcium should be measured and monitored and should be at or above the lower limit \n\nof the normal range prior to administration of first dose of cinacalcet (see section 4.4). The normal \n\ncalcium range may differ depending on the methods used by your local laboratory.  \n\n \n\nDuring dose titration, serum calcium levels should be monitored frequently, and within 1 week of \n\ninitiation or dose adjustment of cinacalcet. Once the maintenance dose has been established, serum \n\ncalcium should be measured approximately monthly. In the event that corrected serum calcium levels \n\nfall below 8.4 mg/dl (2.1 mmol/l) and/or symptoms of hypocalcaemia occur the following \n\nmanagement is recommended: \n\n \n\nCorrected Serum calcium level or clinical \n\nsymptoms of hypocalcaemia \n\nRecommendations \n\n< 8.4 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L) and > 7.5 mg/dL \n\n(1.9 mmol/L), or in the presence of clinical \n\nsymptoms of hypocalcaemia  \n\nCalcium-containing phosphate binders, \n\nvitamin D sterols and/or adjustment of dialysis \n\nfluid calcium concentrations can be used to \n\nraise serum calcium according to clinical \n\njudgment.  \n\n< 8.4 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L) and > 7.5 mg/dL \n\n(1.9 mmol/L) or persistent symptoms of \n\nhypocalcaemia despite attempts to increase \n\nserum calcium  \n\nReduce or withhold dose of cinacalcet.  \n\nCorrected Serum calcium level or clinical \n\nsymptoms of hypocalcaemia \n\nRecommendations \n\n≤ 7.5 mg/dL (1.9 mmol/L) or persistent \n\nsymptoms of hypocalcaemia and vitamin D \n\ncannot be increased  \n\nWithhold administration of cinacalcet until \n\nserum calcium levels reach 8.0 mg/dL \n\n(2.0 mmol/L) and/or symptoms of \n\nhypocalcaemia have resolved.  \n\nTreatment should be reinitiated using the next \n\nlowest dose of cinacalcet.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nCinacalcet Mylan is not indicated for use in children and adolescents. Other pharmaceutical forms \n\nmay be available for this population. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n4 \n \n\nParathyroid carcinoma and primary hyperparathyroidism: \n\n \n\nAdults and elderly (> 65 years) \n\nThe recommended starting dose of Cinacalcet Mylan for adults is 30 mg twice per day. The dose of \n\ncinacalcet should be titrated every 2 to 4 weeks through sequential doses of 30 mg twice daily, 60 mg \n\ntwice daily, 90 mg twice daily, and 90 mg three or four times daily as necessary to reduce serum \n\ncalcium concentration to or below the upper limit of normal. The maximum dose used in clinical trials \n\nwas 90 mg four times daily.  \n\n \n\nSerum calcium should be measured within 1 week after initiation or dose adjustment of cinacalcet. \n\nOnce maintenance dose levels have been established, serum calcium should be measured every 2 to \n\n3 months. After titration to the maximum dose of cinacalcet, serum calcium should be periodically \n\nmonitored; if clinically relevant reductions in serum calcium are not maintained, discontinuation of \n\ncinacalcet therapy should be considered (see section 5.1).  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of cinacalcet in children for the treatment of parathyroid carcinoma and \n\nprimary hyperparathyroidism have not been established. No data are available. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo change in starting dose is necessary. Cinacalcet should be used with caution in patients with \n\nmoderate to severe hepatic impairment and treatment should be closely monitored during dose titration \n\nand continued treatment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor oral use. \n\nTablets should be taken whole and should not be chewed, crushed or divided. \n\nIt is recommended that Cinacalcet Mylan be taken with food or shortly after a meal, as studies have \n\nshown that bioavailability of cinacalcet is increased when taken with food (see section 5.2).  \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nHypocalcaemia (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nSerum calcium \n\nLife threatening events and fatal outcomes associated with hypocalcaemia have been reported in adult \n\nand paediatric patients treated with cinacalcet. Manifestations of hypocalcaemia may include \n\nparaesthesias, myalgias, cramping, tetany and convulsions. Decreases in serum calcium can also \n\nprolong the QT interval, potentially resulting in ventricular arrhythmia secondary to hypocalcaemia. \n\nCases of QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia have been reported in patients treated with \n\ncinacalcet (see section 4.8). Caution is advised in patients with other risk factors for QT prolongation \n\nsuch as patients with known congenital long QT syndrome or patients receiving medicinal products \n\nknown to cause QT prolongation.  \n\n \n\nSince cinacalcet lowers serum calcium, patients should be monitored carefully for the occurrence of \n\nhypocalcaemia (see section 4.2). Serum calcium should be measured within 1 week after initiation or \n\ndose adjustment of cinacalcet. \n\n \n\nCinacalcet treatment should not be initiated in patients with a serum calcium (corrected for albumin) \n\nbelow the lower limit of the normal range.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n \n\nIn Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients receiving dialysis who were administered cinacalcet, \n\napproximately 30% of patients had at least one serum calcium value less than 7.5 mg/dl (1.9 mmol/l).  \n\n \n\nCKD patients not on dialysis \n\nCinacalcet is not indicated for CKD patients not on dialysis. Investigational studies have shown that \n\nCKD patients not on dialysis treated with cinacalcet have an increased risk for hypocalcaemia (serum \n\ncalcium levels < 8.4 mg/dl [2.1 mmol/l]) compared with cinacalcet-treated CKD patients on dialysis, \n\nwhich may be due to lower baseline calcium levels and/or the presence of residual kidney function. \n\n \n\nSeizures  \n\nCases of seizures have been reported in patients treated with cinacalcet (see section 4.8). The threshold \n\nfor seizures is lowered by significant reductions in serum calcium levels. Therefore, serum calcium \n\nlevels should be closely monitored in patients receiving cinacalcet, particularly in patients with a \n\nhistory of a seizure disorder. \n\n \n\nHypotension and/or worsening heart failure  \n\nCases of hypotension and/or worsening heart failure have been reported in patients with impaired \n\ncardiac function, in which a causal relationship to cinacalcet could not be completely excluded and \n\nmay be mediated by reductions in serum calcium levels (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nCo-administration with other medicinal products \n\nAdminister cinacalcet with caution in patients receiving any other medicinal products known to lower \n\nserum calcium. Closely monitor serum calcium (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nPatients receiving cinacalcet should not be given etelcalcetide. Concurrent administration may result \n\nin severe hypocalcaemia. \n\n \n\nGeneral  \n\nAdynamic bone disease may develop if PTH levels are chronically suppressed below approximately \n\n1.5 times the upper limit of normal with the iPTH assay. If PTH levels decrease below the \n\nrecommended target range in patients treated with cinacalcet, the dose of cinacalcet and/or vitamin D \n\nsterols should be reduced or therapy discontinued.  \n\n \n\nTestosterone levels  \n\nTestosterone levels are often below the normal range in patients with end-stage renal disease. In a \n\nclinical study of ESRD patients on dialysis, free testosterone levels decreased by a median of 31.3% in \n\nthe cinacalcet-treated patients and by 16.3% in the placebo-treated patients after 6 months of \n\ntreatment. An open-label extension of this study showed no further reductions in free and total \n\ntestosterone concentrations over a period of 3 years in cinacalcet-treated patients. The clinical \n\nsignificance of these reductions in serum testosterone is unknown.  \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment  \n\nDue to the potential for 2 to 4 fold higher plasma levels of cinacalcet in patients with moderate to \n\nsevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification), cinacalcet should be used with caution in these \n\npatients and treatment should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).   \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nMedicinal products known to reduce serum calcium  \n\nConcurrent administration of other medicinal products known to reduce serum calcium and cinacalcet \n\nmay result in an increased risk of hypocalcaemia (see section 4.4). Patients receiving cinacalcet should \n\nnot be given etelcalcetide (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nEffect of other medicines on cinacalcet  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\nCinacalcet is metabolised in part by the enzyme CYP3A4. Co-administration of 200 mg, twice daily \n\nketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, caused an approximate 2-fold increase in cinacalcet \n\nlevels. Dose adjustment of cinacalcet may be required if a patient receiving cinacalcet initiates or \n\ndiscontinues therapy with a strong inhibitor (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, telithromycin, \n\nvoriconazole, ritonavir) or inducer (e.g. rifampicin) of this enzyme.  \n\n \n\nIn vitro data indicate that cinacalcet is in part metabolised by CYP1A2. Smoking induces CYP1A2; \n\nthe clearance of cinacalcet was observed to be 36-38% higher in smokers than non-smokers. The \n\neffect of CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) on cinacalcet plasma levels has not \n\nbeen studied. Dose adjustment may be necessary if a patient starts or stops smoking or when \n\nconcomitant treatment with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is initiated or discontinued.  \n\n \n\nCalcium carbonate: Co-administration of calcium carbonate (single 1,500 mg dose) did not alter the \n\npharmacokinetics of cinacalcet.  \n\n \n\nSevelamer: Co-administration of sevelamer (2,400 mg, three times a day) did not affect the \n\npharmacokinetics of cinacalcet.  \n\n \n\nPantoprazole: Co-administration of pantoprazole (80 mg, once daily) did not alter the \n\npharmacokinetics of cinacalcet.  \n\n \n\nEffect of cinacalcet on other medicines  \n\nMedicinal products metabolised by the enzyme P450 2D6 (CYP2D6): cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor \n\nof CYP2D6. Dose adjustments of concomitant medicinal products may be required when cinacalcet is \n\nadministered with individually titrated, narrow therapeutic index substances that are predominantly \n\nmetabolised by CYP2D6 (e.g. flecainide, propafenone, metoprolol, desipramine, nortriptyline, \n\nclomipramine).  \n\n \n\nDesipramine: Concurrent administration of 90 mg cinacalcet once daily with 50 mg desipramine, a \n\ntricyclic antidepressant metabolised primarily by CYP2D6, significantly increased desipramine \n\nexposure 3.6-fold (90% CI 3.0, 4.4) in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers.  \n\n \n\nDextromethorphan: Multiple doses of 50 mg cinacalcet increased the AUC of 30 mg \n\ndextromethorphan (metabolised primarily by CYP2D6) by 11-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers. \n\n \n\nWarfarin: Multiple oral doses of cinacalcet did not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics \n\n(as measured by prothrombin time and clotting factor VII) of warfarin.  \n\n \n\nThe lack of effect of cinacalcet on the pharmacokinetics of R-and S-warfarin and the absence of auto-\n\ninduction upon multiple dosing in patients indicates that cinacalcet is not an inducer of CYP3A4, \n\nCYP1A2 or CYP2C9 in humans.  \n\n \n\nMidazolam: Co-administration of cinacalcet (90 mg) with orally administered midazolam (2 mg), a \n\nCYP3A4 and CYP3A5 substrate, did not alter the pharmacokinetics of midazolam. These data suggest \n\nthat cinacalcet would not affect the pharmacokinetics of those classes of medicines that are \n\nmetabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, such as certain immunosuppressants, including ciclosporin \n\nand tacrolimus.  \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no clinical data from the use of cinacalcet in pregnant women. Animal studies do not \n\nindicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, parturition or postnatal development. No \n\nembryonal/foetal toxicities were seen in studies in pregnant rats and rabbits with the exception of \n\ndecreased foetal body weights in rats at doses associated with maternal toxicities (see section 5.3). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\nCinacalcet Mylan should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential \n\nrisk to the foetus. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether cinacalcet is excreted in human milk. Cinacalcet is excreted in the milk of \n\nlactating rats with a high milk to plasma ratio. Following careful benefit/risk assessment, a decision \n\nshould be made to discontinue either breast-feeding or treatment with Cinacalcet Mylan. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical data relating to the effect of cinacalcet on fertility. There were no effects on \n\nfertility in animal studies. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nDizziness and seizures, which may have major influence on the ability to drive and use machines, have \n\nbeen reported by patients taking cinacalcet (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\na) Summary of the safety profile \n \n\nSecondary hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid carcinoma and primary hyperparathyroidism \n\nBased on available data from patients receiving cinacalcet in placebo controlled studies and single-arm \n\nstudies the most commonly reported adverse reactions were nausea and vomiting. Nausea and \n\nvomiting were mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature in the majority of patients. \n\nDiscontinuation of therapy as a result of undesirable effects was mainly due to nausea and vomiting. \n\n \n\nb) Tabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions, considered at least possibly attributable to cinacalcet treatment in the placebo \n\ncontrolled studies and single-arm studies based on best-evidence assessment of causality are listed \n\nbelow using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); \n\nuncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known \n\n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nIncidence of adverse reactions from controlled clinical studies and post-marketing experience are: \n\n \nSystem organ class Very Common Common Not known \n\nImmune system disorders  Hypersensitivity reactions*  \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \n\ndisorders \n\n Anorexia \n\nDecreased appetite \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders  Seizures†  \n\nDizziness \n\nParaesthesia \n\nHeadache \n\n \n\nCardiac disorders   Worsening heart failure* † \n\nQT prolongation and \n\nventricular arrhythmia \n\nsecondary to \n\nhypocalcaemia* † \n\nVascular disorders  Hypotension  \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders \n\n Upper respiratory infection \n\nDyspnoea \n\nCough \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea \n\nVomiting \n\nDyspepsia \n\nDiarrhoea \n\nAbdominal pain \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\nAbdominal pain - upper \n\nConstipation \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders \n\n Rash  \n\nMusculoskeletal and \n\nconnective tissue disorders \n\n Myalgia \n\nMuscle spasms \n\nBack pain \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site \n\nconditions \n\n Asthenia  \n\nInvestigations  Hypocalcaemia† \n\nHyperkalaemia \n\nReduced testosterone \n\nlevels† \n\n \n\n* see section c)  \n† see section 4.4 \n\n \n\nc) Description of selected adverse reactions  \n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\nHypersensitivity reactions including angioedema and urticaria have been identified during post-\n\nmarketing use of cinacalcet. The frequencies of the individual preferred terms including angioedema \n\nand urticaria cannot be estimated from available data.  \n\n \n\nHypotension and/or worsening heart failure \n\nThere have been reports of idiosyncratic cases of hypotension and/or worsening heart failure in \n\ncinacalcet-treated patients with impaired cardiac function in post-marketing safety surveillance, the \n\nfrequencies of which cannot be estimated from available data.  \n\n \n\nQT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia secondary to hypocalcaemia \n\nQT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia secondary to hypocalcaemia have been identified during \n\npost-marketing use of cinacalcet, the frequencies of which cannot be estimated from available data \n\n(see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nd) Paediatric population  \n\n \n\nCinacalcet Mylan is not indicated for use in paediatric patients. The safety and efficacy of cinacalcet \n\nin the paediatric population have not been established. A fatal outcome was reported in a paediatric \n\nclinical trial patient with severe hypocalcaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V.  \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nDoses titrated up to 300 mg once daily have been administered to patients receiving dialysis without \n\nadverse outcome. \n\n \n\nOverdose of cinacalcet may lead to hypocalcaemia. In the event of overdose, patients should be \n\nmonitored for signs and symptoms of hypocalcaemia, and treatment should be symptomatic and \n\nsupportive. Since cinacalcet is highly protein-bound, haemodialysis is not an effective treatment for \n\noverdose. \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Calcium homeostasis, anti-parathyroid agents, ATC code: H05BX01 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nThe calcium sensing receptor on the surface of the chief cell of the parathyroid gland is the principal \n\nregulator of PTH secretion. Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic agent which directly lowers PTH levels by \n\nincreasing the sensitivity of the calcium sensing receptor to extracellular calcium. The reduction in \n\nPTH is associated with a concomitant decrease in serum calcium levels. \n\n \n\nReductions in PTH levels correlate with cinacalcet concentration. \n\n \n\nAfter steady state is reached, serum calcium concentrations remain constant over the dosing interval. \n\n \n\nSecondary Hyperparathyroidism \n\n  \n\nThree, 6 month, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies were conducted in ESRD patients \n\nwith uncontrolled secondary HPT receiving dialysis (n=1,136). Demographic and baseline \n\ncharacteristics were representative of the dialysis patient population with secondary HPT. Mean \n\nbaseline iPTH concentrations across the 3 studies were 733 and 683 pg/ml (77.8 and 72.4 pmol/l) for \n\nthe cinacalcet and placebo groups, respectively. 66% of patients were receiving vitamin D sterols at \n\nstudy entry, and > 90% were receiving phosphate binders. Significant reductions in iPTH, serum \n\ncalcium-phosphorus product (Ca x P), calcium, and phosphorus were observed in the cinacalcet \n\ntreated patients compared with placebo-treated patients receiving standard care, and the results were \n\nconsistent across the 3 studies. In each of the studies, the primary endpoint (proportion of patients with \n\nan iPTH ≤ 250 pg/ml (≤ 26.5 pmol/l)) was achieved by 41%, 46%, and 35% of patients receiving \n\ncinacalcet, compared with 4%, 7%, and 6% of patients receiving placebo. Approximately 60% of \n\ncinacalcet-treated patients achieved a ≥ 30% reduction in iPTH levels, and this effect was consistent \n\nacross the spectrum of baseline iPTH levels. The mean reductions in serum Ca x P, calcium, and \n\nphosphorus were 14%, 7% and 8%, respectively.  \n\n \n\nReductions in iPTH and Ca x P were maintained for up to 12 months of treatment. Cinacalcet \n\ndecreased iPTH and Ca x P, calcium and phosphorus levels regardless of baseline iPTH or Ca x P \n\nlevel, dialysis modality (PD versus HD), duration of dialysis, and whether or not vitamin D sterols \n\nwere administered. \n\n \n\nReductions in PTH were associated with non-significant reductions of bone metabolism markers (bone \n\nspecific alkaline phosphatase, N-telopeptide, bone turnover and bone fibrosis). In post-hoc analyses of \n\npooled data from 6 and 12 months clinical studies, Kaplan-Meier estimates of bone fracture and \n\nparathyroidectomy were lower in the cinacalcet group compared with the control group. \n\n \n\nInvestigational studies in patients with CKD and secondary HPT not undergoing dialysis indicated that \n\ncinacalcet reduced PTH levels to a similar extent as in patients with ESRD and secondary HPT \n\nreceiving dialysis. However, efficacy, safety, optimal doses and treatment targets have not been \n\nestablished in treatment of predialytic renal failure patients. These studies show that CKD patients not \n\nundergoing dialysis treated with cinacalcet have an increased risk for hypocalcaemia compared with \n\ncinacalcet-treated ESRD patients receiving dialysis, which may be due to lower baseline calcium \n\nlevels and/or the presence of residual kidney function. \n\n \n\nEVOLVE (EValuation Of Cinacalcet Therapy to Lower CardioVascular Events) was a randomised, \n\ndouble-blind clinical study evaluating cinacalcet versus placebo for the reduction of the risk of all-\n\ncause mortality and cardiovascular events in 3,883 patients with secondary HPT and CKD receiving \n\ndialysis. The study did not meet its primary objective of demonstrating a reduction in risk of all-cause \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\nmortality or cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, hospitalisation for unstable angina, \n\nheart failure or peripheral vascular event (HR 0.93; 95% CI: 0.85, 1.02; p = 0.112). After adjusting for \n\nbaseline characteristics in a secondary analysis, the HR for the primary composite endpoint was 0.88; \n\n95% CI: 0.79, 0.97. \n\n \n\nParathyroid carcinoma and Primary Hyperparathyroidism  \n\nIn one study, 46 adult patients (29 with parathyroid carcinoma and 17 with primary HPT and severe \n\nhypercalcaemia (who had failed or had contraindications to parathyroidectomy) received cinacalcet for \n\nup to 3 years (mean of 328 days for patients with parathyroid carcinoma and mean of 347 days for \n\npatients with primary HPT). Cinacalcet was administered at doses ranging from 30 mg twice daily to \n\n90 mg four times daily. The primary endpoint of the study was a reduction of serum calcium of ≥ \n\n1 mg/dl (≥ 0.25 mmol/l). In patients with parathyroid carcinoma, mean serum calcium declined from \n\n14.1 mg/dl to 12.4 mg/dl (3.5 mmol/l to 3.1 mmol/l), while in patients with primary HPT, serum \n\ncalcium levels declined from 12.7 mg/dl to 10.4 mg/dl (3.2 mmol/l to 2.6 mmol/l). Eighteen (18) of 29 \n\npatients (62%) with parathyroid carcinoma and 15 of 17 subjects (88%) with primary HPT achieved a \n\nreduction in serum calcium of ≥ 1 mg/dl (≥ 0.25 mmol/l).  \n\n \n\nIn a 28 week placebo-controlled study, 67 adult patients with primary HPT who met criteria for \nparathyroidectomy on the basis of corrected total serum calcium (> 11.3 mg/dl (2.82 mmol/l) but ≤ \n\n12.5 mg/dl (3.12 mmol/l), but who were unable to undergo parathyroidectomy were included. \n\nCinacalcet was initiated at a dose of 30 mg twice daily and titrated to maintain a corrected total serum \n\ncalcium concentration within the normal range. A significantly higher percentage of cinacalcet treated \n\npatients achieved mean corrected total serum calcium concentration ≤ 10.3 mg/dl (2.57 mmol/l) and ≥ \n\n1 mg/dl (0.25 mmol/l) decrease from baseline in mean corrected total serum calcium concentration, \n\nwhen compared with the placebo treated patients (75.8% versus 0% and 84.8% versus 5.9% \n\nrespectively). \n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nAfter oral administration of cinacalcet, maximum plasma cinacalcet concentration is achieved in \n\napproximately 2 to 6 hours. Based on between-study comparisons, the absolute bioavailability of \n\ncinacalcet in fasted subjects has been estimated to be about 20-25%. Administration of cinacalcet with \n\nfood results in an approximate 50-80% increase in cinacalcet bioavailability. Increases in plasma \n\ncinacalcet concentration are similar, regardless of the fat content of the meal.  \n\n \n\nAt doses above 200 mg, the absorption was saturated probably due to poor solubility.  \n\n \n\nDistribution  \n\nThe volume of distribution is high (approximately 1,000 litres), indicating extensive distribution. \n\nCinacalcet is approximately 97% bound to plasma proteins and distributes minimally into red blood \n\ncells.  \n\n \n\nAfter absorption, cinacalcet concentrations decline in a biphasic fashion with an initial half-life of \n\napproximately 6 hours and a terminal half-life of 30 to 40 hours. Steady state levels of cinacalcet are \n\nachieved within 7 days with minimal accumulation. The pharmacokinetics of cinacalcet does not \n\nchange over time.  \n\n \n\nBiotransformation  \n\nCinacalcet is metabolised by multiple enzymes, predominantly CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 (the \n\ncontribution of CYP1A2 has not been characterised clinically). The major circulating metabolites are \n\ninactive.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\nBased on in vitro data, cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6, but is neither an inhibitor of other \n\nCYP enzymes at concentrations achieved clinically, including CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, \n\nCYP2C19, and CYP3A4 nor an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4.  \n\n \n\nElimination  \n\nAfter administration of a 75 mg radiolabelled dose to healthy volunteers, cinacalcet was rapidly and \n\nextensively metabolised by oxidation followed by conjugation. Renal excretion of metabolites was the \n\nprevalent route of elimination of radioactivity. Approximately 80% of the dose was recovered in the \n\nurine and 15% in the faeces.  \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity  \n\nThe AUC and Cmax of cinacalcet increase approximately linearly over the dose range of 30 to 180 mg \n\nonce daily.  \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships  \n\nSoon after dosing, PTH begins to decrease until a nadir at approximately 2 to 6 hours post dose, \n\ncorresponding with cinacalcet Cmax. Thereafter, as cinacalcet levels begin to decline, PTH levels \n\nincrease until 12 hours post-dose, and then PTH suppression remains approximately constant to the \nend of the once-daily dosing interval. PTH levels in cinacalcet clinical trials were measured at the end \n\nof the dosing interval. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nThere are no clinically relevant differences due to age in the pharmacokinetics of cinacalcet. \n\n \n\nRenal insufficiency \n\nThe pharmacokinetic profile of cinacalcet in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal \n\ninsufficiency, and those on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is comparable to that in healthy \n\nvolunteers. \n\n \n\nHepatic insufficiency \n\nMild hepatic impairment did not notably affect the pharmacokinetics of cinacalcet. Compared to \n\nsubjects with normal liver function, average AUC of cinacalcet was approximately 2-fold higher in \n\nsubjects with moderate impairment and approximately 4-fold higher in subjects with severe \n\nimpairment. The mean half-life of cinacalcet is prolonged by 33% and 70% in patients with moderate \n\nand severe hepatic impairment, respectively. Protein binding of cinacalcet is not affected by impaired \n\nhepatic function. Because doses are titrated for each subject based on safety and efficacy parameters, \n\nno additional dose adjustment is necessary for subjects with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and \n\n4.4). \n\n \n\nGender  \n\nClearance of cinacalcet may be lower in women than in men. Because doses are titrated for each \n\nsubject, no additional dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of cinacalcet was studied in paediatric patients with ESRD receiving dialysis \n\naged 3 to 17 years of age. After single and multiple once daily oral doses of cinacalcet, plasma \n\ncinacalcet concentrations (Cmax and AUC values after normalisation by dose and weight) were similar \n\nto those observed in adult patients.  \n\n \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of demographic \n\ncharacteristics. This analysis showed no significant impact of age, sex, race, body surface area, and \n\nbody weight on cinacalcet pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\nSmoking  \n\nClearance of cinacalcet is higher in smokers than in non-smokers, likely due to induction of CYP1A2-\n\nmediated metabolism. If a patient stops or starts smoking, cinacalcet plasma levels may change and \n\ndose adjustment may be necessary. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nCinacalcet was not teratogenic in rabbits when given at a dose of 0.4 times, on an AUC basis, the \n\nmaximum human dose for secondary HPT (180 mg daily). The non-teratogenic dose in rats was 4.4 \n\ntimes, on an AUC basis, the maximum dose for secondary HPT. There were no effects on fertility in \n\nmales or females at exposures up to 4 times a human dose of 180 mg/day (safety margins in the small \n\npopulation of patients administered a maximum clinical dose of 360 mg daily would be approximately \n\nhalf those given above).  \n\n \n\nIn pregnant rats, there were slight decreases in body weight and food consumption at the highest dose. \n\nDecreased foetal weights were seen in rats at doses where dams had severe hypocalcaemia. Cinacalcet \n\nhas been shown to cross the placental barrier in rabbits.  \n\n \n\nCinacalcet did not show any genotoxic or carcinogenic potential. Safety margins from the toxicology \n\nstudies are small due to the dose-limiting hypocalcaemia observed in the animal models. Cataracts and \n\nlens opacities were observed in the repeat dose rodent toxicology and carcinogenicity studies, but were \n\nnot observed in dogs or monkeys or in clinical studies where cataract formation was monitored. \n\nCataracts are known to occur in rodents as a result of hypocalcaemia.  \n\n \n\nIn in vitro studies, IC50 values for the serotonin transporter and KATP channels were found to be 7 and \n\n12 fold greater, respectively, than the EC50 for the calcium-sensing receptor obtained under the same \n\nexperimental conditions. The clinical relevance is unknown, however, the potential for cinacalcet to \n\nact on these secondary targets cannot be fully excluded. \n\n \n\nIn toxicity studies in juvenile dogs, tremors secondary to decreased serum calcium, emesis, decreased \n\nbody weight and body weight gain, decreased red cell mass, slight decreases in bone densitometry \n\nparameters, reversible widening of the growth plates of long bones, and histological lymphoid changes \n\n(restricted to the thoracic cavity and attributed to chronic emesis) were observed. All of these effects \n\nwere seen at a systemic exposure, on an AUC basis, approximately equivalent to the exposure in \n\npatients at the maximum dose for secondary HPT. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Cinacalcet Mylan is and what it is used for \n \n\nCinacalcet Mylan contains the active ingredient cinacalcet, which works by controlling the levels of \n\nparathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium and phosphorous in your body. It is used to treat problems with \n\norgans called parathyroid glands. The parathyroids are four small glands in the neck, near the thyroid \n\ngland, that produce parathyroid hormone (PTH).  \n\n \n\nCinacalcet Mylan is used:  \n\n• to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with serious kidney disease who need \ndialysis to clear their blood of waste products  \n\n• to reduce high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcaemia) in patients with parathyroid \ncancer  \n\n• to reduce high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcaemia) in patients with primary \nhyperparathyroidism when removal of the parathyroid gland is not possible.  \n\n \n\nIn primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism too much PTH is produced by the parathyroid glands. \n\n“Primary” means that the hyperparathyroidism is not caused by any other condition and “secondary” \n\nmeans that the hyperparathyroidism is caused by another condition, e.g. kidney disease. Both primary \n\nand secondary hyperparathyroidism can cause loss of calcium in the bones, which can lead to bone \n\npain and fractures, problems with blood and heart vessels, kidney stones, mental illness and coma. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Cinacalcet Mylan \n \n\nDo not take Cinacalcet Mylan if you are allergic to cinacalcet or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n34 \n \n\nDo not take Cinacalcet Mylan if you have low levels of calcium in your blood. Your doctor will \n\nmonitor your blood calcium levels. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Cinacalcet Mylan. \n\nBefore you start taking Cinacalcet Mylan, tell your doctor if you have or have ever had:  \n\n• seizures (fits or convulsions). The risk of having seizures is higher if you have had them before;  \n\n• liver problems; \n\n• heart failure.  \n \n\nCinacalcet Mylan reduces calcium levels. Life threatening events and fatal outcomes associated with \n\nlow calcium levels (hypocalcaemia) have been reported in patients treated with cinacalcet.  \n\n \n\nPlease tell your doctor if you experience any of the following which may be signs of low calcium \n\nlevels: spasms, twitches, or cramps in your muscles, or numbness or tingling in your fingers, toes or \n\naround your mouth or seizures, confusion or loss of consciousness while being treated with Cinacalcet \n\nMylan. \n\n \n\nLow calcium levels can have an effect on your heart rhythm. Tell your doctor if you experience an \n\nunusually fast or pounding heartbeat, if you have heart rhythm problems, or if you take medicines \n\nknown to cause heart rhythm problems, while taking Cinacalcet Mylan.  \n\n \n\nFor additional information see section 4. \n\n \n\nDuring treatment with Cinacalcet Mylan, tell your doctor:  \n\n• if you start or stop smoking, as this may affect the way Cinacalcet Mylan works.  \n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nChildren under the age of 18 must not take Cinacalcet Mylan. \n\n \n\nIf you are being treated for secondary hyperparathyroidism, your doctor should monitor your calcium \n\nlevels before starting treatment with Cinacalcet Mylan and during treatment with Cinacalcet Mylan. \n\nYou should inform your doctor if you experience any of the signs of low calcium levels as described \n\nabove.    \n\n  \n\nIt is important that you take your dose of Cinacalcet Mylan as advised by your doctor. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Cinacalcet Mylan  \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines \nparticularly etelcalcetide or any other medicines that lower the level of calcium in your blood. \n\n \n\nYou should not take Cinacalcet Mylan together with etelcalcetide. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking the following medicines. \n\nMedicines such as these can affect how Cinacalcet Mylan works: \n\n• medicines used to treat skin and fungal infections (ketoconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole) \n\n• medicines used to treat bacterial infections (telithromycin, rifampicin and ciprofloxacin)  \n\n• a medicine used to treat HIV infection and AIDS (ritonavir)  \n\n• a medicine used to treat depression (fluvoxamine).  \n \n\nCinacalcet Mylan may affect how medicines such as the following work:  \n\n• medicines used to treat depression (amitriptyline, desipramine, nortriptyline and clomipramine) \n\n• a medicine used to relieve cough (dextromethorphan) \n\n• medicines used to treat changes in heart rate (flecainide and propafenone)  \n\n• a medicine used to treat high blood pressure (metoprolol).  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n35 \n \n\n \n\nCinacalcet Mylan with food and drink \n\nCinacalcet Mylan should be taken with or shortly after food. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nCinacalcet has not been tested in pregnant women. In case of pregnancy, your doctor may decide to \n\nmodify your treatment, as cinacalcet might harm the unborn baby. \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether cinacalcet is excreted in human milk. Your doctor will discuss with you if you \n\nshould discontinue either breast-feeding or treatment with Cinacalcet Mylan. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nDizziness and seizures have been reported by patients taking cinacalcet. If you experience these side \n\neffects do not drive or operate machines. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Cinacalcet Mylan \n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are unsure.
