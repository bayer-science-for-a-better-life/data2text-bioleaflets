PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection in pre-filled syringe.\nClear, colourless solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\n Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and \npaediatric patients:\no Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in adult and paediatric patients \n\non haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n4\n\no Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult \npatients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (see section 4.4).\n\n Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving \nchemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of \ntransfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing \nanaemia at the start of chemotherapy).\n\n Silapo can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation \nprogramme. Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of \nthromboembolic events. Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (no \niron deficiency), if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled \nmajor elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for females or \n5 or more units for males).\n\n Silapo is indicated for non-iron deficient adults prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery \nhaving a high perceived risk for transfusion complications to reduce exposure to allogeneic \nblood transfusions. Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e.g. \nhaemoglobin concentration range between 10 to 13 g/dl) who do not have an autologous \npredonation programme available and with expected moderate blood loss (900 to 1 800 ml).\n\n Silapo can be used to increase haemoglobin concentration in symptomatic anaemia \n(haemoglobin concentration of ≤10 g/dl) in adults with low- or intermediate-1-risk primary \nmyelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who have low serum erythropoietin (<200 mU/ml).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with Silapo has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the \nmanagement of patients with above indications.\n\nPosology\n\n Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients\n\nSilapo should be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously.\n\nThe haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/dl (6.2-7.5 mmol/l), except in \npaediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/dl (5.9-\n6.8 mmol/l). The upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration should not be exceeded.\n\nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.\n\nSilapo should be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin \nto not greater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual \nhaemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. \nHaemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the \nhaemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).\n\nA sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl should be avoided; guidance for appropriate \ndose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are \ndescribed below. A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period \nshould be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made as provided.\n\nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved effective dose of Silapo is \nused to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia whilst maintaining a haemoglobin \nconcentration below or at 12g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).\n\nCaution should be exercised with escalation of Silapo doses in patients with chronic renal failure. In \npatients with a poor haemoglobin response to Silapo, alternative explanations for the poor response \nshould be considered (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\n\n\n5\n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart \nfailure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target \nhaemoglobin concentration.\n\nAdult patients on haemodialysis\n\nSilapo should be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously.\n\nThe treatment is divided into two stages:\n1. Correction phase: 50 IU/kg 3 times per week. When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should \n\nbe done in steps of at least four weeks. At each step, the increase or reduction \nin dose should be of 25 IU/kg 3 times per week.\n\n2. Maintenance phase: Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin (Hb) values at the desired \nlevel: Hb between 10 and 12 g/dl (6.2-7.5 mmol/l). The recommended total \nweekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/kg.\n\nThe clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/dl \nor < 3.75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less \nsevere (Hb > 8 g/dl or > 5 mmol/l).\n\nPaediatric patients on haemodialysis\n\nThe treatment is divided into two stages:\n1. Correction phase 50 IU/kg, 3 times per week by the intravenous route. When a dose adjustment \n\nis necessary, this should be done in steps of 25 IU/kg, 3 times per week at \nintervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved.\n\n2. Maintenance phase: Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin (Hb) values at the desired \nlevel: Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/dl (5.9-6.8 mmol/l).\n\nGenerally, children and adolescents under 30 kg body weight require higher maintenance doses than \nadults and children over 30 kg. The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after \n6 months of treatment.\n\nDose (IU/kg given 3 times per week)\n\nWeight (kg) Median Usual maintenance dose\n\n< 10 100 75-150\n\n10-30 75 60-150\n\n> 30 33 30-100\n\nThe clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low \n(< 6.8 g/dl or < 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial \nhaemoglobin is higher > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).\n\nAdult patients on peritoneal dialysis\n\nSilapo should be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously.\n\nThe treatment is divided into two stages:\n1. Correction phase: Starting dose of 50 IU/kg 2 times per week.\n2. Maintenance phase: Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin (Hb) values at the desired \n\nlevel: Hb between 10 and 12 g/dl (6.2-7.5 mmol/l). Maintenance dose between \n25 and 50 IU/kg 2 times per week into 2 equal doses.\n\n\n\n6\n\nAdult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis\n\nSilapo should be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously.\n\nThe treatment is divided into two stages:\n1. Correction phase: Starting dose of 50 IU/kg 3 times per week, followed if necessary by a dose \n\nincrease with 25 IU/kg increments (3 times per week) until the desired goal is \nachieved (this should be done in steps of at least four weeks).\n\n2. Maintenance phase: During the maintenance phase, Silapo can be administered either 3 times per \nweek, and in the case of subcutaneous administration, once weekly or once \nevery 2 weeks. Appropriate adjustment of dose and dose intervals should be \nmade in order to maintain haemoglobin (Hb) values at the desired level: Hb \nbetween 10 and 12 g/dl (6.2-7.5 mmol/l). Extending dose intervals may \nrequire an increase in dose.\n\nThe maximum dosage should not exceed 150 IU/kg 3 times per week, 240 IU/kg (up to a maximum of \n20 000 IU) once weekly or 480 IU/kg (up to a maximum of 40 000 IU) once every 2 weeks.\n\n Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia\n\nSilapo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration ≤ 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, \nand overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and \ncondition is necessary.\n\nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l) \nto 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be \navoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.\n\nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Silapo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.\n\nSilapo therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.\n\nThe initial dose is 150 IU/kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week. Alternatively, Silapo can be \nadministered at an initial dose of 450 IU/kg subcutaneously once weekly.\n\nIf the haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/dl (0.62 mmol/l) or the reticulocyte count has \nincreased ≥ 40 000 cells/µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at \n150 IU/kg 3 times per week or 450 IU/kg once weekly. If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/dl \n(< 0.62 mmol/l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40 000 cells/µl above baseline, increase the \ndose to 300 IU/kg 3 times per week. If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/kg 3 times per \nweek, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/dl (0.62 mmol/l) or the reticulocyte count has increased \n≥ 40 000 cells/µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/kg 3 times per week. However, if the haemoglobin \nhas increased < 1 g/dl (< 0.62 mmol/l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40 000 cells/µl above \nbaseline, response is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.\n\nThe recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram:\n\n\n\n7\n\nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to maintain haemoglobin at that level. Appropriate dose titration should be\nconsidered.\n\nDose adjustment\nAt a rate of rise in haemoglobin of > 2 g/dl (> 1.25 mmol/l) per month the Silapo dose should be \nreduced by about 25-50%. If haemoglobin level exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), discontinue therapy \nuntil it falls to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) or lower and then reinstitute Silapo therapy at a dose 25% below \nthe previous dose.\n\n Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme.\n\nSilapo should be given by the intravenous route.\n\nAt the time of donating blood, Silapo should be administered after the completion of the blood \ndonation procedure.\n\nMildly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33-39%) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 units of blood should be \ntreated with Silapo at a dose of 600 IU/kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.\n\nReticulocyte count increase ≥ 40 000/μl\nor Hb increase ≥ 1 g/dl\n\n150 IU/kg 3x/week\nor 450 IU/kg once weekly\n\nfor 4 weeks\n\nReticulocyte count increase < 40 000/μl\nand Hb increase < 1 g/dl\n\nTarget Hb\n(10 - 12 g/dl)\n\n300 IU/kg\n3x/week\n\nfor 4 weeks\n\nReticulocyte count increase ≥ 40 000/μl\nor Hb increase ≥ 1 g/dl\n\nReticulocyte count increase < 40 000/μl\nand Hb increase < 1 g/dl\n\nDiscontinue therapy\n\n\n\n8\n\nAll patients being treated with Silapo should receive adequate iron supplementation (e.g. 200 mg oral \nelemental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment. Iron supplementation should be started as \nsoon as possible, even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit, in order to achieve \nhigh iron stores prior to starting Silapo therapy.\n\n Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery\n\nSilapo should be administered subcutaneously.\n\nThe recommended dose is 600 IU/kg administered subcutaneously weekly for three weeks (days -21, -\n14 and -7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery.\n\nIn cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks, \n300 IU/kg should be administered subcutaneously daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery, on \nthe day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter.\n\nIf the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/dl, or higher, during the preoperative period, administration of \nSilapo should be stopped and further dosages should not be administered.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of epoetin zeta in paediatrics have not been established. No data are available.\n\n Treatment of adult patients with low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS\n\nSilapo should be administered subcutaneously.\n\nSilapo should be administered to patients with symptomatic anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin concentration \n≤10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)).\n\nThe recommended starting dose of Silapo is 450 IU/kg (maximum total dose is 40 000 IU). This is \ngiven subcutaneously once every week, with not less than 5 days between doses.\n\nAppropriate dose adjustments should be made to maintain haemoglobin concentrations within the \ntarget range of 10 g/dl to 12 g/dl (6.2 to 7.5 mmol/l). It is recommended that initial erythroid response \nbe assessed 8 to 12 weeks following initiation of treatment. Dose increases and decreases should be \ndone one dosing step at a time (see diagram below). A haemoglobin concentration of greater than \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided.\n\nDose increase\nDose should not be increased over the maximum of 1 050 IU/kg (total dose 80 000 IU) per week. If \nthe patient loses response or haemoglobin concentration drops by ≥1 g/dl upon dose reduction the dose \nshould be increased by one dosing step. A minimum of 4 weeks should elapse between dose increases.\n\nDose hold and decrease\nSilapo should be withheld when the haemoglobin concentration exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Once \nthe haemoglobin level is <11 g/dl the dose can be restarted on the same dosing step or one dosing step \ndown based on physician judgement. Decreasing the dose by one dosing step should be considered if \nthere is a rapid increase in haemoglobin (>2 g/dl over 4 weeks).\n\n337.5 IU/kg\n\n450 IU/kg\n\n787.5 IU/kg\n\n1050 IU/kg\n\nD\nos\n\ne \nR\n\ned\nu\n\nct\nio\n\nn\n S\n\nte\np\n\ns D\nose E\n\nscalation\n S\n\ntep\ns\n\n\n\n9\n\nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and co-morbid medical conditions; a \nphysician's evaluation of the individual patient's clinical course and condition is necessary.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nIntravenous injection\nThe dose should be administered over at least 1-5 minutes, depending on the total dose. In \nhaemodialysed patients, a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable \nvenous port in the dialysis line. Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis \nsession via the fistula needle tubing, followed by 10 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution \nfor injection to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the medicinal product into the \ncirculation.\n\nA slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with “flu-like” symptoms.\n\nSilapo must not be administered by intravenous infusion.\nSilapo must not be mixed with other medicinal products (see section 6.2).\n\nSubcutaneous injection\nA maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded. In case of larger \nvolumes, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.\n\nThe injections are given in the limbs or the anterior abdominal wall.\n\nFor instructions on handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any\n\nerythropoietin must not receive Silapo or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4).\n Uncontrolled hypertension.\n In the indication \"increasing the yield of autologous blood\": myocardial infarction or stroke in \n\nthe month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous \nthrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease.\n\n The use of Silapo in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not \nparticipating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with \nsevere coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with \nrecent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.\n\n Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nGeneral\n\nLike in all patients receiving erythropoietin, blood pressure may rise during treatment with Silapo. \nBlood pressure should be closely monitored and adequately controlled in all epoetin treatment naïve as \nwell as pre-treated patients before, at initiation of, and during treatment with Silapo. It may be \nnecessary to add or increase anti-hypertensive treatment. If blood pressure cannot be well controlled, \nSilapo treatment should be discontinued.\n\nSilapo should also be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.\n\nThere may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during \ntreatment with erythropoietin. This regresses during the course of continued therapy. It is \nrecommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy.\n\n\n\n10\n\nAll other causes of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12- or folate \ndeficiencies) should be considered and treated prior to initiating and during therapy with Silapo. In \nmost cases, the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume. In \norder to ensure optimum response to erythropoietin, adequate iron stores should be assured:\n iron supplementation, e.g. 200-300 mg/day orally (100-200 mg/day for paediatric patients) is \n\nrecommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ml\n oral iron substitution of 200-300 mg/day is recommended for all cancer patients whose \n\ntransferrin saturation is below 20%.\n For patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, iron supplementation (elemental \n\niron 200 mg/day orally) should be administered throughout the course of epoetin zeta therapy. If \npossible, iron supplementation should be initiated prior to starting epoetin zeta therapy to \nachieve adequate iron stores.\n\nAll of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase \nthe dose of erythropoietin in cancer patients.\n\nA paradoxical decrease in haemoglobin and development of severe anaemia associated with low \nreticulocyte counts should prompt to discontinue treatment with epoetin and perform anti-\nerythropoietin antibody testing. Cases have been reported in patients with hepatitis C treated with \ninterferon and ribavirin, when epoetins are used concomitantly. Epoetins are not approved in the \nmanagement of anaemia associated with hepatitis C.\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), the name of the \nprescribed ESA should be clearly recorded (or: stated) in the patient file.\n\nPatients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery\n\nGood blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting.\n\nPatients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic \nprophylaxis, as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with \nunderlying cardiovascular disease. In addition, special precaution should be taken in patients with \npredisposition for development of DVTs. Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of \n> 13 g/dl, the possibility that epoetin zeta treatment may be associated with an increased risk of \npostoperative thrombotic/vascular events cannot be excluded. Therefore, epoetin zeta should not be \nused in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/dl.\n\nChronic renal failure patients\n\nHaemoglobin concentration\nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical trials, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events or cerebrovascular events including stroke were \nobserved when ESAs were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).\n\nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.\n\nHaemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and \nperiodically thereafter. The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/dl \n(0.62 mmol/l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) per month to minimise the risk of \ndeveloping or worsening of hypertension.\n\nChronic renal failure patients treated with Silapo by the subcutaneous route should be monitored \nregularly for loss of efficacy, defined as absent or decreased response to Silapo treatment in patients \n\n\n\n11\n\nwho previously responded to such therapy. This is characterised by a sustained decrease in \nhaemoglobin despite an increase in Silapo dosage.\n\nSome patients with more extended dosing intervals (greater than once weekly) of epoetin may not \nmaintain adequate haemoglobin levels (see section 5.1) and may require an increase in epoetin dose. \nHaemoglobin levels should be monitored regularly.\n\nCaution should be exercised with escalation of Silapo doses in patients with chronic renal failure, \nsince high cumulative epoetin doses may be associated with an increased risk of mortality, serious \ncardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. In patients with a poor haemoglobin response to epoetins,\nalternative explanations for the poor response should be considered (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\nNon response to erythropoietin therapy should prompt a search for causative factors. These include: \niron, folate, or Vitamin B12 deficiency; aluminium intoxication; intercurrent infections; inflammatory \nor traumatic episodes; occult blood loss; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin.\n\nCases of antibody-mediated PRCA have been very rarely reported in chronic renal failure patients \nwith erythropoietin administered by the subcutaneous route. In patients developing sudden lack of \nefficacy, defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1-2 g/dl per month) with increased need for \ntransfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response (e.g. iron, \nfolate, or Vitamin B12-deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss, and \nhaemolysis) should be investigated. If no cause is identified, a bone marrow examination should be \nconsidered for diagnosis of PRCA.\n\nIf PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Silapo must be immediately discontinued and testing for \nerythropoietin antibodies should be considered. Patients should not be switched to another medicinal \nproduct as anti-erythropoietin antibodies cross-react with other erythropoietins. Other causes of PRCA \nshould be excluded, and appropriate therapy initiated.\n\nMonitoring of reticulocyte count on a regular basis is recommended to detect possible occurrence of \nlack of efficacy in chronic renal failure patients.\n\nHyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases. In chronic renal failure patients, correction for \nanaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intake. Dialysis prescriptions may \nhave to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium in the desired range. Serum \nelectrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients. If an elevated (or rising) serum \npotassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing erythropoietin administration \nuntil hyperkalaemia has been corrected.\n\nAn increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy \nwith erythropoietin as a result of the increased packed cell volume. Occlusion of the dialysis system is \npossible if heparinisation is not optimum.\n\nBased on information available to date, correction of anaemia with erythropoietin in adult patients \nwith renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal \ninsufficiency.\n\nAdult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy\n\nIn cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2-3 week delay between erythropoietin administration \nand the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if \nSilapo therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).\n\nHaemoglobin levels should be closely monitored until a stable level is achieved and periodically \nthereafter. If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) per month or the \nhaemoglobin level exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose adjustment detailed in section 4.2 should be \nthoroughly performed to minimise the risk of thrombotic events (see section 4.2).\n\n\n\n12\n\nAs an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) has been observed in cancer patients \nreceiving erythropoietic agents (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the \nbenefit to be derived from treatment (with Silapo) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk \nof thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e.g. deep \nvenous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).\n\nAdult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme\n\nAll special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes, especially \nroutine volume replacement, should be respected.\n\nTumour growth potential\n\nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of any type of malignancy. In several \ncontrolled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of \ntumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer.\n\nSeveral controlled clinical studies in which epoetins were administered to patients with a variety of \ncommon tumours including squamous head and neck cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer, have \nshown an unexplained excess mortality.\n\nIn controlled clinical studies, use of epoetin alfa and other ESAs have shown:\n shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl\n(8.7 mmol/l),\n\n shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5 -8.7 mmol/l),\n\n increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy. \nESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population.\n\nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer. The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context. Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1).\n\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions\n\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported in association \nwith epoetin treatment. More severe cases have been observed with long-acting epoetins.\n\nAt the time of prescription patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored \nclosely for skin reactions. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, Silapo should \nbe withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment considered.\nIf the patient has developed a severe cutaneous skin reaction such as SJS or TEN due to the use of \nSilapo, treatment with Silapo must not be restarted in this patient at any time.\n\n\n\n13\n\nThis medicinal product contains up to 0.5 mg phenylalanine in each dosage unit. Phenylalanine may \nbe harmful for patients with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine \nbuilds up because the body cannot remove it properly.\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say\nessentially ‘sodium-free’.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nThere is no evidence to indicate that treatment with erythropoietin alters the metabolism of other \nmedicinal products.\n\nHowever, since ciclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for interactions with other \nmedicinal products. If erythropoietin is given concomitantly with ciclosporin, blood levels of \nciclosporin should be monitored and the dose of ciclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises.\n\nNo evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with \nregard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproduction toxicity (see section 5.3). It is not known whether exogenous epoetin zeta is excreted in \nhuman milk. Consequently, erythropoietin should generally be used during pregnancy and lactation \nonly if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nSilapo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nData from clinical studies with Silapo are in line with the safety profile of other authorised \nerythropoietins. Based on the results from clinical trials with other authorised erythropoietins \napproximately 8% of patients treated with erythropoietin are expected to experience adverse reactions. \nAdverse reactions during treatment with erythropoietin are observed predominantly in patients with \nchronic renal failure or underlying malignancies. These adverse reactions are most commonly \nheadache and a dose dependent increase in blood pressure. Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-\nlike symptoms can occur. Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a \npossible warning signal.\n\nRespiratory tract congestion, which includes events of upper respiratory tract congestion, nasal \ncongestion and nasopharyngitis, have been reported in studies with extended interval dosing in adult \npatients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis.\n\nThrombotic/vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular \naccidents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein \nthrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an \nartificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.\nAntibody-mediated erythroblastopenia (PRCA) has been reported after months to years of treatment \nwith epoetin alfa. In most of these patients, antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nOf a total 3 417 subjects in 25 randomised, double-blinded, placebo or standard of care controlled \nstudies, the overall safety profile of epoetin alfa was evaluated in 2 094 anaemic subjects. Included \n\n\n\n14\n\nwere 228 epoetin alfa-treated CRF subjects in 4 chronic renal failure studies (2 studies in predialysis \n[N = 131 exposed CRF subjects] and 2 in dialysis [N = 97 exposed CRF subjects]); 1 404 exposed \ncancer subjects in 16 studies of anaemia due to chemotherapy; 147 exposed subjects in 2 studies for \nautologous blood donation; 213 exposed subjects in 1 study in the perisurgical period, and \n102 exposed subjects in 2 MDS studies. Adverse drug reactions reported by ≥1% of subjects treated \nwith epoetin alfa in these trials are shown in the table below.\n\nFrequency estimate: Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to \n<1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare (<1/10 000), not known (frequency cannot be \nestimated from the available data).\n\nMedDRA System Organ \nClassification (SOC)\n\nAdverse Reaction (Preferred Term \nLevel)\n\nFrequency\n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders\n\nPure red cell aplasia3, \nThrombocythemia\n\nRare\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Hyperkalaemia1 Uncommon\n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity3 Uncommon\n\nAnaphylactic reaction3 Rare\n\nNervous system disorders Headache Common\n\nConvulsion Uncommon\n\nVascular disorders Hypertension, Venous and arterial \nthromboses2\n\nCommon\n\nHypertensive crisis3 Not known\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\n\nCough Common\n\nRespiratory tract congestion Uncommon\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea, Nausea, Vomiting Very common\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nRash Common\n\nUrticaria3 Uncommon\n\nAngioneurotic oedema3 Not known\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders\n\nArthralgia, Bone pain, Myalgia, Pain \nin extremity\n\nCommon\n\nCongenital, familial and genetic \ndisorders\n\nPorphyria acute3 Rare\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nPyrexia Very common\n\nChills, Influenza like illness, Injection \nsite reaction, Oedema peripheral\n\nCommon\n\nDrug ineffective3 Not known\n\nInvestigations Anti-erythropoeitin antibody positive Rare\n1\n\nCommon in dialysis\n2\n\nIncludes arterial and venous, fatal and non fatal events, such as deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, \nretinal thrombosis, arterial thrombosis (including myocardial infarction), cerebrovascular accidents \n(including cerebral infarction and cerebral haemorrhage) transient ischaemic attacks, and shunt thrombosis \n(including dialysis equipment) and thrombosis within arteriovenous shunt aneurisms\n\n3\nAddressed in the subsection below and/or in section 4.4\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nAdult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with \nrenal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis\n\nThe most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in \nblood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension. These increases in blood pressure can be \n\n\n\n15\n\ntreated with medicinal products. Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended \nparticularly at the start of therapy. The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with \nnormal or low blood pressure: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms (e.g. headaches \nand confused state) and generalised tonoclonal seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a \nphysician and intensive medical care. Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine \nlike headaches as a possible warning signal.\nShunt thromboses may occur, especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose \narteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications (e.g. stenoses, aneurysms, etc.). Early shunt revision and \nthrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid, for example, is recommended in \nthese patients.\n\nAdult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy\n\nHypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients. Consequently, haemoglobin and blood \npressure should be closely monitored.\nAn increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) has \nbeen observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.\n\nSurgery patients\n\nIndependent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients \nwith underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy. Therefore, routine volume \nreplacement should be performed in such patients.\n\nIn patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/dl, the possibility that Silapo treatment may be \nassociated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/vascular events cannot be excluded.\n\nAdult patients with low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS\n\nIn the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study 4 (4.7%) subjects experienced \nTVEs (sudden death, ischaemic stroke, embolism, and phlebitis). All TVEs occurred in the epoetin \nalfa group and in the first 24 weeks of the study. Three were confirmed TVE and in the remaining case \n(sudden death), the thromboembolic event was not confirmed. Two subjects had significant risk \nfactors (atrial fibrillation, heart failure and thrombophlebitis).\n\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions\n\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported in association \nwith epoetin treatment (see section 4.4).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThe therapeutic margin of erythropoietin is very wide. Overdose of erythropoietin may produce effects \nthat are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone. Phlebotomy may be performed if \nexcessively high haemoglobin levels occur. Additional supportive care should be provided as \nnecessary.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n16\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antianaemic preparations, erythropoietin\nATC code: B03XA01\n\nSilapo is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nErythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates, as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating \nhormone, the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment.\n\nThe apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32 000-40 000 Dalton. The protein moiety of the \nmolecule contributes about 58% of total molecular weight and consists of 165 amino acids. The four \ncarbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the \nprotein. Epoetin zeta is identical in its amino acid sequence and similar in carbohydrate composition to \nendogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.\n\nThe biological efficacy of erythropoietin has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo\n(normal and anaemic rats, polycythaemic mice). After administration of erythropoietin, the number of \nerythrocytes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate.\n\nAn increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found \nin vitro (mouse spleen cell culture) after incubation with erythropoietin. It could be shown with the aid \nof cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that erythropoietin stimulates erythropoiesis specifically \nand does not affect leukopoiesis. Cytotoxic actions of erythropoietin on bone marrow cells could not \nbe detected.\n\nAs with other haematopoietic growth factors, erythropoietin has shown in vitro stimulating properties \non human endothelial cells.\n\nAdult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis\n\nIn 2 studies with extended interval dosing of erythropoietin (3 times per week, once weekly, once \nevery 2 weeks and once every 4 weeks) some patients with longer dosing intervals did not maintain \nadequate haemoglobin levels and reached protocol-defined haemoglobin withdrawal criteria (0% in \nonce weekly, 3.7% in once-every-2-weeks and 3.3% in the once-every-4-weeks groups).\n\nTreatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery\nIn patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery with a pretreatment haemoglobin of > 10 \nto ≤ 13 g/dl, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease the risk of receiving allogeneic transfusions and \nhasten erythroid recovery (increased haemoglobin levels, haematocrit levels, and reticulocyte counts).\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled \nstudies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's \nlymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, \n64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastrointestinal, and 30 other tumour types). In two large, \nopen-label studies, 2 697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included, \n1 895 with solid tumours (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastrointestinal, and \n478 other tumour types) and 802 with haematological malignancies.\n\nIn a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients \nwith various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant \nreduction of anaemia-related sequelae (e.g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), as \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n17\n\nmeasured by the following instruments and scales: Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-\nAnaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale \n(CLAS). Two other smaller, randomised, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant \nimprovement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS, respectively.\nErythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production. Erythropoietin receptors \nmay be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.\n\nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2 833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study. The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy (two \nstudies) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated: \nanaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patients \nreceiving radiotherapy. The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the \nremaining three studies it was 12-14 g/dl. In the open-label study there was no difference in overall \nsurvival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls. In the four \nplacebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in \nfavour of controls. These studies have shown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess \nmortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received \nrecombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls. Overall survival outcome in the trials could \nnot be satisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications \nbetween those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.\n\nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9 000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials. Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8 167 patients). An increased relative risk \nof thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and 6 769 patients) was observed in \npatients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is an increased risk for \nthromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a \nnegative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded. The extent to which these outcomes might \napply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.\n\nA patient-level data analysis has also been performed on more than 13 900 cancer patients (chemo-, \nradio-, chemoradio-, or no therapy) participating in 53 controlled clinical trials involving several \nepoetins. Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.06 in \nfavour of controls (95% CI: 1.00, 1.12; 53 trials and 13 933 patients) and for the cancer patients \nreceiving chemotherapy, the overall survival hazard ratio was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.11; 38 trials and \n10 441 patients). Meta-analyses also indicate consistently a significantly increased relative risk of \nthromboembolic events in cancer patients receiving recombinant human erythropoietin (see section \n4.4).\n\nIn a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 4 038 CRF patients not on dialysis with \ntype 2 diabetes and haemoglobin levels ≤ 11 g/dl, patients received either treatment with darbepoetin \nalfa to target haemoglobin levels of 13 g/dl or placebo (see section 4.4). The study did not meet either \nprimary objective of demonstrating a reduction in risk for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular \nmorbidity, or end stage renal disease (ESRD). Analysis of the individual components of the composite\nendpoints showed the following HR (95% CI): death 1.05 (0.92, 1.21), stroke 1.92 (1.38, 2.68), \ncongestive heart failure (CHF) 0.89 (0.74, 1.08), myocardial infarction (MI) 0.96 (0.75, 1.23), \nhospitalisation for myocardial ischaemia 0.84 (0.55, 1.27), ESRD 1.02 (0.87, 1.18).\n\nPooled post-hoc analyses of clinical studies of ESAs have been performed in CRF patients (on \ndialysis, not on dialysis, in diabetic and non-diabetic patients). A tendency towards increased risk \nestimates for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events associated with higher \ncumulative ESA doses independent of the diabetes or dialysis status was observed (see sections 4.2\nand 4.4).\n\n\n\n18\n\nMajor elective orthopaedic surgery\nThe effect of epoetin alfa (300 IU/kg or 100 IU/kg) on the exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion \nhas been evaluated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial in non-iron deficient adult \npatients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic hip or knee surgery. Epoetin alfa was administered \nsubcutaneously for 10 days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery, and for four days after surgery. \nPatients were stratified according to their baseline haemoglobin (≤ 10 g/dl, > 10 to ≤ 13 g/dl and \n> 13 g/dl).\n\nEpoetin alfa 300 IU/kg significantly reduced the risk of allogeneic transfusion in patients with a \npretreatment haemoglobin of > 10 to ≤ 13 g/dl. Sixteen percent of epoetin alfa 300 IU/kg, 23% of \nepoetin alfa 100 IU/kg and 45% of placebo-treated patients required transfusion.\n\nAn open-label, parallel-group trial in non-iron deficient adult subjects with a pretreatment \nhaemoglobin of ≥ 10 to ≤ 13 g/dl who were scheduled for major orthopaedic hip or knee surgery \ncompared epoetin alfa 300 IU/kg subcutaneously daily for 10 days prior to surgery, on the day of \nsurgery and for four days after surgery to epoetin alfa 600 IU/kg subcutaneously once weekly for \n3 weeks prior to surgery and on the day of surgery.\n\nFrom pretreatment to presurgery, the mean increase in haemoglobin in the 600 IU/kg weekly group \n(1.44 g/dl) was twice than that observed in the 300 IU/kg daily group (0.73 g/dl). Mean haemoglobin \nlevels were similar for the two treatment groups throughout the postsurgical period.\n\nThe erythropoietic response observed in both treatment groups resulted in similar transfusion rates \n(16% in the 600 IU/kg weekly group and 20% in the 300 IU/kg daily group).\n\nTreatment of adult patients with low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS\n\nA randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study evaluated the efficacy and safety of \nepoetin alfa in adult anaemic subjects with low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS.\n\nSubjects were stratified by serum erythropoetin (sEPO) level and prior transfusion status at screening. \nKey baseline characteristics for the <200 mU/ml stratum are shown in the table below.\n\nBaseline Characteristics for Subjects with sEPO<200 mU/ml at Screening\nRandomised\n\nEpoetin alfa Placebo\nTotal (N)b 85a 45\nScreening sEPO <200 mU/ml (N) 71 39\nHaemoglobin (g/l)\nN 71 39\nMean 92.1 (8.57) 92.1 (8.51)\nMedian 94.0 96.0\nRange (71, 109) (69, 105)\n95% CI for Mean (90.1, 94.1) (89.3, 94.9)\nPrior Transfusions\nN 71 39\nYes 31 (43.7%) 17 (43.6%)\n≤2 RBC Units 16 (51.6%) 9 (52.9%)\n˃2 and ≤4 RBC Units 14 (45.2%) 8 (47.1%)\n˃4 RBC Units 1 (3.2%) 0\nNo 40 (56.3%) 22 (56.4%)\na one subject did not have sEPO data\nb in the ≥200 mU/ml stratum there were 13 subjects in the epoetin alfa group and 6 subjects in the placebo \n\ngroup\n\nErythroid response was defined according to International Working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria as a \nhaemoglobin increase ≥1.5 g/dl from baseline or a reduction of RBC units transfused by an absolute \n\n\n\n19\n\nnumber of at least 4 units every 8 weeks compared to the 8 weeks prior to baseline, and a response \nduration of at least 8 weeks.\n\nErythroid response during the first 24 weeks of the study was demonstrated by 27/85 (31.8%) of the \nsubjects in the epoetin alfa group compared to 2/45 (4.4%) of the subjects in the placebo group \n(p<0.001). All of the responding subjects were in the stratum with sEPO <200 mU/ml during \nscreening. In that stratum, 20/40 (50%) subjects without prior transfusions demonstrated erythroid \nresponse during the first 24 weeks, compared with 7/31 (22.6%) subjects with prior transfusions (two \nsubjects with prior transfusion reached primary endpoint based on reduction of RBC units transfused \nby an absolute number of at least 4 units every 8 weeks compared to the 8 weeks prior to baseline).\n\nMedian time from baseline to first transfusion was statistically significantly longer in the epoetin alfa \ngroup compared to placebo (49 vs. 37 days; p=0.046). After 4 weeks of treatment the time to first \ntransfusion was further increased in the epoetin alfa group (142 vs. 50 days, p=0.007). The percentage \nof subjects who were transfused in the epoetin alfa group decreased from 51.8% in the 8 weeks prior \nto baseline to 24.7% between weeks 16 and 24, compared to the placebo group which had an increase \nin transfusion rate from 48.9% to 54.1% over the same time periods.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nIntravenous route\nMeasurement of erythropoietin following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life \nof approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life of \napproximately 5 hours in renal failure patients. A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported \nin children.\n\nSubcutaneous route\nFollowing subcutaneous injection, serum levels of erythropoietin are much lower than the levels \nachieved following intravenous injection, the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and \n18 hours postdose. The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route \n(approximately 1/20th of the value).\n\nThere is no accumulation: the levels remain the same, whether they are determined 24 hours after the\nfirst injection or 24 hours after the last injection.\n\nThe half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated to be about 24 hours. \nThe bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable erythropoietin is much lower than that of the \nintravenous medicinal product and is approximately 20%.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIn some pre-clinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats, but not in monkeys, erythropoietin therapy \nwas associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication \nof chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown \nfactors. The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients \nwho were treated with erythropoietin for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis \npatients who had not been treated with erythropoietin).\n\nIn animal studies, erythropoietin has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification \nand increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended \nhuman weekly dose. These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body \nweight gain.\n\nErythropoietin did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests \nand an in vivo micronucleus test in mice. Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out. \nThere are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietin may play a major role \n\n\n\n20\n\nas tumour proliferator. These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples, but \nare of uncertain significance in the clinical situation.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What Silapo is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use Silapo\n3. How to use Silapo\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Silapo\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Silapo is and what it is used for\n\nSilapo contains a protein called epoetin zeta, that stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red \nblood cells which carry haemoglobin (a substance that transports oxygen). Epoetin zeta is a copy of \nthe human protein erythropoietin and acts in the same way.\n\nSilapo is used\n in adults, children and adolescents on haemodialysis to treat symptomatic anaemia (low red \n\nblood cell counts) associated with chronic renal failure (kidney disease).\n in adult patients on peritoneal dialysis to treat symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic \n\nrenal failure (kidney disease).\n in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet on dialysis to treat severe anaemia associated \n\nwith kidney disease accompanied by clinical symptoms.\n in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma (cancer of the \n\nlymphatic system) or multiple myeloma (bone marrow cancer) to treat anaemia and reduce the \nneed for a blood transfusion, if the doctor decides there may be a high risk for needing for a \nblood transfusion.\n\n in moderately anaemic patients who are going to have surgery and prior to it, donate blood so \nthat their own blood can be given to them during or after surgery (autologous pre-donation).\n\n in moderately anaemic adults about to have major orthopaedic surgery (for example hip or knee \nreplacement operations), to reduce the potential need for blood transfusions.\n\n\n\n63\n\n in anaemic adult patients with myelodysplastic syndrome to reduce the need for a blood \ntransfusion.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Silapo\n\nDo not use Silapo\n\n if you are allergic to erythropoietins or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6)\n\n if you have developed Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA; reduced or stopped production of red \nblood cells) following treatment with any erythropoietin\n\n if you have high blood pressure, which is not properly controlled with blood pressure-lowering \nmedicines\n\n if you cannot be given medicines to thin blood for the prevention of blood clots\n if you are donating your own blood before surgery, and:\n\n you had a heart attack or stroke in the month before your treatment\n you have unstable angina pectoris (new or increasing chest pain)\n you are at risk of blood clots in the veins (deep venous thrombosis) – for example, if you \n\nhave had clots before.\n if you are due to have major elective orthopaedic surgery (such as hip or knee surgery), and you:\n\n have severe heart disease\n have severe disorders of the veins and arteries\n have recently had a heart attack or stroke\n can’t take medicines to thin the blood\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor before using Silapo if you know you are suffering, or have suffered, from any of \nthe following:\n epileptic seizures\n liver disease\n cancer\n anaemia from other causes\n heart disease (such as angina)\n disorders of blood circulation resulting in pins and needles or cold hands or feet or muscle \n\ncramps in the legs\n blood clots/blood clotting disorders\n kidney disease.\n\nSpecial warnings\n\nDuring treatment with Silapo\nYour doctor will check that your haemoglobin does not exceed a certain level, as high haemoglobin \nconcentrations could put you at risk of having a problem of the heart or the blood vessels and could \nincrease risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and death.\n\nYour doctor should try to keep your haemoglobin levels between 10 and 12 g/dl.\nThe haemoglobin values should not exceed a value of 12 g/dl.\n\nYour doctor will monitor your blood pressure regularly while you are using Silapo. If you experience \nheadaches, particularly sudden, stabbing migraine-like headaches or start to feel confused or have fits, \ntell your doctor or nursing staff immediately. These may be the warning signs of a sudden rise in \nblood pressure, which requires urgent treatment.\n\n\n\n64\n\nThere may be a rise in the level of platelets (cells that help blood clotting) during treatment with this \nmedicine. This should improve during the course of the treatment. It is recommended that the platelet \ncount is regularly checked during the first 8 weeks of therapy.\n\nRemember to tell your doctor that you are receiving Silapo if you have to visit the hospital or family \ndoctor for any treatment including a blood test, as Silapo may affect the results.\n\nSerious skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis \n(TEN) have been reported in association with epoetin treatment. SJS/TEN can appear initially as \nreddish target-like spots or circular patches often with central blisters on the trunk. Also, ulcers of \nmouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes (red and swollen eyes) can occur. These serious skin rashes are \noften preceded by fever and/or flu-like symptoms. The rashes may progress to widespread peeling of \nthe skin and life-threatening complications. If you develop a serious rash or another of these skin \nsymptoms, stop taking Silapo and contact your doctor or seek medical attention immediately.\n\nTake special care with other products that stimulate red blood cell production:\nSilapo is one of a group of products that stimulate the production of red blood cells like the human \nprotein erythropoietin does. Your healthcare professional will always record the exact product you are \nusing.\n\nKidney disease patients\nPure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) has been reported very rarely after months to years of subcutaneous \ntreatment with other products containing erythropoietins and may not be ruled out with Silapo. PRCA \nmeans the inability to produce enough red blood cells in the bone marrow. If this occurs it can result in \nsevere anaemia, the symptoms of which are unusual tiredness, feeling dizzy or breathlessness. PRCA \nmay be caused by the production of antibodies against the erythropoietin product and, in the \nfollowing, to your own erythropoietin.\n\nYou should discuss this information with your doctor. If PRCA, a very rare condition, occurs, the \nSilapo therapy will be stopped and your doctor will determine the best course of action to treat the \nanaemia. Although this complication is very rare, you should be aware that if you develop it, you \nwould need to have regular blood transfusions, possibly lifelong, to treat your anaemia and the Silapo \ntherapy would have to be discontinued. Tell your doctor immediately if you suddenly feel very tired or \ndizzy or suffer from shortness of breath. Your doctor can decide whether Silapo is not working \nproperly for you and will end the treatment, if necessary.\n\nChronic renal failure patients on erythropoietin should have their haemoglobin levels measured on a \nregular basis until a stable level is achieved, and periodically thereafter to minimise the risk of an \nincrease in blood pressure.\n\nIf you are a patient with chronic renal failure, and particularly if you do not respond properly to \nSilapo, your doctor will check your dose of Silapo because repeatedly increasing your dose of Silapo \nif you are not responding to treatment may increase the risk of having a problem of the heart or the \nblood vessels and could increase risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and death.\n\nIncreases in blood potassium have happened in isolated cases. In chronic renal failure patients, \ncorrection for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intake. If you are \nreceiving dialysis treatment when you begin treatment with Silapo, your dialysis regimen may need to \nbe adjusted to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium levels in the desired range. Your doctor will \ndecide this.\n\nSerum electrolytes (substances in your blood) should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients. If \nan elevated (or rising) serum potassium level is detected, your doctor may consider to stop the \ntreatment with Silapo until the level is back to normal.\n\n\n\n65\n\nAn increase in the dose of a particular blood-thinning medicine (heparin) during haemodialysis is \noften needed during the course of therapy with Silapo to minimise the risk of blood clotting. Blockage \nof the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum.\n\nCancer patients\nCancer patients are more likely to suffer from blood clots if receiving erythropoietin medicines, like \nSilapo (see section 4). Therefore, you should discuss the benefits of Silapo with your doctor, \nparticularly if you are obese or have a history of blood clots/blood clotting disorders.\n\nCancer patients on erythropoietin should have haemoglobin (the part of a red blood cell that carries \noxygen) levels measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved, and periodically thereafter.\n\nIf you are a cancer patient, you should be aware that Silapo may act as a blood cell growth factor and \nin some circumstances may have a negative impact on your cancer. Depending on your individual \nsituation a blood transfusion may be preferable. Please discuss this with your doctor.\n\nOther medicines and Silapo\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nIn particular, if you are taking a medicine containing the active substance ciclosporin to suppress your \nimmune system after a kidney transplant, your doctor may order special blood tests to measure \nciclosporin levels while you are taking Silapo.\n\nIron supplements and other blood stimulants may increase the effectiveness of Silapo. Your doctor \nwill decide if it is right for you to take them.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, Silapo should be used only if the potential benefit outweighs the \npotential risk to the foetus.\n\nAsk your doctor for advice before taking any medicine.\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nSilapo has no or negligible effect on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\nSilapo contains phenylalanine\n\nThis medicine contains up to 0.5 mg phenylalanine in each dosage unit. Phenylalanine may be harmful \nif you have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up because \nthe body cannot remove it properly.\n\nSilapo contains sodium\n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dosage unit, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’.\n\n\n\n66\n\n3. How to use Silapo\n\nSilapo therapy is usually started under medical supervision. The injections can then be given by a \ndoctor, trained nurse or other health care professional.\n\nIn case Silapo is injected under the skin (subcutaneously) you can also inject the solution yourself \nonce you have been shown how. Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check \nwith your doctor if you are not sure.\n\nDose information\n\nThe dose you receive is based on your body weight in kilograms.\n\nYour doctor will conduct investigations, for example blood tests, to help decide if it is necessary for \nyou to have Silapo. He/she will work out the correct dose of Silapo for you to use, how long the \ntreatment should continue and by what route the medicine will be given. These decisions will be \ninfluenced by what is causing your anaemia. Your doctor will use the lowest effective dose to control \nthe symptoms of your anaemia. If you do not respond adequately to Silapo, your doctor will check \nyour dose and will inform you if you need to change doses of Silapo.\n\nYou may be given iron supplements before and during Silapo treatment to make it more effective.\n\nUse in kidney disease patients\nSilapo should be administered either under the skin (subcutaneously) or as an injection either into a \nvein or a tube that goes into a vein.\n\nUse in adult patients receiving haemodialysis\nYour doctor will maintain your haemoglobin concentration between 10 and 12 g/dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/l).\n\nSilapo may be given during the dialysis session or after you have received a dialysis session.\n\nThe recommended starting dose of Silapo is 50 IU/kg (International Units per kilogram). This is given \n3 times a week. If the solution is given into a vein, it should be injected over 1-5 minutes.\n\nDepending on how your anaemia responds to treatment, the dose may be adjusted approximately every \n4 weeks until your condition is controlled.\n\nYour doctor will order regular blood tests to ensure that your medicine is continuing to work properly. \nWhen your condition has been brought under control, you will receive regular doses of Silapo, 2 or \n3 times a week. These doses may not be as high as those received initially.\n\nUse in children and adolescents up to 18 years receiving haemodialysis\nIn children the doctor will maintain the haemoglobin concentration between 9.5 and 11 g/dl\n\nSilapo should be given after the patient has received a dialysis session.\n\nThe dose for children and adolescents is based on body weight in kilograms. The recommended \nstarting dose is 50 IU/kg. This is given three times a week, injected into a vein (over 1-5 minutes).\n\nDepending on how the anaemia responds, the dose may be adjusted approximately every 4 weeks until \nthe condition is controlled. Your doctor will order regular blood tests to see that this is being achieved.\n\nUse in adult patients receiving peritoneal dialysis\nYour doctor will maintain your haemoglobin concentration between 10 and 12 g/dl.\n\nThe recommended starting dose is 50 IU/kg. This is given twice a week.\n\n\n\n67\n\nDepending on how your anaemia responds, the dose may be adjusted approximately every 4 weeks \nuntil your condition is controlled.\n\nYour doctor will order regular blood tests to ensure that your medicine is continuing to work properly.\n\nUse in adult patients with kidney disease but not receiving dialysis\nThe recommended starting dose is 50 IU/kg. This is given 3 times a week.\n\nThe starting dose may be adjusted by your doctor until your condition is controlled. After your \ncondition has been brought under control, you will receive regular doses of Silapo (3 times a week, or, \nif you have your injections under the skin, it may also be given once weekly or once every 2 weeks). \nThe maximum dosage should not exceed 150 IU/kg, 3 times per week, 240 IU/kg (up to a maximum \nof 20 000 IU) once weekly or 480 IU/kg (up to a maximum of 40 000 IU) once every 2 weeks.\n\nYour doctor will order regular blood tests to ensure that your medicine is continuing to work properly.\n\nIf you are on a more extended dosing interval (greater than once weekly) of Silapo, you may not \nmaintain adequate haemoglobin levels and you may require an increase in Silapo dose or frequency of \nadministration.\n\nUse in adult patients receiving chemotherapy\nYour doctor may initiate treatment with Silapo if your haemoglobin level is 10 g/dl or less.\nAfter initiation of therapy, your doctor will maintain your haemoglobin level between 10 and 12 g/dl.\n\nThe recommended starting dose is 150 IU/kg. This is given 3 times a week by injection under the skin. \nAlternatively, your doctor may recommend a starting dose of 450 IU/kg once a week. The starting \ndose may be adjusted by your doctor depending on how your anaemia responds to treatment; you will \nusually receive Silapo until 1 month after the end of chemotherapy.\n\nUse in adult patients in an autologous predonation programme\nThe recommended starting dose is 600 IU/kg. This is given 2 times a week by injection into a vein. \nYou will receive Silapo during the 3 weeks before your surgery. You will also take iron supplements \nbefore and during Silapo treatment to increase the effectiveness of Silapo.\n\nUse in adults scheduled for major orthopaedic surgery\n The recommended dose is 600 IU per kilogram bodyweight once a week.\n Silapo is given by injection under the skin each week for three weeks before surgery and on the day \n\nof surgery.\n If there is a medical need to reduce the time before your operation, you will be given a daily dose \n\nof 300 IU/kg for up to ten days before surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately \nafterwards.\n\n If blood tests show your haemoglobin is too high before the operation, the treatment will be \nstopped.\n\n You may be given iron supplements before and during Silapo treatment to make it more effective.\n\nUse in adult patients with myelodysplastic syndrome\n\nYour doctor may initiate treatment with Silapo if your haemoglobin is 10 g/dl or less. The aim of \ntreatment is to maintain your haemoglobin level between 10 and 12 g/dl as a higher haemoglobin level \nmay increase the risk of blood clots and death.\n\nSilapo is given by injection under the skin.\n\nThe starting dose is 450 IU per kilogram bodyweight once a week.\n\nYour doctor will order blood tests, and may adjust the dose, depending on how your anaemia responds \nto Silapo treatment.\n\n\n\n68\n\nInformation on administration\n\nThe pre-filled syringe is ready for use. Each syringe should be used for a single injection only. Silapo \nmust not be shaken or mixed with any other liquid.\n\nIf Silapo is injected under the skin the amount injected in any one place should not exceed 1 ml. Good \ninjection sites are the top of the thigh and around the tummy (abdomen) but away from the navel. Vary \nthe site from day to day.\n\nAlways follow these instructions when using Silapo:\n\n1. Take one sealed syringe blister and leave it to stand for a few minutes until it reaches room \ntemperature prior to using it. This usually takes between 15 and 30 minutes.\n\n2. Remove the syringe from the blister and check that the solution is clear, colourless and \npractically free from visible particles.\n\n3. Remove the protective cap from the injection needle and expel air from the syringe and \ninjection needle by holding the syringe vertically and gently pressing the plunger upwards.\n\n4. Inject the solution as you have been shown by your doctor. You should check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.\n\nDo not use Silapo if:\n\n the blister sealing is broken or the blister is damaged in any way\n the liquid is coloured or you can see particles floating in it\n any liquid has leaked out of the pre-filled syringe or condensation is visible within the sealed \n\nblister\n you know or think it may have been accidentally frozen\n\nChanging from injecting into a vein to injecting under the skin (from intravenous into subcutaneous \ninjection)\nOnce your condition is controlled you will receive regular doses of Silapo. Your doctor may decide \nthat it is better for you to receive Silapo by injection under the skin (subcutaneous) rather than into a \nvein (intravenous).\n\nThe dose should remain the same while the change is being made. Afterwards, your doctor may order \nblood tests to see if any adjustment in dose is required.\n\nInjecting Silapo under the skin yourself\nWhen treatment starts, Silapo is usually injected by medical or nursing staff. Later, your doctor may \nsuggest that you or your caregiver learn how to inject it under the skin (subcutaneously) yourself. \n\n Do not attempt to inject yourself unless you have been trained to do so by your doctor or nurse.\n Always use Silapo exactly as instructed by your doctor or nurse.\n Only use this medicine if it has been stored correctly (see section 5).\n Before use, leave the syringe to stand until it reaches room temperature. This usually takes \n\nbetween 15 and 30 minutes.\n\nOnly use one dose of Silapo from each syringe.\n\nIf this medicine is injected under the skin (subcutaneously), the amount injected is not normally more \nthan 1 ml in a single injection.\n\nSilapo is given alone and not mixed with other liquids for injection.\n\nDo not shake the syringes. Prolonged vigorous shaking may damage the product. If the product has \nbeen shaken vigorously, don’t use it.\n\n\n\n69\n\nHow to inject yourself using a pre-filled syringe:\n Take a syringe out of the refrigerator. The liquid needs to come to room temperature. Do not \n\nremove the syringe’s needle cover while allowing it to reach room temperature.\n Check the syringe, to make sure it is the right dose, has not passed its expiry date, is not \n\ndamaged, and the liquid is clear and not frozen.\n Choose an injection site. Good sites are the top of the thigh and around the tummy (abdomen) \n\nbut away from the navel. Vary the site from day to day.\n Wash your hands. Use an antiseptic swab on the injection site, to disinfect it.\n Hold the pre-filled syringe by the body of the syringe with the covered needle pointing upward.\n Do not hold by the plunger head, plunger or needle cover.\n Do not pull back on the plunger at any time.\n Do not remove the needle cover from the pre-filled syringe until you are ready to inject Silapo.\n Take the needle cover off the syringe by holding the barrel and pulling the needle cover off \n\ncarefully without twisting it. Don’t push the plunger, touch the needle or shake the syringe.\n Pinch a fold of skin between your thumb and index finger. Don’t squeeze it.\n Push the needle in fully. Your doctor or nurse may have shown you how to do this.\n Push the plunger with your thumb as far as it will go to inject the entire amount of liquid. Push \n\nit slowly and evenly, keeping the skin fold pinched.\n When the plunger is pushed as far as it will go, take out the needle and let go of the skin.\n When the needle is pulled out of your skin, there may be a little bleeding at the injection site. \n\nThis is normal. You can press an antiseptic swab over the injection site for a few seconds after \nthe injection.\n\n Dispose of your used syringe in a sharps container. Do not try to replace the needle cover.\n Never put used syringes into your normal household waste bin.\n\nHow to inject yourself using a pre-filled syringe:\nYour pre-filled syringe has a passive needle guard device attached to it in order to protect you from \nneedle stick injury.\n Take a syringe out of the refrigerator. The liquid needs to come to room temperature. Do not \n\nremove the syringe’s needle cover while allowing it to reach room temperature.\n Check the syringe, to make sure it is the right dose, has not passed its expiry date, is not \n\ndamaged, and the liquid is clear and not frozen.\n Choose an injection site. Good sites are the top of the thigh and around the tummy (abdomen) \n\nbut away from the navel. Vary the site from day to day.\n Wash your hands. Use an antiseptic swab on the injection site, to disinfect it.\n Hold the pre-filled syringe by the body of the syringe with the covered needle pointing upward.\n Do not hold by the plunger head, plunger or needle cover.\n Do not pull back on the plunger at any time.\n Do not remove the needle cover from the pre-filled syringe until you are ready to inject Silapo.\n Take the needle cover off the syringe by holding the barrel and pulling the needle cover off \n\ncarefully without twisting it. Don’t push the plunger, touch the needle or shake the syringe.\n Pinch a fold of skin between your thumb and index finger. Don’t squeeze it.\n Push the needle in fully. Your doctor or nurse may have shown you how to do this.\n Depress the plunger while grasping the finger flange until the entire dose has been given. The \n\nneedle guard will NOT activate unless the ENTIRE dose has been given.\n\n\n\n70\n\n When the plunger is pushed as far as it will go, take out the needle and let go of the skin.\n Let go of the plunger and allow the syringe to move up until the entire needle is guarded and \n\nlocks into place.\n\n When the needle is pulled out of your skin, there may be a little bleeding at the injection site. \nThis is normal. You can press an antiseptic swab over the injection site for a few seconds after \nthe injection.\n\n Dispose of your used syringe in a sharps container. Do not try to replace the needle cover.\n Never put used syringes into your normal household waste bin.\n\nIf you use more Silapo than you should\n\nSilapo has a wide safety margin and side effects due to an overdose of using Silapo are unlikely. You \nshould inform the doctor or nurse immediately if you think too much Silapo has been injected.\n\nIf you forget to use Silapo\n\nDo not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\nIf you stop using Silapo\n\nDo not to stop the treatment without consultation of your doctor.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nSerious side effects:\n\nSerious skin rashes including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been \nreported in association with epoetin treatment. These can appear as reddish target-like macules or \ncircular patches often with central blisters on the trunk, skin peeling, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, \ngenitals and eyes and can be preceded by fever and flu-like symptoms.\nStop using Silapo if you develop these symptoms and contact your doctor or seek medical attention \nimmediately. See also section 2.\n\nIf you experience headaches, particularly sudden, stabbing migraine-like headaches or feel confused or \nhave fits, tell your doctor immediately. These may be the warning signs of a sudden rise in blood \npressure which requires urgent treatment.\n\nTell your doctor or nurse immediately if you notice any of the effects in this list.\n\n\n\n71\n\nOther side effects:\n\nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people\n Diarrhoea\n Feeling sick in your stomach\n Vomiting\n Fever\n Respiratory tract congestion, such as stuffy nose and sore throat, has been reported in patients \n\nwith kidney disease not yet on dialysis.\n\nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people\n Increased blood pressure. Raised blood pressure may require treatment with medicines (or \n\nadjustment to any medicines you already take for high blood pressure). Your doctor may \nmonitor your blood pressure regularly while you are using Silapo, particularly at the start of \ntherapy.\n\n Blood clots (including deep vein thrombosis and embolism) that may require urgent treatment. \nYou may have chest pain, breathlessness, and painful swelling and redness, usually in the leg as \nsymptoms.\n\n Cough\n Stroke (insufficient blood supply to the brain, which may lead to inability to move one or more \n\nlimbs on one side of the body, inability to understand or formulate speech, or an inability to see \none side of the visual field).\n\n Skin rashes and swelling around the eyes (oedema), which may result from an allergic reaction.\n Blood clot in an artificial kidney.\n Bone or muscle pain\n Flu-like symptoms, such as headache, aches and pains in the joints, feeling of weakness, chills, \n\ntiredness and dizziness. These may be more common at the start of treatment. If you have these \nsymptoms during injection into the vein, a slower delivery of the injection may help to avoid \nthem in the future.\n\n Redness, burning and pain at the site of injection\n Swelling of the ankles, feet or fingers\n Arm or leg pain\n\nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people\n Cerebral haemorrhages.\n High levels of blood potassium which can cause abnormal heart rhythm (this is a very common \n\nside effect in patients on dialysis).\n Fits\n Nose or airway congestion\n Allergic reaction\n Hives\n\nRare: may affect up to 1 in 1 000 people\n Symptoms of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA)\n\nPRCA means the bone marrow does not make enough red blood cells. PRCA causes sudden and \nsevere anaemia. The symptoms are:\no unusual tiredness,\no feeling dizzy,\no breathlessness.\n\nPRCA has been very rarely reported mostly in patients with kidney disease after months to \nyears of treatment with Silapo and other products that stimulate red blood cell production.\n\n\n\n72\n\n An increase in levels of small blood cells (called platelets), which are normally involved in the \nformation of a blood clot may occur, particularly when starting treatment. Your doctor will \ncheck on this.\n\n Severe allergic reaction that may include:\no a swollen face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat\no difficulty swallowing or breathing\no itchy rash (hives)\n\n Problem with the blood that may cause pain, dark coloured urine or increased sensitivity of the \nskin to sunlight (porphyria)\n\nIf you are receiving haemodialysis:\n Blood clots (thrombosis) may form in your dialysis shunt. This is more likely if you have low \n\nblood pressure or if your fistula has complications.\n Blood clots may also form in your haemodialysis system. Your doctor may decide to increase \n\nyour heparin dose during dialysis.\n\nTell your doctor or nurse immediately if you are aware of any of these effects, or if you notice any \nother effects while you are receiving treatment with Silapo.\n\nOther side effects:\n\nKidney patients\n– raised blood pressure which may require treatment with medicinal products or adjustment of the \n\ndosage of medicinal products you already take for high blood pressure. Your doctor may \nmonitor your blood pressure regularly while you are using Silapo, particularly at the start of \ntherapy.\n\n– Occlusion in the connection between artery and vein (shunt thrombosis) may occur especially if \nyou have low blood pressure or if your arteriovenous fistula has complications. Your doctor \nmay check your shunt and prescribe a medicinal product to prevent thrombosis.\n\nCancer patients including adult patients with myelodysplastic syndrome\n– blood clotting (thrombotic vascular events) (see section “Warnings and precautions”).\n– increase of blood pressure. Therefore your haemoglobin-levels and your blood pressure should \n\nbe controlled.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine.\n\n5. How to store Silapo\n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.\n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton. The expiry \ndate refers to the last day of that month.\n\nStore in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze.\n\nKeep the pre-filled syringe in the outer carton in order to protect from light.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n73\n\nThe syringe can be removed from the refrigerator and left at room temperature for a single period of \nmaximum 3 days (but not above 25°C).\n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.
