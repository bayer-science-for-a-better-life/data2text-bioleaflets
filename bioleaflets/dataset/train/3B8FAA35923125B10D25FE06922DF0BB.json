CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nSteglujan is indicated in adults aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to \ndiet and exercise to improve glycaemic control:\n\uf0b7 when metformin and/or a sulphonylurea (SU) and one of the monocomponents of Steglujan do \n\nnot provide adequate glycaemic control.\n\uf0b7 in patients already being treated with the combination of ertugliflozin and sitagliptin as separate \n\ntablets.\n\n(For study results with respect to combinations and effects on glycaemic control, see sections 4.4, 4.5, \nand 5.1)\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nThe recommended starting dose is 5 mg ertugliflozin/100 mg sitagliptin once daily. In patients \ntolerating the starting dose, the dose may be increased to 15 mg ertugliflozin/100 mg sitagliptin, once \ndaily, if additional glycaemic control is needed.\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nFor patients treated with ertugliflozin who are being switched to Steglujan, the dose of ertugliflozin \ncan be maintained.\n\nWhen Steglujan is used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, a lower dose of insulin \nor the insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see sections 4.4, 4.5,\nand 4.8).\n\nIn patients with volume depletion, correcting this condition prior to initiation of Steglujan is \nrecommended (see section 4.4).\n\nIf a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers. Patients should not take two \ndoses of Steglujan on the same day.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\nAssessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiation of Steglujan and periodically \nthereafter (see section 4.4).\n\nInitiation of this medicinal product is not recommended in patients with an estimated glomerular \nfiltration rate (eGFR) less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or CrCl less than 60 ml/min (see section 4.4).\n\nSteglujan should be discontinued when eGFR is persistently less than 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 or CrCl is \npersistently less than 45 ml/min.\n\nThe fixed-dose combination of ertugliflozin and sitagliptin should not be used in patients with severe \nrenal impairment, with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or receiving dialysis. Ertugliflozin is not \nexpected to be effective in these patients.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment of Steglujan is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. \nSteglujan has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and is not recommended for \nuse in these patients (see section 5.2).\n\nElderly (\u2265 65 years old)\nNo dose adjustment of Steglujan is recommended based on age. Elderly patients are more likely to \nhave decreased renal function. Because renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating \nertugliflozin, and sitagliptin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys, renal function \nshould be assessed more frequently in elderly patients. Renal function and risk of volume depletion \nshould be taken into account (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). There is limited experience with Steglujan in \npatients \u2265 75 years of age.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Steglujan in children under 18 years of age have not been established. No \ndata are available.\n\nMethod of administration \nSteglujan should be taken orally once daily in the morning, with or without food. In case of \nswallowing difficulties, the tablet could be broken or crushed as it is an immediate-release dosage \nform.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nGeneral\nSteglujan should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.\n\nAcute pancreatitis\nUse of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors has been associated with a risk of developing acute \npancreatitis. Patients should be informed of the characteristic symptom of acute pancreatitis: \npersistent, severe abdominal pain. Resolution of pancreatitis has been observed after discontinuation \nof sitagliptin (with or without supportive treatment), but very rare cases of necrotising or \nhaemorrhagic pancreatitis and/or death have been reported. If pancreatitis is suspected, Steglujan and \nother potentially suspect medicinal products should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, \nSteglujan should not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of \npancreatitis.\n\nHypotension/Volume depletion\nErtugliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to intravascular volume contraction. \nTherefore, symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiating Steglujan (see section 4.8), particularly \nin patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or CrCl less than \n60 ml/min), elderly patients (\u2265 65 years), patients on diuretics, or patients on anti-hypertensive therapy \nwith a history of hypotension. Before initiating Steglujan, volume status should be assessed and \ncorrected if indicated. Monitor for signs and symptoms after initiating therapy.\n\nDue to its mechanism of action, ertugliflozin induces an osmotic diuresis and increases serum \ncreatinine and decreases eGFR. Increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR were greater in \npatients with moderate renal impairment (see section 4.8).\n\nIn case of conditions that may lead to fluid loss (e.g., gastrointestinal illness), careful monitoring of\nvolume status (e.g., physical examination, blood pressure measurements, laboratory tests including\nhaematocrit) and electrolytes is recommended for patients receiving Steglujan. Temporary interruption \nof treatment with Steglujan should be considered until the fluid loss is corrected.\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis\nRare cases of DKA, including life-threatening and fatal cases, have been reported in clinical trials and \npost-marketing in patients treated with sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and cases \nhave been reported in clinical trials with ertugliflozin. In a number of cases, the presentation of the \ncondition was atypical with only moderately increased blood glucose values, below 14 mmol/l \n(250 mg/dl). It is not known if DKA is more likely to occur with higher doses of ertugliflozin.\n\nThe risk of diabetic ketoacidosis must be considered in the event of non-specific symptoms such as \nnausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, difficulty breathing, confusion, unusual \nfatigue or sleepiness. Patients should be assessed for ketoacidosis immediately if these symptoms \noccur, regardless of blood glucose level.\n\nIn patients where DKA is suspected or diagnosed, treatment with Steglujan should be discontinued \nimmediately.\n\nTreatment should be interrupted in patients who are hospitalised for major surgical procedures or acute \nserious medical illnesses. Monitoring of ketones is recommended in these patients. Measurement of \nblood ketone levels is preferred to urine. Treatment with Steglujan may be restarted when the ketone \nvalues are normal and the patient\u2019s condition has stabilised.\n\nBefore initiating Steglujan, factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis should be \nconsidered.\n\nPatients who may be at higher risk of DKA include patients with a low beta-cell function reserve (e.g.,\ntype 2 diabetes patients with low C-peptide or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or \n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\npatients with a history of pancreatitis), patients with conditions that lead to restricted food intake or \nsevere dehydration, patients for whom insulin doses are reduced and patients with increased insulin \nrequirements due to acute medical illness, surgery, or alcohol abuse. SGLT2 inhibitors should be used \nwith caution in these patients.\n\nRestarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients with previous DKA while on SGLT2 inhibitor \ntreatment is not recommended, unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Steglujan in patients with type 1 diabetes have not been established and \nSteglujan should not be used for treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes. Limited data from clinical \ntrials suggest that DKA occurs with common frequency when patients with type 1 diabetes are treated \nwith SGLT2 inhibitors.\n\nLower limb amputations\nIn an ongoing clinical study of ertugliflozin added to existing therapy in type 2 diabetes patients with a \nhistory of established cardiovascular disease, an approximately 1.2-1.6-fold increase in cases of lower \nlimb amputation (primarily of the toe) has been observed in patients treated with ertugliflozin. An \nincrease in cases of lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has also been observed in long-term \nclinical studies with another SGLT2 inhibitor. As an underlying mechanism has not been established, \nrisk factors, apart from general risk factors, for amputation are unknown.\n\nBefore initiating ertugliflozin/sitagliptin, consider factors in the patient history that may increase the \nrisk for amputation. As precautionary measures, consideration should be given to carefully monitoring \npatients with a higher risk for amputation events and counselling patients about the importance of \nroutine preventative foot care and maintaining adequate hydration. Consideration may also be given to \nstopping treatment with ertugliflozin/sitagliptin in patients who develop events which may precede \namputation such as lower-extremity skin ulcer, infection, osteomyelitis or gangrene.\n\nImpairment in renal function\nThe efficacy of ertugliflozin is dependent on renal function, and efficacy is reduced in patients who \nhave moderate renal impairment and likely absent in patients with severe renal impairment (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nSteglujan should not be initiated in patients with an eGFR below 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or CrCl below\n60 ml/min. Steglujan should be discontinued when eGFR is persistently below 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 or \nCrCl is persistently below 45 ml/min due to a reduction of efficacy.\n\nMonitoring of renal function is recommended as follows:\n- Prior to Steglujan initiation and periodically during treatment (see section 4.2).\n- More frequently in patients with an eGFR below 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or a CrCl below 60 ml/min.\n\nHypoglycaemia with concomitant use with insulin and insulin secretagogues\nErtugliflozin may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an \ninsulin secretagogue, which are known to cause hypoglycaemia (see section 4.8). Hypoglycaemia has \nbeen observed when sitagliptin was used in combination with insulin or a sulphonylurea. Therefore, a \nlower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia \nwhen used in combination with Steglujan (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).\n\nGenital mycotic infections\nErtugliflozin increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. In trials with SGLT2 inhibitors, patients \nwith a history of genital mycotic infections and uncircumcised males were more likely to develop \ngenital mycotic infections (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored and treated appropriately.\n\nUrinary tract infections\nUrinary glucose excretion may be associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infections.\nThe incidence of urinary tract infections was not notably different in the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg \ngroups (4.0% and 4.1%) and the placebo group (3.9%). Most of the events were mild or moderate and \n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nno serious case was reported. Temporary interruption of ertugliflozin should be considered when \ntreating pyelonephritis or urosepsis.\n\nNecrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier\u2019s gangrene) \nPost-marketing cases of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum, (also known as Fournier\u2019s gangrene), \nhave been reported in female and male patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. This is a rare but serious and \npotentially life-threatening event that requires urgent surgical intervention and antibiotic treatment. \n\nPatients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience a combination of symptoms of \npain, tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, with fever or malaise. Be aware \nthat either uro-genital infection or perineal abscess may precede necrotising fasciitis. If Fournier\u2019s \ngangrene is suspected, Steglujan should be discontinued and prompt treatment (including antibiotics \nand surgical debridement) should be instituted. \n\nHypersensitivity reactions\nPost-marketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin have \nbeen reported (see section 4.8). These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin \nconditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first \n3 months after initiation of treatment, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a \nhypersensitivity reaction is suspected, Steglujan should be discontinued. Other potential causes for the \nevent should be assessed, and alternative treatment for diabetes initiated.\n\nBullous pemphigoid\nThere have been post-marketing reports of bullous pemphigoid in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors\nincluding sitagliptin. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, Steglujan should be discontinued.\n\nElderly patients\nElderly patients may be at an increased risk of volume depletion. Patients 65 years and older treated \nwith ertugliflozin, had a higher incidence of adverse reactions related to volume depletion compared to \nyounger patients. Steglujan is expected to have diminished efficacy in elderly patients with renal \nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).\n\nCardiac failure \nExperience in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I-II is limited, and there is no experience in \nclinical studies with Steglujan in NYHA class III-IV.\n\nUrine laboratory assessments\nDue to the mechanism of action of ertugliflozin, patients taking Steglujan will test positive for glucose \nin their urine. Alternative methods should be used to monitor glycaemic control.\n\nInterference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) assay\nMonitoring glycaemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are \nunreliable in assessing glycaemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Alternative methods\nshould be used to monitor glycaemic control.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with Steglujan have not been performed; however, such \nstudies have been conducted with ertugliflozin and sitagliptin, the individual active substances of \nSteglujan.\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\nErtugliflozin\n\nPharmacodynamic interactions\n\nDiuretics\nErtugliflozin may add to the diuretic effect of diuretics and may increase the risk of dehydration and \nhypotension (see section 4.4).\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulphonylureas, cause hypoglycaemia. Ertugliflozin may \nincrease the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin \nsecretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce \nthe risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with Steglujan (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.8). \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions\n\nEffects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin\nMetabolism by UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 is the primary clearance mechanism for ertugliflozin. \n\nInteraction studies conducted in healthy subjects, using a single dose design, suggest that the \npharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin are not altered by sitagliptin, metformin, glimepiride, or simvastatin.\n\nMultiple-dose administration of rifampin (a UGT and CYP inducer) decreases ertugliflozin AUC and \nCmax by 39% and 15%, respectively. This decrease in exposure is not considered clinically relevant and \ntherefore, no dose adjustment is recommended. A clinically relevant effect with other inducers (e.g., \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) is not expected. \n\nThe impact of UGT inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin has not been studied clinically, \nbut potential increase in ertugliflozin exposure due to UGT inhibition is not considered to be clinically \nrelevant.\n\nEffects of ertugliflozin on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products\nInteraction studies conducted in healthy volunteers suggest that ertugliflozin had no clinically relevant \neffect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin, metformin, and glimepiride. \n\nCoadministration of simvastatin with ertugliflozin resulted in a 24% and 19% increase in AUC and \nCmax of simvastatin, respectively, and 30% and 16% increase in AUC and Cmax of simvastatin acid, \nrespectively. The mechanism for the small increases in simvastatin and simvastatin acid is unknown \nand is not perpetrated through OATP inhibition by ertugliflozin. These increases are not considered to \nbe clinically meaningful.  \n\nSitagliptin\nPharmacokinetic interactions\n\nEffects of other medicinal products on sitagliptin\nSitagliptin is primarily eliminated unchanged in urine, and metabolism is a minor pathway. In vitro\nstudies indicate that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin is \nCYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8.\n\nMetabolism may play a more significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe \nrenal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For this reason, it is possible that potent \nCYP3A4 inhibitors (i.e., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin) could alter the \npharmacokinetics of sitagliptin in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD.\nInteraction studies conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes or healthy volunteers suggest that \nmetformin and ciclosporin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin.\n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nEffects of sitagliptin on other medicinal products\nIn drug interaction studies, sitagliptin did not have clinically meaningful effects on the \npharmacokinetics of the following: metformin, rosiglitazone, glyburide, simvastatin, warfarin, and oral \ncontraceptives.\n\nDigoxin: Sitagliptin had a small effect on plasma digoxin concentrations. Following administration of\n0.25 mg digoxin concomitantly with 100 mg of sitagliptin daily for 10 days, the plasma AUC of\ndigoxin was increased on average by 11% and the plasma Cmax on average by 18%. No dose\nadjustment of digoxin is recommended. However, patients at risk of digoxin toxicity should be\nmonitored for this when sitagliptin and digoxin are administered concomitantly.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no data from the use of Steglujan in pregnant women. There are limited data from the use of \nertugliflozin in pregnant women. Based on results from animal studies, ertugliflozin may affect renal \ndevelopment and maturation (see section 5.3). Therefore, Steglujan should not be used during \npregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nThere is no information regarding the presence of Steglujan or its individual components in human \nmilk, the effects on the breast-fed infant, or the effects on milk production. No studies in lactating \nanimals have been conducted with the combined components of Steglujan. Ertugliflozin and sitagliptin \nare present in the milk of lactating rats. Ertugliflozin caused effects in the offspring of lactating rats.\n\nPharmacologically mediated effects were observed in juvenile rats treated with ertugliflozin (see \nsection 5.3). Since human kidney maturation occurs in utero and during the first 2 years of life when \nexposure from breast-feeding may occur, a risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Steglujan \nshould not be used during breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\nThe effect of Steglujan on fertility in humans has not been studied. No effects of ertugliflozin or \nsitagliptin on fertility were observed in animal studies (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nSteglujan has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, when\ndriving or using machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness and somnolence have been\nreported with sitagliptin. In addition, patients should be alerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia when \nSteglujan is used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue and to the elevated risk of \nadverse reactions related to volume depletion, such as postural dizziness (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and \n4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nErtugliflozin and Sitagliptin\nThe safety of concomitantly administered ertugliflozin and sitagliptin has been evaluated in \n990 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated for 26 weeks in three studies; a factorial study of \nertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg in combination with sitagliptin 100 mg once daily compared to the \nindividual components, a placebo-controlled study of ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg as add-on therapy to \nsitagliptin 100 mg and metformin once daily, and a placebo-controlled study of initial therapy with \nertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg once daily in combination with sitagliptin 100 mg once daily (see \nsection 5.1). The incidence and type of adverse reactions in these three studies were similar to the \nadverse reactions seen with ertugliflozin and are described below in Table 1. There were no additional \n\n \n\n\n\n9\n\nadverse reactions identified in these three trials that included sitagliptin relative to the three placebo-\ncontrolled studies with ertugliflozin (see below).\n\nErtugliflozin\n\nPool of placebo-controlled trials\nThe primary assessment of safety was conducted in a pool of three 26-week, placebo-controlled trials. \nErtugliflozin was used as monotherapy in one trial and as add-on therapy in two trials (see \nsection 5.1). These data reflect exposure of 1,029 patients to ertugliflozin with a mean exposure \nduration of approximately 25 weeks. Patients received ertugliflozin 5 mg (N=519), ertugliflozin 15 mg \n(N=510), or placebo (N=515) once daily.\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions across the clinical program were vulvovaginal mycotic \ninfection and other female genital mycotic infections. Serious diabetic ketoacidosis occurred rarely. \nSee \u201cDescription of selected adverse reactions\u201d for frequencies and see section 4.4.\n\nSitagliptin\nSerious adverse reactions including pancreatitis and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported.\nHypoglycaemia has been reported in combination with sulphonylurea (4.7%-13.8%) and insulin \n(9.6%) (see section 4.4).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions listed below are classified according to frequency and system organ class (SOC). \nFrequency categories are defined according to the following convention: very common (\u2265 1/10), \ncommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions \n\nSystem Organ Class\nFrequency\n\nAdverse Reaction\n\nInfections and infestations\n\nVery common\n\nCommon\n\nNot known\n\nVulvovaginal mycotic infection and other female genital \nmycotic infections*,\u2020,1\n\nBalanitis candida and other male genital mycotic \ninfections*,\u2020,1\n\nNecrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier\u2019s gangrene)*\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\n\nRare Thrombocytopenia2\n\nImmune system disorders\n\nNot known Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic \n\nresponses*\n,a,2\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\n\nCommon\n\nRare\n\nHypoglycaemia*,\u2020,1,2\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis*,\u2020,1\n\nNervous system disorders\n\nCommon\nUncommon\n\nHeadache2\n\nDizziness2\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\n\nNot known Interstitial lung diseasea,2\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\n\n \n\n\n\n10\n\nUncommon\nNot known\nNot known\nNot known\n\nConstipation2\n\nVomiting\na,2\n\nAcute pancreatitis\na,*,b,2\n\nFatal and non-fatal haemorrhagic and necrotising \n\npancreatitis\n*,a,2\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\n\nUncommon\nNot known\nNot known\nNot known\nNot known\n\nNot known\n\nNot known\n\nPruritusa,2\n\nAngioedemaa,*,2\n\nRasha,*,2\n\nUrticariaa,*,2\n\nCutaneous vasculitisa,*,2\n\nExfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson \n\nsyndromea,*,2\n\nBullous pemphigoida, * ,2\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\n\nNot known\nNot known\nNot known\nNot known\n\nArthralgiaa,2\n\nMyalgiaa,2\n\nBack paina,2\n\nArthropathya,2\n\nVascular disorders\n\nCommon Volume depletion*,\u2020,1\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\n\nCommon\nUncommon\n\nNot known\nNot known\n\nIncreased urination\u2021,1\n\nDysuria1, Blood creatinine increased/Glomerular filtration \nrate decreased\u2020,1\n\nImpaired renal functiona,2\n\nAcute renal failurea,2\n\nReproductive system and breast disorders\n\nCommon Vulvovaginal pruritus1\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\n\nCommon Thirst\u00a7,1\n\nInvestigations\n\nCommon Serum lipids changed\u00b6,1, Haemoglobin increased **1, BUN \nincreased\u00b6\u00b61\n\n1 Adverse reaction with ertugliflozin.\n2 Adverse reaction with sitagliptin.\n* See Section 4.4.\n\u2020 See subsections below for additional information.\n\u2021 Includes: pollakiuria, micturition urgency, polyuria, urine output increased, and nocturia.\n\u00a7 Includes: thirst and polydipsia.\n\u00b6 Mean percent changes from baseline for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg versus placebo, respectively, were LDL-C 5.8% \n\nand 8.4% versus 3.2%; total cholesterol 2.8% and 5.7% versus 1.1%; however, HDL-C 6.2% and 7.6% versus 1.9%. \nMedian percent changes from baseline for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg versus placebo, respectively, were\ntriglycerides -3.9% and -1.7% versus 4.5%.\n\n** The proportion of subjects having at least 1 increase in haemoglobin > 2.0 g/dL was higher in the ertugliflozin 5 mg and \n15 mg groups (4.7% and 4.1%, respectively) compared to the placebo group (0.6%).\n\n\u00b6\u00b6 The proportion of subjects having any occurrence of BUN values \u226550% increase and value >ULN was numerically \nhigher in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group and higher in the 15 mg group (7.9% and 9.8%, respectively) relative to the \nplacebo group (5.1%).\n\na Adverse reactions were identified through post-marketing surveillance.\nb See TECOS Cardiovascular Safety Study below.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nVolume depletion (ertugliflozin)\nErtugliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to intravascular volume contraction and \nadverse reactions related to volume depletion. In the pool of placebo-controlled studies, the incidence \nof adverse events related to volume depletion (dehydration, dizziness postural, presyncope, syncope, \n\n \n\n\n\n11\n\nhypotension and orthostatic hypotension) was low (< 2%) and not notably different across the \nertugliflozin and placebo groups. In the subgroup analyses in the broader pool of Phase 3 studies, \nsubjects with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, subjects \u2265 65 years of age and subjects on diuretics had a \nhigher incidence of volume depletion in the ertugliflozin groups relative to the comparator group (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). In subjects with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence was 5.1%, 2.6% and \n0.5% for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and the comparator group and for subjects with eGFR \n45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence was 6.4%, 3.7% and 0% respectively.\n\nHypoglycaemia (ertugliflozin)\nIn the pool of placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of documented hypoglycemia was increased \nfor ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg (5.0% and 4.5%) compared to placebo (2.9%). In this population, the \nincidence of severe hypoglycaemia was 0.4% in each group. When ertugliflozin was used as \nmonotherapy, the incidence of hypoglycaemic events in the ertugliflozin groups was 2.6% in both \ngroups and 0.7% in the placebo group. When used as add-on to metformin, the incidence of \nhypoglycaemic events was 7.2% in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, 7.8% in the ertugliflozin 15 mg \ngroup and 4.3% in the placebo group.\n\nWhen ertugliflozin was added to metformin and compared to sulphonylurea, the incidence of \nhypoglycaemia was higher for the sulphonylurea (27%) compared to ertugliflozin (5.6% and 8.2% for \nertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg, respectively).\n\nIn patients with moderate renal impairment taking insulins, SU, or meglitinides as background \nmedication, documented hypoglycaemia was 36%, 27% and 36% for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin \n15 mg, and placebo, respectively (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.5).\n\nDiabetic Ketoacidosis (ertugliflozin)\nAcross the clinical program for ertugliflozin, ketoacidosis was identified in 3 of 3,409 (0.1%) \nertugliflozin-treated patients and 0.0% of comparator-treated patients (see section 4.4).\n\nBlood creatinine increased/Glomerular filtration rate decreased and renal-related events\n(ertugliflozin)\nInitial increases in mean creatinine and decreases in mean eGFR in patients treated with ertugliflozin \nwere generally transient during continuous treatment. Patients with moderate renal impairment at \nbaseline had larger mean changes that did not return to baseline at Week 26; these changes reversed\nafter treatment discontinuation.\n\nRenal-related adverse reactions (e.g., acute kidney injury, renal impairment, acute prerenal failure) \nmay occur in patients treated with ertugliflozin, particularly in patients with moderate renal \nimpairment where the incidence of renal-related adverse reactions was 2.5%, 1.3%, and 0.6% in \npatients treated with ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, and placebo, respectively.\n\nGenital mycotic infections (ertugliflozin)\nIn the pool of three placebo-controlled clinical trials, female genital mycotic infections (e.g., genital \ncandidiasis, genital infection fungal, vaginal infection, vulvitis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, vulvovaginal \nmycotic infection, vulvovaginitis) occurred in 9.1%, 12%, and 3.0% of females treated with \nertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, and placebo, respectively. In females, discontinuation due to \ngenital mycotic infections occurred in 0.6% and 0% of patients treated with ertugliflozin and placebo, \nrespectively (see section 4.4).\n\nIn the same pool, male genital mycotic infections (e.g., balanitis candida, balanoposthitis, genital \ninfection, genital infection fungal) occurred in 3.7%, 4.2%, and 0.4% of males treated with \nertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, and placebo, respectively. Male genital mycotic infections \noccurred more commonly in uncircumcised males. In males, discontinuations due to genital mycotic \ninfections occurred in 0.2% and 0% of patients treated with ertugliflozin and placebo, respectively. In \nrare instances, phimosis was reported and sometimes circumcision was performed (see section 4.4).\n\n \n\n\n\n12\n\nSitagliptin\nIn addition to the adverse reactions described in the table above, adverse experiences reported \nregardless of causal relationship to medication and occurring in at least 5% and more commonly in \npatients treated with sitagliptin included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. \nAdditional adverse experiences reported regardless of causal relationship to medication that occurred \nmore frequently in patients treated with sitagliptin (not reaching the 5% level, but occurring with an \nincidence of > 0.5% higher with sitagliptin than that in the control group) included osteoarthritis and \npain in extremity.\n\nSome adverse reactions were observed more frequently in studies of combination use of sitagliptin \nwith other anti-diabetic medicinal products than in studies of sitagliptin monotherapy. These included \nhypoglycaemia (frequency very common with the combination of sulphonylurea and metformin), \ninfluenza (common with insulin (with or without metformin)), nausea and vomiting (common with \nmetformin), flatulence (common with metformin or pioglitazone), constipation (common with the \ncombination of sulphonylurea and metformin), peripheral oedema (common with pioglitazone or the \ncombination of pioglitazone and metformin), somnolence and diarrhoea (uncommon with metformin), \nand dry mouth (uncommon with insulin (with or without metformin)).\n\nTECOS (trial evaluating cardiovascular outcomes with sitagliptin)\nThe cardiovascular safety study with sitagliptin (TECOS) included 7,332 patients treated with \nsitagliptin, 100 mg daily (or 50 mg daily if the baseline eGFR was \u2265 30 and < 50 ml/min/1.73 m2), and \n7,339 patients treated with placebo in the intention-to-treat population. Both treatments were added to \nusual care targeting regional standards for HbA1c and CV risk factors. The overall incidence of \nserious adverse events in patients receiving sitagliptin was similar to that in patients receiving placebo. \n\nIn the intention-to-treat population, among patients who were using insulin and/or a sulphonylurea at \nbaseline, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was 2.7% in sitagliptin-treated patients and 2.5% in \nplacebo-treated patients; among patients who were not using insulin and/or a sulphonylurea at \nbaseline, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was 1.0% in sitagliptin-treated patients and 0.7% in \nplacebo-treated patients. The incidence of adjudication-confirmed pancreatitis events was 0.3% in \nsitagliptin-treated patients and 0.2% in placebo-treated patients. \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nIn the event of an overdose with Steglujan, employ the usual supportive measures (e.g., remove \nunabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring including obtaining an \nelectrocardiogram, and institute supportive treatment) as dictated by the patient\u2019s clinical status.\n\nErtugliflozin\nErtugliflozin did not show any toxicity in healthy subjects at single oral doses up to 300 mg and \nmultiple doses up to 100 mg daily for 2 weeks. No potential acute symptoms and signs of overdose \nwere identified. Removal of ertugliflozin by haemodialysis has not been studied.\n\nSitagliptin\nDuring controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 800 mg sitagliptin were \nadministered. Minimal increases in QTc, not considered to be clinically relevant, were observed in one \nstudy at a dose of 800 mg sitagliptin. There is no experience with doses above 800 mg in clinical \nstudies. In Phase 1 multiple-dose studies, there were no dose-related clinical adverse reactions \nobserved with sitagliptin with doses of up to 600 mg per day for periods of up to 10 days and 400 mg \nper day for periods of up to 28 days.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13\n\nSitagliptin is modestly dialysable. In clinical studies, approximately 13.5% of the dose was removed \nover a 3- to 4-hour haemodialysis session. Prolonged haemodialysis may be considered if clinically \nappropriate. It is not known if sitagliptin is dialysable by peritoneal dialysis.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, combinations of oral blood glucose lowering \ndrugs, ATC code: A10BD24.\n\nMechanism of action\nSteglujan combines two antihyperglycaemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to \nimprove glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: ertugliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor, and \nsitagliptin phosphate, a DPP-4 inhibitor.\n\nErtugliflozin\nSGLT2 is the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular \nfiltrate back into the circulation. Ertugliflozin is a potent, selective, and reversible inhibitor of SGLT2. \nBy inhibiting SGLT2, ertugliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal \nthreshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.\n\nSitagliptin\nSitagliptin is a member of a class of oral antihyperglycaemic agents called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 \n(DPP-4) inhibitors. The improvement in glycaemic control observed with this medicinal product may \nbe mediated by enhancing the levels of active incretin hormones. Incretin hormones, including \nglucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released \nby the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. The incretins are \npart of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When \nblood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and \nrelease from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signalling pathways involving cyclic AMP. \nTreatment with GLP-1 or with DPP-4 inhibitors in animal models of type 2 diabetes has been \ndemonstrated to improve beta cell responsiveness to glucose and stimulate insulin biosynthesis and \nrelease. With higher insulin levels, tissue glucose uptake is enhanced. In addition, GLP-1 lowers \nglucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells. Decreased glucagon concentrations, along with higher \ninsulin levels, lead to reduced hepatic glucose production, resulting in a decrease in blood glucose \nlevels. The effects of GLP-1 and GIP are glucose-dependent such that when blood glucose \nconcentrations are low, stimulation of insulin release and suppression of glucagon secretion by GLP-1 \nare not observed. For both GLP-1 and GIP, stimulation of insulin release is enhanced as glucose rises \nabove normal concentrations. Further, GLP-1 does not impair the normal glucagon response to \nhypoglycaemia. The activity of GLP-1 and GIP is limited by the DPP-4 enzyme, which rapidly \nhydrolyses the incretin hormones to produce inactive products. Sitagliptin prevents the hydrolysis of \nincretin hormones by DPP-4, thereby increasing plasma concentrations of the active forms of GLP-1 \nand GIP. By enhancing active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases \nglucagon levels in a glucose-dependent manner. In patients with type 2 diabetes with hyperglycaemia, \nthese changes in insulin and glucagon levels lead to lower haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and lower fasting \nand post-prandial glucose concentrations. The glucose-dependent mechanism of sitagliptin is distinct \nfrom the mechanism of sulphonylureas, which increase insulin secretion even when glucose levels are \nlow and can lead to hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes and in normal subjects. Sitagliptin \nis a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the enzyme DPP-4 and does not inhibit the closely-related \nenzymes DPP-8 or DPP-9 at therapeutic concentrations.\n\nIn a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, \nwhereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. \nCoadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. \nSitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations.\n\n \n\n\n\n14\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nErtugliflozin\n\nUrinary glucose excretion and urinary volume\nDose-dependent increases in the amount of glucose excreted in urine were observed in healthy \nsubjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus following single- and multiple-dose \nadministration of ertugliflozin. Dose-response modelling indicates that ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg \nresult in near maximal urinary glucose excretion (UGE) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, \nproviding 87% and 96% of maximal inhibition, respectively.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nErtugliflozin in combination with sitagliptin\nThe efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in combination with sitagliptin have been studied in 3 multi-\ncentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled, Phase 3 clinical studies \ninvolving 1,985 patients with type 2 diabetes. Across the 3 studies, the racial distribution ranged from \n72.9% to 90.4% White, 0.0% to 20.3% Asian, 1.9% to 4.5% Black and 4.8% to 5.4% Other. Hispanic \nor Latino patients comprised 15.6% to 36.1% of the population. The mean age of the patients across \nthese 3 studies ranged from 55.1 to 59.1 years (range 21 years to 85 years). Across the 3 studies, \n16.2% to 29.9% of patients were \u2265 65 years of age and 2.3% to 2.8% were \u2265 75 years of age.\n\nFactorial study with ertugliflozin and sitagliptin as add-on combination therapy with metformin\nA total of 1,233 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, \n26-week, active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg in \ncombination with sitagliptin 100 mg compared to the individual components. Patients with type 2 \ndiabetes inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy (\u2265 1,500 mg/day) were randomised to one \nof five active-treatment arms: ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg, sitagliptin 100 mg, or sitagliptin 100 mg in \ncombination with 5 mg or 15 mg ertugliflozin administered once daily in addition to continuation of \nbackground metformin therapy (see Table 2).\n\n \n\n\n\n15\n\nTable 2: Results at Week 26 from a factorial study with ertugliflozin and sitagliptin as add-on \ncombination therapy with metformin compared to individual components alone*\n\nErtugliflozin \n5 mg\n\nErtugliflozin \n15 mg\n\nSitagliptin \n100 mg\n\nErtugliflozin 5 mg +\nSitagliptin 100 mg\n\nErtugliflozin 15 mg \n+ Sitagliptin 100 mg\n\nHbA1c (%) N = 250 N = 248 N = 247 N = 243 N = 244\n\nBaseline (mean) 8.6 8.6 8.5 8.6 8.6\n\nChange from baseline (LS mean\u2020) -1.0 -1.1 -1.1 -1.5 -1.5\n\nDifference from\n\nSitagliptin \n\nErtugliflozin 5 mg\n\n-0.4\u2021 (-0.6, -0.3)\n\n-0.5\u2021 (-0.6, -0.3)\n\n-0.5\u2021 (-0.6, -0.3)\n\nErtugliflozin 15 mg\n\n(LS mean\u2020, 95% CI)\n\n-0.4\u2021 (-0.6, -0.3)\n\nPatients [N (%)] with HbA1c < 7% 66 (26.4) 79 (31.9) 81 (32.8) 127 \u00a7 (52.3) 120 \u00a7 (49.2)\n\nBody weight (kg) N = 250 N = 248 N = 247 N = 243 N = 244\n\nBaseline (mean) 88.6 88.0 89.8 89.5 87.5\n\nChange from baseline (LS mean\u2020) -2.7 -3.7 -0.7 -2.5 -2.9\n\nDifference from Sitagliptin\n\n(LS mean\u2020, 95% CI)\n\n-1.8\u2021 (-2.5, -1.2) -2.3\u2021 (-2.9, -1.6)\n\n* N includes all randomised, treated patients who had at least one measurement of the outcome variable.\n\u2020 Least squares means adjusted for treatment, time, baseline eGFR and the interaction of time by treatment.\n\u2021 p< 0.001 compared to control group.\n\u00a7 p< 0.001 compared to corresponding dose of ertugliflozin or sitagliptin (based on adjusted odds ratio comparisons from a \n\nlogistic regression model using multiple imputation for missing data values).\n\nErtugliflozin as add-on combination therapy with metformin and sitagliptin\nA total of 463 patients, with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin (\u2265 1,500 mg/day) \nand sitagliptin 100 mg once daily participated in a randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, 26-week, \nplacebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin.

Additionally, when added on to background metformin and \nsitagliptin therapy, ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg resulted in statistically significant placebo subtracted \nreductions in SBP of 2.9 and 3.9 mmHg, respectively.\n\n \n\n\n\n17\n\nSubgroup analysis\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes treated with ertugliflozin in combination with sitagliptin, the \nimprovement in HbA1c was similar across subgroups defined by age, sex, and race, and duration of \ntype 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nTECOS Cardiovascular Safety Study\nThe TECOS was a randomised study in 14,671 patients in the intention-to-treat population with an \nHbA1c of \u2265 6.5 to 8.0% with established CV disease who received sitagliptin (7,332) 100 mg daily (or \n50 mg daily if the baseline eGFR was \u2265 30 and < 50 ml/min/1.73 m2) or placebo (7,339) added to \nusual care targeting regional standards for HbA1c and CV risk factors. Patients with an eGFR \n< 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 were not to be enrolled in the study. The study population included \n2,004 patients \u2265 75 years of age and 3,324 patients with renal impairment \n(eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2).\n\nOver the course of the study, the overall estimated mean (SD) difference in HbA1c between the \nsitagliptin and placebo groups was 0.29% (0.01), 95% CI (-0.32, -0.27); p< 0.001. The primary \ncardiovascular endpoint was a composite of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal \nmyocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina. Secondary \ncardiovascular endpoints included the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial \ninfarction, or nonfatal stroke; first occurrence of the individual components of the primary composite; \nall-cause mortality; and hospital admissions for congestive heart failure.\n\nAfter a median follow up of 3 years, sitagliptin, when added to usual care, did not increase the risk of \nmajor adverse cardiovascular events or the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure compared to usual \ncare without sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes (see Table 5).\n\n \n\n\n\n18\n\nTable 5: Rates of composite cardiovascular outcomes and key secondary outcomes\n\nSitagliptin 100 mg Placebo\n\nHazard Ratio\n\n(95% CI) p-value\u2020N (%)\n\nIncidenc\ne rate \n\nper 100 \npatient-\nyears* N (%)\n\nIncidence \nrate per \n\n100 \npatient-\nyears*\n\nAnalysis in the Intention-to-Treat Population\n\nNumber of patients\n7,332 7,339\n\n0.98 (0.89\u20131.08) <0.001\n\nPrimary Composite Endpoint\n(Cardiovascular death, nonfatal \nmyocardial infarction, nonfatal \nstroke, or hospitalisation for \nunstable angina) 839 (11.4) 4.1 851 (11.6) 4.2\n\nSecondary Composite Endpoint\n(Cardiovascular death, nonfatal \nmyocardial infarction, or nonfatal \nstroke) 745 (10.2) 3.6 746 (10.2) 3.6 0.99 (0.89\u20131.10) <0.001\n\nSecondary Outcome\n\nCardiovascular death 380 (5.2) 1.7 366 (5.0) 1.7 1.03 (0.89-1.19) 0.711\n\nAll myocardial infarction (fatal \nand nonfatal) 300 (4.1) 1.4 316 (4.3) 1.5 0.95 (0.81\u20131.11) 0.487\n\nAll stroke (fatal and nonfatal) 178 (2.4) 0.8 183 (2.5) 0.9 0.97 (0.79\u20131.19) 0.760\n\nHospitalisation for unstable \nangina 116 (1.6) 0.5 129 (1.8) 0.6 0.90 (0.70\u20131.16) 0.419\n\nDeath from any cause 547 (7.5) 2.5 537 (7.3) 2.5 1.01 (0.90\u20131.14) 0.875\n\nHospitalization for heart failure\u2021\n228 (3.1) 1.1 229 (3.1) 1.1 1.00 (0.83\u20131.20) 0.983\n\n*Incidence rate per 100 patient-years is calculated as 100 \u00d7 (total number of patients with \u2265 1 event during eligible exposure \nperiod per total patient-years of follow-up).\n\n\u2020 Based on a Cox model stratified by region. For composite endpoints, the p-values correspond to a test of non-inferiority \nseeking to show that the hazard ratio is less than 1.3. For all other endpoints, the p-values correspond to a test of differences \nin hazard rates.\n\n\u2021The analysis of hospitalisation for heart failure was adjusted for a history of heart failure at baseline.\n\nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nSteglujan in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (see section 4.2 \nfor information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nSteglujan\nSteglujan has been shown to be bioequivalent to coadministration of corresponding doses of \nertugliflozin and sitagliptin tablets.\n\nThe effects of a high-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin and sitagliptin when \nadministered as Steglujan tablets are comparable to those reported for the individual tablets. \nAdministration of Steglujan with food decreased ertugliflozin Cmax by 29% and had no meaningful \neffect on ertugliflozin AUCinf, or on sitagliptin AUCinf and Cmax.\n\n \n\n\n\n19\n\nErtugliflozin\n\nGeneral introduction\nThe pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin are similar in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes. \nThe steady state mean plasma AUC and Cmax were 398 ng\u2219hr/ml and 81 ng/ml, respectively, with 5 mg \nertugliflozin once daily treatment, and 1,193 ng\u2219hr/ml and 268 ng/ml, respectively, with 15 mg \nertugliflozin once daily treatment. Steady-state is reached after 4 to 6 days of once-daily dosing with \nertugliflozin. Ertugliflozin does not exhibit time-dependent pharmacokinetics and accumulates in \nplasma up to 10-40% following multiple dosing.\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing single-dose oral administration of 5 mg and 15 mg of ertugliflozin, peak plasma \nconcentrations (median Tmax) of ertugliflozin occur at 1 hour post-dose under fasted conditions. \nPlasma Cmax and AUC of ertugliflozin increase in a dose-proportional manner following single doses \nfrom 0.5 mg to 300 mg and following multiple doses from 1 mg to 100 mg. The absolute oral \nbioavailability of ertugliflozin following administration of a 15-mg dose is approximately 100%.\n\nAdministration of ertugliflozin with a high-fat and high-calorie meal decreases ertugliflozin Cmax by \n29% and prolongs Tmax by 1 hour, but does not alter AUC as compared with the fasted state. The \nobserved effect of food on ertugliflozin pharmacokinetics is not considered clinically relevant, and \nertugliflozin may be administered with or without food. In Phase 3 clinical trials, ertugliflozin was \nadministered without regard to meals.\n\nErtugliflozin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) \ntransporters.\n\nDistribution\nThe mean steady-state volume of distribution of ertugliflozin following an intravenous dose is 86 l. \nPlasma protein binding of ertugliflozin is 93.6% and is independent of ertugliflozin plasma \nconcentrations. Plasma protein binding is not meaningfully altered in patients with renal or hepatic \nimpairment. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio of ertugliflozin is 0.66.\n\nErtugliflozin is not a substrate of organic anion transporters (OAT1, OAT3), organic cation \ntransporters (OCT1, OCT2), or organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1, OATP1B3) in \nvitro.\n\nBiotransformation\nMetabolism is the primary clearance mechanism for ertugliflozin. The major metabolic pathway for \nertugliflozin is UGT1A9 and UGT2B7-mediated O-glucuronidation to two glucuronides that are \npharmacologically inactive at clinically relevant concentrations. CYP-mediated (oxidative) \nmetabolism of ertugliflozin is minimal (12%).\n\nElimination\nThe mean systemic plasma clearance following an intravenous 100 \u00b5g dose was 11 l/hr. The mean \nelimination half-life in type 2 diabetic patients with normal renal function was estimated to be \n17 hours based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Following administration of an oral \n[14C]-ertugliflozin solution to healthy subjects, approximately 41% and 50% of the drug-related \nradioactivity was eliminated in faeces and urine, respectively. Only 1.5% of the administered dose was \nexcreted as unchanged ertugliflozin in urine and 34% as unchanged ertugliflozin in faeces, which is \nlikely due to biliary excretion of glucuronide metabolites and subsequent hydrolysis to parent.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\nIn a Phase 1 clinical pharmacology study in patients with type 2 diabetes and mild, moderate, or \nsevere renal impairment (as determined by eGFR), following a single-dose administration of 15 mg \nertugliflozin, the mean increases in AUC of ertugliflozin were \u2264 1.7-fold, compared to subjects with \n\n \n\n\n\n20\n\nnormal renal function. These increases in ertugliflozin AUC are not considered clinically relevant. \nThere were no clinically meaningful differences in the ertugliflozin Cmax values among the different \nrenal function groups. The 24-hour urinary glucose excretion declined with increasing severity of renal \nimpairment (see section 4.4). The plasma protein binding of ertugliflozin was unaffected in patients \nwith renal impairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\nModerate hepatic impairment (based on the Child-Pugh classification) did not result in an increase in \nexposure of ertugliflozin. The AUC of ertugliflozin decreased by approximately 13%, and Cmax\ndecreased by approximately 21% compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. This decrease in \nertugliflozin exposure is not considered clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in \npatients with Child-Pugh class C (severe) hepatic impairment. The plasma protein binding of \nertugliflozin was unaffected in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.\n\nPaediatric population\nNo studies with ertugliflozin have been performed in paediatric patients.\n\nEffects of age, body weight, gender and race\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, body weight, gender, and race do not have a \nclinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin.\n\nSitagliptin\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing oral administration of a 100-mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed, \nwith peak plasma concentrations (median Tmax) occurring 1 to 4 hours post-dose. Mean plasma AUC \nof sitagliptin was 8.52 \uf06dM\u2022hr and Cmax was 950 nM. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is \napproximately 87%. Since coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the \npharmacokinetics, Steglujan may be administered with or without food.\n\nPlasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner. Dose-proportionality was not \nestablished for Cmax and C24hr (Cmax increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner and C24hr\nincreased in a less than dose-proportional manner).\n\nDistribution\nThe mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of \nsitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 l. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to \nplasma proteins is low (38%).\n\nBiotransformation\nSitagliptin is primarily eliminated unchanged in urine, and metabolism is a minor pathway. \nApproximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine.\n\nFollowing a [14C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as \nmetabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to \ncontribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the \nprimary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution \nfrom CYP2C8.\n\nIn vitro data showed that sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, \n1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2.\n\nElimination\nFollowing administration of an oral [14C]-sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of \nthe administered radioactivity was eliminated in faeces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of \ndosing. The apparent terminal t1/2 following a 100-mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately \n\n \n\n\n\n21\n\n12.4 hours. Sitagliptin accumulates only minimally with multiple doses. The renal clearance was \napproximately 350 ml/min.\n\nElimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. \nSitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in \nthe renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not \nbeen established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of P-gp, which may also be involved in mediating the \nrenal elimination of sitagliptin. However, ciclosporin, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal \nclearance of sitagliptin. Sitagliptin is not a substrate for OCT2 or OAT1 or peptide transporter 1/2 \n(PEPT1/2) transporters. In vitro, sitagliptin did not inhibit OAT3 (IC50=160 \uf06dM) or p-glycoprotein (up \nto 250 \uf06dM) mediated transport at therapeutically relevant plasma concentrations. In a clinical study \nsitagliptin had a small effect on plasma digoxin concentrations indicating that sitagliptin may be a \nmild inhibitor of P-gp.\n\nDrug interactions\nNo drug interactions studies have been performed with Steglujan and other medicinal products; \nhowever, such studies have been conducted with the individual active substances.\n\nIn vitro assessment of ertugliflozin\nIn in vitro studies, ertugliflozin and ertugliflozin glucuronides did not inhibit or inactivate CYPs 1A2, \n2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2B6, 2D6, or 3A4, and did not induce CYPs 1A2, 2B6, or 3A4. Ertugliflozin and \nertugliflozin glucuronides did not inhibit the activity of UGTs 1A6, 1A9 or 2B7 in vitro. Ertugliflozin \nwas a weak inhibitor of UGTs 1A1 and 1A4 in vitro at higher concentrations that are not clinically \nrelevant. Ertugliflozin glucuronides had no effect on these isoforms. Overall, ertugliflozin is unlikely \nto affect the pharmacokinetics of concurrently administered drugs eliminated by these enzymes.\n\nErtugliflozin or ertugliflozin glucuronides do not meaningfully inhibit P-gp, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3 \ntransporters or transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 at clinically relevant \nconcentrations in vitro. Overall, ertugliflozin is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of concurrently \nadministered medications that are substrates of these transporters.\n\nIn vitro assessment of sitagliptin\nIn vitro data suggest that sitagliptin does not inhibit or induce CYP450 isoenzymes. In clinical studies, \nsitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, \nrosiglitazone, warfarin, or oral contraceptives, providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for \ncausing interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and OCT. Sitagliptin may be a \nmild inhibitor of P-gp in vivo.\n\nIn vitro transport studies showed that sitagliptin is a substrate for P-gp and OAT3. OAT3 mediated \ntransport of sitagliptin was inhibited in vitro by probenecid, although the risk of clinically meaningful \ninteractions is considered to be low. Concomitant administration of OAT3 inhibitors has not been \nevaluated in vivo.\n\nCharacteristics in patients\nThe pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin were generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with \ntype 2 diabetes.\n\nRenal impairment\nIn patients with normal renal function, metabolism, including via CYP3A4, plays only a small role in \nthe clearance of sitagliptin. Metabolism may play a more significant role in the elimination of \nsitagliptin in the setting of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD).\n\nCompared to normal healthy control subjects, plasma AUC of sitagliptin was increased modestly in \npatients with GFR \u2265 45 to < 90 mL/min. Because increases of this magnitude are not clinically \nrelevant, dosage adjustment in these patients is not necessary.\n\n \n\n\n\n22\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment for sitagliptin is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh score \uf0a3 9). There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh score > 9). However, because sitagliptin is primarily renally eliminated, severe hepatic \nimpairment is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin.\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is required based on age. Age did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the \npharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of Phase 1 and Phase 2\ndata. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of \nsitagliptin compared to younger subjects.\n\nPaediatric\nNo studies with sitagliptin have been performed in paediatric patients.\n\nOther patient characteristics\nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on gender, race, or body mass index (BMI). These \ncharacteristics had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a \ncomposite analysis of Phase 1 pharmacokinetic data and on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of \nPhase 1 and Phase 2 data.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, acute toxicity, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential.\n\nErtugliflozin\n\nGeneral toxicity\nRepeat-dose oral toxicity studies were conducted in mice, rats, and dogs for up to 13, 26, and \n39 weeks, respectively. Signs of toxicity that were considered adverse were generally observed at \nexposures greater than or equal to 77 times the human unbound exposure (AUC) at the maximum \nrecommended human dose (MRHD) of 15 mg/day. Most toxicity was consistent with pharmacology \nrelated to urinary glucose loss and included decreased body weight and body fat, increased food \nconsumption, diarrhoea, dehydration, decreased serum glucose and increases in other serum \nparameters reflective of increased protein metabolism, gluconeogenesis and electrolyte imbalances, \nand urinary changes such as polyuria, glucosuria, and calciuria. Microscopic changes related to \nglucosuria and/or calciuria observed only in rodents included dilatation of renal tubules, hypertrophy \nof zona glomerulosa in adrenal glands (rats), and increased trabecular bone (rats). Except for emesis, \nthere were no adverse toxicity findings in dogs at 379 times the human unbound exposure (AUC) at \nthe MRHD of 15 mg/day.\n\nCarcinogenesis\nIn the 2-year mouse carcinogenicity study, ertugliflozin was administered by oral gavage at doses of 5, \n15, and 40 mg/kg/day. There were no ertugliflozin-related neoplastic findings at doses up to \n40 mg/kg/day (approximately 41 times human unbound exposure at the MRHD of 15 mg/day based on \nAUC). In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, ertugliflozin was administered by oral gavage at doses \nof 1.5, 5, and 15 mg/kg/day. Ertugliflozin-related neoplastic findings included an increased incidence \nof benign adrenal medullary pheochromocytoma in male rats at 15 mg/kg/day. This finding was \nattributed to carbohydrate malabsorption leading to altered calcium homeostasis and was not \nconsidered relevant to human risk. The no-observed-effect level (NOEL) for neoplasia was \n5 mg/kg/day (approximately 16 times human unbound exposure at the MRHD of 15 mg/day).\n\nMutagenesis\nErtugliflozin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the microbial \nreverse mutation, in vitro cytogenetic (human lymphocytes), and in vivo rat micronucleus assays.\n\n \n\n\n\n23\n\nReproductive toxicology\nIn the rat fertility and embryonic development study, male and female rats were administered \nertugliflozin at 5, 25, and 250 mg/kg/day. No effects on fertility were observed at 250 mg/kg/day \n(approximately 386 times human unbound exposure at the MRHD of 15 mg/day based on AUC \ncomparisons). Ertugliflozin did not adversely affect developmental outcomes in rats and rabbits at \nmaternal exposures that were 239 and 1,069 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum \nclinical dose of 15 mg/day, based on AUC. At a maternally toxic dose in rats (250 mg/kg/day), lower \nfoetal viability and a higher incidence of a visceral malformation were observed at maternal exposure \nthat was 510 times the maximum clinical dose of 15 mg/day.\n\nIn the pre- and post-natal development study, decreased post-natal growth and development were \nobserved in rats administered ertugliflozin gestation day 6 through lactation day 21 at \n\u2265 100 mg/kg/day (estimated 239 times the human exposure at the maximum clinical dose of \n15 mg/day, based on AUC). Sexual maturation was delayed in both sexes at 250 mg/kg/day (estimated \n620 times the MRHD at 15 mg/day, based on AUC).\n\nWhen ertugliflozin was administered to juvenile rats from post-natal day (PND) 21 to PND 90, a \nperiod of renal development corresponding to the late second and third trimesters of human pregnancy, \nincreased kidney weights, dilatation of the renal pelvis and tubules, and renal tubular mineralization \nwere seen at an exposure 13 times the maximum clinical dose of 15 mg/day, based on AUC. Effects \non bone (shorter femur length, increased trabecular bone in the femur) as well as effects of delayed \npuberty were observed at an exposure 817 times the MRHD of 15 mg/day based on AUC. The effects \non kidney and bone did not fully reverse after the 1 month recovery period.\n\nSitagliptin\nRenal and liver toxicity were observed in rodents at systemic exposure values 58 times the human \nexposure level, while the no-effect level was found at 19 times the human exposure level. Incisor teeth \nabnormalities were observed in rats at exposure levels 67 times the clinical exposure level; the \nno-effect level for this finding was 58-fold based on the 14-week rat study. The relevance of these \nfindings for humans is unknown. Transient treatment-related physical signs, some of which suggest \nneural toxicity, such as open-mouth breathing, salivation, white foamy emesis, ataxia, trembling, \ndecreased activity, and/or hunched posture were observed in dogs at exposure levels approximately \n23 times the clinical exposure level. In addition, very slight to slight skeletal muscle degeneration was \nalso observed histologically at doses resulting in systemic exposure levels of approximately 23 times \nthe human exposure level. A no-effect level for these findings was found at an exposure 6-fold the \nclinical exposure level.\n\nSitagliptin has not been demonstrated to be genotoxic in preclinical studies. Sitagliptin was not \ncarcinogenic in mice. In rats, there was an increased incidence of hepatic adenomas and carcinomas at \nsystemic exposure levels 58 times the human exposure level. Since hepatotoxicity has been shown to \ncorrelate with induction of hepatic neoplasia in rats, this increased incidence of hepatic tumours in rats \nwas likely secondary to chronic hepatic toxicity at this high dose. Because of the high safety margin \n(19-fold at this no-effect level), these neoplastic changes are not considered relevant for the situation\nin humans.\n\nNo adverse effects upon fertility were observed in male and female rats given sitagliptin prior to and \nthroughout mating.\n\nIn a pre-/post-natal development study performed in rats sitagliptin showed no adverse effects.\n\nReproductive toxicity studies showed a slight treatment-related increased incidence of foetal rib \nmalformations (absent, hypoplastic and wavy ribs) in the offspring of rats at systemic exposure levels \nmore than 29 times the human exposure levels. Maternal toxicity was seen in rabbits at more than \n29 times the human exposure levels. Because of the high safety margins, these findings do not suggest \na relevant risk for human reproduction. Sitagliptin is secreted in considerable amounts into the milk of \nlactating rats (milk/plasma ratio: 4:1).\n\n \n\n\n\n24\n\n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n\uf0b7 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\uf0b7 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. \n\uf0b7 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n\uf0b7 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Steglujan is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Steglujan\n3. How to take Steglujan\n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Steglujan\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Steglujan is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Steglujan is\nSteglujan contains two active substances, ertugliflozin and sitagliptin.\n\n\uf0b7 Ertugliflozin belongs to a group of medicines called sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2)\ninhibitors.\n\n\uf0b7 Sitagliptin belongs to a group of medicines called DPP-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) inhibitors.\n\nWhat Steglujan is used for\n\uf0b7 Steglujan lowers blood sugar levels in adult patients (aged 18 years and older) with type 2 \n\ndiabetes.\n\uf0b7 Steglujan can be used instead of taking both ertugliflozin and sitagliptin as separate tablets. \n\uf0b7 Steglujan can be used alone or with some other medicines that lower blood sugar.\n\uf0b7 You need to keep following your food and exercise plan while taking Steglujan.\n\nHow Steglujan works\n\uf0b7 Ertugliflozin works by blocking the SGLT2 protein in your kidneys. This causes blood sugar to \n\nbe removed in your urine.\n\uf0b7 Sitagliptin helps to increase the levels of insulin produced after a meal. It also lowers the \n\namount of sugar made by your body.\n\n \n\n\n\n38\n\nWhat is type 2 diabetes?\nType 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin or the insulin that \nyour body produces does not work as well as it should. Your body can also make too much sugar. \nWhen this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical problems, \nlike heart disease, kidney disease, blindness and poor circulation.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Steglujan\n\nDo not take Steglujan\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to ertugliflozin or sitagliptin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before and while taking Steglujan if you:\n\uf0b7 have kidney problems.\n\uf0b7 have or have had yeast infections of the vagina or penis.\n\uf0b7 have ever had serious heart disease or if you have had a stroke.\n\uf0b7 have or have had a disease of the pancreas (such as pancreatitis).\n\uf0b7 have type 1 diabetes. Steglujan should not be used to treat this condition.\n\uf0b7 take other diabetes medicines: you are more likely to get low blood sugar with certain \n\nmedicines.\n\uf0b7 might be at risk of dehydration (for example, if you are taking medicines that increase urine \n\nproduction [diuretics] or lower blood pressure or if you are over 65 years old). Ask about ways \nto prevent dehydration.\n\n\uf0b7 have or have had gallstones, alcohol dependence or very high levels of triglycerides (a form of \nfat) in your blood. These medical conditions can increase your chance of getting pancreatitis \n(see section 4).\n\n\uf0b7 experience rapid weight loss, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, fast and \ndeep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, a sweet \nor metallic taste in your mouth or a different odour to your urine or sweat contact a doctor or the \nnearest hospital straight away. These symptoms could be a sign of \u201cdiabetic ketoacidosis\u201d \u2013 a \nproblem you can get with diabetes because of increased levels of \u201cketone bodies\u201d in your urine \nor blood, seen in tests. The risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with \nprolonged fasting, excessive alcohol consumption, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin \ndose, or a higher need of insulin due to major surgery or serious illness.\n\n\uf0b7 have had a lower limb amputation.\n\nIt is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice regarding foot care and \nadequate hydration given by your healthcare professional. You should notify your doctor immediately \nif you notice any wounds or discolouration, or if you experience any tenderness or pain in your feet. \nSome studies indicate that taking ertugliflozin may have contributed to an increase in cases of lower \nlimb amputation (mainly of the toe).\n\nCases of inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) have been reported in patients receiving \nsitagliptin (see section 4).\n\nTalk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness, \nredness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or feeling \ngenerally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even life-threatening \ninfection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier\u2019s gangrene which destroys the tissue \nunder the skin. Fournier\u2019s gangrene has to be treated immediately.\n\nWhen this medicine is used in combination with insulin or medicines that increase insulin release from \nthe pancreas, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may reduce the dose of your \ninsulin or other medicine.\n\n \n\n\n\n39\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nUrine glucose\nBecause of how Steglujan works, your urine will test positive for sugar (glucose) while you are on this \nmedicine.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nChildren and adolescents below 18 years should not take this medicine. It is not known if this \nmedicine is safe and effective when used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.\n\nOther medicines and Steglujan\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nIn particular, tell your doctor:\n\uf0b7 if you are taking medicines which increase urine production (diuretics). \n\uf0b7 if you are taking other medicines that lower the amount of sugar in your blood, such as insulin \n\nor medicines that increase insulin release from the pancreas.\n\uf0b7 if you are taking digoxin (a medicine used to treat irregular heart beat and other heart problems). \n\nThe level of digoxin in your blood may need to be checked if you are taking it with Steglujan.\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), tell your doctor.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nIt is not known if Steglujan can harm your unborn baby.

You should not use this medicine if you are breast-feeding or \nplan to breast-feed.\n\nDriving and using machines\nThis medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, \ndizziness and drowsiness have been reported with sitagliptin, which may affect your ability to drive or \nuse machines. Do not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel dizzy while taking Steglujan.\n\nTaking this medicine in combination with insulin or medicines that increase insulin release from the \npancreas can cause blood sugar levels to drop too low (hypoglycaemia), which may cause symptoms \nsuch as shaking, sweating or changes in vision and may affect your ability to drive and use machines.\n\n3.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what steglujan is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "what steglujan is steglujan contains two active substances, ertugliflozin and sitagliptin. ertugliflozin belongs to a group of medicines called sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (sglt2) inhibitors. sitagliptin belongs to a group of medicines called dpp-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) inhibitors. what steglujan is used for steglujan lowers blood sugar levels in adult patients (aged 18 years and older) with type 2 diabetes. steglujan can be used instead of taking both ertugliflozin and sitagliptin as separate tablets. steglujan can be used alone or with some other medicines that lower blood sugar. you need to keep following your food and exercise plan while taking steglujan. how steglujan works ertugliflozin works by blocking the sglt2 protein in your kidneys. this causes blood sugar to be removed in your urine. sitagliptin helps to increase the levels of insulin produced after a meal. it also lowers the amount of sugar made by your body. what is type 2 diabetes? type 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin or the insulin that your body produces does not work as well as it should. your body can also make too much sugar. when this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. this can lead to serious medical problems, like heart disease, kidney disease, blindness and poor circulation.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "steglujan", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 4, "BeginOffset": 60,

heart disease or if you have had a stroke. have or have had a disease of the pancreas (such as pancreatitis). have type 1 diabetes. steglujan should not be used to treat this condition. take other diabetes medicines: you are more likely to get low blood sugar with certain medicines. might be at risk of dehydration (for example, if you are taking medicines that increase urine production [diuretics] or lower blood pressure or if you are over 65 years old). ask about ways to prevent dehydration. have or have had gallstones, alcohol dependence or very high levels of triglycerides (a form of fat) in your blood. these medical conditions can increase your chance of getting pancreatitis (see section 4). experience rapid weight loss, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, fast and deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, a sweet or metallic taste in your mouth or a different odour to your urine or sweat contact a doctor or the nearest hospital straight away. these symptoms could be a sign of \"diabetic ketoacidosis\" a problem you can get with diabetes because of increased levels of \"ketone bodies\" in your

have been reported in patients receiving sitagliptin (see section 4). talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness, redness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or feeling generally unwell. these symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even life-threatening infection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or fournier's gangrene which destroys the tissue under the skin. fournier's gangrene has to be treated immediately. when this medicine is used in combination with insulin or medicines that increase insulin release from the pancreas, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur. your doctor may reduce the dose of your insulin or other medicine. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. urine glucose because of how steglujan works, your urine will test positive for sugar (glucose) while you are on this medicine.

which may affect your ability to drive or use machines. do not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel dizzy while taking steglujan. taking this medicine in combination with insulin or medicines that increase insulin release from the pancreas can cause blood sugar levels to drop too low (hypoglycaemia), which may cause symptoms such as shaking, sweating or changes in vision and may affect your ability to drive and use machines.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "steglujan", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 11, "BeginOffset": 12, "EndOffset": 21,
