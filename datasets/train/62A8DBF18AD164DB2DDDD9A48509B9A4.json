NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nIvozall 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml of concentrate contains 1 mg of clofarabine.  \nEach 20 ml vial contains 20 mg of clofarabine. \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach 20 ml vial contains 70.77 mg of sodium . \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate).  \n \nClear, practically colourless solution with a pH of 4.5 to 7.5 and an osmolarity of 270 to 310 mOsm/l, \nfree from visible particles. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in paediatric patients who have relapsed or are \nrefractory after receiving at least two prior regimens and where there is no other treatment option \nanticipated to result in a durable response. Safety and efficacy have been assessed in studies of \npatients \u2264 21 years old at initial diagnosis (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy must be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the management of patients \nwith acute leukaemias. \n \nPosology \n \nAdult population (including elderly) \n \nThere are currently insufficient data to establish the safety and efficacy of clofarabine in adult patients \n(see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nChildren and adolescents (\u2265 1 year old) \nThe recommended dose in monotherapy is 52 mg/m2 of body surface area administered by intravenous \ninfusion over 2 hours daily for 5 consecutive days. Body surface area must be calculated using the \nactual height and weight of the patient before the start of each cycle. Treatment cycles should be \nrepeated every 2 to 6 weeks (from the starting day of the previous cycle) following recovery of normal \nhaematopoiesis (i.e. ANC \u2265 0.75 \u00d7 109/l) and return to baseline organ function. A 25% dose reduction \nmay be warranted in patients experiencing significant toxicities (see below). There is currently limited \nexperience of patients receiving more than 3 treatment cycles (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nThe majority of patients who respond to clofarabine achieve a response after 1 or 2 treatment cycles \n(see section 5.1). Therefore, the potential benefit and risks associated with continued therapy in \npatients who do not show haematological and/or clinical improvement after 2 treatment cycles should \nbe assessed by the treating physician (see section 4.4).   \n \nChildren weighing < 20 kg \nAn infusion time of > 2 hours should be considered to help reduce symptoms of anxiety and \nirritability, and to avoid unduly high maximum concentrations of clofarabine (see section 5.2). \n \nChildren < 1 year old \nThere are no data on the pharmacokinetics, safety or efficacy of clofarabine in infants. Therefore, a \nsafe and effective dosage recommendation for patients < 1 year old has yet to be established. \n \nDose reduction for patients experiencing haematological toxicities \n \nIf the ANC does not recover by 6 weeks from the start of a treatment cycle, a bone marrow aspirate / \nbiopsy should be performed to determine possible refractory disease. If persistent leukaemia is not \nevident, it is recommended that the dose for the next cycle be reduced by 25% of the previous dose \nfollowing recovery of ANC to \u2265 0.75 \u00d7 109/l. Should patients experience an ANC < 0.5 \u00d7 109/l for \nmore than 4 weeks from the start of the last cycle, it is recommended that the dose for the next cycle \nbe reduced by 25%. \n \nDose reduction for patients experiencing non-haematological toxicities \n \nInfectious events \nIf a patient develops a clinically significant infection, clofarabine treatment may be withheld until the \ninfection is clinically controlled. At this time, treatment may be reinitiated at the full dose. In the event \nof a second clinically significant infection, clofarabine treatment should be withheld until the infection \nis clinically controlled and may be reinitiated at a 25% dose reduction. \n \nNon-infectious events \nIf a patient experiences one or more severe toxicities (US National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common \nToxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 3 toxicities excluding nausea and vomiting), treatment should be \ndelayed until the toxicities resolve to baseline parameters or to the point where they are no longer \nsevere and the potential benefit of continued treatment with clofarabine outweighs the risk of such \ncontinuation. It is then recommended that clofarabine be administered at a 25% dose reduction. \n \nShould a patient experience the same severe toxicity on a second occasion, treatment should be \ndelayed until the toxicity resolves to baseline parameters or to the point where it is no longer severe \nand the potential benefit of continued treatment with clofarabine outweighs the risk of such \ncontinuation. It is then recommended that clofarabine be administered at a further 25% dose reduction. \n \nAny patient who experiences a severe toxicity on a third occasion, a severe toxicity that does not \nrecover within 14 days (see above for exclusions), or a life-threatening or disabling toxicity (US NCI \nCTC Grade 4 toxicity) should be withdrawn from treatment with clofarabine (see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nThe limited data available indicate that clofarabine may accumulate in patients with decreased \ncreatinine clearance (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Clofarabine is contraindicated in patients with severe \nrenal insufficiency (see section 4.3) and should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate \nrenal insufficiency (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 \u2013 < 60 ml/min) require a 50% dose \nreduction (see section 5.2). \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nThere is no experience in patients with hepatic impairment (serum bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN plus AST \nand ALT > 5 x ULN) and the liver is a potential target organ for toxicity. Therefore, clofarabine is \ncontraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3) and should be used with \ncaution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nIvozall is for intravenous use. The recommended dosage should be administered by intravenous \ninfusion although it has been administered via a central venous catheter in ongoing clinical trials.  \n \nIvozall must not be mixed with or concomitantly administered using the same intravenous line as other \nmedicinal products (see section 6.2). For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before \nadministration (see section 6.6). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nUse in patients with severe renal insufficiency or severe hepatic impairment. \n \nBreast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIvozall is a potent antineoplastic agent with potentially significant haematological and \nnon-haematological adverse reactions (see section 4.8).   \n \nThe following parameters should be closely monitored in patients undergoing treatment with \nclofarabine: \n\u2022 Complete blood and platelet counts should be obtained at regular intervals, more frequently in \n\npatients who develop cytopaenias. \n\u2022 Renal and hepatic function prior to, during active treatment and following therapy. Clofarabine \n\nshould be discontinued immediately if substantial increases in creatinine, liver enzymes and/or \nbilirubin are observed.  \n\n\u2022 Respiratory status, blood pressure, fluid balance and weight throughout and immediately after \nthe 5 day clofarabine administration period.  \n\n \nBlood and lymphatic disorders \nSuppression of bone marrow should be anticipated. This is usually reversible and appears to be \ndose-dependent. Severe bone marrow suppression, including neutropaenia, anaemia and \nthrombocytopaenia have been observed in patients treated with clofarabine. Haemorrhage, including \ncerebral, gastrointestinal and pulmonary haemorrhage, has been reported and may be fatal. The \nmajority of the cases were associated with thrombocytopaenia (see section 4.8).  \nIn addition, at initiation of treatment, most patients in the clinical studies had haematological \nimpairment as a manifestation of leukaemia. Because of the pre-existing immuno-compromised \ncondition of these patients and prolonged neutropaenia that can result from treatment with clofarabine, \npatients are at increased risk for severe opportunistic infections, including severe sepsis, with \npotentially fatal outcomes. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and \ntreated promptly. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nOccurrences of enterocolitis, including neutropaenic colitis, caecitis, and C. difficile colitis, have been \nreported during treatment with clofarabine. This has occurred more frequently within 30 days of \ntreatment, and in the setting of combination chemotherapy. Enterocolitis may lead to necrosis, \nperforation or sepsis complications and may be associated with fatal outcome (see section 4.8). \nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis.  \n \nSkin and subcutaneous disorders  \nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), including fatal cases, have \nbeen reported (see section 4.8). Clofarabine must be discontinued for exfoliative or bullous rash, or if \nSJS or TEN is suspected.  \n \nNeoplasms benign and malignant (including cysts and polyps) and Immune systems disorders \nAdministration of clofarabine results in a rapid reduction in peripheral leukaemia cells. Patients \nundergoing treatment with clofarabine should be evaluated and monitored for signs and symptoms of \ntumour lysis syndrome and cytokine release (e.g. tachypnoea, tachycardia, hypotension, pulmonary \noedema) that could develop into Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), capillary leak \nsyndrome and/or organ dysfunction (see section 4.8). \n\u2022 Prophylactic administration of allopurinol should be considered if hyperuricemia (tumour lysis) \n\nis expected.  \n\u2022 Patients should receive intravenous fluids throughout the 5 day clofarabine administration \n\nperiod to reduce the effects of tumour lysis and other events.  \n\u2022 The use of prophylactic steroids (e.g., 100 mg/m2 hydrocortisone on Days 1 through 3) may be \n\nof benefit in preventing signs or symptoms of SIRS or capillary leak.  \n \nClofarabine should be discontinued immediately if patients show early signs or symptoms of SIRS, \ncapillary leak syndrome or substantial organ dysfunction and appropriate supportive measures \ninstituted. In addition, clofarabine treatment should be discontinued if the patient develops \nhypotension for any reason during the 5 days of administration. Further treatment with clofarabine, \ngenerally at a lower dose, can be considered when patients are stabilised and organ function has \nreturned to baseline.  \n \nThe majority of patients who respond to clofarabine achieve a response after 1 or 2 treatment cycles \n(see section 5.1). Therefore, the potential benefit and risks associated with continued therapy in \npatients who do not show haematological and/or clinical improvement after 2 treatment cycles should \nbe assessed by the treating physician.  \n \nCardiac disorders \nPatients with cardiac disease and those taking medicinal products known to affect blood pressure or \ncardiac function should be closely monitored during treatment with clofarabine (see sections 4.5 and \n4.8).  \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nThere is no clinical study experience in paediatric patients with renal insufficiency (defined in clinical \nstudies as serum creatinine \u2265 2 x ULN for age) and clofarabine is predominately excreted via the \nkidneys. Pharmacokinetic data indicate that clofarabine may accumulate in patients with decreased \ncreatinine clearance (see section 5.2). Therefore, clofarabine should be used with caution in patients \nwith mild to moderate renal insufficiency (see section 4.2 for dose adjustments). The safety profile of \nclofarabine has not been established in patients with severe renal insufficiency or patients receiving \nrenal replacement therapy (see section 4.3). The concomitant use of medicinal products that have been \nassociated with renal toxicity and those eliminated by tubular secretion such as NSAIDs, amphotericin \nB, methotrexate, aminosides, organoplatines, foscarnet, pentamidine, cyclosporin, tacrolimus, \nacyclovir and valganciclovir, should be avoided particularly during the 5 day clofarabine \nadministration period; preference should be given to those medicinal products that are not known to be \nnephrotoxic (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). Renal failure or acute renal failure have been observed as a \nconsequence of infections, sepsis and tumour lysis syndrome (see section 4.8). Patients should be \nmonitored for renal toxicity and clofarabine should be discontinued as necessary.  \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nIt was observed that the frequency and severity of adverse reactions, in particular infection, \nmyelosuppression (neutropenia) and hepatotoxicity, are increased when clofarabine is used in in \ncombination. In this regard, patients should be closely monitored when clofarabine is used in \ncombined regimens. \n \nPatients receiving clofarabine may experience vomiting and diarrhoea; they should, therefore, be \nadvised regarding appropriate measures to avoid dehydration. Patients should be instructed to seek \nmedical advice if they experience symptoms of dizziness, fainting spells, or decreased urine output. \nProphylactic anti-emetic medicinal products should be considered.  \n \nHepato biliary disorders \nThere is no experience in patients with hepatic impairment (serum bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN plus AST \nand ALT > 5 x ULN) and the liver is a potential target organ for toxicity. Therefore, clofarabine \nshould be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and \n4.3). The concomitant use of medicinal products that have been associated with hepatic toxicity should \nbe avoided wherever possible (see sections 4.5 and 4.8).  \nIf a patient experiences a hematologic toxicity of Grade 4 neutropaenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/l) lasting \n\u2265  4 weeks, then the dose should be reduced by 25% for the next cycle.  \n \nAny patient who experiences a severe non-hematologic toxicity (US NCI CTC Grade 3 toxicity) on a \nthird occasion, a severe toxicity that does not recover within 14 days (excluding nausea/vomiting) or a \nlife-threatening or disabling non-infectious non-hematologic toxicity (US NCI CTC Grade 4 toxicity) \nshould be withdrawn from treatment with clofarabine (see section 4.2). \n \nPatients who have previously received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) may be at higher \nrisk for hepatotoxicity suggestive of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) following treatment with \nclofarabine (40 mg/m2) when used in combination with etoposide (100 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide \n(440 mg/m2). In the post-marketing period, following treatment with clofarabine, serious hepatotoxic \nadverse reactions of VOD in paediatric and adult patients have been associated with a fatal outcome. \nCases of hepatitis and hepatic failure, including fatal outcomes, have been reported with clofarabine \ntreatment (see section 4.8).  \n \nMost patients received conditioning regimens that included busulfan, melphalan, and/or the \ncombination of cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation. Severe hepatotoxic events have been \nreported in a Phase 1/2 combination study of clofarabine in paediatric patients with relapsed or \nrefractory acute leukaemia.  \n \nThere are currently limited data on the safety and efficacy of clofarabine when administered for more \nthan 3 treatment cycles.  \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach vial of Ivozall contains 70.77 mg of sodium. This is equivalent to 3.08 mmol (or 70.77 mg) of \nsodium which is equivalent to 3.53% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium \nfor an adult and should be taken into consideration for patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. However, there are no known clinically significant \ninteractions with other medicinal products or laboratory tests. \n \nClofarabine is not detectably metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. Therefore, \nit is unlikely to interact with active substances which inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In \naddition, clofarabine is unlikely to inhibit any of the major 5 human CYP isoforms (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, \n2D6 and 3A4) or to induce 2 of these isoforms (1A2 and 3A4) at the plasma concentrations achieved \nfollowing intravenous infusion of 52 mg/m2/day. As a result, it is not expected to affect the \nmetabolism of active substances which are known substrates for these enzymes. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nClofarabine is predominately excreted via the kidneys. Thus, the concomitant use of medicinal \nproducts that have been associated with renal toxicity and those eliminated by tubular secretion such \nas NSAIDs, amphotericin B, methotrexate, aminosides, organoplatines, foscarnet, pentamidine, \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus, acyclovir and valganciclovir, should be avoided particularly during the 5 day \nclofarabine administration period (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2). \n \nThe liver is a potential target organ for toxicity. Thus, the concomitant use of medicinal products that \nhave been associated with hepatic toxicity should be avoided wherever possible (see sections 4.4 and \n4.8).  \n \nPatients taking medicinal products known to affect blood pressure or cardiac function should be \nclosely monitored during treatment with clofarabine (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nContraception in males and females  \n \nFemales of childbearing potential and sexually active males must use effective methods of \ncontraception during treatment.  \n \nPregnancy  \n \nThere are no data on the use of clofarabine in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity including teratogenicity (see section 5.3). Clofarabine may cause serious birth \ndefects when administered during pregnancy. Therefore, Ivozall should not be used during pregnancy, \nespecially not during the first trimester, unless clearly necessary (i.e. only if the potential benefit to the \nmother outweighs the risk to the foetus). If a patient becomes pregnant during treatment with \nclofarabine, she should be informed of the possible hazard to the foetus.  \n \nBreast-feeding  \n \nIt is unknown whether clofarabine or its metabolites are excreted in human breast milk. The excretion \nof clofarabine in milk has not been studied in animals. However, because of the potential for serious \nadverse reactions in nursing infants, breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to, during and \nfollowing treatment with Ivozall (see section 4.3).  \n \nFertility  \n \nDose related toxicities on male reproductive organs have been observed in mice, rats and dogs, and \ntoxicities on female reproductive organs have been observed in mice (see section 5.3). As the effect of \nclofarabine treatment on human fertility is unknown, reproductive planning should be discussed with \npatients as appropriate. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects of clofarabine on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \nHowever, patients should be advised that they may experience undesirable effects such as dizziness, \nlight-headedness or fainting spells during treatment and told not to drive or operate machines in such \ncircumstances. \n \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n \nNearly all patients (98%) experienced at least one adverse event considered by the study investigator \nto be related to clofarabine. Those most frequently reported were nausea (61% of patients), vomiting \n(59%), febrile neutropaenia (35%), headache (24%), rash (21%), diarrhoea (20%), pruritus (20%), \npyrexia (19%), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (15%), fatigue (14%), anxiety (12%), \nmucosal inflammation (11%), and flushing (11%). Sixty-eight patients (59%) experienced at least one \nserious clofarabine-related adverse event. One patient discontinued treatment due to grade 4 \nhyperbilirubinaemia considered as related to clofarabine after receiving 52 mg/m2/day clofarabine. \nThree patients died of adverse events considered by the study investigator to be related to treatment \nwith clofarabine: one patient died from respiratory distress, hepatocellular damage, and capillary leak \nsyndrome; one patient from VRE sepsis and multi-organ failure; and one patient from septic shock and \nmulti-organ failure. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe information provided is based on data generated from clinical trials in which 115 patients (> 1 and \n\u2264 21 years old) with either ALL or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) received at least one dose of \nclofarabine at the recommended dose of 52 mg/m2 daily x 5.  \n \nAdverse reactions are listed by system organ class and frequency (very common (\u2265 1/10); common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100; rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and very rare \n(< 1/10,000)) in the table below. Adverse reactions reported during the post-marketing period are also \nincluded in the table under the frequency category \u201cnot known\u201d (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness.  \n \nPatients with advanced stages of ALL or AML may have confounding medical conditions that make \ncausality of adverse events difficult to assess due to the variety of symptoms related to the underlying \ndisease, its progression and the co-administration of numerous medicinal products. \n \n\nAdverse reactions considered to be related to clofarabine \nreported at frequencies \u2265 1/1,000 (i.e. in > 1/115 patients) in clinical trials  \n\nand post-marketing   \nInfections and infestations  Common: Septic shock*, sepsis, bacteraemia, \n\npneumonia, herpes zoster, herpes simplex, oral \ncandidiasis  \nFrequency not known: C. difficile colitis  \n\nNeoplasms benign and malignant  \n(including cysts and polyps)  \n\nCommon: Tumour lysis syndrome*  \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders  Very common: Febrile neutropenia   \nCommon: Neutropenia  \n\nImmune system disorders  Common: Hypersensitivity  \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders  Common: Anorexia, decreased appetite, dehydration  \n\nFrequency not known: Hyponatremia  \nPsychiatric disorders  Very common: Anxiety  \n\nCommon: Agitation, restlessness, mental status change  \nNervous system disorders  Very common: Headache  \n\nCommon: Somnolence, peripheral neuropathy, \nparaesthesia, dizziness, tremor   \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders  Common: Hypoacusis  \nCardiac disorders  Common: Pericardial effusion*, tachycardia*   \n\n\n\n9 \n\nVascular disorders  Very common: Flushing*  \nCommon: Hypotension*, capillary leak syndrome, \nhaematoma  \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders  \n\nCommon: Respiratory distress, epistaxis, dyspnoea, \ntachypnoea, cough   \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  Very common: Vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea  \nCommon: Mouth haemorrhage, gingival bleeding, \nhaematemesis, abdominal pain, stomatitis, upper \nabdominal pain, proctalgia, mouth ulceration   \nFrequency not known: Pancreatitis elevations in serum \namylase and lipase, enterocolitis, neutropenic colitis, \ncaecitis  \n\nHepato-biliary disorders  \n  \n\nCommon: Hyperbilirubinaemia, jaundice, veno-occlusive \ndisease, increases in alanine (ALT)* and aspartate \n(AST)* aminotransferases, hepatic failure  \nUncommon: Hepatitis   \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions   \n\nVery common: Fatigue, pyrexia, mucosal inflammation  \nCommon: Multi-organ failure, systemic inflammatory \nresponse syndrome*, pain, chills, irritability, oedema, \nperipheral oedema, feeling hot, feeling abnormal   \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  Very common: Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia \nsyndrome, pruritus  \nCommon: Maculo-papular rash, petechiae, erythema, \npruritic rash, skin exfoliation, generalised rash, alopecia,  \nskin hyperpigmentation, generalised erythema,  \nerythematous rash, dry skin, hyperhidrosis   \nFrequency not known: Stevens Johnson Syndrome  \n(SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)  \n\nMusculoskeletal, connective tissue and \nbone disorders  \n\nCommon: Pain in extremity, myalgia, bone pain, chest \nwall pain, arthralgia, neck and back pain  \n\nRenal and urinary disorders  Common: Haematuria*, renal failure, acute renal failure  \n\nInvestigations  Common: Weight decreased   \nInjury, poisoning and procedural \ncomplications  \n\nCommon: Contusion  \n\n* = see below  \n**All adverse reactions occurring at least twice (i.e., 2 or more reactions (1.7%)) are included in this \n\ntable \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders  \nThe most frequent haematological laboratory abnormalities observed in patients treated with \nclofarabine were anaemia (83.3%; 95/114); leucopaenia (87.7%; 100/114); lymphopaenia (82.3%; \n93/113), neutropaenia (63.7%; 72/113), and thrombocytopaenia (80.7%; 92/114).The majority of these \nevents were of grade \u2265 3.  \n \nDuring the post-marketing period prolonged cytopaenias (thrombocytopaenia, anaemia, neutropaenia \nand leukopaenia) and bone marrow failure have been reported. Bleeding events have been observed in \nthe setting of thrombocytopaenia. Haemorrhage, including cerebral, gastrointestinal and pulmonary \nhaemorrhage, has been reported and may be associated with a fatal outcome (see section 4.4).  \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nVascular disorders  \nSixty-four patients of 115 (55.7%) experienced at least one vascular disorders adverse reaction. \nTwenty-three patients out of 115 experienced a vascular disorder considered to be related to \nclofarabine, the most frequently reported being flushing (13 events; not serious) and hypotension (5 \nevents; all of which were considered to be serious; see section 4.4). However, the majority of these \nhypotensive events were reported in patients who had confounding severe infections.  \n \nCardiac disorders  \nFifty percent of patients experienced at least one cardiac disorders adverse reaction. Eleven events in \n115 patients were considered to be related to clofarabine, none of which were serious and the most \nfrequently reported cardiac disorder was tachycardia (35%) (see section 4.4); 6.1% (7/115) patient's \ntachycardia were considered to be related to clofarabine. Most of the cardiac adverse reactions were \nreported in the first 2 cycles.  \n \nPericardial effusion and pericarditis were reported as an adverse reaction in 9% (10/115) of patients. \nThree of these events were subsequently assessed as being related to clofarabine: pericardial effusion \n(2 events; 1 of which was serious) and pericarditis (1 event; not serious). In the majority of patients \n(8/10), the pericardial effusion and pericarditis were deemed to be asymptomatic and of little or no \nclinical significance on echocardiographic assessment. However, the pericardial effusion was \nclinically significant in 2 patients with some associated haemodynamic compromise.  \n \nInfections and infestations  \nForty-eight percent of patients had one or more ongoing infections prior to receiving treatment with \nclofarabine. A total of 83% of patients experienced at least 1 infection after clofarabine treatment, \nincluding fungal, viral and bacterial infections (see section 4.4). Twenty-one (18.3%) events were \nconsidered to be related to clofarabine of which catheter related infection (1 event), sepsis (2 events) \nand septic shock (2 events; 1 patient died (see above)) were considered to be serious.  \n \nDuring the post-marketing period, bacterial, fungal and viral infections have been reported and may be \nfatal. These infections may lead to septic shock, respiratory failure, renal failure, and/or multi-organ \nfailure.  \n \nRenal and urinary disorders  \nForty-one patients of 115 (35.7%) experienced at least one renal and urinary disorders adverse \nreaction. The most prevalent renal toxicity in paediatric patients was elevated creatinine. Grade 3 or 4 \nelevated creatinine occurred in 8% of patients. Nephrotoxic medicinal products, tumour lysis, and \ntumour lysis with hyperuricemia may contribute to renal toxicity (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \nHaematuria was observed in 13% of patients overall. Four renal adverse reactions in 115 patients were \nconsidered to be related to clofarabine, none of which were serious; haematuria (3 events) and acute \nrenal failure (1 event) (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  \n \nHepato-biliary disorders  \nThe liver is a potential target organ for clofarabine toxicity and 25.2% of patients experienced at least \none hepato-biliary disorders adverse reaction (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). Six events were considered to \nbe related to clofarabine of which acute cholecystitis (1 event), cholelithiasis (1 event), hepatocellular \ndamage (1 event; patient died (see above)) and hyperbilirubinaemia (1 event; the patient discontinued \ntherapy (see above)) were considered to be serious. Two paediatric reports (1.7%) of veno-occlusive \ndisease (VOD) were considered related to study drug.  \n \nVOD cases reported during the post-marketing period in paediatric and adult patients have been \nassociated with a fatal outcome (see section 4.4).  \n \nIn addition, 50/113 patients receiving clofarabine had at least severely (at least US NCI CTC Grade 3) \nelevated ALT, 36/100 elevated AST and 15/114 elevated bilirubin levels. The majority of elevations in \nALT and AST occurred within 10 days of clofarabine administration and returned to \u2264 grade 2 within \n15 days. Where follow-up data are available, the majority of bilirubin elevations returned to \u2264 grade 2 \nwithin 10 days.  \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \nSystemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or capillary leak syndrome  \nSIRS, capillary leak syndrome (signs and symptoms of cytokine release, e.g., tachypnea, tachycardia, \nhypotension, pulmonary oedema) were reported as an adverse reaction in 5% (6/115) of paediatric \npatients (5 ALL, 1 AML) (see section 4.4). Thirteen events of tumour lysis syndrome, capillary leak \nsyndrome or SIRS have been reported; SIRS (2 events; both were considered to be serious), capillary \nleak syndrome (4 events; 3 of which were considered serious and related) and tumour lysis syndrome \n(7 events; 6 of which were considered related and 3 of which were serious).  \n \nCapillary leak syndrome cases reported during the post-marketing period have been associated with a \nfatal outcome (See section 4.4).  \n \nGastrointestinal disorders  \nOccurrences of enterocolitis, including neutropaenic colitis, caecitis, and C. difficile colitis have been \nreported during treatment with clofarabine. Enterocolitis may lead to necrosis, perforation or sepsis \ncomplications and may be associated with fatal outcome (see section 4.4).  \n \nSkin and subcutaneous disorders  \nStevens - Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), including fatal cases, have \nbeen reported in patients who were receiving or had recently been treated with clofarabine. Other \nexfoliative conditions have also been reported. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms  \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. However, possible symptoms of overdose are expected to \ninclude nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and severe bone marrow suppression. To date, the highest daily \ndose administered to human beings is 70 mg/m2 for 5 consecutive days (2 paediatric ALL patients). \nThe toxicities observed in these patients included vomiting, hyperbilirubinaemia, elevated \ntransaminase levels and maculo-papular rash.  \n \nManagement  \n \nNo specific antidotal therapy exists. Immediate discontinuation of therapy, careful observation and \ninitiation of appropriate supportive measures are recommended. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, antimetabolites, purine analogues, ATC code: \nL01BB06. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nClofarabine is a purine nucleoside anti-metabolite. Its antitumour activity is believed to be due to \n3 mechanisms: \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n12 \n\n\u2022 DNA polymerase \u03b1 inhibition resulting in termination of DNA chain elongation and/or DNA \nsynthesis / repair.  \n\n\u2022 Ribonucleotide reductase inhibition with reduction of cellular deoxynucleotide triphosphate \n(dNTP) pools.  \n\n\u2022 Disruption of mitochondrial membrane integrity with the release of cytochrome C and other \nproapoptotic factors leading to programmed cell death even in non-dividing lymphocytes.  \n\n \nClofarabine must first diffuse or be transported into target cells where it is sequentially phosphorylated \nto the mono- and bi-phosphate by intracellular kinases, and then finally to the active conjugate, \nclofarabine 5\u2019-triphosphate. Clofarabine has high affinity for one of the activating phosphorylating \nenzymes, deoxycytidine kinase, which exceeds that of the natural substrate, deoxycytidine.  \n \nIn addition, clofarabine possesses greater resistance to cellular degradation by adenosine deaminase \nand decreased susceptibility to phosphorolytic cleavage than other active substances in its class whilst \nthe affinity of clofarabine triphosphate for DNA polymerase \u03b1 and ribonucleotide reductase is similar \nto or greater than that of deoxyadenosine triphosphate. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn vitro studies have demonstrated that clofarabine inhibits cell growth in and is cytotoxic to a variety \nof rapidly proliferating haematological and solid tumour cell lines. It was also active against quiescent \nlymphocytes and macrophages. In addition, clofarabine delayed tumour growth and, in some cases, \ncaused tumour regression in an assortment of human and murine tumour xenografts implanted in mice. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nClinical efficacy: To enable systematic evaluation of the responses seen in patients, an unblinded \nIndependent Response Review Panel (IRRP) determined the following response rates based on \ndefinitions produced by the Children\u2019s Oncology Group: \n \n\nCR = Complete remission  Patients who met each of the following criteria:  \n\u2022 No evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary \n\ndisease  \n\u2022 An M1 bone marrow (\u2264 5% blasts)  \n\u2022 Recovery of peripheral counts (platelets \u2265 100 x 109/l \n\nand ANC \u2265 1.0 x 109/l)  \nCRp = Complete remission in the \nAbsence of Total Platelet Recovery  \n\n\u2022 Patients who met all of the criteria for a CR except for \nrecovery of platelet counts to > 100 x 109/l  \n\nPR = Partial remission  Patients who met each of the following criteria:  \n\u2022 Complete disappearance of circulating blasts  \n\u2022 An M2 bone marrow (\u2265 5% and \u2264 25% blasts) and \n\nappearance of normal progenitor cells  \n\u2022 An M1 marrow that did not qualify for CR or CRp  \n\nOverall remission (OR) Rate  \u2022 - (Number of patients with a CR + Number of patients \nwith a CRp) \u00f7 Number of eligible patients who \nreceived clofarabine  \n\n \nThe safety and efficacy of clofarabine were evaluated in a phase I, open-label, non-comparative, dose-\nescalation study in 25 paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory leukaemia (17 ALL; 8 AML) who \nhad failed standard therapy or for whom no other therapy existed. Dosing commenced at 11.25 with \nescalation to 15, 30, 40, 52 and 70 mg/m2/day by intravenous infusion for 5 days every 2 to 6 weeks \ndepending on toxicity and response. Nine of 17 ALL patients were treated with clofarabine \n52 mg/m2/day. Of the 17 ALL patients, 2 achieved a complete remission (12%; CR) and 2 a partial \n\n\n\n13 \n\nremission (12%; PR) at varying doses. Dose-limiting toxicities in this study were hyperbilirubinaemia, \nelevated transaminase levels and maculo-papular rash experienced at 70 mg/m2/day (2 ALL patients; \nsee section 4.9). \n \nA multi-centre, phase II, open-label, non-comparative study of clofarabine was conducted to \ndetermine the overall remission (OR) rate in heavily pretreated patients (\u2264 21 years old at initial \ndiagnosis) with relapsed or refractory ALL defined using the French-American-British classification. \nThe maximum tolerated dose identified in the phase I study described above of 52 mg/m2/day \nclofarabine was administered by intravenous infusion for 5 consecutive days every 2 to 6 weeks. The \ntable below summarises the key efficacy results for this study.  \n \nPatients with ALL must not have been eligible for therapy of higher curative potential and must have \nbeen in second or subsequent relapse and/or refractory i.e. failed to achieve remission after at least two \nprior regimens. Before enrolling in the trial, 58 of the 61 patients (95%) had received 2 to 4 different \ninduction regimens and 18/61 (30%) of these patients had undergone at least 1 prior haematological \nstem cell transplant (HSCT). The median age of treated patients (37 males, 24 females) was 12 years \nold.  \n \nAdministration of clofarabine resulted in a dramatic and rapid reduction in peripheral leukaemia cells \nin 31 of the 33 patients (94%) who had a measurable absolute blast count at baseline. The 12 patients \nwho achieved an overall remission (CR + CRp) had a median survival time of 66.6 weeks as of the \ndata collection cut-off date. Responses were seen in different immunophenotypes of ALL, including \npre-B cell and T-cell. Although transplantation rate was not a study endpoint, 10/61 patients (16%) \nwent on to receive a HSCT after treatment with clofarabine (3 after achieving a CR, 2 after a CRp, 3 \nafter a PR, 1 patient that was considered a treatment failure by the IRRP and 1 that was considered not \nevaluable by the IRRP). Response durations are confounded in patients who received a HSCT. \n \n\nEfficacy results from the pivotal study in patients (\u2264 21 years old at initial diagnosis) with \nrelapsed or refractory ALL after at least two prior regimens  \n\nResponse \ncategory  \n\nITT*  \npatients  \n(n = 61)  \n\nMedian duration \nof remission  \n\n(weeks)  \n(95% CI)  \n\nMedian time to \nprogression  \n(weeks)**  \n(95% CI)  \n\nMedian overall \nsurvival (weeks)  \n\n(95% CI)  \n\nOverall \nremission (CR \n+ CRp)  \n\n12  \n(20%)  \n\n32.0  \n(9.7 to 47.9)  \n\n38.2  \n(15.4 to 56.1)  \n\n69.5  \n(58.6 to -)  \n\nCR  7  \n(12%)  \n\n47.9  \n(6.1 to -)  \n\n56.1  \n(13.7 to -)  \n\n72.4  \n(66.6 to -)  \n\nCRp  5  \n(8%)  \n\n28.6  \n(4.6 to 38.3)  \n\n37.0  \n(9.1 to 42)  \n\n53.7  \n(9.1 to -)  \n\nPR  6  \n(10%)  \n\n11.0  \n(5.0 to -)  \n\n14.4  \n(7.0 to -)  \n\n33.0  \n(18.1 to -)  \n\nCR + CRp + PR  18  \n(30%)  \n\n21.5  \n(7.6 to 47.9)  \n\n28.7  \n(13.7 to 56.1)  \n\n66.6  \n(42.0 to -)  \n\nTreatment \nfailure  \n\n33  \n(54%)  \n\nN/A    \n4.0  \n\n(3.4 to 5.1)  \n\n  \n7.6  \n\n(6.7 to 12.6)  Not evaluable  10  \n(16%)  \n\nN/A  \n\nAll patients  61  \n(100%)  \n\nN/A  5.4  \n(4.0 to 6.1)  \n\n12.9  \n(7.9 to 18.1)  \n\n\n\n14 \n\n*ITT = intention to treat.  \n**Patients alive and in remission at the time of last follow up were censored at that time point for \nthe analysis.  \n\n \nIndividual duration remission and survival data for patients who achieved CR or CRp   \n\n \n\nBest Response  \nTime to OR  \n(weeks)  \n\nDuration of  \nRemission  \n(weeks)  \n\nOverall  \nSurvival  \n(weeks)  \n\nPatients who did not undergo transplant  \nCR  5.7  4.3  66.6  \nCR  14.3  6.1  58.6  \nCR  8.3  47.9  66.6  \nCRp  4.6  4.6  9.1  \nCR  3.3  58.6  72.4  \nCRp  3.7  11.7  53.7  \nPatients who underwent transplant while in continued \nremission*  \nCRp  8.4  11.6+  145.1+  \nCR  4.1  9.0+  111.9+   \nCRp  3.7  5.6+  42.0  \nCR  7.6  3.7+  96.3+   \nPatients who underwent transplant after alternative therapy or \nrelapse*  \nCRp  4.0  35.4  113.3+**  \nCR  4.0  9.7  89.4***  \n\n* Duration of remission censored at the time of transplant  \n** Patient received a transplant following alternate therapy \n*** Patient received a transplant following relapse  \n\n \nThe reference medicinal product containing clofarabine has been authorised under \u2018exceptional \ncircumstances\u2019.

The patients were enrolled into a single phase I (n = 12) or two \nphase II (n = 14 / n = 14) safety and efficacy studies, and received multiple doses of clofarabine by \nintravenous infusion (see section 5.1). \n \n\nPharmacokinetics in patients aged between 2 to 19 years old with relapsed or refractory \nALL or AML following administration of multiple doses of clofarabine by intravenous  \n\ninfusion  \n\n\n\n15 \n\nParameter  Estimates based on non-\ncompartmental analysis  \n\n(n = 14 / n = 14)  \n\nEstimates based on other \nanalysis  \n\nDistribution:  \nVolume of distribution (steady \nstate)  \n\n172 l/m2    \n\nPlasma protein binding    47.1%  \nSerum albumin    27.0%  \nElimination:  \n\u03b2 half-life of clofarabine  5.2 hours    \nHalf-life of clofarabine \ntriphosphate  \n\n  > 24 hours  \n\nSystemic clearance  28.8 l/h/m2    \nRenal clearance  10.8 l/h/m2    \nDose excreted in urine  57%    \n\n \nMultivariate analysis showed that the pharmacokinetics of clofarabine are weight dependent and \nalthough white blood cell (WBC) count was identified as having an impact on clofarabine \npharmacokinetics, this did not appear sufficient to individualise a patient\u2019s dosage regimen based on \ntheir WBC count. Intravenous infusion of 52 mg/m2 clofarabine produced equivalent exposure across a \nwide range of weights. However, Cmax is inversely proportional to patient weight and, therefore, small \nchildren may have a higher Cmax at the end of infusion than a typical 40 kg child given the same dose \nof clofarabine per m2. Accordingly, longer infusion times should be considered in children weighing \n< 20 kg (see section 4.2). \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \n \nClofarabine is eliminated by a combination of renal and non-renal excretion. After 24 hours, about \n60% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Clofarabine clearance rates appear to be much \nhigher than glomerular filtration rates suggesting filtration and tubular secretion as kidney elimination \nmechanisms. However, as clofarabine is not detectably metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) \nenzyme system, pathways of non-renal elimination currently remain unknown. \n \nNo apparent difference in pharmacokinetics was observed between patients with ALL or AML, or \nbetween males and females.  \n \nNo relationship between clofarabine or clofarabine triphosphate exposure and either efficacy or \ntoxicity has been established in this population. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAdults (> 21 and < 65 years old)  \nThere are currently insufficient data to establish the safety and efficacy of clofarabine in adult patients. \nHowever, the pharmacokinetics of clofarabine in adults with relapsed or refractory AML following \nadministration of a single dose of 40 mg/m2 clofarabine by intravenous infusion over 1 hour were \ncomparable to those described above in patients aged between 2 to 19 years old with relapsed or \nrefractory ALL or AML following administration of 52 mg/m2 clofarabine by intravenous infusion \nover 2 hours for 5 consecutive days. \n \n \n \nElderly (\u2265 65 years old)  \nThere are currently insufficient data to establish the safety and efficacy of clofarabine in patients \n65 years of age or older.  \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nRenal impairment  \nTo date, there are limited data on the pharmacokinetics of clofarabine in paediatric patients with \ndecreased creatinine clearance. However, these data indicate that clofarabine may accumulate in such \npatients (see figure below).  \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic data from adult and paediatric patients suggest that patients with stable \nmoderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 \u2013 < 60 ml/min) receiving a 50% dose reduction \nachieve similar clofarabine exposure to those with normal renal function receiving a standard dose. \n \n\nClofarabine AUC0-24 hours by baseline estimated creatinine clearance in patients aged between  \n2 to 19 years old with relapsed or refractory ALL or AML (n = 11 / n = 12) following \n\nadministration of multiple doses of clofarabine by intravenous infusion  \n(creatinine clearance estimated using Schwartz formula)  \n\n \n \n\nEstimated creatinine clearance (ml/min) \n\n \nHepatic impairment  \nThere is no experience in patients with hepatic impairment (serum bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN plus AST \nand ALT > 5 x ULN) and the liver is a potential target organ for toxicity (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nToxicology studies of clofarabine in mice, rats and dogs showed that rapidly proliferating tissues were \nthe primary target organs of toxicity.  \n \nCardiac effects were observed in rats consistent with cardiomyopathy and contributed to signs of \ncardiac failure after repeated cycles of treatment. The incidence of these toxicities was dependent on \nboth the dose of clofarabine administered and the duration of treatment. They were reported at \nexposure levels (Cmax) approximately 7 to 13 fold (after 3 or more dosing cycles) or 16 to 35 fold (after \none or more dosing cycles) higher than clinical exposures. The minimal effects seen at lower doses \nsuggest that there is a threshold for toxicities on the heart and nonlinear plasma pharmacokinetics in \nthe rat may play a role in the observed effects. The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n \nGlomerulonephropathy was reported in rats at exposure levels 3 to 5 fold higher than the clinical AUC \nafter 6 dosing cycles of clofarabine. It was characterised by minor thickening of the glomerular \nbasement membrane with only slight tubular damage and was not associated with changes in serum \nchemistry.  \n \nHepatic effects were observed in rats following chronic administration of clofarabine. These likely \nrepresent the superimposition of degenerative and regenerative changes as a result of treatment cycles, \nand were not associated with changes in serum chemistry. Histological evidence of hepatic effects was \n\n\n\n17 \n\nseen in dogs following acute administration of high doses, but was also not accompanied by changes \nin serum chemistry.  \n \nDose related toxicities on male reproductive organs were observed in mice, rats and dogs. These \neffects included bilateral degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium with retained spermatids and \natrophy of interstitial cells in rats at exaggerated exposure levels (150 mg/m2/day), and cell \ndegeneration of the epididymis and degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium in dogs at clinically \nrelevant exposure levels (\u2265 7.5 mg/m2/day clofarabine).  \n \nDelayed ovarian atrophy or degeneration and uterine mucosal apoptosis were observed in female mice \nat the only dose used of 225 mg/m2/day clofarabine.  \n \nClofarabine was teratogenic in rats and rabbits. Increases in postimplantation loss, reduced foetal body \nweights and decreased litter sizes together with increases in the number of malformations (gross \nexternal, soft tissue) and skeletal alterations (including retarded ossification) were reported in rats \nreceiving doses which produced approximately 2 to 3 fold the clinical exposure (54 mg/m2/day) and in \nrabbits receiving 12 mg/m2/day clofarabine. (There are no exposure data in rabbits.) The threshold for \ndevelopmental toxicity was considered to be 6 mg/m2/day in rats and 1.2 mg/m2/day in rabbits. The \nno-observable effect level for maternal toxicity in rats was 18 mg/m2/day and in rabbits was more than \n12 mg/m2/day. No fertility studies have been conducted. \n \nGenotoxicity studies demonstrated that clofarabine was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse \nmutation assay, but did induce clastogenic effects in the non-activated chromosomal aberration assay \nin Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells and in the in vivo rat micronucleus assay.  \n \nNo carcinogenicity studies have been performed. \n \n \n6.

What Ivozall is and what it is used for \n \nIvozall contains the active substance clofarabine. Clofarabine is one of a family of medicines called \nanticancer medicines. It works by hindering the growth of abnormal white blood cells, and eventually \nkills them. It works best against cells which are multiplying quickly \u2013 such as cancer cells.  \n \nIvozall is used to treat children (\u2265 1 year old), teenagers and young adults up to 21 years old with \nacute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) when previous treatments have not worked or have stopped \nworking. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is caused by abnormal growth of some types of white blood \ncells.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Ivozall \n \nDo not use Ivozall \n- - if you are allergic to clofarabine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6);  \n- if you are breast-feeding (please read the section \u201cPregnancy and breast-feeding\u201d below); \n- if you have severe kidney or liver problems.  \n \nTell your doctor if any of these conditions apply to you. If you are the parent of a child who is \nbeing treated with Ivozall, tell the doctor if any of them apply to your child.  \n \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTell your doctor if any of these apply to you. Ivozall may not be suitable for you:  \n-  if you have suffered a severe reaction after previously using this medicine;  \n-  if you have kidney disease, or used to have it;  \n-  if you have liver disease, or used to have it;  \n-  if you have heart disease, or used to have it.  \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nTell your doctor or carer immediately if you experience any of the following as you may need to \nstop treatment:  \n- if you get a fever or high temperature \u2013 because clofarabine reduces the number of blood cells \n\nmade in the bone marrow, you may be more likely to catch infections;  \n- if you have breathing difficulties, rapid breathing, or breathlessness;  \n- if you feel a change in your heart rate;  \n- if you suffer from dizziness (light-headedness) or fainting \u2013 it may be a symptom of low blood \n\npressure;  \n- if you feel sick or have diarrhoea (loose bowels);  \n- if your urine is darker than usual \u2013 it is important to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration;  \n- if you get a rash with blisters or mouth ulcers;  \n- if you lose your appetite, have nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, diarrhea, dark-colored urine and \n\nlight-coloured stools, stomach pain, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), or if you feel \ngenerally unwell, these could be symptoms of an inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), or liver \ndamage (hepatic failure);  \n\n- if you pass little or no urine, or experience drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, breathlessness, loss of \nappetite and / or weakness (these may be signs of acute kidney failure / kidney failure).   \n\n \nIf you are the parent of a child who is being treated with Ivozall, tell the doctor if any of the above \nconditions apply to your child.  \n \nDuring treatment with Ivozall, your doctor will carry out regular blood tests and other tests to \nmonitor your health. Because of the way this medicine works, it will affect your blood and other \norgans.  \n \nTalk to your doctor about contraception. Young men and women must use effective contraception \nduring and after treatment. See the section \u2018Pregnancy and breast-feeding\u2019 below. Ivozall may harm \nboth male and female reproductive organs.

The reference medicine for Ivozall has been authorised under \n\u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019. This means that because of the rarity of this disease it has been \nimpossible to get complete information on the reference medicine. \nThe European Medicines Agency will review any new information on the reference medicine every \nyear and any updates for the reference medicine will also be included as appropriate in the information \nfor Ivozall, such as this leaflet. \n \n \nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu. There are also links to other websites about rare diseases and treatments.  \n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n \nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: \n \nIvozall 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion must be diluted prior to administration. It \nshould be filtered through a sterile 0.2 micrometre syringe filter (the use of hydrophilic PVDF \nsyringe filter is recommended) ) and then diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) intravenous \ninfusion to produce a total volume according to the examples given in the table below. However, \nthe final dilution volume may vary depending on the patient\u2019s clinical status and physician \ndiscretion.  \n \nSuggested dilution schedule based on the recommended dosage of 52 mg/m2/day \nclofarabine \nBody surface area (m2)  Concentrate (ml)*  Total diluted volume  \n\u2264 1.44  \u2264 74.9            100 ml  \n1.45 to 2.40  75.4 to 124.8  150 ml  \n2.41 to 2.50  125.3 to 130.0  200 ml  \n*Each ml of concentrate contains 1 mg of clofarabine. Each 20 ml vial contains 20 mg of \nclofarabine. Therefore, for patients with a body surface area \u2264 0.38 m2, the partial contents of a \nsingle vial will be required to produce the recommended daily dosage of clofarabine. However, \nfor patients with a body surface area > 0.38 m2, the contents of between 1 to 7 vials will be \nrequired to produce the recommended daily dosage of clofarabine.  \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \nThe diluted concentrate should be a clear, colourless solution. It should be visually inspected for \nparticulate matter and discolouration prior to administration.  \n \nStorage at low temperatures, i.e. below 15\u00b0C, might lead to formation of particles, which can be \nredissolved by letting the vial warm to room temperature and gentle swirling until all visible \nparticles have dissolved.  \n \nInstructions for handling  \nProcedures for proper handling of antineoplastic agents should be observed. Cytotoxic medicinal \nproducts should be handled with caution.  \n \nThe use of disposable gloves and protective garments is recommended when handling clofarabine. \nIf the product comes into contact with eyes, skin or mucous membranes, rinse immediately with \ncopious amounts of water.  \nIvozall should not be handled by pregnant women.   \n \nDisposal  \nIvozall is for single use only.
