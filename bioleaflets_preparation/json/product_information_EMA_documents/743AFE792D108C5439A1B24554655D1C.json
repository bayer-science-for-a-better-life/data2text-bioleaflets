This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nLivogiva 20 micrograms/80 microliters solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach dose of 80 microliters contains 20 micrograms of teriparatide*.  \nEach pre-filled pen of 2.7 mL contains 675 micrograms of teriparatide (corresponding to \n250 micrograms per mL). \n \n*Teriparatide, rhPTH(1-34), produced in P. fluorescens, using recombinant DNA technology, is \nidentical to the 34 N-terminal amino acid sequence of endogenous human parathyroid hormone.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection.  \n \nColourless, clear solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nLivogiva is indicated in adults.  \n \nTreatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fracture (see \nsection 5.1). In postmenopausal women, a significant reduction in the incidence of vertebral and non-\nvertebral fractures but not hip fractures have been demonstrated.  \n \nTreatment of osteoporosis associated with sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy in women and \nmen at increased risk for fracture (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of Livogiva is 20 micrograms administered once daily.  \n \nThe maximum total duration of treatment with Livogiva should be 24 months (see section 4.4).  \nThe 24-month course of Livogiva should not be repeated over a patient’s lifetime.  \n \nPatients should receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D supplements if dietary intake is \ninadequate.  \n \nFollowing cessation of Livogiva therapy, patients may be continued on other osteoporosis therapies. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nSpecial populations  \n \nElderly patients  \nDose adjustment based on age is not required (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment  \nTeriparatide must not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.3). In patients \nwith moderate renal impairment, teriparatide should be used with caution (see section 4.4). No special \ncaution is required for patients with mild renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment  \nNo data are available in patients with impaired hepatic function (see section 5.3). Therefore, \nteriparatide should be used with caution. \n \nPaediatric population and young adults with open epiphyses  \nThe safety and efficacy of teriparatide in children and adolescents less than 18 years have not been \nestablished. Teriparatide should not be used in paediatric patients (less than 18 years), or young adults \nwith open epiphyses.  \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nLivogiva should be administered once daily by subcutaneous injection in the thigh or abdomen.  \n \nPatients must be trained to use the proper injection techniques (see section 6.6).  \nPlease also refer to the user manual for instructions on the correct use of the pen. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n• Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see sections 4.4 and 4.6)  \n• Pre-existing hypercalcaemia  \n• Severe renal impairment  \n• Metabolic bone diseases (including hyperparathyroidism and Paget’s disease of the bone) other \n\nthan primary osteoporosis or glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.  \n• Unexplained elevations of alkaline phosphatase  \n• Prior external beam or implant radiation therapy to the skeleton  \n• Patients with skeletal malignancies or bone metastases should be excluded from treatment with \n\nteriparatide.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nSerum and urine calcium  \n \nIn normocalcaemic patients, slight and transient elevations of serum calcium concentrations have been \nobserved following teriparatide injection. Serum calcium concentrations reach a maximum between 4 \nand 6 hours and return to baseline by 16 to 24 hours after each dose of teriparatide. Therefore, if blood \nsamples for serum calcium measurements are taken, this should be done at least 16 hours after the \nmost recent Livogiva injection. Routine calcium monitoring during therapy is not required.  \n \nTeriparatide may cause small increases in urinary calcium excretion, but the incidence of \nhypercalciuria did not differ from that in the placebo-treated patients in clinical trials. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nUrolithiasis  \n \nTeriparatide has not been studied in patients with active urolithiasis. Livogiva should be used with \ncaution in patients with active or recent urolithiasis because of the potential to exacerbate this \ncondition. \n \nOrthostatic hypotension  \n \nIn short-term clinical studies with teriparatide, isolated episodes of transient orthostatic hypotension \nwere observed. Typically, an event began within 4 hours of dosing and spontaneously resolved within \na few minutes to a few hours. When transient orthostatic hypotension occurred, it happened within the \nfirst several doses, was relieved by placing subjects in a reclining position, and did not preclude \ncontinued treatment. \n \nRenal impairment  \n \nCaution should be exercised in patients with moderate renal impairment (see section 4.2).  \n \nYounger adult population  \n \nExperience in the younger adult population, including premenopausal women, is limited (see \nsection 5.1). Treatment should only be initiated if the benefit clearly outweighs risks in this \npopulation.  \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective methods of contraception during use of \nLivogiva. If pregnancy occurs, Livogiva should be discontinued.  \n \nDuration of treatment \n  \nStudies in rats indicate an increased incidence of osteosarcoma with long-term administration of \nteriparatide (see section 5.3). Until further clinical data become available, the recommended treatment \ntime of 24 months should not be exceeded. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn a study of 15 healthy subjects administered digoxin daily to steady state, a single teriparatide dose \ndid not alter the cardiac effect of digoxin. However, sporadic case reports have suggested that \nhypercalcaemia may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity. Because teriparatide transiently increases \nserum calcium, Livogiva should be used with caution in patients taking digitalis.  \n \nTeriparatide has been evaluated in pharmacodynamic interaction studies with hydrochlorothiazide. No \nclinically significant interactions were noted.  \n \nCo-administration of raloxifene or hormone replacement therapy with teriparatide did not alter the \neffects of teriparatide on serum or urine calcium or on clinical adverse events. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in females  \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective methods of contraception during use of \nLivogiva. If pregnancy occurs, Livogiva should be discontinued.  \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nPregnancy  \n \nLivogiva is contraindicated for use during pregnancy (see section 4.3).  \n \nBreast-feeding  \n \nLivogiva is contraindicated for use during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). It is not known whether \nteriparatide is excreted in human milk.  \n \nFertility  \n \nStudies in rabbits have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The effect of teriparatide on \nhuman foetal development has not been studied. The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nLivogiva has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Transient, orthostatic \nhypotension or dizziness was observed in some patients. These patients should refrain from driving or \nthe use of machines until symptoms have subsided. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients treated with teriparatide are nausea, pain in \nlimb, headache and dizziness.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nOf patients in the teriparatide trials, 82.8% of the teriparatide patients and 84.5% of the placebo \npatients reported at least 1 adverse event.  \n \nThe adverse reactions associated with the use of teriparatide in osteoporosis clinical trials and post-\nmarketing exposure are summarised in the table below.  \n \nThe following convention has been used for the classification of the adverse reactions: very common \n(≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), \nvery rare (<1/10,000). \n \nTable 1.

In clinical trials, 2.8% of teriparatide patients \nhad serum uric acid concentrations above the upper limit of normal compared with 0.7% of placebo \npatients. However, the hyperuricemia did not result in an increase in gout, arthralgia, or urolithiasis.  \n \nAnti-drug antibodies were observed in line with other teriparatide containing medicinal products. \nThere was no evidence of hypersensitivity reactions, allergic reactions, effects on serum calcium, or \neffects on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) response.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSigns and symptoms  \n \nTeriparatide has been administered in single doses of up to 100 micrograms and in repeated doses of \nup to 60 micrograms/day for 6 weeks.  \n \nThe effects of overdose that might be expected include delayed hypercalcaemia and risk of orthostatic \nhypotension. Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache can also occur.  \n \nOverdose experience based on post-marketing spontaneous reports  \n \nIn post-marketing spontaneous reports, there have been cases of medicinal product error where the \nentire contents (up to 800 mcg) of the teriparatide pen have been administered as a single dose. \nTransient events reported have included nausea, weakness/lethargy and hypotension. In some cases, \nno adverse events occurred as a result of the overdose. No fatalities associated with overdose have \nbeen reported.  \n \nOverdose management  \n \nThere is no specific antidote for teriparatide. Treatment of suspected overdose should include \ntransitory discontinuation of Livogiva, monitoring of serum calcium, and implementation of \nappropriate supportive measures, such as hydration. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Calcium homeostasis, parathyroid hormones and analogues, ATC code: \nH05AA02. \n \nLivogiva is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website \nof the European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nEndogenous 84-amino-acid parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the primary regulator of calcium and \nphosphate metabolism in bone and kidney. Teriparatide (rhPTH(1-34)) is the active fragment (1-34) of \nendogenous human parathyroid hormone. Physiological actions of PTH include stimulation of bone \nformation by direct effects on bone forming cells (osteoblasts) indirectly increasing the intestinal \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\nabsorption of calcium and increasing the tubular re-absorption of calcium and excretion of phosphate \nby the kidney.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nTeriparatide is a bone formation agent to treat osteoporosis. The skeletal effects of teriparatide depend \nupon the pattern of systemic exposure. Once-daily administration of teriparatide increases apposition \nof new bone on trabecular and cortical bone surfaces by preferential stimulation of osteoblastic \nactivity over osteoclastic activity. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nRisk factors  \n \nIndependent risk factors, for example, low BMD, age, the existence of previous fracture, family \nhistory of hip fractures, high bone turnover and low body mass index should be considered in order to \nidentify women and men at increased risk of osteoporotic fractures who could benefit from treatment.  \n \nPremenopausal women with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis should be considered at high risk for \nfracture if they have a prevalent fracture or a combination of risk factors that place them at high risk \nfor fracture (e.g., low bone density [e.g., T score ≤−2], sustained high dose glucocorticoid therapy \n[e.g., ≥7.5 mg/day for at least 6 months], high underlying disease activity, low sex steroid levels).  \n \nPostmenopausal osteoporosis  \n \nThe pivotal study included 1,637 postmenopausal women (mean age 69.5 years). At baseline, ninety \npercent of the patients had one or more vertebral fractures, and on average, vertebral BMD was \n0.82 g/cm2 (equivalent to a T score = - 2.6). All patients were offered 1,000 mg calcium per day and at \nleast 400 IU vitamin D per day. Results from up to 24 months (median: 19 months) treatment with \nteriparatide demonstrate statistically significant fracture reduction (Table 1). To prevent one or more \nnew vertebral fractures, 11 women had to be treated for a median of 19 months. \n \nTable 2.

The primary objective of the study \n\n\n\n9 \n\nwas to collect safety data of teriparatide. During this observational period, other osteoporosis \ntreatments were allowed and additional assessment of vertebral fractures was performed.  \n \nDuring a median of 18 months following discontinuation of teriparatide, there was a 41% reduction \n(p=0.004) compared with placebo in the number of patients with a minimum of one new vertebral \nfracture.  \n \nIn an open-label study, 503 postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis and a fragility fracture \nwithin the previous 3 years (83% had received previous osteoporosis therapy) were treated with \nteriparatide for up to 24 months. At 24 months, the mean increase from baseline in lumbar spine, total \nhip and femoral neck BMD was 10.5%, 2.6% and 3.9% respectively. The mean increase in BMD from \n18 to 24 months was 1.4%, 1.2%, and 1.6% at the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck, \nrespectively. \n \nA 24-month, randomised, double-blind, comparator-controlled Phase 4 study included 1,360 \npostmenopausal women with established osteoporosis. 680 subjects were randomised to teriparatide \nand 680 subjects were randomised to oral risedronate 35 mg/week. At baseline, the women had a mean \nage of 72.1 years and a median of 2 prevalent vertebral fractures; 57.9% of patients had received \nprevious bisphosphonate therapy and 18.8% took concomitant glucocorticoids during the study. 1,013 \n(74.5%) patients completed the 24-month follow-up. The mean (median) cumulative dose of \nglucocorticoid was 474.3 (66.2) mg in the teriparatide arm and 898.0 (100.0) mg in the risedronate \narm. The mean (median) vitamin D intake for the teriparatide arm was 1,433 IU/day (1,400 IU/day) \nand for the risedronate arm was 1,191 IU/day (900 IU/day). For those subjects who had baseline and \nfollow-up spine radiographs, the incidence of new vertebral fractures was 28/516 (5.4%) in \nteriparatide- and 64/533 (12.0%) in risedronate-treated patients, relative risk (95% CI) = 0.44 (0.29-\n0.68), P<0.0001. The cumulative incidence of pooled clinical fractures (clinical vertebral and non-\nvertebral fractures) was 4.8% in teriparatide and 9.8% in risedronate-treated patients, hazard ratio \n(95% CI) = 0.48 (0.32-0.74), P=0.0009 \n \nMale osteoporosis  \n \n437 patients (mean age 58.7 years) were enrolled in a clinical trial for men with hypogonadal (defined \nas low morning free testosterone or an elevated FSH or LH) or idiopathic osteoporosis. Baseline spinal \nand femoral neck bone mineral density mean T-scores were -2.2 and -2.1, respectively. At baseline, \n35% of patients had a vertebral fracture and 59% had a non-vertebral fracture.  \n \nAll patients were offered 1,000 mg calcium per day and at least 400 IU vitamin D per day. Lumbar \nspine BMD significantly increased by 3 months. After 12 months, BMD had increased in the lumbar \nspine and total hip by 5% and 1%, respectively, compared with placebo. However, no significant \neffect on fracture rates was demonstrated. \n \nGlucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis  \n \nThe efficacy of teriparatide in men and women (N=428) receiving sustained systemic glucocorticoid \ntherapy (equivalent to 5 mg or greater of prednisone for at least 3 months) was demonstrated in the 18-\nmonth primary phase of a 36 month, randomised, double-blind, comparator-controlled study \n(alendronate 10 mg/day). Twenty-eight percent of patients had one or more radiographic vertebral \nfractures at baseline. All patients were offered 1,000 mg calcium per day and 800 IU vitamin D per \nday.  \nThis study included postmenopausal women (N=277), premenopausal women (N=67), and men \n(N=83). At baseline, the postmenopausal women had a mean age of 61 years, mean lumbar spine \nBMD T score of −2.7, median prednisone equivalent dose of 7.5 mg/day, and 34% had one or more \nradiographic vertebral fractures; premenopausal women had a mean age of 37 years, mean lumbar \nspine BMD T score of −2.5, median prednisone equivalent dose of 10 mg/day, and 9% had one or \nmore radiographic vertebral fractures; and men had a mean age of 57 years, mean lumbar spine BMD \nT score of −2.2, median prednisone equivalent dose of 10 mg/day, and 24% had one or more \nradiographic vertebral fractures.  \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nSixty-nine percent of patients completed the 18-month primary phase. At the 18-month endpoint, \nteriparatide significantly increased lumbar spine BMD (7.2%) compared with alendronate (3.4%) \n(p<0.001). Teriparatide increased BMD at the total hip (3.6%) compared with alendronate (2.2%) \n(p<0.01), as well as at the femoral neck (3.7%) compared with alendronate (2.1%) (p<0.05). In \npatients treated with teriparatide, lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck BMD increased between 18 \nand 24 months by an additional 1.7%, 0.9%, and 0.4%, respectively. \n \nAt 36 months, analysis of spinal X-rays from 169 alendronate patients and 173 teriparatide patients \nshowed that 13 patients in the alendronate group (7.7%) had experienced a new vertebral fracture \ncompared with 3 patients in the teriparatide group (1.7%) (p=0.01). In addition, 15 of 214 patients in \nthe alendronate group (7.0%) had experienced a non-vertebral fracture compared with 16 of 214 \npatients in the teriparatide group (7.5%) (p=0.84).  \n \nIn premenopausal women, the increase in BMD from baseline to 18 months endpoint was significantly \ngreater in the teriparatide group compared with the alendronate group at the lumbar spine (4.2% versus \n−1.9%; p<0.001) and total hip (3.8% versus 0.9%; p=0.005). However, no significant effect on \nfracture rates was demonstrated. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDistribution \n \nThe volume of distribution is approximately 1.7 L/kg. The half-life of teriparatide is approximately 1 \nhour when administered subcutaneously, which reflects the time required for absorption from the \ninjection site.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nNo metabolism or excretion studies have been performed with teriparatide but the peripheral \nmetabolism of parathyroid hormone is believed to occur predominantly in liver and kidney. \n \nElimination \n \nTeriparatide is eliminated through hepatic and extra-hepatic clearance (approximately 62 L/hr in \nwomen and 94 L/hr in men).  \n \nElderly  \n \nNo differences in teriparatide pharmacokinetics were detected with regard to age (range 31 to 85 \nyears). Dosage adjustment based on age is not required. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nTeriparatide was not genotoxic in a standard battery of tests. It produced no teratogenic effects in rats, \nmice or rabbits. There were no important effects observed in pregnant rats or mice administered \nteriparatide at daily doses of 30 to 1,000 μg/kg. However, fetal resorption and reduced litter size \noccurred in pregnant rabbits administered daily doses of 3 to 100 μg/kg. The embryotoxicity observed \nin rabbits may be related to their much greater sensitivity to the effects of PTH on blood ionised \ncalcium compared with rodents. \n \nRats treated with near-life time daily injections had dose-dependent exaggerated bone formation and \nincreased incidence of osteosarcoma most probably due to an epigenetic mechanism. Teriparatide did \nnot increase the incidence of any other type of neoplasia in rats. Due to the differences in bone \nphysiology in rats and humans, the clinical relevance of these findings is probably minor. No bone \ntumours were observed in ovariectomised monkeys treated for 18 months or during a 3-year follow-up \n\n\n\n11 \n\nperiod after treatment cessation. In addition, no osteosarcomas have been observed in clinical trials or \nduring the post treatment follow-up study.  \n \nAnimal studies have shown that severely reduced hepatic blood flow decreases exposure of PTH to the \nprincipal cleavage system (Kupffer cells) and consequently clearance of PTH (1-84). \n \n \n6.

What you need to know before you use Livogiva \n3. How to use Livogiva \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Livogiva \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Livogiva is and what it is used for \n \nLivogiva contains the active substance teriparatide that is used to make the bones stronger, and to \nreduce the risk of fractures by stimulating bone formation.  \n \nLivogiva is used to treat osteoporosis in adults. Osteoporosis is a disease that causes your bones to \nbecome thin and fragile. This disease is especially common in women after the menopause, but it can \nalso occur in men. Osteoporosis is also common in patients receiving corticosteroids. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Livogiva \n \nDo not use Livogiva \n• if you are allergic to teriparatide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n• if you suffer from high calcium levels (pre-existing hypercalcaemia). \n• if you suffer from serious kidney problems.  \n• if you have ever been diagnosed with bone cancer or other cancers that have spread \n\n(metastasised) to your bones.  \n• if you have certain bone diseases. If you have a bone disease, tell your doctor.  \n• if you have unexplained high levels of alkaline phosphatase in your blood, which means you \n\nmight have Paget’s disease of bone (disease with abnormal bone changes). If you are not sure, \nask your doctor.  \n\n• if you have had radiation therapy involving your bones.  \n• if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.  \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nLivogiva may cause an increase in the amount of calcium in your blood or urine. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before or while using Livogiva:  \n• if you have continuing nausea, vomiting, constipation, low energy, or muscle weakness. These \n\nmay be signs there is too much calcium in your blood.  \n• if you suffer from kidney stones or have a history of kidney stones.  \n• if you suffer from kidney problems (moderate renal impairment).  \n \nSome patients get dizzy or get a fast heartbeat after the first few doses. For the first doses, inject \nLivogiva where you can sit or lie down right away if you get dizzy.  \nThe recommended treatment time of 24 months should not be exceeded.  \n \nLivogiva should not be used in growing adults. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nLivogiva should not be used in children and adolescents (less than 18 years). \n \nOther medicines and Livogiva \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, because occasionally they may interact (e.g. digoxin/digitalis, a medicine used to treat heart \ndisease). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not use Livogiva if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. If you are a woman of child-bearing \npotential, you should use effective methods of contraception during use of Livogiva. If you become \npregnant, Livogiva should be discontinued. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking \nany medicine.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome patients may feel dizzy after injecting Livogiva. If you feel dizzy you should not drive or use \nmachines until you feel better \n \nLivogiva contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n \n3. How to use Livogiva \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you to. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  \n \nThe recommended dose is 20 micrograms given once daily by injection under the skin (subcutaneous \ninjection) in the thigh or abdomen. To help you remember to use your medicine, inject it at about the \nsame time each day.  \n \nInject Livogiva each day for as long as your doctor prescribes it for you. The total duration of \ntreatment with Livogiva should not exceed 24 months. You should not receive more than one \ntreatment course of 24 months over your lifetime.  \n \nYour doctor may advise you to use Livogiva with calcium and vitamin D. Your doctor will tell you \nhow much you should take each day. \n \nRead the user manual, which is included in the carton for instructions on how to use the Livogiva pen.  \n \nInjection needles are not included with the pen. Pen needles 29 to 31 gauge (diameter 0.25-0.33 mm) \ncan be used. \n\n\n\n23 \n\nYou should use your Livogiva injection shortly after you take the pen out of the refrigerator as \ndescribed in the user manual. Put the pen back into the refrigerator immediately after you have used it.  \nUse a new injection needle for each injection and dispose of it after each use. Never store your pen \nwith the needle attached. Never share your Livogiva pen with others.  \n \nLivogiva can be given with or without food. \n \nIf you use more Livogiva than you should \nIf, by mistake, you have used more Livogiva than you should, contact your doctor or pharmacist.  \n \nThe effects of overdose that might be expected include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache.  \n \nIf you forget or cannot take Livogiva at your usual time, use it as soon as possible on that day. Do \nnot use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Do not use more than one injection in the same \nday. Do not try to make up for a missed dose.  \n \nIf you stop taking Livogiva \nIf you are considering stopping Livogiva treatment, please discuss this with your doctor. Your doctor \nwill advise you and decide how long you should be treated with Livogiva.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most common side effects are pain in limb (frequency is very common, may affect more than 1 in \n10 people) and feeling sick, headache and dizziness (frequency is common). If you become dizzy \n(light-headed) after your injection, you should sit or lie down until you feel better. If you do not feel \nbetter, you should call a doctor before you continue treatment. Cases of fainting have been reported in \nassociation with teriparatide use.  \nIf you experience discomfort such as redness of the skin, pain, swelling, itching, bruising or minor \nbleeding around the area of the injection (frequency is common), this should clear up in a few days or \nweeks. Otherwise tell your doctor as soon as possible.  \nSome patients may have experienced allergic reactions soon after injection, consisting of \nbreathlessness, swelling of the face, rash and chest pain (frequency is rare). In rare cases, serious and \npotentially life-threatening allergic reactions including anaphylaxis can occur. \n \nOther side effects include:  \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people  \n• increase in blood cholesterol levels  \n• depression  \n• neuralgic pain in the leg  \n• feeling faint  \n• irregular heart beats  \n• breathlessness  \n• increased sweating  \n• muscle cramps  \n• loss of energy  \n• tiredness  \n• chest pain  \n• low blood pressure  \n• heartburn (painful or burning sensation just below the breast bone)  \n• being sick (vomiting)  \n• a hernia of the tube that carries food to your stomach  \n\n\n\n24 \n\n• low haemoglobin or red blood cell count (anaemia)  \n \n\nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people  \n• increased heart rate  \n• abnormal heart sound  \n• shortness of breath  \n• haemorrhoids (piles)  \n• accidental loss or leakage of urine  \n• increased need to pass water  \n• weight increase  \n• kidney stones  \n• pain in the muscles and pain in the joints. Some patients have experienced severe back cramps \n\nor pain which lead to hospitalization.  \n• increase in blood calcium level  \n• increase in blood uric acid level  \n• increase in an enzyme called alkaline phosphatase.  \n \nRare: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people  \n• reduced kidney function, including renal failure  \n• swelling, mainly in the hands, feet and legs.  \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n5.

How do I reset my Livogiva? \n\nTo reset the Livogiva pen follow the steps below: \n1) If you have already injected, DO NOT inject \nyourself a second time on the same day. Use a new \nneedle for your injection on the following day. \n2) Remove the needle.  \n3) Attach a new needle, pull off the large needle cover \nand save it. \n4) Pull off the inner needle cover and throw away. \n5) Point the needle down into an empty container. Push \nin the black injection button until it stops. Hold it in \nand slowly count to 5 s-l-o-w-l-y. You may see a small \nstream or drop of fluid. When you have finished, the \nblack injection button should be all the way in. \n6) If you still see the yellow shaft showing, do not use \nthis pen; contact your doctor or pharmacist.  \n7) Put the large needle cover on needle. Unscrew the \nneedle all the way by giving the needle cover 3 to 5 \ncomplete turns. Pull off needle cover and throw away \nas directed by your doctor or pharmacist. Push the \nwhite cap back on, and put your Livogiva in the \nrefrigerator. \n \nYou can prevent this problem by always using a NEW \nneedle for each injection, and by pushing the black \ninjection button all the way in and slowly counting \nto 5 s-l-o-w-l-y. \n \n\nB How can I tell if my Livogiva \nworks? \n\nThe Livogiva is designed to inject the full dose every \ntime it is used according to the directions in the section \nInstructions for Use.  \nThe black injection button should be all the way in to \nshow that the full dose of medicine has been injected \nfrom the Livogiva. Use a new needle every time you \ninject to be sure your Livogiva will work properly. \n \n\nC I see an air bubble in my Livogiva. A small air bubble will not affect your dose and it will \nnot harm you. You can continue to use your dose as \nusual. \n \n\nD I cannot get the needle off. 1) Put the large needle cover on the needle. \n2) Use the large needle cover to unscrew the needle. \n3) Unscrew the needle all the way by giving the large \nneedle cover 3 to 5 counter-clockwise turns. \n4) If you still cannot get the needle off, ask someone to \nhelp you. \nSee step 9 “Remove needle and dispose”. \n\nE What should I do if I cannot pull out \nthe black injection button? \n\nChange to a new Livogiva pen to use your dose as \ninstructed by your doctor or pharmacist. \nWhen the black injection button becomes hard to pull \nout, this means there is not enough medicine in your \nLivogiva pen for another dose. You may still see some \nmedicine left in the cartridge. \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \nCleaning and storage \n\nCleaning your Livogiva pen \n• Wipe the outside of the Livogiva with a damp cloth. \n• Do not place the Livogiva in water, or wash or clean it with any liquid. \n\n \nStoring your Livogiva pen \n\n• Read and follow the instructions in the Information for the Patient leaflet on how to store \nyour pen. \n\n• DO NOT store the Livogiva with a needle attached. Doing this may affect the sterility of \nthe medicine during subsequent injections. \n\n• Store the Livogiva with the white cap on. \nIf the Livogiva has been left out of the refrigerator, do not throw the pen away. Place the \npen back in the refrigerator and contact your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \nDisposal information \n\nDisposal of pen needles and Livogiva pen  \n• Before disposing of the Livogiva pen, be sure to remove the pen needle.  \n• Put used needles in a sharps container or a hard-plastic container with a secure lid. Do not \n\nthrow needles directly into your household waste.  \n• Do not recycle the filled sharps container.  \n\n \nOther important notes \n\n• DO NOT transfer the medicine into a syringe.  \n• During injection, you may hear one or more clicks – this is normal pen operation \n• The Livogiva is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired persons without \n\nthe assistance from a person trained in the proper use of the pen. \n \nThis user manual was last revised in: \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
