CHARACTERISTICS \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRoclanda 50 micrograms/ml + 200 micrograms/ml eye drops, solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml of solution contains 50 micrograms latanoprost and 200 micrograms netarsudil (as mesylate) . \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect \n \nEach ml of solution contains 200 micrograms benzalkonium chloride. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nEye drops, solution.  \n \nClear, colourless solution, pH 5 (approximately). \n \nOsmolality: 280 mOsm/Kg. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRoclanda is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in adult patients with \nprimary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension for whom monotherapy with a prostaglandin or \nnetarsudil provides insufficient IOP reduction. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Roclanda should only be initiated by an ophthalmologist or a healthcare professional \nqualified in ophthalmology. \n \nPosology \n \nUse in adults, including the elderly  \nThe recommended dosage is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening. Patients should \nnot instill more than one drop in the affected eye(s) each day. \n \nIf one dose is missed, treatment should continue with the next dose in the evening.   \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Roclanda in children below the age of 18 years have not been established. \nNo data are available. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n \nFor ocular use. \n \nData on potential interactions specific to latanoprost + netarsudil are described in section 4.5. If \nlatanoprost + netarsudil is to be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic medicinal products, \neach medicinal product should be administered at least five minutes apart. Due to netarsudil’s \nvasodilating properties, other eye drops should be administered before latanoprost + netarsudil. Eye \nointments should be administered last. \n \nContact lenses should be removed prior to instillation of latanoprost + netarsudil and may be \nreinserted 15 minutes following its administration (see section 4.4). \n \nAs with any eye drops, to reduce possible systemic absorption, it is recommended that the lachrymal \nsac be compressed at the medial canthus (punctal occlusion) for one minute. This should be performed \nimmediately following the instillation of each drop. \n \nThe tip of the dispensing container should avoid contacting the eye, surrounding structures, fingers, or \nany other surface in order to avoid contamination of the solution. Serious damage to the eye and \nsubsequent loss of vision may result from using contaminated solutions. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIris pigmentation \n \nLatanoprost may gradually change eye colour by increasing the amount of brown pigment in the iris. \nBefore treatment is instituted, patients should be informed of the possibility of a permanent change in \neye colour. Unilateral treatment can result in permanent heterochromia. \n \nIncreased iris pigmentation has not been shown to have any negative clinical sequelae and treatment \nwith medicinal products containing latanoprost can be continued if iris pigmentation ensues. However, \npatients should be monitored regularly and if the clinical situation warrants, treatment with medicinal \nproducts containing latanoprost may be discontinued. \n \nHerpetic keratitis condition \n \nMedicinal product(s) containing latanoprost should be used with caution in patients with a history of \nherpetic keratitis, and should be avoided in cases of active herpes simplex keratitis and in patients with \na history of recurrent herpetic keratitis specifically associated with prostaglandin analogues. \n \nMacular oedema risk \n \nReports of macular oedema with medicinal products containing latanoprost have occurred mainly in \naphakic patients, in pseudophakic patients with torn posterior lens capsule or anterior chamber lenses, \nor in patients with known risk factors for cystoid macular oedema (such as diabetic retinopathy and \nretinal vein occlusion). Medicinal products containing latanoprost should be used with caution in \naphakic patients, in pseudophakic patients with torn posterior lens capsule or anterior chamber lenses, \nor in patients with known risk factors for cystoid macular oedema. \n \nIritis/uveitis risk \n \nIn patients with known predisposing risk factors for iritis/uveitis, medicinal products containing \nlatanoprost can be used with caution. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n \nAsthma exacerbation \n \nThere is limited experience of latanoprost use in patients with asthma, but some cases of exacerbation \nof asthma and/or dyspnoea were reported in post marketing experience. Asthmatic patients should \ntherefore be treated with caution until there is sufficient experience with the combination. \n \nPeriorbital skin discolouration \n \nPeriorbital skin discolouration has been observed on treatment with medicinal products containing \nlatanoprost, the majority of reports being in Japanese patients. Experience to date shows that \nperiorbital skin discolouration is not permanent and in some cases has reversed while continuing \ntreatment with latanoprost. \n \nEyelash changes \n \nTreatment with medicinal products containing latanoprost may gradually change eyelashes and vellus \nhair in the treated eye and surrounding areas; these changes include increased length, thickness, \npigmentation, number of lashes or hairs and misdirected growth of eyelashes. Eyelash changes are \nreversible upon discontinuation of treatment. \n \nBenzalkonium chloride content \n \nThis medicinal product contains benzalkonium chloride. \nBenzalkonium chloride has been reported to cause eye irritation, symptoms of dry eyes and may affect \nthe tear film and corneal surface and is known to discolour soft contact lenses. It should be used with \ncaution in dry eye patients and in patients where the cornea may be compromised.  \nPatients should be monitored in case of prolonged use. \n \nThe efficacy of Roclanda has not been studied beyond 12 months. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn vitro interaction studies have shown that precipitation can occur when eye drops containing \nthimerosal are mixed with latanoprost + netarsudil. Administer other eye drops at least five minutes \napart (see section 4.2). \n \nIn vitro studies have indicated netarsudil has the potential to inhibit CYP450 isoenzymes in the cornea, \nhowever no clinical evidence of local pharmacokinetic interactions has been observed to date. \n \nThere have been reports of paradoxical elevations in IOP following the concomitant ophthalmic \nadministration of two prostaglandin analogues. Therefore, the use of two or more prostaglandins, \nprostaglandin analogues or prostaglandin derivatives is not recommended. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of latanoprost + netarsudil in pregnant women.  \n \nNo effects during pregnancy are anticipated, since systemic exposure to netarsudil is negligible (see \nsection 5.2). Animal studies with intravenous administration of netarsudil do not indicate direct or \nindirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity at clinically relevant exposures (see \nsection 5.3).  \n \nLatanoprost has potentially harmful pharmacological effects during pregnancy and/or on the \nfetus/newborn child (see section 5.3).  \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n \nTherefore, latanoprost + netarsudil should not be used during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether netarsudil/metabolites are excreted in human milk. However, while no effects \non the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of breast-feeding women \nto netarsudil is expected to be negligible, no relevant clinical data are available (see section 5.2). \nLatanoprost and its metabolites may pass into human milk. A decision must be made whether to \ndiscontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Roclanda therapy taking into account the \nbenefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.  \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effects of netarsudil on male or female fertility. However, no effects are \nanticipated, since systemic exposure to netarsudil is negligible (see section 5.2). Latanoprost has not \nbeen found to have any effect on male or female fertility in animal studies (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRoclanda has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \nIf transient blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient should wait until the vision clears before \ndriving or using machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common ocular adverse reaction observed is conjunctival hyperemia which was reported in \n52% of patients. Other ocular adverse reactions reported are instillation site pain (18%), cornea \nverticillata (13%), eye pruritis (6%), instillation site erythema (6%), increased lacrimation (5%), \ninstillation site discomfort (5%) and conjunctival haemorrhage (4%).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been reported with latanoprost + netarsudil, dosed once daily, \nand during clinical studies and post-marketing surveillance with the individual components latanoprost \nand netarsudil. Adverse reactions are presented according to the MedDRA system organ classification. \nWithin each system organ class, the adverse reactions are classified by frequency according to the \nfollowing convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000). \n \n\nSystem Organ Classification Frequency Adverse reactions \nInfections and infestations Rare herpetic keratitis2 \nImmune system disorders Uncommon hypersensitivity3 \nNervous system disorders Uncommon headache, \n\nmuscle contractions involuntary, \ndizziness2,3, \nvisual field defect3 \n\nEye disorders Very \ncommon \n\nconjunctival hyperaemia1,  \ncornea verticillata1,  \ninstillation site pain, \niris hyperpigmentation2, \neyelash and vellus hair changes of the \neyelid (increased length, thickness, \npigmentation and number of eyelashes)2 \n\nCommon conjunctival haemorrhage,  \nvision blurred,  \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nSystem Organ Classification Frequency Adverse reactions \nlacrimation increased,  \nerythema of eyelid,  \neye pruritus,  \neye irritation,  \nvisual acuity reduced,  \neyelid oedema,  \npunctate keratitis,  \ncorneal disorder, \nconjunctival oedema,   \nconjunctivitis allergic,  \nphotophobia,  \neye pain,  \ndry eye,  \nforeign body sensation in eyes, \neyelid margin crusting,  \nblepharitis, \ninstillation site erythema,  \ninstillation site discomfort,  \nvital dye staining cornea present \n\nUncommon eyelids pruritus,  \nconjunctival disorder, \ncorneal opacity, \neye discharge, \ncorneal deposits, \nconjunctivitis, \ndacryostenosis acquired, \neye inflammation, \neye paraesthesia, \nconjunctival follicles,  \neye swelling,  \nmeibomian gland dysfunction,  \ncorneal pigmentation,  \ndiplopia,  \nnoninfective conjunctivitis,  \nabnormal sensation in eye,  \nkeratitis,  \nrefraction disorder,  \nanterior chamber flare,  \nconjunctival irritation, \nconjunctivitis, \nintraocular pressure increased, \neyelid rash, \neyelid skin dryness,  \ngrowth of eyelashes, \nlacrimal disorder,  \niritis,  \nvisual impairment,  \ncorneal dystrophy,   \ninstillation site dryness, \ninstillation site pruritus, \ninstillation site reaction,  \neye complication associated with \ndevice,fatigue, \ninstillation site paraesthesia,  \nmacular oedema including cystoid \nmacular oedema2, \nuveitis2 \n\nocular hyperaemia3 \n\ndiabetic retinopathy3, \neye allergy3 \nocular discomfort3, \neyelid disorder3, \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nSystem Organ Classification Frequency Adverse reactions \nectropion3, \nlenticular opacities3, \nasthenopia3, \nepiscleral hyperemia3, \nhalo vision3, \nanterior chamber inflammation3, \nblindness3, \nconjunctivochalasis3, \neczema eyelids3, \nglaucoma3, \niris adhesions3, \niris bombe3, \nocular hypertension3, \ninstillation site irritation3, \nglassy eyes3, \ninstillation site oedema3, \nconjunctival staining3, \noptic nerve cup/disc ratio increased3, \nmadarosis3 \n\n \n\nRare corneal oedema2, \ncorneal erosion2, \nperiorbital oedema2, \ntrichiasis2, \ndistichiasis2, \niris cyst2, \nlocalised skin reaction on the eyelids2, \ndarkening of the palpebral skin of the \neyelids2, \npseudopemphigoid of ocular conjunctiva2 \n\nVery rare periorbital and lid changes resulting in \ndeepening of the eyelid sulcus2 \n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon angina2, \npalpitations2 \n\nVery rare angina unstable2 \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Uncommon epistaxis, \n\nnasal congestion, \nnasal discomfort3, \nrhinalgia3  \n\nasthma2, \ndyspnoea2 \n\nRare asthma exacerbation2 \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Common dermatitis contact \n\nUncommon lichenification, \ndry skin, \nerythema, \nskin disorder, \ndermatitis allergic3 \n\npetechiae3 \nRare pruritus2 \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Uncommon pain in jaw, \nmyalgia2, \narthralgia2, \npolychondritis3 \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nUncommon chest pain2 \n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications Uncommon excoriation3 \n1 See Description of selected adverse reactions for further information \n2 Additional adverse reaction observed with latanoprost monotherapy \n3 Additional adverse reaction observed with netarsudil monotherapy \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nConjunctival hyperaemia \nConjunctival hyperaemia was the most frequently reported adverse reaction associated with latanoprost \n+ netarsudil treatment in clinical studies and it is attributed to the vasodilation effect of the Rho kinase \ninhibitor medicinal product class. Conjunctival hyperaemia was typically mild in severity and sporadic. \nHowever, there was a relatively small proportion of subjects with moderate or severe hyperaemia who \ndiscontinued treatment because of this adverse reaction (5.0% in Phase 3 clinical studies).\n\nCornea verticillata \nCornea verticillata occurred in approximately 13% of the patients in controlled Phase 3 clinical studies. \nThe cornea verticillata seen in latanoprost + netarsudil-treated patients were first noted at 4 weeks of \ndaily dosing. This reaction did not result in any apparent visual functional changes in patients. The \nmajority of cornea verticillata resolved upon discontinuation of treatment. The incidence of cornea \nverticillata was higher in certain subpopulations: elderly (≥65 years) versus non-elderly (18.8 vs. \n11.5%); males versus females (18.8 vs. 13.0%) and in white versus other races (21.7 vs. 2.5%).  \n\nIris pigmentation \nRoclanda contains latanoprost which is a prostaglandin F2α analogue. The majority of adverse reactions \nassociated with latanoprost are ocular in nature. In a 5-year latanoprost safety study, 33% of patients \ndeveloped iris pigmentation (section 4.4).  \n\nThis change in eye colour has predominantly been seen in patients with mixed coloured irides, i.e. \nblue-brown, grey-brown, yellow-brown and green-brown. In studies with latanoprost, the onset of the \nchange is usually within the first 8 months of treatment, rarely during the second or third year, and has \nnot been seen after the fourth year of treatment. The rate of progression of iris pigmentation decreases \nwith time and is stable for five years. The effect of increased pigmentation beyond five years has not \nbeen evaluated. The iris colour change is slight in the majority of cases and often not observed \nclinically. The incidence in patients with mixed colour irides ranged from 7 to 85%, with yellow-\nbrown irides having the highest incidence. In patients with homogeneously blue eyes, no change has \nbeen observed and in patients with homogeneously grey, green or brown eyes, the change has only \nrarely been seen. \n\nThe colour change is due to increased melanin content in the stromal melanocytes of the iris and not to \nan increase in number of melanocytes. Typically, the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads \nconcentrically towards the periphery in affected eyes, but the entire iris or parts of it may become \nmore brownish. No further increase in brown iris pigment has been observed after discontinuation of \ntreatment. It has not been associated with any symptom or pathological changes in clinical studies to \ndate. \n\nNeither naevi nor freckles of the iris have been affected by treatment. Accumulation of pigment in the \ntrabecular meshwork or elsewhere in the anterior chamber has not been observed in clinical studies. \n\nOther special populations \n\nElderly \nWith the exception of cornea verticillata (see above), no difference in the safety profile for latanoprost \n+ netarsudil has been observed between subjects aged <65 or ≥65 years.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\nSystemic exposure to the netarsudil component of latanoprost + netarsudil following topical ocular \nadministration has been shown to be negligible.  \n\nApart from ocular irritation and conjunctival hyperaemia, no other ocular side effects are known if \nlatanoprost is overdosed. \n\nIf latanoprost is accidentally ingested the following information may be useful: one bottle contains \n125 micrograms latanoprost. More than 90% is metabolised during the first pass through the liver. \nIntravenous infusion of 3 micrograms/kg in healthy volunteers induced no symptoms, but a dose of \n5.5-10 micrograms/kg caused nausea, abdominal pain, dizziness, fatigue, hot flushes and sweating. \nIn monkeys, latanoprost has been infused intravenously in doses of up to 500 micrograms/kg without \nmajor effects on the cardiovascular system. \n\nIntravenous administration of latanoprost in monkeys has been associated with transient \nbronchoconstriction. However, in patients with moderate bronchial asthma, bronchoconstriction was \nnot induced by latanoprost when applied topically on the eyes in a dose of seven times the clinical \ndose of latanoprost. \n\nIf topical overdose of latanoprost + netarsudil should occur, the eye(s) may be flushed with tap water. \nTreatment of an overdose would include supportive and symptomatic therapy. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, antiglaucoma preparations and miotics, ATC code: \nS01EE51 \n\nMechanism of action \n\nRoclanda contains two active substances: latanoprost and netarsudil. These two components lower \nIOP by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor. Although both latanoprost and netarsudil lower IOP \nby increasing aqueous humor outflow, their mechanisms of action are different. \n\nStudies in animal and man suggest that the main mechanism of action for netarsudil, a Rho kinase \ninhibitor, is increased trabecular outflow. These studies also suggest that netarsudil lowers IOP by \nreducing episcleral venous pressure.   \n\nStudies in animal and man indicate that the main mechanism of action for latanoprost, a prostaglandin \nF2α analoque, is increased uveoscleral outflow, although some increase in outflow facility (decrease in \noutflow resistance) has been reported in man. \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nRoclanda was evaluated in 2 randomized, double-blind, multicentre Phase 3 clinical studies in \n1,468 patients with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Studies 301 and 302 enrolled \nsubjects with IOP <36 mmHg and compared IOP lowering effect of latanoprost + netarsudil dosed \nonce daily to individually administered netarsudil 0.02% once daily and latanoprost 0.005% once \ndaily. The treatment duration was 12 months for Study 301 and 3 months for Study 302. The median \nage of study participants was 66 years (range 18 to 99 years).  \n\nThe studies were designed to show superiority of latanoprost + netarsudil when dosed once daily in the \nevening over its individual components netarsudil 0.02% once daily and latanoprost 0.005% once \ndaily. The primary efficacy outcome measure was least squares (LS) mean IOP at each of 9 timepoints \n\n\n\n10 \n\nmeasured at 08:00, 10:00 and 16:00 on day 15, day 43 and day 90. The average IOP lowering effect of \nlatanoprost + netarsudil was 1 to 3 mmHg greater than monotherapy with either netarsudil 0.02% or \nlatanoprost 0.005% throughout 3 months (Figures 1 and 2). In Study 301 IOP reductions were \nmaintained, showing statistical superiority of latanoprost + netarsudil throughout the 12-month \ntreatment period. In all cases, the differences in the LS mean IOP were clinically relevant and \nstatistically significant (p < 0.0001) through month 3. Approximately 30% of subjects included in the \nPhase 3 studies had a baseline IOP of ≥27 mmHg (132, 136 and 143 in the latanoprost + netarsudil, \nlatanoprost and netarsudil treatment groups, respectively). In these subjects, latanoprost + netarsudil \nshowed statistically significantly superior IOP-lowering efficacy to each of its components at all time \npoints. Across both studies, compared to latanoprost alone, the combination product reduced IOP by a \nfurther 1.7 mmHg to 3.7 mmHg, and compared to netarsudil alone by a further 3.4 mmHg to \n5.9 mmHg. \n\nFigure 1: Study 301 mean IOP (mmHg) by treatment group and treatment difference in mean IOP \n \n\nlatanoprost + \nnetarsudil vs. \nnetarsudil \n95% CI \n\n3.0 \n\n(2.5, 3.6) \n\n3.0 \n\n(2.4, 3.6) \n\n2.4 \n\n(1.9, 3.0) \n\n3.2 \n\n(2.6, 3.8) \n\n2.9 \n\n(2.3, 3.5) \n\n2.3 \n\n(1.7, 2.8) \n\n3.1 \n\n(2.5, 3.8) \n\n3.2 \n\n(2.5, 3.8) \n\n2.0 \n\n(1.4, 2.6) \n\nlatanoprost + \nnetarsudil vs. \nlatanoprost \n95% CI \n\n2.3 \n\n(1.7, 2.8) \n\n2.6 \n\n(2.0, 3.2) \n\n2.3 \n\n(1.8, 2.9) \n\n1.7 \n\n(1.1, 2.4) \n\n1.9 \n\n(1.3, 2.5) \n\n1.7 \n\n(1.1, 2.2) \n\n1.5 \n\n(0.9, 2.1) \n\n1.7 \n\n(1.1, 2.3) \n\n1.3 \n\n(0.7, 1.9) \n\nThe LS mean IOP at each post-baseline time point was derived using an analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline IOP and based on \nobserved data for all randomized subjects (238 in latanoprost + netarsudil group, 244 in netarsudil group, 236 in latanoprost group). \n\n15.6\n14.9\n\n14.8\n\n16.0\n15.2 15.3\n\n16.1\n\n15.2\n15.4\n\n18.6\n\n17.9\n\n17.2\n\n19.1\n\n18.1\n17.6\n\n19.3\n\n18.4\n\n17.4\n17.8\n\n17.4\n17.2\n\n17.7\n17.1\n\n17.0\n17.6\n\n16.9\n16.7\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\nDay 15\n(8AM)\n\nDay 15\n(10AM)\n\n Day 15\n(4PM)\n\nDay 43\n(8AM)\n\nDay 43\n(10AM)\n\nDay 43\n(4PM)\n\nDay 90\n(8AM)\n\nDay 90\n(10AM)\n\nDay 90\n(4PM)\n\nRoclanda Netarsudil Latanoprost\n\nBaseline\n8AM    10AM    \n\n4PM\n24.8      23.7      \n\n22.6\n\nBaseline\n8AM    10AM    \n\n4PM\n24.8      23.5      \n\n22.6\n\nBaseline\n8AM    10AM    \n\n4PM\n24.6      23.4      \n\n22.4\n\n\n\n11 \n\n16.1\n\n15.3 15.2\n\n16.4\n\n15.5 15.5\n\n16.4\n\n15.6\n15.6\n\n19.4\n\n18.0\n17.5\n\n19.6\n\n18.4\n\n17.9\n\n20.0\n\n18.4\n\n18.0\n18.1\n\n17.7 17.1\n\n17.9\n17.4\n\n17.1\n\n17.9\n17.5\n\n17.1\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\nDay 15\n(8AM)\n\nDay 15\n(10AM)\n\n Day 15\n(4PM)\n\nDay 43\n(8AM)\n\nDay 43\n(10AM)\n\nDay 43\n(4PM)\n\nDay 90\n(8AM)\n\nDay 90\n(10AM)\n\nDay 90\n(4PM)\n\nRoclanda Netarsudil Latanoprost\n\nBaseline\n8AM    10AM    4PM\n24.7      23.3      22.4\n\nBaseline\n8AM    10AM    4PM\n24.7      23.4      22.8\n\nBaseline\n8AM    10AM    4PM\n24.8      23.2      22.6\n\nFigure 2: Study 302 mean IOP (mmHg) by treatment group and treatment difference in mean IOP \n\nlatanoprost + \nnetarsudil vs. \nnetarsudil \n95% CI \n\n3.4 \n\n(2.8, 3.9) \n\n2.7 \n\n(2.2, 3.2) \n\n2.2 \n\n(1.7, 2.8) \n\n3.2 \n\n(2.6, 3.8) \n\n2.9 \n\n(2.3, 3.4) \n\n2.3 \n\n(1.8, 2.9) \n\n3.6 \n\n(3.0, 4.2) \n\n2.8 \n\n(2.3, 3.4) \n\n2.4 \n\n(1.9, 2.9) \n\nlatanoprost + \nnetarsudil vs. \nlatanoprost \n95% CI \n\n2.0 \n\n(1.5, 2.6) \n\n2.4 \n\n(1.9, 2.9) \n\n1.9 \n\n(1.3, 2.4) \n\n1.5 \n\n(0.9, 2.1) \n\n1.9 \n\n(1.3, 2.4) \n\n1.6 \n\n(1.0, 2.1) \n\n1.5 \n\n(0.9, 2.2) \n\n2.0 \n\n(1.4, 2.5) \n\n1.5 \n\n(1.0, 2.1) \n\nThe LS mean IOP at each post-baseline time point was derived using an analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline IOP and based on \nobserved data for all randomized subjects (245 in latanoprost + netarsudil group, 255 in netarsudil group, 250 in latanoprost group). \n\nApproximately 67% of subjects included in the latanoprost + netarsudil treatment groups of Phase 3 \nstudies were caucasian and 30% black or african american. Over half were aged ≥ 65 years. With the \nexception of the incidence of cornea verticillata (section 4.8); no other difference in safety profile was \nobserved between races or age groups. \n\nCompletion rates in Phase 3 studies were lower in the latanoprost + netarsudil treatment groups when \ncompared with the latanoprost group. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events at month 3 were \n8.7% for the pooled latanoprost + netarsudil treatment group versus 7.6% for the pooled netarsudil \ngroup and 1.0% for the pooled latanoprost group. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events at month \n12 in Study 301 were 19.7% for the latanoprost + netarsudil treatment group versus 21.7% for the \nnetarsudil group and 1.7% for the latanoprost group. The majority of discontinuations were associated \nwith ocular events. The most frequently reported adverse event associated with discontinuation in the \npooled latanoprost + netarsudil group was conjunctival hypaeremia (7.6% at month 12). The majority \nof ocular adverse events reported with netarsudil + latanoprost were mild in intensity.  \n\nThe efficacy and safety of latanoprost + netarsudil in subjects with compromised corneal epithelium or \nco-existing ocular pathologies e.g. pseudoexfoliation and dispersion pigment syndrome has not been \nestablished. \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nRoclanda in all subsets of the paediatric population for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure \n\n\n\n12 \n\nin patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe systemic exposures of netarsudil and its active metabolite, AR-13503, were evaluated in \n18 healthy subjects after topical ocular administration of netarsudil 200 micrograms/ml once daily \n(one drop bilaterally in the morning) for 8 days. There were no quantifiable plasma concentrations of \nnetarsudil (lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) 0.100 ng/ml) post dose on Day 1 and Day 8. Only one \nplasma concentration at 0.11 ng/ml for the active metabolite was observed for one subject on Day 8 at \n8 hours post-dose. \n\nLatanoprost (molecular weight 432.58) is an isopropyl ester prodrug which per se is inactive, but after \nhydrolysis to the acid of latanoprost becomes biologically active. The prodrug is well absorbed \nthrough the cornea and all active substance that enters the aqueous humour is hydrolysed during the \npassage through the cornea. Studies in man indicate that the peak concentration in the aqueous humour \nis reached about two hours after topical administration. After topical application in monkeys, \nlatanoprost is distributed primarily in the anterior segment, the conjunctivae and the eyelids. Only \nminute quantities of latanoprost reach the posterior segment. \n\nBiotransformation \n\nAfter topical ocular dosing, netarsudil is metabolized by esterases in the eye to an active metabolite, \nAR-13503. \n\nThere is practically no metabolism of the acid of latanoprost in the eye. The main metabolism occurs \nin the liver. The half-life in plasma is 17 minutes in man. The main metabolites, the 1,2-dinor and \n1,2,3,4-tetranor metabolites, exert no or only weak biological activity in animal studies and are \nexcreted primarily in the urine. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nNetarsudil \n\nNon-clinical data with netarsudil reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of \nsafety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to development. Effects in \nnon-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the \nmaximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. \n\nIntravenous administration of netarsudil to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis did not \nproduce adverse embryofetal effects at clinically relevant systemic exposures. In pregnant rats, \n0.1 mg/kg/day showed no adverse maternal or embryofoetal effects, whereas increased \npost-implantation loss and reduced foetal viability was observed at 0.3 mg/kg/day and higher. \nIn pregnant rabbits, 3 mg/kg/day showed no maternal or embryofoetal effects, whereas an increase in \npost-implantation loss and a decrease in foetal weight were observed at 5 mg/kg/day. \n\nLong-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of \nnetarsudil. \n\nNetarsudil was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutation assay, in a mouse lymphoma assay, or in a rat \nmicronucleus test. \n\nNetarsudil and its active metabolite AR-13503 was found to have a possible phototoxic potential in a \nmodified 3T3 NRU-PT in vitro assay, where the wavelength was extended to include UVB light. \n\n\n\n13 \n\nLatanoprost \n\nThe ocular as well as systemic toxicity of latanoprost has been investigated in several animal species. \nGenerally, latanoprost is well tolerated with a safety margin between clinical ocular dose and systemic \ntoxicity of at least 1000 times. High doses of latanoprost, approximately 100 times the clinical dose/kg \nbody weight, administered intravenously to unanaesthetised monkeys have been shown to increase the \nrespiration rate probably reflecting bronchoconstriction of short duration. In animal studies, \nlatanoprost has not been found to have sensitising properties. \n\nIn the eye, no toxic effects have been detected with doses of up to 100 micrograms/eye/day in rabbits \nor monkeys (clinical dose is approximately 1.5 micrograms/eye/day). In monkeys, however,  \nlatanoprost has been shown to induce increased pigmentation of the iris. The mechanism of increased \npigmentation seems to be stimulation of melanin production in melanocytes of the iris with no \nproliferative changes observed. The change in iris colour may be permanent. \n\nIn chronic ocular toxicity studies, administration of latanoprost 6 micrograms/eye/day has also been \nshown to induce increased palpebral fissure. This effect is reversible and occurs at doses above the \nclinical dose level. The effect has not been seen in humans. \n\nLatanoprost was found negative in reverse mutation tests in bacteria, gene mutation in mouse \nlymphoma and mouse micronucleus test. Chromosome aberrations were observed in vitro with human \nlymphocytes. Similar effects were observed with prostaglandin F2α, a naturally occurring \nprostaglandin, and indicates that this is a class effect. \n\nAdditional mutagenicity studies on in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis in rats were negative \nand indicate that latanoprost does not have mutagenic potency. Carcinogenicity studies in mice and \nrats were negative. \n\nLatanoprost has not been found to have any effect on male or female fertility in animal studies. In the \nembryotoxicity study in rats, no embryotoxicity was observed at intravenous doses (5, 50 and \n250 micrograms/kg/day) of latanoprost. However, latanoprost induced embryolethal effects in rabbits \nat doses of 5 micrograms/kg/day and above. \n\nThe dose of 5 micrograms/kg/day (approximately 100 times the clinical dose) caused significant \nembryofoetal toxicity characterised by increased incidence of late resorption and abortion and by \nreduced foetal weight. \n\nNo teratogenic potential has been detected. \n\n6.

What Roclanda is and what it is used for\n\nRoclanda contains the active substances latanoprost and netarsudil. Latanoprost belongs to a group of \nmedicines known as prostaglandin analogues. Netarsudil belongs to a group of medicines called Rho \nkinase inhibitors. They work in different ways to reduce the amount of fluid, and so lower the \npressure, inside the eye.  \n\nRoclanda is used to lower pressure in the eyes in adults who have an eye condition known as \nglaucoma or who have raised pressure in their eyes. If the pressure in the eye is too high, it can \ndamage your sight. \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Roclanda\n\nDo not use Roclanda \n- if you are allergic to latanoprost or netarsudil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine\n\n(listed in section 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Roclanda if you think any of the following applies to \nyou: \n\n• If you suffer from dry eyes;\n• If you have severe asthma or asthma that is not well controlled;\n• If you have suffered or are currently suffering from a viral infection of the eye caused by the\n\nherpes simplex virus.\n\nDo not use Roclanda more than once a day, as you may experience more side effects. \n\n\n\n24 \n\nChildren and adolescents \nRoclanda should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age as it is not known if it \nis safe or effective in this age group.  \n\nOther medicines and Roclanda \nRoclanda may interact with other medicines. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have \nrecently used or might use any other medicines, especially any that contain another prostaglandin \nanalogue like latanoprost.   \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Do not use Roclanda if you are \npregnant. \n\nDriving and using machines \nYou may find that your vision is blurred or abnormal just after using Roclanda. Do not drive or use \nmachines until your vision has cleared. \n\nRoclanda contains benzalkonium chloride \nThis medicine contains benzalkonium chloride which may be absorbed by soft contact lenses and \nchange the colour of the contact lenses. You should remove contact lenses before using this medicine \nand not put them back before 15 minutes has passed.   \n\nBenzalkonium chloride may also cause eye irritation, especially if you have dry eyes or disorders of \nthe cornea (the clear layer at the front of the eye). If you feel abnormal eye sensation, stinging or pain \nin the eye after using this medicine, talk to your doctor. \n\n3. How to use Roclanda\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n\nOnly use Roclanda for your eyes (ocular use). \n\nThe recommended dose is one drop in the affected eye once a day in the evening. Use the medicine at \naround the same time each day. Do not use it more than once a day. \n\nHow to use \n\n• Wash your hands before you start.\n• Do not touch the dropper tip with your fingers when opening or closing the bottle. It could\n\ninfect the eye drops.\n• Twist off the bottle cap, and lie the cap on a clean surface on its side. Continue to hold the\n\nbottle, ensuring that the tip doesn’t come into contact with anything.\n• Hold the bottle, pointing down, between your thumb and fingers.\n• Tilt your head back.\n\n\n\n25 \n\n• Pull down your lower eyelid with a clean finger to form a ‘pocket’ between the eyelid and your\neye. The drop will go in here.\n\n• Bring the dropper tip close to the eye. Do this in front of a mirror if it helps.\n• Do not touch your eye, eyelid, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper tip. It could\n\ninfect the eye drops.\n• Gently squeeze the bottle to release one drop of Roclanda into your eye.\n• Only put one drop into your eye each time. If a drop misses your eye, try again.\n• Press a finger against the corner of the eye by the nose. Hold for 1 minute whilst keeping the\n\neye closed.\n• If you need to use the drops in both eyes, repeat the steps for your other eye while you have\n\nthe bottle open.\n• Put back the bottle cap to close the bottle.\n• Put the bottle back into the carton to protect the drops from light until you need to use the drops\n\nagain.\n\nIf you are using other eye drops, wait at least five minutes after using them and then use Roclanda. If \nyou are using an eye ointment, it should be used last. \n\nIf you use more Roclanda than you should  \nRinse your eye with warm water. Do not put in any more drops until it is time for your next regular dose. \n\nIf you forget to use Roclanda \nContinue with the next dose as planned.
