NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nSelincro 18 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 18.06 mg nalmefene (as hydrochloride dihydrate).\n\nExcipient with known effect\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 60.68 mg lactose.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet)\nWhite, oval, biconvex, 6.0 x 8.75 mm film-coated tablet engraved with “S” on one side\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nSelincro is indicated for the reduction of alcohol consumption in adult patients with alcohol \ndependence who have a high drinking risk level (DRL) [see section 5.1], without physical withdrawal \nsymptoms and who do not require immediate detoxification.\n\nSelincro should only be prescribed in conjunction with continuous psychosocial support focused on\ntreatment adherence and reducing alcohol consumption.\n\nSelincro should be initiated only in patients who continue to have a high DRL two weeks after initial \nassessment.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nAt an initial visit, the patient’s clinical status, alcohol dependence, and level of alcohol consumption \n(based on patient reporting) should be evaluated. Thereafter, the patient should be asked to record his \nor her alcohol consumption for approximately two weeks.\n\nAt the next visit, Selincro may be initiated in patients who continued to have a high DRL (see section \n5.1) over this two-week period, in conjunction with psychosocial intervention focused on treatment \nadherence and reducing alcohol consumption.\n\nSelincro is to be taken as-needed: On each day the patient perceives a risk of drinking alcohol, one \ntablet should be taken, preferably 1-2 hours prior to the anticipated time of drinking. If the patient has \nstarted drinking alcohol without taking Selincro, the patient should take one tablet as soon as possible.\n\nThe maximum dose of Selincro is one tablet per day. Selincro can be taken with or without food (see \nsection 5.2).\n\nDuring pivotal trials the greatest improvement was observed within the first 4 weeks. The patient’s \nresponse to treatment and the need for continued pharmacotherapy should be evaluated on a regular \n\n\n\n3\n\n(for example, monthly) basis (see section 5.1). The physician should continue to assess the patient’s \nprogress in reducing alcohol consumption, overall functioning, treatment adherence, and any potential \nside effects. Clinical data for the use of Selincro under randomised controlled conditions are available \nfor a period of 6 to 12 months. Caution is advised if Selincro is prescribed for more than 1 year.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly (≥65 years of age)\nNo dose adjustment is recommended for this patient population (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Selincro in children and adolescents <18 years of age have not been \nestablished. No data are available (see section 5.1).\n\nMethod of administration \n\nSelincro is for oral use.\nThe film-coated tablet should be swallowed whole.\nThe film-coated tablet should not be divided or crushed because nalmefene may cause skin \nsensitisation when in direct contact with the skin (see section 5.3).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nPatients taking opioid agonists (such as opioid analgesics, opioids for substitution therapy with opioid \nagonists (e.g. methadone) or partial agonists (e.g. buprenorphine)) (see section 4.4).\n\nPatients with current or recent opioid addiction.\n\nPatients with acute symptoms of opioid withdrawal.\n\nPatients for whom recent use of opioids is suspected.\n\nPatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification).\n\nPatients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2).\n\nPatients with a recent history of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome (including hallucinations, \nseizures, and delirium tremens).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nSelincro is not for patients for whom the treatment goal is immediate abstinence. Reduction of alcohol \nconsumption is an intermediate goal on the way to abstinence.\n\n\n\n4\n\nOpioid administration\n\nIn an emergency situation when opioids must be administered to a patient taking Selincro, the amount \nof opioid required to obtain the desired effect may be greater than usual. The patient should be closely \nmonitored for symptoms of respiratory depression as a result of the opioid administration and for other \nadverse reactions.\n\nIf opioids are needed in an emergency, the dose must always be titrated individually. If unusually large \ndoses are required, close observation is necessary.\n\nSelincro should be temporarily discontinued for 1 week prior to the anticipated use of opioids, for \nexample, if opioid analgesics might be used during elective surgery.\nThe prescriber should advise patients that it is important to inform their health care professional of last \nSelincro intake if opioid use becomes necessary.\n\nCaution should be exercised when using medicinal products containing opioids (for example, cough \nmedicines, opioid analgesics (see section 4.5)).\n\nComorbidity\n\nPsychiatric disorders\nPsychiatric effects were reported in clinical studies (see section 4.8). If patients develop psychiatric \nsymptoms that are not associated with treatment initiation with Selincro, and/or that are not transient, \nthe prescriber should consider alternative causes of the symptoms and assess the need for continuing \ntreatment with Selincro.\nSelincro has not been investigated in patients with unstable psychiatric disease. Caution should be \nexercised if Selincro is prescribed to patients with current psychiatric comorbidity such as major \ndepressive disorder.\n\nThe increased suicidal risk in alcohol and substances abusers, with or without accompanying \ndepression, is not reduced by the intake of nalmefene.\n\nSeizure disorders\nThere is limited experience in patients with a history of seizure disorders, including alcohol \nwithdrawal seizures.\nCaution is advised if treatment aimed at reduction of alcohol consumption is started in such patients.\n\nRenal or hepatic impairment\nSelincro is extensively metabolised by the liver and excreted predominantly in the urine. Therefore,\ncaution should be exercised when prescribing Selincro to patients with mild or moderate hepatic or \nmild or moderate renal impairment, for example, by more frequent monitoring.\n\nCaution should be exercised when prescribing Selincro to patients with elevated ALAT or \nASAT (>3 times ULN) as these patients were excluded from the clinical development programme.\n\nElderly patients (≥65 years of age)\n\nLimited clinical data are available on the use of Selincro in patients ≥65 years of age with alcohol \ndependence.\n\nCaution should be exercised when prescribing Selincro to patients ≥65 years of age (see sections \n4.2 and 5.2).\n\nOthers\n\nCaution is advised if Selincro is co-administered with a potent UGT2B7 inhibitor (see section 4.5).\n\n\n\n5\n\nLactose\n\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency, or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted.\n\nBased on in vitro studies, no clinically relevant interactions between nalmefene, or its metabolites, and \nconcomitantly administered medicinal products metabolised by the most common CYP450 and UGT \nenzymes or membrane transporters are anticipated. Co-administration with medicinal products that are \npotent inhibitors of the UGT2B7 enzyme (for example, diclofenac, fluconazole, medroxyprogesterone \nacetate, meclofenamic acid) may significantly increase the exposure to nalmefene. This is unlikely to \npresent a problem with occasional use, but if long-term concurrent treatment with a potent UGT2B7 \ninhibitor is initiated, a potential for an increase in nalmefene exposure cannot be excluded (see section \n4.4).  Conversely, concomitant administration with a UGT inducer (for example, dexamethasone, \nphenobarbital, rifampicin, omeprazole) may potentially lead to subtherapeutic nalmefene plasma \nconcentrations.\n\nIf Selincro is taken concomitantly with opioid agonists (for example, certain types of cough and cold \nmedicinal products, certain antidiarrhoeal medicinal products, and opioid analgesics), the patient may \nnot benefit from the opioid agonist.\n\nThere is no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between nalmefene and alcohol.  \nThere seems to be a small impairment in cognitive and psychomotor performance after administration \nof nalmefene. However, the effect of nalmefene and alcohol in combination did not exceed the sum of \nthe effects of each substance when taken alone. \n\nSimultaneous intake of alcohol and Selincro does not prevent the intoxicating effects of alcohol.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no or limited data (fewer than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of nalmefene in \npregnant women. \n\nAnimal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\n\nSelincro is not recommended during pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of \nnalmefene/metabolites in milk (see section 5.3). It is unknown whether nalmefene is excreted in \nhuman milk.\n\nA risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded.\n\nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \nSelincro therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of \ntherapy to the woman.\n\n\n\n6\n\nFertility\n\nIn fertility studies in rats, no effects were observed for nalmefene on fertility, mating, pregnancy, or\nsperm parameters.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nAdverse reactions such as disturbance in attention, feeling abnormal, nausea, dizziness, somnolence,\ninsomnia, and headache may occur following administration of nalmefene (see section 4.8). The \nmajority of these reactions were mild or moderate, associated with treatment initiation, and of short \nduration.\n\nConsequently, Selincro may have minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines \nand patients should exercise caution particular when starting treatment with Selincro.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe frequencies of the adverse reactions in Table 1 were calculated based on three randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with alcohol dependence. \n\nThe most common adverse reactions were nausea, dizziness, insomnia, and headache. The majority of \nthese reactions were mild or moderate, associated with treatment initiation, and of short duration.\n\nConfusional state and, rarely, hallucinations and dissociation were reported in the clinical studies. The \nmajority of these reactions were mild or moderate, associated with treatment initiation, and of short \nduration (a few hours to a few days). Most of these adverse reactions resolved during continued \ntreatment and did not recur upon repeated administration. While these events were generally short-\nlasting, they could represent alcoholic psychosis, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, or comorbid \npsychiatric disease. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nFrequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 \nto <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), or not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data).\n\n\n\n7\n\nTable 1 Frequencies of adverse reactions\n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse Reaction\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Common Decreased appetite\n\nPsychiatric disorders\n\nVery common Insomnia \n\nCommon Sleep disorder\n\nConfusional state\n\nRestlessness\n\nLibido decreased (including loss of \nlibido)\n\nNot known Hallucination (including \nhallucination auditory, \nhallucination tactile, hallucination \nvisual, and somatic hallucination)\n\nDissociation\n\nNervous system disorders\n\nVery Common Dizziness\n\nHeadache\n\nCommon Somnolence\n\nTremor\n\nDisturbance in attention\n\nParaesthesia \n\nHypoaesthesia\n\nCardiac disorders\nCommon Tachycardia\n\nPalpitations\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\n\nVery Common Nausea\n\nCommon Vomiting\n\nDry mouth\n\nDiarrhoea\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nCommon Hyperhidrosis \n\nUnknown Angioedema\n\nUrticaria\n\nPruritus\n\nRash\n\nErythema\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders\n\nCommon Muscle spasms\n\nUnknown Myalgia\n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorder\n\nUnknown Priapism\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nCommon Fatigue\n\nAsthenia\n\n\n\n8\n\nMalaise\n\nFeeling abnormal\n\nInvestigations Common Weight decreased\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nIn a study in patients diagnosed with pathological gambling, doses of nalmefene up to 90 mg/day for \n16 weeks were investigated. In a study in patients with interstitial cystitis, 20 patients received \n108 mg/day of nalmefene for more than 2 years. Intake of a single dose of 450 mg nalmefene has been \nreported without changes in blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, or body temperature.\n\nNo unusual pattern of adverse reactions was observed in these settings, but experience is limited.\n\nManagement of an overdose should be observational and symptomatic.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs, drugs used in alcohol dependence;\nATC code: N07BB05\n\nMechanism of action\n\nNalmefene is an opioid system modulator with a distinct μ, δ, and κ receptor profile. \n- In vitro studies have demonstrated that nalmefene is a selective opioid receptor ligand with \n\nantagonist activity at the μ and δ receptors and partial agonist activity at the κ receptor.\n- In vivo studies have demonstrated that nalmefene reduces alcohol consumption, possibly by \n\nmodulating cortico-mesolimbic functions.\n\nData from the nonclinical studies, the clinical studies, and the literature do not suggest any form of \ndependence or abuse potential with Selincro.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nThe efficacy of Selincro in reducing alcohol consumption in patients with alcohol dependence (DSM-\nIV) was evaluated in two efficacy studies. Patients with a history of delirium tremens, hallucinations, \nseizures, significant psychiatric comorbidity, or significant abnormalities of liver function as well as \nthose with significant physical withdrawal symptoms at screening or randomisation were excluded. \nThe majority (80%) of the patients included had a high or very high DRL (alcohol consumption >60 \ng/day for men and >40 g/day for women according to the WHO DRLs of alcohol consumption) at \nscreening, of these 65% maintained a high or very high DRL between screening and randomisation.\n\nBoth studies were randomised, double-blind, parallel-group and placebo-controlled, and after 6 \nmonths of treatment, patients who received Selincro were re-randomised to receive either placebo or \nSelincro in a 1-month run-out period. The efficacy of Selincro was also evaluated in a randomised, \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9\n\ndouble-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled 1-year study. Overall, the studies included 1,941 \npatients, 1,144 of whom were treated with Selincro 18 mg as-needed. \n\nAt the initial visit, the patients’ clinical status, social situation, and alcohol consumption pattern were \nevaluated (based on patient reporting). At the randomisation visit, which occurred 1 to 2 weeks later, \nthe DRL was re-assessed and treatment with Selincro was initiated together with a psychosocial \nintervention (BRENDA) focused on treatment adherence and reduction of alcohol consumption. \nSelincro was prescribed as-needed, which resulted in patients taking Selincro, on average, \napproximately half of the days.\n\nThe efficacy of Selincro was measured using two co-primary endpoints: the change from baseline to \nMonth 6 in the monthly number of heavy drinking days (HDDs) and the change from baseline to \nMonth 6 in the daily total alcohol consumption (TAC). An HDD was defined as a day with a \nconsumption ≥60 g of pure alcohol for men and ≥40 g for women. \n\nA significant reduction in the number of HDDs and TAC occurred in some patients in the period \nbetween the initial visit (screening) and randomisation due to non-pharmacological effects.  \n\nIn Studies 1 (n=579), and 2 (n=655), 18%, and 33%, of the total population, respectively, considerably \nreduced their alcohol consumption in the period between screening and randomisation. As concerns\nthe patients with high or very high DRL at baseline, 35% of patients experienced improvement due to \nnon-pharmacological effects in the period between the initial visit (screening) and randomisation. At \nrandomisation, these patients consumed such a small amount of alcohol that there was little room for \nfurther improvement (floor effect). Therefore, the patients who maintained a high or very high DRL at \nrandomisation were defined post hoc as the target population. In this post hoc population, the \ntreatment effect was larger than that in the total population. \n\nThe clinical efficacy and the clinical relevance of Selincro were analysed in patients with a high or \nvery high DRL at screening and randomisation. At baseline, the patients had, on average, 23 HDDs \nper month (11% of patients had fewer than 14 HDDs per month) and consumed 106 g/day. The \nmajority of the patients had low (55% had a score of 0-13) or intermediate (36% had a score of 14-21)\nalcohol dependence according to the Alcohol Dependence Scale.\n\nPost-hoc efficacy analysis in patients who maintained a high or very high DRL at randomisation\nIn Study 1, the proportion of patients who withdrew was higher in the Selincro group than in the \nplacebo group (50% versus 32%, respectively). For HDDs there were 23 days/month at baseline in the \nSelincro group (n=171) and 23 days/month at baseline in the placebo group (n=167).  For the patients \nwho continued in the study and provided efficacy data at Month 6, the number of HDDs was 9 \ndays/month in the Selincro group (n=85) and 14 days/month in the placebo group (n=114). The TAC \nwas 102 g/day at baseline in the Selincro group (n=171) and 99 g/day at baseline in the placebo group \n(n=167).  For the patients who continued in the study and provided efficacy data at Month 6, the TAC \nwas 40 g/day in the Selincro-group (n=85) and 57 g/day in the placebo group (n=114).   \nIn Study 2, the proportion of patients who withdrew was higher in the Selincro group than in the \nplacebo group (30% versus 28%, respectively). For HDDs there were 23 days/month at baseline in the \nSelincro group (n=148) and 22 days/month at baseline in the placebo group (n=155).  For the patients \nwho continued in the study and provided efficacy data at Month 6, the number of HDDs was 10 \ndays/month in the Selincro group (n=103) and 12 days/month in the placebo group (n=111). The TAC \nwas 113 g/day at baseline in the Selincro group (n=148) and 108 g/day at baseline in the placebo \ngroup (n=155).  For the patients who continued in the study and provided efficacy data at Month 6, the \nTAC was 44 g/day in the Selincro group (n=103) and 52 g/day in the placebo group (n=111).   \n\nResponder analyses of the pooled data from the two studies are provided in Table 2.\n\n\n\n10\n\nTable 2 Pooled Responder Analysis Results in Patients with a High or Very High \n\nDRL at screening and Randomisation  \n\nResponsea Placebo Nalmefene Odds Ratio (95% CI) p-value\n\nTAC R70b 19.9% 25.4% 1.44 (0.97; 2.13) 0.067\n\n0-4 HDDc 16.8% 22.3% 1.54 (1.02; 2.35) 0.040\n\na  Analysis treats patients who withdrew as non-responder\n\nb  ≥70% reduction from baseline in TAC at Month 6 (28-day period) \n\nc  0 to 4 HDDs/month at Month 6 (28-day period)  \n\nLimited data are available for Selincro in the 1-month run-out period.\n\n1 year study\nThis study comprised a total of 665 patients. 52% of these patients had a high or very high DRL at \nbaseline; of these, 52% (representing 27% of the total population) continued to have a high or very \nhigh DRL at randomisation. In this post-hoc target population, more patients receiving nalmefene \ndiscontinued (45%) as compared to those receiving placebo (31%). For HDDs there were 19 \ndays/month at baseline in the Selincro-group (n=141) and19 days/month at baseline in the placebo \ngroup (n=42).  For the patients who continued in the study and provided efficacy data at 1 year, the \nnumber of HDDs was 5 days/month in the Selincro group (n=78) and 10 days/month in the placebo \ngroup (n= 29). The TAC was 100 g/day at baseline in the Selincro group (n=141) and 101 g/day at \nbaseline in the placebo group (n=42).  For the patients who continued in the study and provided \nefficacy data at 1 year, the TAC was 24 g/day in the Selincro group (n=78) and 47 g/day in the \nplacebo group (n=29).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nSelincro in all subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of alcohol dependence (see section \n4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\nNalmefene is rapidly absorbed after a single oral administration of 18.06 mg, with a peak \nconcentration (Cmax) of 16.5 ng/ml after approximately 1.5 hours and an exposure (AUC) of \n131 ng*h/ml.\nThe absolute oral bioavailability of nalmefene is 41%. Administration of high-fat food increases the \ntotal exposure (AUC) by 30% and the peak concentration (Cmax) by 50%; the time to peak \nconcentration (tmax) is delayed by 30 min (tmax is 1.5 hours). This change is considered unlikely to be of \nclinical relevance.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe average protein-bound fraction of nalmefene in plasma is approximately 30%. The estimated \nvolume of distribution (Vd/F) is approximately 3200 l.\nOccupancy data obtained in a PET study after single and repeated daily dosing with 18.06 mg \nnalmefene show 94% to 100% receptor occupancy within 3 hours after dosing, which suggests that \nnalmefene readily crosses the blood-brain barrier.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nFollowing oral administration, nalmefene undergoes extensive, rapid metabolism to the major \nmetabolite nalmefene 3-O-glucuronide, with the UGT2B7 enzyme being primarily responsible for the \n\n\n\n11\n\nconversion, and with the UGT1A3 and UGT1A8 enzymes as minor contributors. A small proportion \nof nalmefene is converted to nalmefene 3-O-sulphate by sulphation and to nornalmefene by \nCYP3A4/5. Nornalmefene is further converted to nornalmefene 3-O-glucuronide and nornalmefene 3-\nO-sulphate. The metabolites are not considered to contribute with significant pharmacological effect \non the opioid receptors in humans, except for nalmefene 3-O-sulphate, which has a potency \ncomparable to that of nalmefene. However, nalmefene 3-O-sulphate is present in concentrations less \nthan 10% of that of nalmefene and thus considered highly unlikely to be a major contributor to the \npharmacological effect of nalmefene.\n\nElimination\n\nMetabolism by glucuronide conjugation is the primary mechanism of clearance for nalmefene, with \nrenal excretion being the main route of elimination of nalmefene and its metabolites. 54% of the total \ndose is excreted in the urine as nalmefene 3-O-glucuronide, while nalmefene and its other metabolites \nare present in the urine in amounts of less than 3% each.\nThe oral clearance of nalmefene (CL/F) was estimated as 169 l/h and the terminal half-life was \nestimated as 12.5 hours.\nFrom distribution, metabolism, and excretion data, it appears that nalmefene has a high hepatic \nextraction ratio.\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\n\nNalmefene exhibits a dose-independent linear pharmacokinetic profile in the dose interval of 18.06 mg \nto 72.24 mg, with a 4.4 times increase in Cmax and a 4.3 times increase in AUC0-tau (at or near steady \nstate).\nNalmefene does not exhibit any substantial pharmacokinetic differences between sexes, between \nyoung and elderly, or between ethnic groups.\nHowever, body size seems to affect the clearance of nalmefene to a minor degree (clearance increases \nwith increasing body size), but this is considered unlikely to be of clinical relevance.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nAdministration of a single oral dose of nalmefene 18.06 mg to patients with mild, moderate or severe \nrenal impairment, classified using the estimated glomerular filtration rate, resulted in an increased \nexposure to nalmefene relative to that in healthy subjects.  For patients with mild, moderate or severe \nrenal impairment the AUC for nalmefene was 1.1 times, 1.4 times and 2.4 times higher, respectively.  \nFurther, the Cmax and elimination half-life for nalmefene was up to 1.6 times higher in patients with \nsevere renal impairment.  No clinically relevant changes were seen in tmax for any of the groups.  For \nthe inactive major metabolite nalmefene 3-O-glucuronide, the AUC and Cmax were up to 5.1 times and \n1.8 times higher in patients with severe renal impairment, respectively (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nAdministration of a single dose of nalmefene 18.06 mg to patients with mild or moderate hepatic \nimpairment increased exposure relative to that in healthy subjects. In patients with mild hepatic \nimpairment, exposure increased 1.5 times and oral clearance decreased by approximately 35%. In \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment, exposure increased 2.9 times for AUC and 1.7 times for \nCmax, while oral clearance decreased by approximately 60%. No clinically relevant changes were seen \nin tmax or elimination half-life for any of the groups. \nPharmacokinetic data after oral administration of nalmefene to patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment are not available (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nElderly\n\nNo specific study with oral dosing has been conducted in patients ≥65 years of age. A study with IV \nadministration suggested that there were no relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics in the elderly as \ncompared to non-elderly adults (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\n\n\n12\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNalmefene was shown to have skin sensitisation potential in the Local Lymph Node Assay in mice \nafter topical application.\n\nStudies in animals do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to fertility, pregnancy, \nembryonic/foetal development, parturition, or postnatal development.\n\nIn a rabbit embryo-foetal developmental toxicity study, effects on foetuses in terms of reduced foetal \nweight and delayed ossification, but no major abnormalities were seen. The AUC at the no observed \nadverse effect level (NOAEL) for these effects was below the human exposure at the recommended \nclinical dose.\nAn increase in still-born pups and decrease in post-natal viability of pups was observed in pre-\npostnatal toxicity studies in rats. This effect was considered to be an indirect effect related to toxicity \nto the dams.\n\nStudies in rats have shown excretion of nalmefene or its metabolites in milk.\n\nThe nonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, or carcinogenic potential.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Selincro is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Selincro\n3. How to take Selincro\n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Selincro\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Selincro is and what it is used for\n\nSelincro contains the active substance nalmefene.\n\nSelincro is used for the reduction of alcohol consumption in adult patients with alcohol dependence \nwho still have a high level of alcohol consumption 2 weeks after the first consultation with their \ndoctor. \n\nAlcohol dependence occurs when a person has a physical or psychological dependence on the \nconsumption of alcohol.\n\nA high level of alcohol consumption is defined as drinking more than 60 g of pure alcohol per day for\nmen and more than 40 g of pure alcohol per day for women. For example, a bottle of wine (750 ml; \n12% alcohol by volume) contains approximately 70 g alcohol and a bottle of beer (330 ml; 5% alcohol \nby volume) contains approximately 13 g alcohol.\n\nYour doctor has prescribed Selincro because you were not able to reduce your alcohol consumption on \nyour own. Your doctor will provide you with counselling to help you keep to your treatment and  \nthereby reduce your alcohol consumption.\n\nSelincro works by affecting processes in the brain that are responsible for your urge to continue \ndrinking.\n\nA high level of alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of health and social problems. \nSelincro can help you reduce the amount of alcohol you drink, and keep the reduced level of alcohol \nconsumption.\n\n\n\n24\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Selincro\n\nDo not take Selincro:\n\n- if you are allergic to nalmefene or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6)\n\n- if you are taking medicines containing opioids, for example, methadone or buprenorphine or\npain killers (such as morphine, oxycodone or other opioids)\n\n- if you are or have recently been dependent on opioids. You may experience acute opioid \nwithdrawal symptoms (such as feeling sick, vomiting, shakiness, sweating and anxiety)\n\n- if you experience, or suspect you are experiencing opioid withdrawal symptoms\n- if your liver or kidney function is poor\n- if you are experiencing or have recently experienced several alcohol withdrawal symptoms \n\n(such as seeing, hearing or sensing things that are not there, seizures and shakiness)\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Selincro. Inform your doctor about any other diseases \nyou may have, for example, depression, seizure, liver or kidney disease.\n\nIf you and your doctor have decided that your immediate goal is abstinence (not drinking any alcohol), \nyou should not take Selincro because Selincro is indicated for reduction of alcohol consumption.\n\nIf you require emergency medical attention, tell your doctor that you are taking Selincro. Your use of \nSelincro may affect your doctor’s choice of emergency treatment.\n\nIf you are going to have a surgical procedure, talk to your doctor at least 1 week before the procedure. \nYou may need to stop taking Selincro temporarily.\n\nIf you feel detached from yourself, see or hear things that are not there, and this continues to recur for \nmore than a few days, stop taking Selincro and talk to your doctor.\n\nThe increased suicidal risk in alcohol and substances abusers, with or without accompanying \ndepression, is not reduced by the intake of nalmefene.\n\nIf you are 65 years old or above, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Selincro.\n\nChildren and adolescents\n\nSelincro should not be used in children or adolescents below the age of 18 years because Selincro has\nnot been tested in this age group.\n\nOther medicines and Selincro\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Caution should be excercised when taking medicines such as diclofenac (antiinflammatory \nmedicine used to treat, for example, muscle pain), fluconazole (antibiotic used to treat diseases caused \nby some types of fungus), omeprazole (medicine used to block the production of acid in the stomach), \nor rifampicin (antibiotic used to treat diseases caused by some types of bacteria) together with \nSelincro.\n\nIf you take medicines containing opioids, the effects of these medicines will be reduced, or the \nmedicines may not work at all if you take them together with Selincro. These medicines include\ncertain types of cough and cold medicines, certain medicines for diarrhoea and strong pain killers.\n\n\n\n25\n\nSelincro with food and alcohol\n\nSelincro does not prevent the intoxicating effects of alcohol.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nIt is not known if Selincro is safe to use during pregnancy and breast-feeding.\n\nSelincro is not recommended if you are pregnant.\n\nIf you are breast-feeding, you and your doctor should make a decision whether to discontinue breast-\nfeeding or to discontinue Selincro therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the \nchild and the benefit of therapy to you.\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nSide effects such as disturbance in attention, feeling abnormal, nausea, dizziness, somnolence, \ninsomnia, and headache may occur when beginning Selincro treatment. The majority of these reactions \nwere mild or moderate, occurred at the beginning of treatment and lasted for a few hours to a few \ndays. These side effects may affect your skills when driving or doing anything that requires you to be \nalert, including operating machinery.\n\nSelincro contains lactose\n\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine.\n\n3. How to take Selincro\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor\nor pharmacist if you are not sure.\n\nHow much to take\n\n- The recommended dose is one tablet on days when you think there is a risk you will drink \nalcohol \n\n- The maximum dose is one tablet per day.\n\nHow and when to take\n\n- Selincro is for oral use.\n- You should take the tablet 1-2 hours before you start drinking alcohol.\n- Swallow the tablet whole, do not crush or divide the tablet because Selincro may cause skin \n\nsensitisation when in direct contact with the skin.\n- You can take Selincro with or without food.\n- You can expect to be able to reduce your alcohol consumption within the first month after you \n\nstart treatment with Selincro. \n- Your doctor will follow up with you on a regular basis, for example, monthly after you start \n\ntreatment with Selincro; the actual frequency will depend on your progress. Together you will \ndecide how to continue.\n\n\n\n26\n\nIf you take more Selincro than you should\n\nIf you believe you have taken too many Selincro tablets, contact your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nIf you forget to take Selincro\n\nIf you have started drinking alcohol without taking Selincro, take one tablet as soon as possible.\n\nIf you stop taking Selincro\n\nAfter you stop treatment with Selincro, you may be less sensitive to the effects of medicines \ncontaining opioids for a few days.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nFew cases of side effects of seeing, hearing or sensing things that are not there or feeling detached \nfrom oneself have been reported. However, the frequency of  these side effects cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data.\n\nThe side effects reported with Selincro were mainly mild or moderate, occurred at the beginning of \ntreatment and lasted for a few hours to a few days.\nIf you continue treatment with Selincro, or start again after a break in treatment, you will probably not \nhave side effects.\nIn some cases, it may be difficult for you to distinguish side effects from the symptoms you may feel \nwhen you reduce your alcohol consumption.\n\nThe following side effects have been reported with Selincro:\n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)\n- feeling sick\n- dizziness\n- inability to sleep\n- headache\n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)\n- loss of appetite\n- difficulty sleeping, confusion, feeling restless, reduced sex drive\n- drowsiness, body twitches, feeling less alert, peculiar sensation in the skin like pins and needles, \n\nreduced sense of touch\n- racing heart, a sensation of a rapid, forceful, or irregular beating of the heart\n- vomiting, dry mouth, diarrhoea\n- excessive sweating\n- muscle spasms\n- feeling of exhaustion, weakness, discomfort or uneasiness, feeling strange\n- weight loss\n\n\n\n27\n\nOther side effects (cannot be estimated from the available data)\n- seeing, hearing or sensing things that are not there\n- feeling detached from oneself\n- swelling of face, lips, tongue or throat\n- hives\n- itching\n- rash\n- redness of skin\n- muscle pain\n- prolonged erection (priapism)\n\nReporting of side effects\n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
