NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nALISADE 27.5 micrograms/spray  \nnasal spray suspension \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach spray actuation delivers 27.5 micrograms of fluticasone furoate. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nNasal spray, suspension. \n \nWhite suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAdults, adolescents (12 years and over) and children (6 – 11 years)  \n \nAlisade is indicated for the treatment of: \n• the symptoms of allergic rhinitis \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nFluticasone furoate nasal spray is for administration by the intranasal route only.  \n \nFor full therapeutic benefit regular, scheduled usage is recommended. Onset of action has been \nobserved as early as 8 hours after initial administration. However, it may take several days of \ntreatment to achieve maximum benefit, and the patient should be informed that their symptoms will \nimprove with continuous regular use (see section 5.1). The duration of treatment should be restricted \nto the period that corresponds to allergenic exposure. \n \nAdults and Adolescents (12 years and over) \nThe recommended starting dose is two spray actuations (27.5 micrograms of fluticasone furoate per \nspray actuation) in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 110 micrograms).  \n \nOnce adequate control of symptoms is achieved, dose reduction to one spray actuation in each nostril \n(total daily dose 55 micrograms) may be effective for maintenance. \n The dose should be titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of symptoms is maintained. \n \nChildren (6 to 11 years of age) \nThe recommended starting dose is one spray actuation (27.5 micrograms of fluticasone furoate per \nspray actuation) in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 55 micrograms).  \n \nPatients not adequately responding to one spray actuation in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, \n55 micrograms) may use two spray actuations in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, \n110 micrograms). Once adequate control of symptoms is achieved, dose reduction to one spray \nactuation in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 55 micrograms) is recommended. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner \nau\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n3 \n\nChildren under 6 years of age: The experience in children under the age of 6 years is limited (see \nsection 5.1 and 5.2). Safety and efficacy in this group has not been well established. \n \nElderly Patients: No dose adjustment is required in this population (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal Impaired Patients: No dose adjustment is required in this population (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic Impaired Patients: No dose adjustment is required in mild to moderate hepatic impairment. \nThere are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nThe intranasal device should be shaken before use. The device is primed by pressing the mist release \nbutton for at least six spray actuations (until a fine mist is seen), whilst holding the device upright. Re-\npriming (approximately 6 sprays until a fine mist is seen) is only necessary if the cap is left off for 5 \ndays or the intranasal device has not been used for 30 days or more. \nThe device should be cleaned after each use and the cap replaced. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of Alisade. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFluticasone furoate undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, therefore the systemic exposure of \nintranasal fluticasone furoate in patients with severe liver disease is likely to be increased. This may \nresult in a higher frequency of systemic adverse events (see section 4.2 and 5.2). Caution is advised \nwhen treating these patients. \n \nRitonavir \nConcomitant administration with ritonavir is not recommended because of the risk of increased \nsystemic exposure of fluticasone furoate (see section 4.5). \n \nSystemic effects of nasal corticosteroid may occur, particularly at high doses prescribed for prolonged \nperiods. These effects vary between patients and different corticosteroids (see section 5.2). \n \nTreatment with higher than recommended doses of nasal corticosteroids may result in clinically \nsignificant adrenal suppression. If there is evidence for higher than recommended doses being used, \nthen additional systemic corticosteroid cover should be considered during periods of stress or elective \nsurgery.  Fluticasone furoate 110 micrograms once daily was not associated with hypothalamic-\npituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression in adult, adolescent or paediatric subjects. However the dose \nof intranasal fluticasone furoate should be reduced to the lowest dose at which effective control of the \nsymptoms of rhinitis is maintained. As with all intranasal corticosteroids, the total systemic burden of \ncorticosteroids should be considered whenever other forms of corticosteroid treatment are prescribed \nconcurrently. \n \nGrowth retardation has been reported in children receiving some nasal corticosteroids at licensed \ndoses. It is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with nasal \ncorticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be reviewed with the aim of \nreducing the dose of nasal corticosteroid if possible, to the lowest dose at which effective control of \nsymptoms is maintained. In addition, consideration should be given to referring the patient to a \npaediatric specialist (see section 5.1). \n \nIf there is any reason to believe that adrenal function is impaired, care must be taken when transferring \npatients from systemic steroid treatment to fluticasone furoate. \n \nNasal and inhaled corticosteriods may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. \nTherefore close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history if \nincreased pressure, glaucoma and/or cataracts. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner \nau\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n4 \n\n \nAlisade contains benzalkonium chloride. It may cause irritation of the nasal mucosa. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFluticasone furoate is rapidly cleared by extensive first pass metabolism mediated by the cytochrome \nP450 3A4.  \n \nBased on data with another glucocorticoid (fluticasone propionate), that is metabolised by CYP3A4, \nco-administration with ritonavir is not recommended because of the risk of increased systemic \nexposure of fluticasone furoate. \n \nCaution is recommended when co-administering fluticasone furoate with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors as \nan increase in systemic exposure cannot be ruled out. In a drug interaction study of intranasal \nfluticasone furoate with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole there were more subjects with \nmeasurable fluticasone furoate concentrations in the ketoconazole group (6 of the 20 subjects) \ncompared to placebo (1 out of 20 subjects). This small increase in exposure did not result in a \nstatistically significant difference in 24 hour serum cortisol levels between the two groups (see section \n4.4). \n \nThe enzyme induction and inhibition data suggest that there is no theoretical basis for anticipating \nmetabolic interactions between fluticasone furoate and the cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism of \nother compounds at clinically relevant intranasal doses. Therefore, no clinical studies have been \nconducted to investigate interactions of fluticasone furoate on other drugs. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of fluticasone furoate in pregnant women. In animal studies \nglucocorticoids have been shown to induce malformations including cleft palate and intra-uterine \ngrowth retardation. This is not likely to be relevant for humans given recommended nasal doses which \nresults in minimal systemic exposure (see section 5.2). Fluticasone furoate should be used in \npregnancy only if the benefits to the mother outweigh the potential risks to the foetus or child. \n \nIt is unknown whether nasal administered fluticasone furoate is excreted in human breast milk. \nAdministration of fluticasone furoate to women who are breastfeeding should only be considered if the \nexpected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the child.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed as fluticasone \nfuroate is not expected to affect this ability. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nData from large clinical trials were used to determine the frequency of adverse reactions.  \nThe following convention has been used for the classification of frequencies: Very common >1/10; \nCommon >1/100 to <1/10; Uncommon >1/1000 to <1/100; Rare >1/10,000 to <1/1000; Very rare \n<1/10,000. \n \n\nImmune system disorders \nRare Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and \n\nurticaria. \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nVery common *Epistaxis \nCommon Nasal ulceration \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner \nau\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n5 \n\n \n \n*Epistaxis was generally mild to moderate in intensity. In adults and adolescents, the incidence of \nepistaxis was higher in longer-term use (more than 6 weeks) than in short-term use (up to 6 weeks).  In \npaediatric clinical studies of up to 12 weeks duration the incidence of epistaxis was similar between \npatients receiving fluticasone furoate and patients receiving placebo. \n \nSystemic effects of nasal corticosteroids may occur, particularly when prescribed at high doses for \nprolonged periods. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn a bioavailability study, intranasal doses of up to 2640 micrograms per day were administered over \nthree days with no adverse systemic effects observed (see section 5.2). \nAcute overdose is unlikely to require any therapy other than observation. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Corticosteroids. ATC code: R01AD12 \n \nFluticasone furoate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid that possesses a very high affinity for the \nglucocorticoid receptor and has a potent anti-inflammatory action. \n \nClinical experience: \nSeasonal Allergic Rhinitis in adults and adolescents \nCompared with placebo, fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily significantly \nimproved nasal symptoms (comprising rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion, sneezing and nasal itching) and \nocular symptoms (comprising itching/burning, tearing/watering and redness of the eyes) in all 4 \nstudies. Efficacy was maintained over the full 24-hours dosing period with once daily administration. \n \nOnset of therapeutic benefit was observed as early as 8 hours after initial administration, with further \nimprovement observed for several days afterwards.   \nFluticasone furoate nasal spray significantly improved the patients’ perception of overall response to \ntherapy, and the patients’ disease-related quality of life (Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life \nQuestionnaire – RQLQ), in all 4 studies. \n \nPerennial Allergic Rhinitis in adults and adolescents: \nFluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily significantly improved nasal symptoms as \nwell as patients’ perception of overall response to therapy compared to placebo in three studies.  \nFluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily significantly improved ocular symptoms as \nwell as improving patients’ disease-related quality of life (RQLQ) compared to placebo in one study. \nEfficacy was maintained over the full 24-hour dosing period with once daily administration.  \n \nSeasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis in children: \nThe paediatric posology is based on assessment of the efficacy data across the allergic rhinitis \npopulation in children. \nIn seasonal allergic rhinitis, fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily was effective \nbut no significant differences were observed between fluticasone furoate nasal spray 55 micrograms \nonce daily and placebo on any endpoint. \nIn perennial allergic rhinitis, fluticasone furoate nasal spray 55 micrograms once daily exhibited a \nmore consistent efficacy profile than fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily over 4 \nweeks’ treatment. Post-hoc analysis over 6 and 12 weeks in the same study, as well as 6-week HPA \naxis safety study, supported the efficacy of fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner \nau\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n6 \n\nA 6-week study that assessed the effect of fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily \non adrenal function in children aged 2 to 11 years showed that there was no significant effect on 24-\nhour serum cortisol profiles, compared with placebo. \nResults from a placebo-controlled knemometry study of fluticasone furoate nasal spray \n110 micrograms once daily revealed no clinically relevant effects on short-term lower leg growth rate \nin children (6 to 11 years). \n \nSeasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis in children (under 6 years): \nSafety and efficacy studies were performed in a total of 271 patients from 2 to 5 years of age in both \nseasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, of whom 176 were exposed to fluticasone furoate. \n Safety and efficacy in this group has not been well established. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption: Fluticasone furoate undergoes incomplete absorption and extensive first-pass metabolism \nin the liver and gut resulting in negligible systemic exposure. The intranasal dosing of 110 micrograms \nonce daily does not typically result in measurable plasma concentrations (<10 pg/ml). The absolute \nbioavailability for intranasal fluticasone furoate is 0.50 %, such that less than 1 microgram of \nfluticasone furoate would be systemically available after administration of 110 micrograms (see \nsection 4.9). \n \nDistribution: The plasma protein binding of fluticasone furoate is greater than 99 %. Fluticasone \nfuroate is widely distributed with volume of distribution at steady-state of, on average, 608 l.  \n \nMetabolism: Fluticasone furoate is rapidly cleared (total plasma clearance of 58.7 l/h) from systemic \ncirculation principally by hepatic metabolism to an inactive 17β-carboxylic metabolite (GW694301X), \nby the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4. The principal route of metabolism was hydrolysis of the S-\nfluoromethyl carbothioate function to form the 17β-carboxylic acid metabolite. In vivo studies have \nrevealed no evidence of cleavage of the furoate moiety to form fluticasone. \n \nElimination: Elimination was primarily via the faecal route following oral and intravenous \nadministration indicative of excretion of fluticasone furoate and its metabolites via the bile. Following \nintravenous administration, the elimination phase half-life averaged 15.1 hours. Urinary excretion \naccounted for approximately 1 % and 2 % of the orally and intravenously administered dose, \nrespectively. \n \nChildren:  \nIn the majority of patients fluticasone furoate is not quantifiable (< 10 pg/ml) following intranasal \ndosing of 110 micrograms once daily. Quantifiable levels were observed in 15.1 % of paediatric \npatients following intranasal dosing of 110 micrograms once daily and only 6.8 % of paediatric \npatients following 55 micrograms once daily.  There was no evidence for higher quantifiable levels of \nfluticasone furoate in younger children (less than 6 years of age). Median fluticasone furoate \nconcentrations in those subjects with quantifiable levels at 55 micrograms were 18.4 pg/ml and \n18.9 pg/ml for 2-5 yrs and 6-11 yrs, respectively. At 110 micrograms, median concentrations in those \nsubjects with quantifiable levels were 14.3 pg/ml and 14.4 pg/ml for 2-5 yrs and 6-11 yrs, respectively. \nThe values are similar to those seen in adults (12+) where median concentrations in those subjects \nwith quantifiable levels were 15.4 pg/ml and 21.8 pg/ml at 55 micrograms and 110 micrograms, \nrespectively. \n \nElderly: \nOnly a small number of elderly patients (≥ 65 years, n=23/872; 2.6 %) provided pharmacokinetic data. \nThere was no evidence for a higher incidence of patients with quantifiable fluticasone furoate \nconcentrations in the elderly, when compared with the younger patients. \n \nRenal Impairment:  \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner \nau\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n7 \n\nFluticasone furoate is not detectable in urine from healthy volunteers after intranasal dosing. Less than \n1 % of dose-related material is excreted in urine and therefore renal impairment would not be expected \nto affect the pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate. \n \nHepatic Impairment:  \nThere are no data with intranasal fluticasone furoate in patients with hepatic impairment. A study of a \nsingle 400 microgram dose of orally inhaled fluticasone furoate in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment resulted in increased Cmax (42 %) and AUC(0-∞) (172 %) and a modest (on average \n23 %) decrease in cortisol levels in patients compared to healthy subjects. From this study the average \npredicted exposure of 110 micrograms of intranasal fluticasone furoate in patients with moderate \nhepatic impairment would not be expected to result in suppression of cortisol. Therefore moderate \nhepatic impairment is not predicted to result in a clinically relevant effect for the normal adult dose. \nThere are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The exposure of fluticasone furoate is \nlikely to be further increased in such patients. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nFindings in general toxicology studies were similar to those observed with other glucocorticoids and \nare associated with exaggerated pharmacological activity. These findings are not likely to be relevant \nfor humans given recommended nasal doses which results in minimal systemic exposure. No \ngenotoxic effects of fluticasone furoate have been observed in conventional genotoxicity tests. Further, \nthere were no treatment-related increases in the incidence of tumours in two year inhalation studies in \nrats and mice. \n \n \n6.

Further information \n\nStep-by-step guide to using the nasal spray \n \n \n1. WHAT ALISADE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nAlisade nasal spray is used to treat symptoms of allergic rhinitis including stuffy, runny or itchy nose, \nsneezing and watery, itchy or red eyes, in adults and children aged 6 years and over. \n \nAllergy symptoms can occur at specific times of the year and be caused by allergy to pollen from grass \nor trees (hayfever), or they can occur all year round and be caused by allergy to animals, house-dust \nmites or moulds.  \n \nAlisade belongs to a group of medicines called glucocorticoids. \nAlisade works to decrease inflammation caused by allergy (rhinitis).  \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE ALISADE \n \nDo not use Alisade: \nIf you are allergic (hypersensitive) to fluticasone furoate or any of the other ingredients of Alisade. \n \nTake special care with Alisade: \nIf you have any liver problems, tell your doctor or pharmacist. Your doctor may adjust your dose of \nAlisade. \n \nTaking nasal glucocorticoids (such as Alisade): \n• may when taken for a long time cause children to grow more slowly. The doctor will check your \n\nchild’s height regularly, and make sure he or she is taking the lowest possible effective dose. \n• may cause eye conditions such as glaucoma (increase in pressure in the eye) or cataracts \n\n(clouding of the lens of the eye).  Tell your doctor if you had these conditions in the past, or if \nyou notice any change in your vision while you are taking Alisade \n\n \nTaking other medicines \nTell your doctor if you are taking, or have recently taken, any other medicines, including those bought \nwithout a prescription.  \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner \nau\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n19 \n\nIt is especially important to tell your doctor if you are taking, or have recently taken any of the \nfollowing medicines: \n• steroid tablets or injected steroids \n• steroid creams \n• medicines for asthma \n• ritonavir, used to treat HIV  \n• ketoconazole, used to treat fungal infections  \n \nYour doctor will assess whether you should take Alisade with these medicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAsk your doctor for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDo not use Alisade if you are pregnant, or planning to become pregnant, unless your doctor or \npharmacist tells you to. \n \nDo not use Alisade if you are breast feeding unless your doctor or pharmacist tells you to. \n \nDriving and using machines \nAlisade is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Alisade \nAlisade contains benzalkonium chloride. In some patients this can cause irritation in the inside of the \nnose. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you feel discomfort when using the spray. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE ALISADE  \n \nAlways use Alisade exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you are \nnot sure. \n \nAlisade has virtually no taste or smell. It is sprayed into the nose as a fine mist. Be careful not to get \nany spray into your eyes. If you do, rinse your eyes with water. \n \nWhen to use Alisade \n• Use once a day \n• Use at the same time each day. \nThis will treat your symptoms throughout the day and night. \n \nHow long Alisade takes to work \nSome people will not feel the full effects until several days after first using Alisade. However, it is \nusually effective within 8 to 24 hours of use. \n \nHow much to use \n\nAdults and children 12 years and over \n• The usual starting dose is 2 sprays in each nostril once every day.  \n• Once symptoms are controlled you may be able to decrease your dose to 1 spray in each nostril, \n\nonce every day. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner \nau\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n20 \n\nChildren 6 to 11 years  \n• The usual starting dose is 1 spray in each nostril once a day.  \n• If symptoms are very bad your doctor may increase the dose to 2 sprays in each nostril once \n\nevery day until the symptoms are under control. It may then be possible for the dose to be \nreduced to 1 spray in each nostril once every day. \n\n• Do not use in children under 6 years old. \n\nHow to use the nasal spray \nThere is a step-by-step guide to using the nasal spray after Section 6 of this leaflet. Follow the guide \ncarefully to get full benefit from using Alisade \n\nSee Step-by-step guide to using the nasal spray, after Section 6. \n \n \nIf you use more Alisade than you should \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIf you forget to use AlisadeIf you miss a dose, take it when you remember. \n \nIf it is nearly the time for your next dose, wait until then. Do not take a double dose to make up for a \nforgotten dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, or if you have any discomfort using the \nnasal spray ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Alisade can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nAllergic reactions: get a doctor’s help straight away \n \nAllergic reactions to Alisade are rare and affect less than 1 person in 1,000. In a small number of \npeople, allergic reactions can develop into a more serious, even life-threatening problem if not treated. \nSymptoms include: \n\n- becoming very wheezy, coughing or having difficulty with breathing \n- suddenly feeling weak or light-headed (which may lead to collapse or loss of consciousness) \n- swelling around the face \n- skin rashes or redness. \n\nIn many cases, these symptoms will be signs of less serious side effects. But you must be aware that \nthey are potentially serious — so, if you notice any of these symptoms: \n\nSee a doctor as soon as possible. \n \nVery common side effects (These can affect more than 1 person in 10)  \n• Nosebleeds (generally minor), particularly if you use Alisade for more than 6 weeks continuously. \n \nCommon side effects (These can affect less than 1 person in 10 and more than 1 person in 100) \n• Irritation or discomfort in the inside of the nose – you may also get streaks of blood when you blow \n\nyour nose. This may be due to nasal ulceration. \n \nNasal corticosteroids can affect the normal production of hormones in your body, particularly if you \nuse high doses for a long time. In children this side effect can cause them to grow more slowly than \nothers.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner \nau\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n21 \n\nIf you get side effects \nIf any of the side effects gets serious or troublesome, or if you notice any side effects not \n\nlisted in this leaflet: Tell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n5. HOW TO STORE ALISADE \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \nIt is best to store your Alisade nasal spray upright. Always keep the cap on. \n \nDo not use Alisade after the expiry date which is stated on the label and carton. The expiry date refers \nto the last day of the month. Alisade nasal spray should be used within 2 months after first opening. \n \nDo not refrigerate or freeze. \n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste.

It will contain \neither 30, 60 or 120 sprays, depending on the pack size that has been prescribed for you. \n \n\n \n \nThe window in the plastic casing lets you see how much Alisade is left in the bottle. You will be able \nto see the liquid level for a new 30 or 60 spray bottle, but not in a new 120 spray bottle because the \nliquid level is above the window.  \n\nSix important things you need to know about using the nasal spray \n\n• Alisade comes in a brown bottle. If you need to check how much is left hold the nasal spray \nupright against a bright light. You will then be able to see the level through the window.   \n\n• When you first use the nasal spray you will need to shake it vigorously with the cap on for \nabout 10 seconds. This is important as Alisade is a thick suspension that becomes liquid when \nyou shake it well - see picture b. It will only spray when it becomes liquid. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner \nau\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n25 \n\n• The mist-release button must be pressed firmly all the way in, to release the mist through the \nnozzle - see picture c.  \n\n \n\n \n• If you have difficulty pressing the button with your thumb, you can use two hands – see picture \n\nd \n \n\n \n \n\n• Always keep the cap on the nasal spray when you are not using it. The cap keeps the dust out, \nseals in the pressure and stops the nozzle from blocking up. When the cap is in place the mist-\nrelease button cannot be pressed accidentally. \n\n• Never use a pin or anything sharp to clear the nozzle. It will damage the nasal spray. \n\n \n\nPreparing the nasal spray for use \n \nYou must prepare the nasal spray: \n \n• before you use it for the first time \n\n• if you have left the cap off \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner \nau\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n26 \n\nPreparing the nasal spray helps to make sure you always get the full dose of medicine. Follow these \nsteps: \n\n1 Shake the nasal spray vigorously with the cap on for about 10 seconds.   \n\n2 Remove the cap by squeezing firmly on the sides of the cap with your thumb and forefinger– \nsee picture e.  \n\n \n \n3 Hold the nasal spray upright, then tilt and point the nozzle away from you.  \n\n4 Press the button firmly all the way in. Do this at least 6 times until it releases a fine mist of \nspray into the air  – see picture f. \n\n \n \nThe nasal spray is now ready for use. \n\n \nUsing the nasal spray \n\n1 Shake the nasal spray vigorously.  \n\n2 Remove the cap.  \n\n3 Blow your nose to clear your nostrils, then tilt your head forward a little bit. \n\n4 Place the nozzle in one of your nostrils – see picture g.  Point the end of the nozzle slightly \noutwards, away from the centre ridge of your nose. This helps to get the medicine to the correct part of \nyour nose. \n\n5 Press the button firmly all the way in, while you breathe in through your nose – see picture \nh.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner \nau\n\ntho\nris\n\ned\n\n27 \n\n \n6 Take the nozzle out and breathe out through your mouth. \n\n7 If your dose is two sprays in each nostril repeat steps 4 to 6. \n\n8 Repeat steps 4 to 7 to treat the other nostril. \n\n9 Replace the cap on the nasal spray. \n\n \nCleaning the nasal spray \n\nAfter each use: \n\n1 Wipe the nozzle and inside of the cap with a clean, dry tissue – see pictures i and j.  \n\n \n2 Do not use water to clean it.  \n\n3 Never use a pin or anything sharp on the nozzle.  \n\n4 Always replace the cap once you have finished. \n\n If the nasal spray does not seem to be working: \n\n• Check you still have medicine left. Look at the level through the window. If the level is very \nlow there may not be enough left to work the nasal spray. \n\n• Check the nasal spray for damage  \n\n• If you think the nozzle may be blocked, do not use a pin or anything sharp to clear it.  \n\n• Try to reset it by following the instructions under ‘Preparing the nasal spray for use’.  \n\nIf it is still not working, or if it produces a jet of liquid, take the nasal spray back to the \npharmacy to get advice. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
