NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nLyxumia 10 micrograms solution for injection \n\nLyxumia 20 micrograms solution for injection \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nLyxumia 10 micrograms solution for injection \n\nEach dose (0.2 ml) contains 10 micrograms (mcg) of lixisenatide (50 mcg per ml). \n \n\nLyxumia 20 micrograms solution for injection \n\nEach dose (0.2 ml) contains 20 micrograms (mcg) of lixisenatide (100 mcg per ml). \n \n\nExcipient(s) with known effects \n\nEach dose contains 540 micrograms of metacresol. \n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nSolution for injection (injection). \n\nClear, colourless solution.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nLyxumia is indicated for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus to achieve glycaemic \n\ncontrol in combination with oral glucose-lowering medicinal products and/or basal insulin when these, \n\ntogether, with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control (see sections 4.4 and 5.1 \n\nfor available data on the different combinations). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nStarting dose: dosing is initiated at 10 mcg lixisenatide once daily for 14 days. \nMaintenance dose: a fixed maintenance dose of 20 mcg lixisenatide once daily is started on Day 15.   \n\nFor the starting dose Lyxumia 10 micrograms solution for injection is available. \n\nFor the maintenance dose Lyxumia 20 micrograms solution for injection is available. \n \n\nWhen Lyxumia is added to existing metformin therapy, the current metformin dose can be continued \n\nunchanged. \nWhen Lyxumia is added to existing therapy of a sulphonylurea or a basal insulin, a reduction in the \n\ndose of the sulphonylurea or the basal insulin may be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. \n\nLyxumia should not be given in combination with basal insulin and a sulphonylurea due to increased \nrisk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4).  \n\nThe use of Lyxumia does not require specific blood glucose monitoring. However, when used in \n\ncombination with a sulphonylurea or a basal insulin, blood glucose monitoring or blood glucose \n\nself-monitoring may become necessary to adjust the doses of the sulphonylurea or the basal insulin. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly  \nNo dose adjustment is required based on age. \n\n \n\nPatients with renal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.  \n\nThere is no therapeutic experience in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less \n\nthan 30 ml/min) or end-stage renal disease and therefore, it is not recommended to use lixisenatide in \n\nthese populations (see section 5.2). \n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2) \n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of lixisenatide in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age have not \n\nyet been established. No data are available. \n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nLyxumia is to be injected subcutaneously in the thigh, abdomen or upper arm. Lyxumia should not be \nadministered intravenously or intramuscularly. \n\n \n\nThe injection is administered once daily, within the hour prior to any meal of the day. It is preferable \nthat the prandial injection of Lyxumia is performed before the same meal every day, when the most \n\nconvenient meal has been chosen. If a dose is missed, it should be injected within the hour prior to the \n\nnext meal.  \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nThere is no therapeutic experience with lixisenatide in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and it \nshould not be used in these patients. Lixisenatide should not be used for treatment of diabetic \n\nketoacidosis. \n\n \nAcute pancreatitis  \n\nUse of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists has been associated with a risk of \n\ndeveloping acute pancreatitis. There have been few reported events of acute pancreatitis with \n\nlixisenatide although a causal relationship has not been established. Patients should be informed of the \ncharacteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis: persistent, severe abdominal pain. If pancreatitis is \n\nsuspected, lixisenatide should be discontinued ; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, lixisenatide should \n\nnot be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of pancreatitis. \n \n\nSevere gastrointestinal disease \n\nUse of GLP-1 receptor agonists may be associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Lixisenatide \n\nhas not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, including severe gastroparesis and \ntherefore, the use of lixisenatide is not recommended in these patients. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \nThere is no therapeutic experience in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less \n\nthan 30 ml/min) or end-stage renal disease. Use is not recommended in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nHypoglycaemia \n\nPatients receiving Lyxumia with a sulphonylurea or with a basal insulin may have an increased risk of \nhypoglycaemia. Reduction of the dose of the sulphonylurea or the basal insulin may be considered to \n\nreduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.2). Lixisenatide should not be given in combination \n\nwith basal insulin and a sulphonylurea due to increased risk of hypoglycaemia. \n \n\nConcomitant medicinal products \n\nThe delay of gastric emptying with lixisenatide may reduce the rate of absorption of orally \n\nadministered medicinal products. Lixisenatide should be used with caution in patients receiving oral \nmedicinal products that require rapid gastrointestinal absorption, require careful clinical monitoring or \n\nhave a narrow therapeutic ratio. Specific recommendations regarding intake of such medicinal \n\nproducts are given in section 4.5. \n \n\nPopulations not studied \n\nLixisenatide has not been studied in combination with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. \n\n \nDehydration \n\nPatients treated with lixisenatide should be advised of the potential risk of dehydration in relation to \n\ngastrointestinal adverse reactions and take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. \n \n\nExcipients \n\nThis medicinal product contains metacresol, which may cause allergic reactions.  \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n\n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nLixisenatide is a peptide and is not metabolised by cytochrome P450. In in vitro studies, lixisenatide \n\ndid not affect the activity of cytochrome P450 isozymes or human transporters tested. \nThe delay of gastric emptying with lixisenatide may reduce the rate of absorption of orally \n\nadministered medicinal products. Patients receiving medicinal products of either a narrow therapeutic \n\nratio or medicinal products that require careful clinical monitoring should be followed closely, \nespecially at the time of initiation of lixisenatide treatment. These medicinal products should be taken \n\nin a standardised way in relation to lixisenatide. If such medicinal products are to be administered with \n\nfood, patients should be advised to, if possible, take them with a meal when lixisenatide is not \n\nadministered. \nFor oral medicinal products that are particularly dependent on threshold concentrations for efficacy, \n\nsuch as antibiotics, patients should be advised to take those medicinal products at least 1 hour before \n\nor 4 hours after lixisenatide injection. \nGastro-resistant formulations containing substances sensitive to stomach degradation, should be \n\nadministered 1 hour before or 4 hours after lixisenatide injection. \n\n \nParacetamol \n\nParacetamol was used as a model medicinal product to evaluate the effect of lixisenatide on gastric \n\nemptying. Following administration of a single dose of paracetamol 1,000 mg, paracetamol AUC and \n\nt1/2 were unchanged whatever the timing of its administration (before or after the lixisenatide \ninjection). When administered 1 or 4 hours after 10 mcg lixisenatide, Cmax of paracetamol was \n\ndecreased by 29% and 31% respectively and median tmax was delayed by 2.0 and 1.75 hours \n\nrespectively. A further delay in tmax and a reduced Cmax of paracetamol have been predicted with the \n20 mcg maintenance dose. \n\nNo effects on paracetamol Cmax and tmax were observed when paracetamol was administered 1 hour \n\nbefore lixisenatide. \nBased on these results, no dose adjustment for paracetamol is required but the delayed tmax observed \n\nwhen paracetamol is administered 1-4 hours after lixisenatide should be taken into account when a \n\nrapid onset of action is required for efficacy. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nOral contraceptives  \n\nFollowing administration of a single dose of an oral contraceptive medicinal product (ethinylestradiol \n0.03 mg/levonorgestrel 0.15 mg) 1 hour before or 11 hours after 10 mcg lixisenatide, the Cmax, AUC, \n\nt1/2 and tmax of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel were unchanged. \n\nAdministration of the oral contraceptive 1 hour or 4 hours after lixisenatide did not affect AUC and t1/2 \nof ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel, whereas Cmax of ethinylestradiol was decreased by 52% and \n\n39% respectively and Cmax of levonorgestrel was decreased by 46% and 20%, respectively and median \n\ntmax was delayed by 1 to 3 hours. \n\nThe reduction in Cmax is of limited clinical relevance and no dose adjustment for oral contraceptives is \nrequired. \n\n \n\nAtorvastatin \nWhen lixisenatide 20 mcg and atorvastatin 40 mg were co-administered in the morning for 6 days, the \n\nexposure to atorvastatin was not affected, while Cmax was decreased by 31% and tmax was delayed by \n\n3.25 hours. \n\nNo such increase for tmax was observed when atorvastatin was administered in the evening and \nlixisenatide in the morning but the AUC and Cmax of atorvastatin were increased by 27% and 66%, \n\nrespectively. \n\nThese changes are not clinically relevant and therefore, no dose adjustment for atorvastatin is required \nwhen co-administered with lixisenatide. \n\n \n\nWarfarin and other coumarin derivatives \nAfter concomitant administration of warfarin 25 mg with repeated dosing of lixisenatide 20 mcg, there \n\nwere no effects on AUC or INR (International Normalised Ratio) while Cmax was reduced by 19% and \n\ntmax was delayed by 7 hours. \n\nBased on these results, no dose adjustment for warfarin is required when co-administered with \nlixisenatide; however, frequent monitoring of INR in patients on warfarin and/or coumarin derivatives \n\nis recommended at the time of initiation or ending of lixisenatide treatment. \n\n \nDigoxin \n\nAfter concomitant administration of lixisenatide 20 mcg and digoxin 0.25 mg at steady state, the AUC \n\nof digoxin was not affected. The tmax of digoxin was delayed by 1.5 hour and the Cmax was reduced by \n26%. \n\nBased on these results, no dose adjustment for digoxin is required when co-administered with \n\nlixisenatide. \n\n \nRamipril \n\nAfter concomitant administration of lixisenatide 20 mcg and ramipril 5 mg during 6 days, the AUC of \n\nramipril was increased by 21% while the Cmax was decreased by 63%. The AUC and Cmax of the active \nmetabolite (ramiprilat) were not affected. The tmax of ramipril and ramiprilat were delayed by \n\napproximately 2.5 hours. \n\nBased on these results, no dose adjustment for ramipril is required when co-administered with \n\nlixisenatide. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \nLyxumia is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of Lyxumia in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \n\nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Lyxumia \n\nshould not be used during pregnancy. The use of insulin is recommended instead. If a patient wishes to \nbecome pregnant, or pregnancy occurs, treatment with Lyxumia should be discontinued. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown if Lyxumia is excreted in human milk. Lyxumia should not be used during \n\nbreast-feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to fertility. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nLixisenatide has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. When used in \n\ncombination with a sulphonylurea or a basal insulin, patients should be advised to take precautions to \navoid hypoglycaemia while driving and using machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nOver 2,600 patients have received Lyxumia either alone or in combination with metformin, a \nsulphonylurea (with or without metformin) or a basal insulin (with or without metformin, or with or \n\nwithout a sulphonylurea) in 8 large placebo- or active-controlled phase III studies. \n\n  \n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions during clinical studies were nausea, vomiting and \n\ndiarrhoea. These reactions were mostly mild and transient. \n\nIn addition, hypoglycaemia (when Lyxumia was used in combination with a sulphonylurea and/or a \n\nbasal insulin) and headache occurred. \n\nAllergic reactions have been reported in 0.4% of Lyxumia patients. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions reported from placebo- and active-controlled phase III studies over the entire \n\ntreatment period are presented in Table 1. The table presents adverse reactions that occurred with an \n\nincidence >5% if the frequency was higher among Lyxumia treated patients than patients treated with \n\nall comparators. The table also includes adverse reactions with a frequency \u22651% in the Lyxumia group \n\nif the frequency was greater than 2 times the frequency for all comparators group. \n\n \nFrequencies of adverse reactions are defined as: very common: \u22651/10; common: \u22651/100 to <1/10; \n\nuncommon: \u22651/1,000 to <1/100; rare: \u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000; very rare: <1/10,000). \n\nWithin each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions reported in placebo- and active-controlled phase III studies during the \n\nentire treatment period (including the period beyond the main 24-week treatment period in studies \nwith \u226576 weeks of total treatment). \n\n \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency of occurrence \n\n Very common Common Uncommon \n\nInfections and \n\ninfestations \n\n Influenza  \n\n Upper respiratory tract \n\ninfection \n\n \n\n Cystitis  \n\n Viral infection  \n\nImmune system \n\ndisorders \n\n  Anaphylactic reaction \n\nMetabolism and \n\nnutrition disorders \n\nHypoglycaemia (in \n\ncombination with a \n\nsulphonylurea and / or \n\na basal insulin) \n\nHypoglycaemia (in \n\ncombination with \n\nmetformin alone) \n\n \n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders \n\nHeadache Dizziness  \n\n Somnolence  \n\n   \n\nGastrointestinal \n\ndisorders \n\nNausea Dyspepsia  \n\nVomiting   \n\nDiarrhoea   \n\n   \n\nSkin and \n\nsubcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\n  Urticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal and \n\nconnective tissue \n\ndisorders \n\n Back pain  \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site \n\nconditions \n\n Injection site pruritus  \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia \n\nIn patients taking Lyxumia in monotherapy, symptomatic hypoglycaemia occurred in 1.7% of \n\nlixisenatide treated patients and in 1.6% of placebo treated patients. When Lyxumia is used in \n\ncombination with metformin alone, symptomatic hypoglycaemia occurred in 7.0% of lixisenatide \npatients and in 4.8% of placebo patients during the entire treatment period. \n\n \n\nIn patients taking Lyxumia in combination with a sulphonylurea and metformin, symptomatic \nhypoglycaemia occurred in 22.0% of lixisenatide treated patients and in 18.4% of placebo treated \n\npatients during the entire treatment period (3.6% absolute difference). When Lyxumia is used in \n\ncombination with a basal insulin with or without metformin, symptomatic hypoglycaemia occurred in \n42.1% of lixisenatide patients and in 38.9% of placebo patients during the entire treatment period \n\n(3.2% absolute difference). \n\n \nDuring the entire treatment period, when Lyxumia was given with a sulphonylurea alone, symptomatic \n\nhypoglycaemia occurred in 22.7% of lixisenatide treated patients versus 15.2% with placebo (7.5% \n\nabsolute difference). When Lyxumia was given with a sulphonylurea and a basal insulin, symptomatic \nhypoglycaemia occurred in 47.2% of lixisenatide treated patients compared to 21.6% with placebo \n\n(25.6% absolute difference). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nOverall, the incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycaemia was uncommon (0.4% in lixisenatide \n\npatients and 0.2% in placebo patients) during the entire treatment period of the Phase III \nplacebo-controlled studies. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nNausea and vomiting were the most frequently reported adverse reactions during the main 24-week \n\ntreatment period. The incidence of nausea was higher in the lixisenatide group (26.1%) compared to \n\nthe placebo group (6.2%) and the incidence of vomiting was higher in the lixisenatide group (10.5%) \n\nthan in the placebo group (1.8%). They were mostly mild and transient and occurred during the first \n\n3 weeks after starting treatment. Thereafter, they progressively decreased during the following weeks. \n\n \n\nInjection site reactions \n\nInjections site reactions were reported in 3.9% of the patients receiving Lyxumia while they were \n\nreported in 1.4% of patients receiving placebo during the main 24-week treatment period. The \n\nmajority of reactions were mild in intensity and usually did not result in discontinuation of the \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity  \n\nConsistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of medicinal products containing proteins or \npeptides, patients may develop anti-lixisenatide antibodies following treatment with Lyxumia and, at \n\nthe end of the main 24-week treatment period in placebo-controlled studies, 69.8% of lixisenatide \n\npatients had a positive antibody status. The percentage of patients who were antibody positive was \nsimilar at the end of the entire 76-week treatment period. At the end of the main 24-week treatment \n\nperiod, 32.2% of the patients having a positive antibody status had an antibody concentration above \n\nthe lower limit of quantification, and at the end of the entire 76-week treatment period, 44.7% of the \n\npatients had an antibody concentration above the lower limit of quantification. After stopping the \ntreatment, few antibody positive patients were followed-up for antibody status; the percentage \n\ndecreased to approximately 90% within 3 months and 30% at 6 months or beyond. \n\nThe change in HbA1c from baseline was similar regardless of the antibody status (positive or negative). \n\nOf lixisenatide-treated patients with HbA1c measurement, 79.3% had either a negative antibody status \n\nor an antibody concentration below the lower limit of quantification and the other 20.7% of patients \n\nhad a quantified antibody concentration. In the subset of patients (5.2%) with the highest antibody \n\nconcentrations, the mean improvement in HbA1c at Week 24 and at Week 76 was in a clinically \n\nrelevant range; however there was variability in the glycaemic response and 1.9% had no decrease in \n\nHbA1c. \n\nThe antibody status (positive or negative) is not predictive of the reduction of HbA1c for an individual \n\npatient. \n\n \n\nThere was no difference in the overall safety profile in patients regardless of the antibody status with \n\nthe exception of an increase of the incidence of injection site reactions (4.7% in antibody positive \n\npatients compared to 2.5% in antibody-negative patients during the entire treatment period). The \n\nmajority of injection site reactions were mild, regardless of antibody status. \n\n \n\nThere was no cross-reactivity versus either native glucagon or endogenous GLP-1. \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions \n\nAllergic reactions possibly associated with lixisenatide (such as anaphylactic reaction, angioedema \n\nand urticaria) have been reported in 0.4% of lixisenatide patients while possibly associated allergic \n\nreactions occurred in less than 0.1% of placebo patients during the main 24-week treatment period. \n\nAnaphylactic reactions were reported in 0.2% of the lixisenatide treated patients vs. none in the \n\nplacebo group. Most of these reported allergic reactions were mild in severity. \n\nOne case of anaphylactoid reaction was reported during clinical trials with lixisenatide. \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nHeart rate \n\nIn a study in healthy volunteers, a transient rise in heart rate has been observed after administration of \n\nlixisenatide 20 mcg.  Cardiac arrhythmias particularly tachycardia (0.8% vs <0.1%) and palpitations \n\n(1.5% vs 0.8%) have been reported in lixisenatide patients compared to placebo treated patients. \n\n \n\nWithdrawal \n\nThe incidence of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was 7.4% for Lyxumia compared to \n\n3.2% in the placebo group during the main 24-week treatment period. The most common adverse \n\nreactions which led to treatment discontinuation in the lixisenatide group were nausea (3.1%) and \n\nvomiting (1.2%). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nDuring clinical studies, doses up to 30 mcg of lixisenatide twice a day were administered to type 2 \n\ndiabetic patients in a 13-week study. An increased incidence of gastrointestinal disorders was \n\nobserved. \n\nIn case of overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient\u2019s \n\nclinical signs and symptoms and the lixisenatide dose should be reduced to the prescribed dose. \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in Diabetes, Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues, \n\nATC code: A10BJ03  \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nLixisenatide is a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist. The GLP-1 receptor is the target for native GLP-1, \n\nan endogenous incretin hormone that potentiates glucose-dependent insulin secretion from the \n\npancreatic beta cells. \n\nLixisenatide action is mediated via a specific interaction with GLP-1 receptors, leading to an increase \n\nin intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Lixisenatide stimulates insulin secretion \n\nwhen blood glucose is increased but not at normoglycaemia, which limits the risk of hypoglycaemia. \n\nIn parallel, glucagon secretion is suppressed. In case of hypoglycaemia, the rescue mechanism of \n\nglucagon secretion is preserved. \n\nLixisenatide slows gastric emptying thereby reducing the rate at which meal-derived glucose appears \n\nin the circulation. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nWhen administered once daily, lixisenatide improves glycaemic control through the immediate and \n\nsustained effects of lowering both post-prandial and fasting glucose concentrations in patients with \n\ntype 2 diabetes. \n\n \n\nThis effect on post-prandial glucose was confirmed in a 4-week study versus liraglutide 1.8 mg once a \n\nday in combination with metformin. Reduction from baseline in the AUC0:30-4:30 h of plasma glucose \n\nafter a test-meal was: -12.61 h*mmol/L (-227.25 h*mg/dl) in the lixisenatide group \n\nand -4.04 h*mmol/L (-72.83 h*mg/dl) in the liraglutide group.

This study consisted of a 12-week run-in period with introduction and titration of insulin \n\nglargine and of a 24-week treatment period during which patients receive either lixisenatide or placebo \nin combination with insulin glargine and metformin with or without thiazolidinediones. Insulin \n\nglargine was continuously titrated during this period. \n\nDuring the 12-week run-in period, addition and titration of insulin glargine resulted approximately in \n\nan HbA1c decrease of 1%. The addition of lixisenatide led to a significantly greater HbA1c decrease of \n0.71% in the lixisenatide group compared to 0.40% in the placebo group. At the end of the 24-week \n\ntreatment period, 56.3% of the lixisenatide patients achieved an HbA1c less than 7 % compared to \n\n38.5% in the placebo group. \nDuring the 24-week treatment period, 22.4% lixisenatide patients reported at least one symptomatic \n\nhypoglycaemic event compared to 13.5% in the placebo group. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was \n\nmainly increased in the lixisenatide group during the first 6 weeks of treatment and thereafter, was \nsimilar to the placebo group. \n\n \n\nPatients with type 2 diabetes with basal insulin combined with 1-3 oral anti-diabetic agents were \nenrolled in an open-label randomised study for insulin intensification. After 12-week of optimal \n\ninsulin glargine titration with or without metformin, inadequately controlled patients were randomised \n\nto add single dose of lixisenatide or a single dose (QD) of insulin glulisine (both before the largest \n\nmeal) or insulin glulisine administered three times a day (TID) for 26 weeks. \n \n\nThe level of HbA1c reduction was comparable between groups (table 5). \n\n \nAs opposed to both insulin glulisine treatment regimens, lixisenatide reduced body weight (table 5). \n\nThe rate of symptomatic hypoglycaemic events was lower with lixisenatide (36%) compared to insulin \n\nglulisine QD and TID (47% and 52%, respectively). \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nTable 5: Active-controlled study in combination with basal insulin with or without metformin \n\n(26-week results) - (mITT) and safety population \n \n\n Lixisenatide  Insulin glulisine  \n\nQD \n\nInsulin glulisine  \n\nTID \n\nMean HbA1c (%) \n\nLS change from baseline \n\nLS mean difference (SE) of \n\nlixisenatide versus \n\n95% CI \n\nN = 297 \n\n-0.63 \n\nN = 298 \n\n-0.58 \n\n \n\n-0.05 (0.059) \n\n(-0.170 to 0.064) \n\nN = 295 \n\n-0.84 \n\n \n\n0.21 (0.059) \n\n(0.095 to 0.328) \n\n \n\nMean body weight \n\n \n\nN = 297 \n\n \n\nN = 298 \n\n \n\nN = 295 \n\nLS change from baseline \n\nLS mean difference (SE) of \n\nlixisenatide versus \n\n95% CI \n\n-0.63 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n+1.03 \n\n \n\n-1.66 (0.305) \n\n(-2.257 to -1.062) \n\n+1.37 \n\n \n\n-1.99 (0.305) \n\n(-2.593 to -1.396)* \n\n*p<0.0001 \n\n \n\n\u2022 Fasting plasma glucose \nThe reductions in fasting plasma glucose obtained with Lyxumia treatment ranged from 0.42 mmol/L \nto 1.19 mmol/L (7.6 to 21.4 mg/dl) from baseline at the end of the main 24-week treatment period in \n\nplacebo-controlled studies. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Post-prandial glucose \nTreatment with Lyxumia resulted in reductions in 2-hour post-prandial glucose after a test-meal \n\nstatistically superior to placebo whatever the background treatment.  \n\nThe reductions with Lyxumia ranged from 4.51 to 7.96 mmol/L (81.2 to 143.3 mg/dl) from baseline at \nthe end of the main 24-week treatment period across all studies in which post-prandial glucose was \n\nmeasured; 26.2% to 46.8% of patients had a 2-hour post-prandial glucose value below 7.8 mmol/L \n\n(140.4 mg/dl). \n \n\n\u2022 Body weight  \nTreatment with Lyxumia in combination with metformin and/or a sulphonylurea resulted in a \n\nsustained body weight change from baseline in all controlled studies in a range from -1.76 kg to -\n2.96 kg at the end of the main 24-week treatment period.  \n\nBody weight change from baseline in a range from -0.38 kg to -1.80 kg was also observed in \n\nlixisenatide patients receiving stable basal insulin dose, alone or in combination with metformin or a \nsulphonylurea. \n\nIn patients newly started on insulin, body weight remained almost unchanged in the lixisenatide group \n\nwhile an increase was shown in the placebo group.  \nBody weight reduction was sustained in long term studies up to 76 weeks. \n\nThe body weight reduction is independent from the occurrence of nausea and vomiting. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Beta cell function \nClinical studies with Lyxumia indicate improved beta-cell function as measured by the homeostasis \nmodel assessment for beta-cell function (HOMA-\u03b2). \n\nRestoration of first phase insulin secretion and improved second phase insulin secretion in response to \n\nan intravenous bolus of glucose were demonstrated in patients with type 2 diabetes (n=20) after a \nsingle dose of Lyxumia. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n\u2022 Cardiovascular evaluation \nNo increase in mean heart rate in patients with type 2 diabetes was seen in all placebo controlled phase \n\nIII studies. \nMean systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions up to 2.1 mmHg and up to 1.5 mmHg \n\nrespectively were observed in phase III placebo-controlled studies. \n\n \nThe ELIXA study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study that \n\nevaluated cardiovascular (CV) outcomes during treatment with lixisenatide in patients with type 2 \n\ndiabetes mellitus after a recent Acute Coronary Syndrome. \n \n\nOverall, 6068 patients were randomized 1:1 to either placebo or lixisenatide 20 mcg (following a \n\nstarting dose of 10 mcg during the first 2 weeks). \n \n\nNinety-six percent of the patients in both treatment groups completed the study in accordance with the \n\nprotocol and the vital status was known at the end of the study for 99.0% and 98.6% of the patients in \n\nthe lixisenatide and placebo group, respectively. Median treatment duration was 22.4 months in the \nlixisenatide group and 23.3 months in the placebo group, and the median duration of study follow-up \n\nwas 25.8 and 25.7 months, respectively. Mean HbA1c (\u00b1SD) in the lixisenatide and placebo groups \n\nwas 7.72 (\u00b11.32)% and 7.64 (\u00b11.28)% at baseline and 7.46 (\u00b11.51)% and 7.61 (\u00b11.48)% at 24 months, \nrespectively. \n\n \n\nThe results of the primary and secondary composite efficacy endpoints, and the results of all the \nindividual components of the composite endpoints are shown in Figure 1. \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Forest plot: analyses of each individual cardiovascular event -- ITT population \n\n \n\nHarzard Ratio with 95% CI\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0\n\nLixi  n(%) Placebo  n(%) HR [95% CI]\n\nPrimary composite endpoint\n\n      CV death, non-fatal MI,  406 (13.4%)  399 (13.2%) 1.02 [0.89, 1.17]\n      non-fatal stroke,\n      or hospitalization for\n      unstable angina\n\nSecondary composite endpoints\n\n      primary + HF  456 (15.0%)  469 (15.5%) 0.97 [0.85, 1.10]\n\n      primary + HF + Revasc  661 (21.8%)  659 (21.7%) 1.00 [0.90, 1.11]\n\nIndividual components of composites\n\n      CV death   156 (5.1%)   158 (5.2%) 0.98 [0.78, 1.22]\n\n      MI   270 (8.9%)   261 (8.6%) 1.03 [0.87, 1.23]\n\n      Stroke    67 (2.2%)    60 (2.0%) 1.12 [0.79, 1.58]\n\n      Hospitalization for    11 (0.4%)    10 (0.3%) 1.11 [0.47, 2.62]\n      unstable angina\n\n      Hospitalization for   122 (4.0%)   127 (4.2%) 0.96 [0.75, 1.23]\n      heart failure\n\n      Coronary revascularization  368 (12.1%)  356 (11.7%) 1.03 [0.89, 1.19]\n      procedure\n\n \n\nCV: cardiovascular, MI: myocardial infarction, HF: hospitalization for heart failure, Revasc: coronary \n\nrevascularization procedure, HR: hazard ratio, CI: confidence interval. \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nElderly \n\nPeople aged \u226570 years \n\nThe efficacy and safety of lixisenatide in people aged \u226570 years with type 2 diabetes was evaluated in \n\na double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 24 weeks duration. Frail patients, including patients at risk \nfor malnutrition, patients with recent cardiovascular events and patients with moderate to severe \n\ncognitive impairment were excluded. A total of 350 patients were randomized (randomization ratio \n\n1:1). Overall, 37% of the patients were \u226575 years old (N=131) and 31% had moderate renal \nimpairment (N=107). Patients received stable dose(s) of oral antidiabetic drug(s) (OAD) and/or basal \n\ninsulin as background therapy. Sulfonylureas or glinides were not used with basal insulin as \n\nbackground therapy. \n \n\nLixisenatide provided significant improvements in HbA1c (-0.64% change compared to placebo; 95% \n\nCI: -0.810% to -0.464%; p<0.0001), from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.0%. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nLyxumia in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in type 2 diabetes mellitus (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing subcutaneous administration to patients with type 2 diabetes, the rate of lixisenatide \n\nabsorption is rapid and not influenced by the dose administered. Irrespective of the dose and whether \n\nlixisenatide was administered as single or multiple doses, the median tmax is 1 to 3.5 hours in patients \n\nwith type 2 diabetes. There are no clinically relevant differences in the rate of absorption when \n\nlixisenatide is administered subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh, or arm. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nLixisenatide has a moderate level of binding (55%) to human proteins. \n\nThe apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of lixisenatide (Vz/F) is \n\napproximately 100 L. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nAs a peptide, lixisenatide is eliminated through glomerular filtration, followed by tubular reabsorption \n\nand subsequent metabolic degradation, resulting in smaller peptides and amino acids, which are \n\nreintroduced in the protein metabolism. \n\n \n\nAfter multiple dose administration in patients with type 2 diabetes, mean terminal half-life was \n\napproximately 3 hours and the mean apparent clearance (CL/F) about 35 L/h. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nPatients with renal impairment \n\nIn subjects with mild (creatinine clearance calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula 60-90 ml/min), \n\nmoderate (creatinine clearance 30-60 ml/min) and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n\n15-30 ml/min), AUC was increased by 46%, 51% and 87%, respectively. \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\nAs lixisenatide is cleared primarily by the kidney, no pharmacokinetic study has been performed in \n\npatients with acute or chronic hepatic impairment. Hepatic dysfunction is not expected to affect the \n\npharmacokinetics of lixisenatide.  \n\n \n\nGender \n\nGender has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lixisenatide. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\nRace \n\nEthnic origin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lixisenatide based on the \n\nresults of pharmacokinetic studies in Caucasian, Japanese and Chinese subjects.  \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nAge has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lixisenatide. In a pharmacokinetic \n\nstudy in elderly non-diabetic subjects, administration of lixisenatide 20 mcg resulted in a mean \n\nincrease of lixisenatide AUC by 29% in the elderly population (11 subjects aged 65 to 74 years and 7 \n\nsubjects aged \u226575 years) compared to 18 subjects aged 18 to 45 years, likely related to reduced renal \n\nfunction in the older age group. \n\n \n\nBody weight \n\nBody weight has no clinically relevant effect on lixisenatide AUC.  \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology and toxicology. \n\n \n\nIn 2-year subcutaneous carcinogenicity studies, non-lethal C-cell thyroid tumours were seen in rats \n\nand mice and are considered to be caused by a non-genotoxic GLP-1 receptor-mediated mechanism to \n\nwhich rodents are particularly sensitive. C-cell hyperplasia and adenoma were seen at all doses in rats \n\nand a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) could be not defined. In mice, these effects occurred \n\nat exposure ratio above 9.3-fold when compared to human exposure at the therapeutic dose. No C-cell \n\ncarcinoma was observed in mice and C-cell carcinoma occurred in rats with an exposure ratio relative \n\nto exposure at human therapeutic dose of about 900-fold. In 2-year subcutaneous carcinogenicity study \n\nin mice, 3 cases of adenocarcinoma in the endometrium were seen in the mid dose group with a \n\nstatistically significant increase, corresponding to an exposure ratio of 97-fold. No treatment-related \n\neffect was demonstrated. \n\n \n\nAnimal studies did not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to male and female fertility in rats. \n\nReversible testicular and epididymal lesions were seen in dogs treated with lixisenatide. No related \n\neffect on spermatogenesis was seen in healthy men. \n\nIn embryo-foetal development studies, malformations, growth retardation, ossification retardation and \n\nskeletal effects were observed in rats at all doses (5-fold exposure ratio compared to human exposure) \n\nand in rabbits at high doses (32-fold exposure ratio compared to human exposure) of lixisenatide. In \n\nboth species, there was a slight maternal toxicity consisting of low food consumption and reduced \n\nbody weight. Neonatal growth was reduced in male rats exposed to high doses of lixisenatide during \n\nlate gestation and lactation, with a slightly increased pup mortality observed. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nTreatment initiation pack \n\nLyxumia 10 micrograms solution for injection \n\nLyxumia 20 micrograms solution for injection \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nLyxumia 10 micrograms solution for injection \n\nEach dose (0.2 ml) contains 10 micrograms (mcg) of lixisenatide (50 mcg per ml). \n\n \nLyxumia 20 micrograms solution for injection \n\nEach dose (0.2 ml) contains 20 micrograms (mcg) of lixisenatide (100 mcg per ml). \n\n \n\nExcipient(s) with known effects \nEach dose contains 540 micrograms of metacresol. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nSolution for injection (injection). \n\nClear, colourless solution.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nLyxumia is indicated for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus to achieve glycaemic \n\ncontrol in combination with oral glucose-lowering medicinal products and/or basal insulin when these, \n\ntogether, with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control (see sections 4.4 and 5.1 \n\nfor available data on the different combinations). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nStarting dose: dosing is initiated at 10 mcg lixisenatide once daily for 14 days. \n\nMaintenance dose: a fixed maintenance dose of 20 mcg lixisenatide once daily is started on Day 15.   \n\n \nWhen Lyxumia is added to existing metformin therapy, the current metformin dose can be continued \n\nunchanged. \n\nWhen Lyxumia is added to existing therapy of a sulphonylurea or a basal insulin, a reduction in the \ndose of the sulphonylurea or the basal insulin may be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. \n\nLyxumia should not be given in combination with basal insulin and a sulphonylurea due to increased \nrisk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n\nThe use of Lyxumia does not require specific blood glucose monitoring. However, when used in \n\ncombination with a sulphonylurea or a basal insulin, blood glucose monitoring or blood glucose self- \n\nmonitoring may become necessary to adjust the doses of the sulphonylurea or the basal insulin. \n\n \nSpecial populations \n\nElderly  \n\nNo dose adjustment is required based on age. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\nPatients with renal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.  \nThere is no therapeutic experience in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less \n\nthan 30 ml/min) or end-stage renal disease and therefore, it is not recommended to use lixisenatide in \n\nthese populations (see section 5.2). \n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n\n \nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of lixisenatide in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age have not \n\nyet been established. No data are available. \n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\nLyxumia is to be injected subcutaneously in the thigh, abdomen or upper arm. Lyxumia should not be \nadministered intravenously or intramuscularly. \n\n \n\nThe injection is administered once daily, within the hour prior to any meal of the day. It is preferable \nthat the prandial injection of Lyxumia is performed before the same meal every day, when the most \n\nconvenient meal has been chosen. If a dose is missed, it should be injected within the hour prior to the \n\nnext meal. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nThere is no therapeutic experience with lixisenatide in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and it \n\nshould not be used in these patients. Lixisenatide should not be used for treatment of diabetic \nketoacidosis. \n\n \n\nAcute pancreatitis  \nUse of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists has been associated with a risk of \n\ndeveloping acute pancreatitis. There have been few reported events of acute pancreatitis with \n\nlixisenatide although a causal relationship has not been established. Patients should be informed of the \ncharacteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis: persistent, severe abdominal pain. If pancreatitis is \n\nsuspected, lixisenatide should be discontinued ; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, lixisenatide should \n\nnot be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of pancreatitis. \n\n \nSevere gastrointestinal disease \n\nUse of GLP-1 receptor agonists may be associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Lixisenatide \n\nhas not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, including severe gastroparesis and \ntherefore, the use of lixisenatide is not recommended in these patients. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThere is no therapeutic experience in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less \nthan 30 ml/min) or end-stage renal disease. Use is not recommended in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \nHypoglycaemia \n\nPatients receiving Lyxumia with a sulphonylurea or with a basal insulin may have an increased risk of \n\nhypoglycaemia. Reduction of the dose of the sulphonylurea or the basal insulin may be considered to \nreduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.2). Lixisenatide should not be given in combination \n\nwith basal insulin and a sulphonylurea due to increased risk of hypoglycaemia. \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\nConcomitant medicinal products \n\nThe delay of gastric emptying with lixisenatide may reduce the rate of absorption of orally \nadministered medicinal products. Lixisenatide should be used with caution in patients receiving oral \n\nmedicinal products that require rapid gastrointestinal absorption, require careful clinical monitoring or \n\nhave a narrow therapeutic ratio. Specific recommendations regarding intake of such medicinal \nproducts are given in section 4.5. \n\n \n\nPopulations not studied \n\nLixisenatide has not been studied in combination with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. \n \n\nDehydration \n\nPatients treated with lixisenatide should be advised of the potential risk of dehydration in relation to \ngastrointestinal adverse reactions and take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\nThis medicinal product contains metacresol, which may cause allergic reactions. \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n\n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nLixisenatide is a peptide and is not metabolised by cytochrome P450. In in vitro studies, lixisenatide \ndid not affect the activity of cytochrome P450 isozymes or human transporters tested. \n\nThe delay of gastric emptying with lixisenatide may reduce the rate of absorption of orally \n\nadministered medicinal products. Patients receiving medicinal products of either a narrow therapeutic \nratio or medicinal products that require careful clinical monitoring should be followed closely, \n\nespecially at the time of initiation of lixisenatide treatment. These medicinal products should be taken \n\nin a standardised way in relation to lixisenatide. If such medicinal products are to be administered with \n\nfood, patients should be advised to, if possible, take them with a meal when lixisenatide is not \nadministered. \n\nFor oral medicinal products that are particularly dependent on threshold concentrations for efficacy, \n\nsuch as antibiotics, patients should be advised to take those medicinal products at least 1 hour before \nor 4 hours after lixisenatide injection. \n\nGastro-resistant formulations containing substances sensitive to stomach degradation, should be \n\nadministered 1 hour before or 4 hours after lixisenatide injection. \n\n \nParacetamol \n\nParacetamol was used as a model medicinal product to evaluate the effect of lixisenatide on gastric \n\nemptying. Following administration of a single dose of paracetamol 1,000 mg, paracetamol AUC and \nt1/2 were unchanged whatever the timing of its administration (before or after the lixisenatide \n\ninjection). When administered 1 or 4 hours after 10 mcg lixisenatide , Cmax of paracetamol was \n\ndecreased by 29% and 31% respectively and median tmax was delayed by 2.0 and 1.75 hours \nrespectively. A further delay in tmax and a reduced Cmax of paracetamol have been predicted with the \n\n20 mcg maintenance dose.No effects on paracetamol Cmax and tmax were observed when paracetamol \n\nwas administered 1 hour before lixisenatide. \n\nBased on these results, no dose adjustment for paracetamol is required but the delayed tmax observed \nwhen paracetamol is administered 1-4 hours after lixisenatide should be taken into account when a \n\nrapid onset of action is required for efficacy. \n\n \nOral contraceptives \n\nFollowing administration of a single dose of an oral contraceptive medicinal product (ethinylestradiol \n\n0.03 mg/levonorgestrel 0.15 mg) 1 hour before or 11 hours after 10 mcg lixisenatide, the Cmax, AUC, \nt1/2 and tmax of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel were unchanged. \n\nAdministration of the oral contraceptive 1 hour or 4 hours after lixisenatide did not affect AUC and t1/2 \nof ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel, whereas Cmax of ethinylestradiol was decreased by 52% and \n\n39% respectively and Cmax of levonorgestrel was decreased by 46% and 20%, respectively and median \ntmax was delayed by 1 to 3 hours. \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nThe reduction in Cmax is of limited clinical relevance and no dose adjustment for oral contraceptives is \n\nrequired.  \n \n\nAtorvastatin \n\nWhen lixisenatide 20 mcg and atorvastatin 40 mg were co-administered in the morning for 6 days, the \nexposure to atorvastatin was not affected, while Cmax was decreased by 31% and tmax was delayed by \n\n3.25 hours. \n\nNo such increase for tmax was observed when atorvastatin was administered in the evening and \n\nlixisenatide in the morning but the AUC and Cmax of atorvastatin were increased by 27% and 66%, \nrespectively. \n\nThese changes are not clinically relevant and therefore, no dose adjustment for atorvastatin is required \n\nwhen co-administered with lixisenatide. \n \n\nWarfarin and other coumarin derivatives \n\nAfter concomitant administration of warfarin 25 mg with repeated dosing of lixisenatide 20 mcg, there \n\nwere no effects on AUC or INR (International Normalised Ratio) while Cmax was reduced by 19% and \ntmax was delayed by 7 hours. \n\nBased on these results, no dose adjustment for warfarin is required when co-administered with \n\nlixisenatide; however, frequent monitoring of INR in patients on warfarin and/or coumarin derivatives \nis recommended at the time of initiation or ending of lixisenatide treatment. \n\n \n\nDigoxin \nAfter concomitant administration of lixisenatide 20 mcg and digoxin 0.25 mg at steady state, the AUC \n\nof digoxin was not affected. The tmax of digoxin was delayed by 1.5 hour and the Cmax was reduced by \n\n26%.  \n\nBased on these results, no dose adjustment for digoxin is required when co-administered with \nlixisenatide. \n\n \n\nRamipril \nAfter concomitant administration of lixisenatide 20 mcg and ramipril 5 mg during 6 days, the AUC of \n\nramipril was increased by 21% while the Cmax was decreased by 63%.The AUC and Cmax of the active \n\nmetabolite (ramiprilat) were not affected. The tmax of ramipril and ramiprilat were delayed by \napproximately 2.5 hours. \n\nBased on these results, no dose adjustment for ramipril is required when co-administered with \n\nlixisenatide. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\nLyxumia is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of Lyxumia in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Lyxumia \n\nshould not be used during pregnancy. The use of insulin is recommended instead. If a patient wishes to \n\nbecome pregnant, or pregnancy occurs, treatment with Lyxumia should be discontinued.  \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown if Lyxumia is excreted in human milk. Lyxumia should not be used during \nbreast-feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to fertility. \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nLixisenatide has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. When used in \n\ncombination with a sulphonylurea or a basal insulin, patients should be advised to take precautions to \n\navoid hypoglycaemia while driving and using machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nOver 2,600 patients have received Lyxumia either alone or in combination with metformin, a \n\nsulphonylurea (with or without metformin) or a basal insulin (with or without metformin, or with or \n\nwithout a sulphonylurea) in 8 large placebo- or active-controlled phase III studies. \n  \n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions during clinical studies were nausea, vomiting and \n\ndiarrhoea. These reactions were mostly mild and transient. \n\nIn addition, hypoglycaemia (when Lyxumia was used in combination with a sulphonylurea and/or a \n\nbasal insulin) and headache occurred. \n\nAllergic reactions have been reported in 0.4% of Lyxumia patients. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions reported from placebo- and active-controlled phase III studies over the entire \n\ntreatment period are presented in Table 1. The table presents adverse reactions that occurred with an \n\nincidence >5% if the frequency was higher among Lyxumia treated patients than patients treated with \n\nall comparators. The table also includes adverse reactions with a frequency \u22651% in the Lyxumia group \n\nif the frequency was greater than 2 times the frequency for all comparators group. \n\n \n\nFrequencies of adverse reactions are defined as: very common: \u22651/10; common: \u22651/100 to <1/10; \nuncommon: \u22651/1,000 to <1/100; rare: \u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000; very rare: <1/10,000). \n\nWithin each system organ class, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency. \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions reported in placebo- and active-controlled phase III studies during the \n\nentire treatment period (including the period beyond the main 24-week treatment period in studies \nwith \u226576 weeks of total treatment). \n\n \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency of occurrence \n\n Very common Common Uncommon \n\nInfections and \n\ninfestations \n\n Influenza  \n\n Upper respiratory tract \n\ninfection \n\n \n\n Cystitis  \n\n Viral infection  \n\nImmune system \n\ndisorders \n\n  Anaphylactic reaction \n\nMetabolism and \n\nnutrition disorders \n\nHypoglycaemia (in \n\ncombination with a \n\nsulphonylurea and / or \n\na basal insulin) \n\nHypoglycaemia (in \n\ncombination with \n\nmetformin alone) \n\n \n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders \n\nHeadache Dizziness  \n\n Somnolence  \n\n   \n\nGastrointestinal \n\ndisorders \n\nNausea Dyspepsia  \n\nVomiting   \n\nDiarrhoea   \n\n   \n\nSkin and \n\nsubcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\n  Urticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal and \n\nconnective tissue \n\ndisorders \n\n Back pain  \n\nGeneral disorders \n\nand administration \n\nsite conditions \n\n Injection site pruritus  \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia \n\nIn patients taking Lyxumia in monotherapy, symptomatic hypoglycaemia occurred in 1.7% of \nlixisenatide treated patients and in 1.6% of placebo treated patients. When Lyxumia is used in \n\ncombination with metformin alone, symptomatic hypoglycaemia occurred in 7.0% of lixisenatide \n\npatients and in 4.8% of placebo patients during the entire treatment period. \n\n \nIn patients taking Lyxumia in combination with a sulphonylurea and metformin, symptomatic \n\nhypoglycaemia occurred in 22.0% of lixisenatide treated patients and in 18.4% of placebo treated \n\npatients during the entire treatment period (3.6% absolute difference). When Lyxumia is used in \ncombination with a basal insulin with or without metformin, symptomatic hypoglycaemia occurred in \n\n42.1% of lixisenatide patients and in 38.9% of placebo patients during the entire treatment period \n\n(3.2% absolute difference). \n \n\nDuring the entire treatment period, when Lyxumia was given with a sulphonylurea alone, symptomatic \n\nhypoglycaemia occurred in 22.7% of lixisenatide treated patients versus 15.2% with placebo (7.5% \nabsolute difference). When Lyxumia was given with a sulphonylurea and a basal insulin, symptomatic \n\nhypoglycaemia occurred in 47.2% of lixisenatide treated patients compared to 21.6% with placebo \n\n(25.6% absolute difference). \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\nOverall, the incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycaemia was uncommon (0.4% in lixisenatide \n\npatients and 0.2% in placebo patients) during the entire treatment period of the Phase III placebo-\ncontrolled studies. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nNausea and vomiting were the most frequently reported adverse reactions during the main 24-week \n\ntreatment period. The incidence of nausea was higher in the lixisenatide group (26.1%) compared to \n\nthe placebo group (6.2%) and the incidence of vomiting was higher in the lixisenatide group (10.5%) \n\nthan in the placebo group (1.8%). They were mostly mild and transient and occurred during the first 3 \n\nweeks after starting treatment. Thereafter, they progressively decreased during the following weeks. \n\n \n\nInjection site reactions \n\nInjections site reactions were reported in 3.9% of the patients receiving Lyxumia while they were \n\nreported in 1.4% of patients receiving placebo during the main 24-week treatment period. The \n\nmajority of reactions were mild in intensity and usually did not result in discontinuation of the \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity \n\nConsistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of medicinal products containing proteins or \n\npeptides, patients may develop anti-lixisenatide antibodies following treatment with Lyxumia and, at \n\nthe end of the main 24-week treatment period in placebo-controlled studies, 69.8% of lixisenatide \n\npatients had a positive antibody status. The percentage of patients who were antibody positive was \n\nsimilar at the end of the entire 76-week treatment period. At the end of the main 24-week treatment \n\nperiod, 32.2% of the patients having a positive antibody status had an antibody concentration above \n\nthe lower limit of quantification, and at the end of the entire 76-week treatment period, 44.7% of the \n\npatients had an antibody concentration above the lower limit of quantification. After stopping the \n\ntreatment, few antibody positive patients were followed up for antibody status; the percentage \n\ndecreased to approximately 90% within 3 months and 30% at 6 months or beyond. \n\nThe change in HbA1c from baseline was similar regardless of the antibody status (positive or negative). \n\nOf lixisenatide-treated patients with HbA1c measurement, 79.3% had either a negative antibody status \n\nor an antibody concentration below the lower limit of quantification and the other 20.7% of patients \n\nhad a quantified antibody concentration. In the subset of patients (5.2%) with the highest antibody \n\nconcentrations, the mean improvement in HbA1c at Week 24 and at Week 76 was in a clinically \n\nrelevant range; however there was variability in the glycaemic response and 1.9% had no decrease in \n\nHbA1c. \n\nThe antibody status (positive or negative) is not predictive of the reduction of HbA1c for an individual \n\npatient. \n\n \n\nThere was no difference in the overall safety profile in patients regardless of the antibody status with \n\nthe exception of an increase of the incidence of injection site reactions (4.7%in antibody positive \n\npatients compared to 2.5% in antibody negative patients during the entire treatment period). The \n\nmajority of injection site reactions were mild, regardless of antibody status. \n\n \n\nThere was no cross-reactivity versus either native glucagon or endogenous GLP-1. \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions \n\nAllergic reactions possibly associated with lixisenatide (such as anaphylactic reaction, angioedema \n\nand urticaria) have been reported in 0.4% of lixisenatide patients while possibly associated allergic \n\nreactions occurred in less than 0.1% of placebo patients during the main 24-week treatment period. \n\nAnaphylactic reactions were reported in 0.2% of the lixisenatide treated patients vs. none in the \n\nplacebo group. Most of these reported allergic reactions were mild in severity. \n\nOne case of anaphylactoid reaction was reported during clinical trials with lixisenatide. \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\nHeart rate \n\nIn a study in healthy volunteers, a transient rise in heart rate has been observed after administration of \n\nlixisenatide 20 mcg. Cardiac arrhythmias particularly tachycardia (0.8% vs <0.1%) and palpitations \n\n(1.5% vs 0.8%) have been reported in lixisenatide patients compared to placebo treated patients. \n\n \n\nWithdrawal \n\nThe incidence of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was 7.4% for Lyxumia compared to \n\n3.2% in the placebo group during the main 24-week treatment period. The most common adverse \n\nreactions which led to treatment discontinuation in the lixisenatide group were nausea (3.1%) and \n\nvomiting (1.2%). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nDuring clinical studies, doses up to 30 mcg of lixisenatide twice a day were administered to type 2 \n\ndiabetic patients in a 13 week study. An increased incidence of gastrointestinal disorders was \n\nobserved. \n\nIn case of overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient\u2019s \n\nclinical signs and symptoms and the lixisenatide dose should be reduced to the prescribed dose. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in Diabetes, Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues , \n\nATC code: A10BJ03. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nLixisenatide is a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist. The GLP-1 receptor is the target for native GLP-1, \n\nan endogenous incretin hormone that potentiates glucose-dependent insulin secretion from the \n\npancreatic beta cells. \n\nLixisenatide action is mediated via a specific interaction with GLP-1 receptors, leading to an increase \n\nin intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Lixisenatide stimulates insulin secretion \n\nwhen blood glucose is increased but not at normoglycaemia, which limits the risk of hypoglycaemia. \n\nIn parallel, glucagon secretion is suppressed. In case of hypoglycaemia, the rescue mechanism of \n\nglucagon secretion is preserved. \n\nLixisenatide slows gastric emptying thereby reducing the rate at which meal-derived glucose appears \n\nin the circulation. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nWhen administered once daily, lixisenatide improves glycaemic control through the immediate and \n\nsustained effects of lowering both post-prandial and fasting glucose concentrations in patients with \n\ntype 2 diabetes. \n\n \n\nThis effect on post-prandial glucose was confirmed in a 4-week study versus liraglutide 1.8 mg once a \n\nday in combination with metformin. Reduction from baseline in the AUC0:30-4:30 h of plasma glucose \n\nafter a test meal was: -12.61 h*mmol/L (-227.25 h*mg/dl) in the lixisenatide group \n\nand -4.04 h*mmol/L (-72.83 h*mg/dl) in the liraglutide group. This was also confirmed in an 8-week \n\nstudy versus liraglutide, administered before breakfast, in combination with insulin glargine with or \n\nwithout metformin. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nThe clinical efficacy and safety of Lyxumia were evaluated in nine randomised double-blind, \n\nplacebo-controlled clinical studies including 4,508 patients with type 2 diabetes (2,869 patients \n\nrandomised to lixisenatide, 47.5% men and 52.5% women, and 517 were \u226565 years of age).  \n\n \n\nEfficacy of Lyxumia was also assessed in two randomised, open-label, active-controlled study (versus \n\nexenatide or versus insulin glulisine) and in a meal time study (in total 1,067 patients randomised to \n\nlixisenatide). \n\n \n\nEfficacy and safety of Lyxumia in patients older than 70 years was addressed in a specifically \n\ndedicated placebo-controlled study (176 patients randomised to lixisenatide, including 62 patients \u226575 \n\nyears of age). \n\n \n\nIn addition, a double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome study (ELIXA) enrolled 6,068 \n\ntype 2 diabetes patients with previous acute coronary syndrome (3,034 randomised to lixisenatide, \n\nincluding 198 patients \u226575 years of age and 655 patients with moderate renal impairment). \n\n \n\nIn the completed Phase III studies, it was observed that approximately 90% of the patients were able to \nremain on the once daily maintenance dose of 20 mcg Lyxumia at the end of the main 24-week \n\ntreatment period. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Glycaemic control \n\n \n\nAdd-on combination therapy with oral antidiabetics \n\n  \n\nLyxumia in combination with metformin, a sulphonylurea, pioglitazone or a combination of these \n\nagents showed statistically significant reductions in HbA1c, in fasting plasma glucose and in 2-hour \n\npost-prandial glucose after a test-meal compared to placebo at the end of the main 24-week treatment \n\nperiod (tables 2 and 3).

This study consisted of a 12-week run-in period with introduction and titration of insulin \n\nglargine and of a 24-week treatment period during which patients receive either lixisenatide or placebo \nin combination with insulin glargine and metformin with or without thiazolidinediones. Insulin \n\nglargine was continuously titrated during this period. \n\nDuring the 12-week run-in period, addition and titration of insulin glargine resulted approximately in \n\nan HbA1c decrease of 1%. The addition of lixisenatide led to a significantly greater HbA1c decrease of \n0.71% in the lixisenatide group compared to 0.40% in the placebo group. At the end of the 24-week \n\ntreatment period, 56.3% of the lixisenatide patients achieved an HbA1c less than 7 % compared to \n\n38.5% in the placebo group. \nDuring the 24-week treatment period, 22.4% lixisenatide patients reported at least one symptomatic \n\nhypoglycaemic event compared to 13.5% in the placebo group. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was \n\nmainly increased in the lixisenatide group during the first 6 weeks of treatment and thereafter, was \nsimilar to the placebo group. \n\n \n\nPatients with type 2 diabetes with basal insulin combined with 1-3 oral anti-diabetic agents were \n\nenrolled in an open-label randomised study for insulin intensification. After 12-week of optimal \n\ninsulin glargine titration with or without metformin, inadequately controlled patients were randomised \nto add single dose of lixisenatide or a single dose (QD) of insulin glulisine (both before the largest \n\nmeal) or insulin glulisine administered three times a day (TID) for 26 weeks. \n\n \nThe level of HbA1c reduction was comparable between groups (table 5). \n\n \n\nAs opposed to both insulin glulisine treatment regimens, lixisenatide reduced body weight (table 5). \n\nThe rate of symptomatic hypoglycaemic events was lower with lixisenatide (36%) compared to insulin \nglulisine QD and TID (47% and 52%, respectively).  \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\nTable 5: Active-controlled study in combination with basal insulin with or without metformin \n\n(26-week results) - (mITT) and safety population \n \n\n Lixisenatide  Insulin glulisine  \n\nQD \n\nInsulin glulisine  \n\nTID \n\nMean HbA1c (%) \n\nLS change from baseline \n\nLS mean difference (SE) of \n\nlixisenatide versus \n\n95% CI \n\nN = 297 \n\n-0.63 \n\nN = 298 \n\n-0.58 \n\n \n\n-0.05 (0.059) \n\n(-0.170 to 0.064) \n\nN = 295 \n\n-0.84 \n\n \n\n0.21 (0.059) \n\n(0.095 to 0.328) \n\n \n\nMean body weight \n\n \n\nN = 297 \n\n \n\nN = 298 \n\n \n\nN = 295 \n\nLS change from baseline \n\nLS mean difference (SE) of \n\nlixisenatide versus \n\n95% CI \n\n-0.63 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n+1.03 \n\n \n\n-1.66 (0.305) \n\n(-2.257 to -1.062) \n\n+1.37 \n\n \n\n-1.99 (0.305) \n\n(-2.593 to -1.396)* \n\n*p<0.0001 \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Fasting plasma glucose \nThe reductions in fasting plasma glucose obtained with Lyxumia treatment ranged from 0.42 mmol/L \n\nto 1.19 mmol/L (7.6 to 21.4 mg/dl) from baseline at the end of the main 24-week treatment period in \n\nplacebo-controlled studies. \n \n\n\u2022 Post-prandial glucose \nTreatment with Lyxumia resulted in reductions in 2-hour post-prandial glucose after a test-meal \n\nstatistically superior to placebo whatever the background treatment. \nThe reductions with Lyxumia ranged from 4.51 to 7.96 mmol/L (81.2 to 143.3 mg/dl) from baseline at \n\nthe end of the main 24-week treatment period across all studies in which post-prandial glucose was \n\nmeasured; 26.2% to 46.8% of patients had a 2-hour post-prandial glucose value below 7.8 mmol/L \n(140.4 mg/dl). \n\n \n\n\u2022 Body weight  \nTreatment with Lyxumia in combination with metformin and/or a sulphonylurea resulted in a \nsustained body weight change from baseline in all controlled studies in a range from - 1.76 kg to - \n\n2.96 kg at the end of the main 24-weeks treatment period. \n\nBody weight change from baseline in a range from - 0.38 kg to - 1.80 kg was also observed in \nlixisenatide patients receiving stable basal insulin dose alone or in combination with metformin or a \n\nsulphonylurea. \n\nIn patients newly started on insulin, body weight remained almost unchanged in the lixisenatide group \nwhile an increase was shown in the placebo group. \n\nBody weight reduction was sustained in long term studies up to 76 weeks. \n\nThe body weight reduction is independent from the occurrence of nausea and vomiting. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Beta cell function \nClinical studies with Lyxumia indicate improved beta-cell function as measured by the homeostasis \n\nmodel assessment for beta-cell function (HOMA-\u03b2). \n\nRestoration of first phase insulin secretion and improved second phase insulin secretion in response to \nan intravenous bolus of glucose were demonstrated in patients with type 2 diabetes (n=20) after a \n\nsingle dose of Lyxumia. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Cardiovascular evaluation \nNo increase in mean heart rate patients with type 2 diabetes was seen in all placebo controlled phase \n\nIII studies. \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\nMean systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions up to 2.1 mmHg and up to 1.5 mmHg \n\nrespectively were observed in phase III placebo-controlled studies. \n \n\nThe ELIXA study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study that \n\nevaluated cardiovascular (CV) outcomes during treatment with lixisenatide in patients with type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus after a recent Acute Coronary Syndrome. \n\n \n\nOverall, 6068 patients were randomized 1:1 to either placebo or lixisenatide 20 mcg (following a \nstarting dose of 10 mcg during the first 2 weeks). \n\n \n\nNinety-six percent of the patients in both treatment groups completed the study in accordance with the \n\nprotocol and the vital status was known at the end of the study for 99.0% and 98.6% of the patients in \nthe lixisenatide and placebo group, respectively. Median treatment duration was 22.4 months in the \n\nlixisenatide group and 23.3 months in the placebo group, and the median duration of study follow-up \n\nwas 25.8 and 25.7 months, respectively.

Frail patients, including patients at risk \n\nfor malnutrition, patients with recent cardiovascular events and patients with moderate to severe \ncognitive impairment were excluded. A total of 350 patients were randomized (randomization ratio \n\n1:1). Overall, 37% of the patients were \u226575 years old (N=131) and 31% had moderate renal \n\nimpairment (N=107). Patients received stable dose(s) of oral antidiabetic drug(s) (OAD) and/or basal \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\ninsulin as background therapy. Sulfonylureas or glinides were not used with basal insulin as \n\nbackground therapy. \n \n\nLixisenatide provided significant improvements in HbA1c (-0.64% change compared to placebo; 95% \n\nCI: -0.810% to -0.464%; p<0.0001), from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.0%. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nLyxumia in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in type 2 diabetes mellitus (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing subcutaneous administration to patients with type 2 diabetes, the rate of lixisenatide \n\nabsorption is rapid and not influenced by the dose administered. Irrespective of the dose and whether \n\nlixisenatide was administered as single or multiple doses, the median tmax is 1 to 3.5 hours in patients \n\nwith type 2 diabetes. There are no clinically relevant differences in the rate of absorption when \n\nlixisenatide is administered subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh, or arm. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nLixisenatide has a moderate level of binding (55%) to human proteins. \n\nThe apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of lixisenatide (Vz/F) is \n\napproximately 100 L.  \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nAs a peptide, lixisenatide is eliminated through glomerular filtration, followed by tubular reabsorption \n\nand subsequent metabolic degradation, resulting in smaller peptides and amino acids, which are \n\nreintroduced in the protein metabolism.  \n\n \n\nAfter multiple dose administration in patients with type 2 diabetes, mean terminal half-life was \n\napproximately 3 hours and the mean apparent clearance (CL/F) about 35 L/h. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nPatients with renal impairment \n\nIn subjects with mild (creatinine clearance calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula 60-90 ml/min), \n\nmoderate (creatinine clearance 30-60 ml/min) and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-\n\n30 ml/min) AUC was increased by 46%, 51% and 87%, respectively. \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\nAs lixisenatide is cleared primarily by the kidney, no pharmacokinetic study has been performed in \n\npatients with acute or chronic hepatic impairment. Hepatic dysfunction is not expected to affect the \n\npharmacokinetics of lixisenatide. \n\n \n\nGender \n\nGender has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lixisenatide. \n\n \n\nRace \n\nEthnic origin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lixisenatide based on the \nresults of pharmacokinetic studies in Caucasian, Japanese and Chinese subjects.  \n\n \n\nElderly  \n\nAge has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lixisenatide. \n\nIn a pharmacokinetic study in elderly non diabetic subjects, administration of lixisenatide 20 mcg \n\nresulted in a mean increase of lixisenatide AUC by 29% in the elderly population (11 subjects aged 65 \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\nto 74 years and 7 subjects aged \u226575 years) compared to 18 subjects aged 18 to 45 years, likely related \n\nto reduced renal function in the older age group. \n\n \n\nBody weight \n\nBody weight has no clinically relevant effect on lixisenatide AUC. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology and toxicology. \n\n \n\nIn 2-year subcutaneous carcinogenicity studies, non-lethal C-cell thyroid tumours were seen in rats \n\nand mice and are considered to be caused by a non-genotoxic GLP-1 receptor-mediated mechanism to \n\nwhich rodents are particularly sensitive. C-cell hyperplasia and adenoma were seen at all doses in rats \n\nand a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) could be not defined. In mice, these effects occurred \n\nat exposure ratio above 9.3-fold when compared to human exposure at the therapeutic dose. No C-cell \n\ncarcinoma was observed in mice and C-cell carcinoma occurred in rats with an exposure ratio relative \n\nto exposure at human therapeutic dose of about 900-fold. In 2-year subcutaneous carcinogenicity study \n\nin mice, 3 cases of adenocarcinoma in the endometrium were seen in the mid dose group with a \n\nstatistically significant increase, corresponding to an exposure ratio of 97-fold. No treatment-related \n\neffect was demonstrated. \n\n \n\nAnimal studies did not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to male and female fertility in rats. \n\nReversible testicular and epididymal lesions were seen in dogs treated with lixisenatide. No related \n\neffect on spermatogenesis was seen in healthy men. \n\nIn embryo-foetal development studies, malformations, growth retardation, ossification retardation and \n\nskeletal effects were observed in rats at all doses (5-fold exposure ratio compared to human exposure) \n\nand in rabbits at high doses (32-fold exposure ratio compared to human exposure) of lixisenatide. In \n\nboth species, there was a slight maternal toxicity consisting of low food consumption and reduced \n\nbody weight. Neonatal growth was reduced in male rats exposed to high doses of lixisenatide during \n\nlate gestation and lactation, with a slightly increased pup mortality observed. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Lyxumia is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Lyxumia  \n\n3. How to use Lyxumia \n\n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Lyxumia  \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Lyxumia is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nLyxumia contains the active substance lixisenatide. \nIt is an injectable medicine used to help your body to control your blood sugar level when it is too \n\nhigh. It is used in adults with type 2 diabetes. \n\n \nLyxumia is used with other medicines for diabetes when they are not enough to control your blood \n\nsugar levels.These may include: \n\n\u2022 oral antidiabetics (such as metformin, pioglitazone, sulphonylurea medicines) and/ or ,  \n\n\u2022 a basal insulin, a type of insulin which works all day. \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Lyxumia  \n\n \nDo not use Lyxumia \n\n- if you are allergic to lixisenatide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).  \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lyxumia if: \n\n \n- you have type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes that occurs when \n\nthe body is unable to break down glucose because there is not enough insulin) since this \n\nmedicine will not be right for you \n \n\n- you have or have had inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)  \n\n \n- you have a severe stomach or gut problem such as a disease of the muscles of the stomach \n\ncalled \u201cgastroparesis\u201d which results in delayed stomach emptying \n\n \n\n- you have severe kidney disease or you are on dialysis as the use of this medicine will not be \nrecommended  \n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n\n- you are also taking a sulphonylurea or a basal insulin. This is because low blood sugar \n\n(hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may want to control your blood sugar level and then, \ndecide to reduce your dose of basal insulin or sulphonylurea. Lyxumia should not be used with a \n\ncombination of both basal insulin and sulphonylurea \n\n \n- you are taking other medicines, as there are other medicines such as antibiotics or stomach \n\nresistant tablets or capsules that should not stay too long in your stomach (see section Other \n\nmedicines and Lyxumia) \n\n \n- you experience loss of fluids/dehydration,e.g. in case of vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea. It is \n\nimportant to avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids, especially when starting treatment \n\nwith Lyxumia \n \n\n- you suffer from heart problems which can cause shortness of breath or ankle swelling, since \nthere is limited experience in this population. \n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThere is no experience with Lyxumia in children and adolescents less than 18 years and therefore, the \nuse of Lyxumia is not recommended in this age group. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Lyxumia \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other \nmedicines. \n\nThe effect of some medicines you swallow might be affected by Lyxumia. Some medicines such as \n\nantibiotics or stomach resistant tablets or capsules that should not stay too long in your stomach may \nneed to be taken at least one hour before or four hours after your Lyxumia injection.  \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nLyxumia should not be used during pregnancy. It is not known if Lyxumia may harm your unborn \n\nchild.  \n\nLyxumia should not be used if breast-feeding. It is not known if Lyxumia passes into your milk.  \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nIf you use Lyxumia with a sulphonylurea or a basal insulin, you may get low blood sugar \n\n(hypoglycaemia). This may make it difficult to concentrate and you may feel dizzy or sleepy. If this \n\nhappens do not drive or use any tools or machines. \n\n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Lyxumia \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n\nThis medicine contains metacresol which may cause allergic reactions. \n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Lyxumia \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with your \n\ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.  \n \n\nHow much to inject \n\n\u2022 The starting dose is 10 micrograms once a day for the first 14 days \u2013 injected using the green \npen.  \n\n\u2022 The dose from then onwards will be 20 micrograms once a day -using the purple pen. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\nWhen to inject \n\nInject Lyxumia in the hour before any meal of the day. Preferably inject Lyxumia before the same \nmeal every day, when you have chosen the most convenient meal for your injection. \n\n \n\nWhere to inject \n\nInject Lyxumia into the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area (abdomen), upper leg (thigh) or \n\nupper arm. \n\n \nLearning how to use the pre-filled pens \n\nBefore you use the pen for the first time, your doctor or nurse will show how to inject Lyxumia. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Always read the \"Instructions for Use\" provided in the box. \n\n\u2022 Always use the pen as described in the \u201cInstructions for Use\u201d.  \n\n \n\nOther important information about using the pre-filled pens \n\nThere is more information on how to use the pens in the \u201cInstructions for Use\u201d. The most important \n\npoints are: \n\n\u2022 Always use a new needle for each injection. You must dispose of the needle after each use, in an \n\nappropriate sharp\u2019s container, following local recommendations. Speak to your doctor, nurse or \n\npharmacist about how to dispose of sharps. \n\n\u2022 Only use needles that are compatible for use with Lyxumia pen (see \u201cInstructions for Use\u201d). \n\n\u2022 You must activate your Lyxumia pen before you use it for the first time. This is to make \nsure that it is working correctly and that the dose for your first injection is correct.  \n\n\u2022 If you think your Lyxumia pen may be damaged, do not use it. Get a new one. Do not try to \n\nrepair the pen. \n\n \nIf you use more Lyxumia than you should \n\nIf you use more Lyxumia than you should, talk to your doctor immediately. Too much Lyxumia can \n\nmake you feel sick or be sick. \n\n \nIf you forget to use Lyxumia \n\nIf you miss a dose of Lyxumia, you can inject it in the hour before your next meal. Do not take two \n\ndoses at the same time to make up for a forgotten injection. \n \n\nIf you stop using Lyxumia \n\nDo not stop using Lyxumia without talking with your doctor.

(listed in section 6). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using lyxumia if: - you have type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes that occurs when the body is unable to break down glucose because there is not enough insulin) since this medicine will not be right for you - you have or have had inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) - you have a severe stomach or gut problem such as a disease of the muscles of the stomach called \"gastroparesis\" which results in delayed stomach emptying - you have severe kidney disease or you are on dialysis as the use of this medicine will not be recommended 52 - you are also taking a sulphonylurea or a basal insulin. this is because low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur. your doctor may want to control your blood sugar level and then, decide to reduce your dose of basal insulin or sulphonylurea. lyxumia should not be used with a combination of both basal insulin and sulphonylurea - you are taking other medicines, as there are other medicines such as antibiotics or stomach resistant tablets or capsules that should not stay too long in your stomach (see section other medicines and lyxumia) - you experience loss of fluids/dehydration,e.g. in case of vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea. it is important to avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids, especially when starting treatment with lyxumia - you suffer from heart problems which can cause shortness of breath or ankle swelling, since there is limited experience in this population. children and adolescents there is no experience with lyxumia in children and adolescents less than 18 years and therefore, the use of lyxumia is not recommended in this age group. other medicines and lyxumia tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. the effect of some medicines you swallow might be affected by lyxumia. some medicines such as antibiotics or stomach resistant tablets or capsules that should not stay too long in your stomach may need to be taken at least one hour before or four hours after your lyxumia injection. pregnancy and breast-feeding lyxumia should not be used during pregnancy. it is not known if lyxumia may harm your unborn child. lyxumia should not be used if breast-feeding. it is not known if lyxumia passes into your milk. if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. driving and using machines if you use lyxumia with a sulphonylurea or a basal insulin, you may get low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). this may make it difficult to concentrate and you may feel dizzy or sleepy. if this happens do not drive or use any tools or machines. important information about some of the ingredients of lyxumia this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e.
