NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM 30 mg hard gastro-resistant capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach capsule contains 30 mg of duloxetine (as hydrochloride) \n \nExcipients: sucrose 8.6 mg. \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard gastro-resistant capsule. \n \nOpaque white body, imprinted with ‘30 mg’ and an opaque blue cap, imprinted with ‘9543’. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain in adults. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \nAdults \nThe starting and recommended maintenance dose is 60 mg daily with or without food. Dosages above \n60 mg once daily, up to a maximum dose of 120 mg per day administered in evenly divided doses, \nhave been evaluated from a safety perspective in clinical trials.  The plasma concentration of \nduloxetine displays large inter-individual variability (see 5.2). Hence, some patients that respond \ninsufficiently to 60 mg may benefit from a higher dose. \n \nResponse to treatment should be evaluated after 2 months. In patients with inadequate initial response, \nadditional response after this time is unlikely. \n \nThe therapeutic benefit should be reassessed regularly (at least every three months) (see Section 5.1). \n \nElderly \nNo dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients solely on the basis of age. However, \ncaution should be exercised when treating the elderly (see section 5.2). \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThere is no experience in children and adolescents (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM should not be used in patients with liver disease \nresulting in hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 3\n\nRenal insufficiency \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine \nclearance 30 to 80 ml/min). DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM should not be used in \npatients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min; see section 4.3).. \n \nDiscontinuation of treatment \nAbrupt discontinuation should be avoided. When stopping treatment with DULOXETINE \nBOEHRINGER INGELHEIM the dose should be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to \ntwo weeks in order to reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).If intolerable \nsymptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming \nthe previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue \ndecreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n \nConcomitant use of DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM with nonselective, irreversible \nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) is contraindicated (see section 4.5). \n \nLiver disease resulting in hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM should not be used in combination with fluvoxamine, \nciprofloxacin or enoxacine (i.e. potent CYP1A2 inhibitors) since the combination results in elevated \nplasma concentrations of duloxetine (see section 4.5). \n \nSevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) (see section 4.4). \n \nThe initiation of treatment with DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM is contraindicated in \npatients with uncontrolled hypertension that could expose patients to a potential risk of hypertensive \ncrisis (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMania and seizures \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM should be used with caution in patients with a history \nof mania or a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and/or seizures. \n \nMydriasis \nMydriasis has been reported in association with duloxetine, therefore, caution should be used when \nprescribing DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM to patients with increased intraocular \npressure, or those at risk of acute narrow-angle glaucoma. \n \nBlood pressure and heart rate \nDuloxetine has been associated with an increase in blood pressure and clinically significant \nhypertension in some patients. This may be due to the noradrenergic effect of duloxetine. Cases of \nhypertensive crisis have been reported with duloxetine, especially in patients with pre-existing \nhypertension. Therefore,in patients with known hypertension and/or other cardiac disease, blood \npressure monitoring is recommended, especially during the first month of treatment. Duloxetine \nshould be used with caution in patients whose conditions could be compromised by an increased heart \nrate or by an increase in blood pressure. Caution should also be exercised when duloxetine is used \nwith medicinal products that may impair its metabolism (see section 4.5). For patients who experience \na sustained increase in blood pressure while receiving duloxetine either dose reduction or gradual \ndiscontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). In patients with uncontrolled hypertension \nduloxetine should not be initiated (see section 4.3). \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 4\n\nRenal impairment \nIncreased plasma concentrations of duloxetine occur in patients with severe renal impairment on \nhaemodialysis (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min).  For patients with severe renal impairment, see \nsection 4.3. ee section 4.2 for information on patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction. \n \nUse with antidepressants \nCaution should be exercised when using DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM in \ncombination with antidepressants. In particular the combination with selective reversible MAOIs is not \nrecommended. \n \nSt John’s wort \nUndesirable effects may be more common during concomitant use of DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER \nINGELHEIM and herbal preparations containing St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum). \n \nDepression, suicidal ideation and behaviour \nAlthough DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM is not indicated for the treatment of \ndepression, its active ingredient (duloxetine) also exists as an antidepressant medication. Depression is \nassociated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts, self harm and suicide (suicide-related events). \nThis risk persists until significant remission occurs. As improvement may not occur during the first \nfew weeks or more of treatment, patients should be closely monitored until such improvement occurs. \nIt is general clinical experience that the risk of suicide may increase in the early stages of recovery. \nPatients with a history of suicide-related events or those exhibiting a significant degree of suicidal \nthoughts prior to commencement of treatment are known to be at a greater risk of suicidal thoughts or \nsuicidal behaviour, and should receive careful monitoring during treatment. A meta-analysis of \nplacebo-controlled clinical trials of antidepressant medicinal products in psychiatric disorders showed \nan increased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to placebo in patients less than \n25 years old. \nCases of suicidal thoughts and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or \nearly after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.8). Physicians should encourage patients to report \nany distressing thoughts or feelings or depressive symptoms at any time. If while on DULOXETINE \nBOEHRINGER INGELHEIM therapy, the patient develops agitation or depressive symptoms, \nspecialised medical advice should be sought, as depression is a serious medical condition. If a decision \nto initiate antidepressant pharmacological therapy is taken, the gradual discontinuation of \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM is recommended (see section 4.2). \n \nUse in children and adolescents under 18 years of age \nNo clinical trials have been conducted with duloxetine in paediatric populations. DULOXETINE \nBOEHRINGER INGELHEIM should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under \nthe age of 18 years.  Suicide-related behaviours (suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts), and hostility \n(predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger), were more frequently observed in \nclinical trials among children and adolescents treated with antidepressants compared to those treated \nwith placebo.  If, based on clinical need, a decision to treat is nevertheless taken, the patient should be \ncarefully monitored for the appearance of suicidal symptoms. In addition, long-term safety data in \nchildren and adolescents concerning growth, maturation and cognitive and behavioural development \nare lacking. \n \nHaemorrhage  \nThere have been reports of bleeding abnormalities, such as ecchymoses, purpura and gastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin/noradrenaline \nreuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Caution is advised in patients taking anticoagulants and/or medicinal \nproducts known to affect platelet function, and in patients with known bleeding tendencies. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 5\n\nHyponatremia \nHyponatremia has been reported rarely, predominantly in the elderly, when administering \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM. Caution is required in patients at increased risk for \nhyponatremia; such as elderly, cirrhotic, or dehydrated patients or patients treated with diuretics. \nHyponatremia may be due to a syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). \n \nDiscontinuation of treatment \nWithdrawal symptoms when treatment is discontinued are common, particularly if discontinuation is \nabrupt (see section 4.8). In clinical trials adverse events seen on abrupt treatment discontinuation \noccurred in approximately 45% of patients treated with DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM \nand 23% of patients taking placebo.  \nThe risk of withdrawal symptoms seen with SSRI’s and SNRI’s may be dependent on several factors \nincluding the duration and dose of therapy and the rate of dose reduction. The most commonly \nreported reactions are listed in section 4.8. Generally these symptoms are mild to moderate, however, \nin some patients they may be severe in intensity.  They usually occur within the first few days of \ndiscontinuing treatment, but there have been very rare reports of such symptoms in patients who have \ninadvertently missed a dose. Generally these symptoms are self-limiting and usually resolve within 2 \nweeks, though in some individuals they may be prolonged (2-3 months or more).  It is therefore \nadvised that duloxetine should be gradually tapered when discontinuing treatment over a period of no \nless than 2 weeks, according to the patient’s needs (see section 4.2). \n \nAkathisia/psychomotor restlessness \nThe use of duloxetine has been associated with the development of akathisia, characterised by a \nsubjectively unpleasant or distressing restlessness and need to move often accompanied by an inability \nto sit or stand still. This is most likely to occur within the first few weeks of treatment. In patients who \ndevelop these symptoms, increasing the dose may be detrimental. \n \nMedicinal products containing duloxetine \nDuloxetine is used under different trademarks in several indications (treatment of diabetic neuropathic \npain, major depressive episodes as well as stress urinary incontinence). The use of more than one of \nthese products concomitantly should be avoided. \n \nHepatitis/increased liver enzymes  \nCases of liver injury, including severe elevations of liver enzymes (>10 times upper limit of normal), \nhepatitis and jaundice have been reported with duloxetine (see section 4.8). Most of them occurred \nduring the first months of treatment. The pattern of liver damage was predominantly hepatocellular. \nDuloxetine should be used with caution in patients treated with other medicinal products associated \nwith hepatic injury. \n \nSucrose \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM gastro-resistant capsules contain sucrose. Patients with \nrare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrose-\nisomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCNS medicinal products: the risk of using duloxetine in combination with other CNS-active medicinal \nproducts has not been systematically evaluated, except in the cases described in this section. \nConsequently, caution is advised when DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM is taken in \ncombination with other centrally acting medicinal products and substances including alcohol and \nsedative medicinal products (e.g. benzodiazepines, morphinomimetics, antipsychotics, phenobarbital, \nsedative antihistamines). \n \nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): due to the risk of serotonin syndrome, DULOXETINE \nBOEHRINGER INGELHEIM should not be used in combination with nonselective irreversible \nmonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or within at least 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 6\n\nMAOI. Based on the half-life of duloxetine, at least 5 days should be allowed after stopping \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM before starting an MAOI (see section 4.3). \n \nFor selective, reversible MAOIs, like moclobemide, the risk of serotonin syndrome is lower. However, \nthe concomitant use of DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM with selective, reversible \nMAOIs is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nSerotonin syndrome: in rare cases, serotonin syndrome has been reported in patients using SSRIs (e.g. \nparoxetine, fluoxetine) concomitantly with serotonergic medicinal products. Caution is advisable if \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM is used concomitantly with serotonergic \nantidepressants like SSRIs, tricyclics like clomipramine or amitriptyline, St John’s wort (Hypericum \nperforatum), venlafaxine or triptans, tramadol, pethidine and tryptophan. \n \nEffect of duloxetine on other medicinal products \nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP1A2: The pharmacokinetics of theophylline, a CYP1A2 \nsubstrate, were not significantly affected by co-administration with duloxetine (60 mg twice daily).  \nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6: Duloxetine is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6. When \nduloxetine was administered at a dose of 60 mg twice daily with a single dose of desipramine, a \nCYP2D6 substrate, the AUC of desipramine increased 3-fold. The co-administration of duloxetine (40 \nmg twice daily) increases steady state AUC of tolterodine (2 mg twice daily) by 71 %, but does not \naffect the pharmacokinetics of its active 5-hydroxyl metabolite and no dosage adjustment is \nrecommended. Caution is advised if DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM is co-administered \nwith medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by CYP2D6 (risperidone, tricyclic \nantidepressants [TCAs] such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine) particularly if they have a \nnarrow therapeutic index (such as flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol). \n \nOral contraceptives and other steroidal agents: results of in vitro studies demonstrate that duloxetine \ndoes not induce the catalytic activity of CYP3A. Specific in vivo drug interaction studies have not \nbeen performed. \n \nAnticoagulants and antiplatelet agents: Caution should be exercised when duloxetine is combined \nwith oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents due to a potential increased risk of bleeding attributable \nto a pharmacodynamic interaction. Furthermore, increases in INR values have been reported when \nduloxetine was co-administered to patients treated with warfarin. However, concomitant \nadministration of duloxetine with warfarin under steady state conditions, in healthy volunteers, as part \nof a clinical pharmacology study, did not result in a clinically significant change in INR from baseline \nor in the pharmacokinetics of R- or S-warfarin. \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on duloxetine \nAntacids and H2 antagonists: co-administration of duloxetine with aluminium- and magnesium-\ncontaining antacids or duloxetine with famotidine had no significant effect on the rate or extent of \nduloxetine absorption after administration of a 40 mg oral dose. \n \nInhibitors of CYP 1A2: because CYP1A2 is involved in duloxetine metabolism, concomitant use of \nduloxetine with potent inhibitors of CYP1A2 is likely to result in higher concentrations of duloxetine. \nFluvoxamine (100 mg once daily), a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, decreased the apparent plasma \nclearance of duloxetine by about 77% and increased AUCo-t 6-fold. Therefore DULOXETINE \nBOEHRINGER INGELHEIM should not be administered in combination with potent inhibitors of \nCYP1A2 like fluvoxamine (see section 4.3). \n \nInducers of CYP1A2: Population pharmacokinetic analyses have shown that smokers have almost 50% \nlower plasma concentrations of duloxetine compared with non-smokers. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 7\n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy  \nThere are no data on the use of duloxetine in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity at systemic exposure levels (AUC) of duloxetine lower than the maximum \nclinical exposure (see section 5.3).  \nThe potential risk for humans is unknown. As with other serotonergic medicinal products, \ndiscontinuation symptoms may occur in the neonate after maternal duloxetine use near term. \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM should be used in pregnancy only if the potential \nbenefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. Women should be advised to notify their physician if \nthey become pregnant, or intend to become pregnant, during therapy.  \n \nBreast feeding \nDuloxetine is very weakly excreted into human milk based on a study of 6 lactating patients, who did  \nnot breast feed their children . The estimated daily infant dose on a mg/kg basis is approximately \n0.14% of the maternal dose (see section 5.2). As the safety of duloxetine in infants is not known, the \nuse of DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM while breast-feeding is not recommended.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM may be associated with sedation and dizziness. \nPatients should be instructed that if they experience sedation or dizziness they should avoid potentially \nhazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nTable 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled \nclinical trials (comprising a total of 6828 patients, 4199 on duloxetine and 2629 on placebo).  \nThe most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients with diabetic neuropathic pain treated with \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM were: nausea; headache, dry mouth and somnolence \nand dizziness. \n \nTable 1:

syncope have been reported especially at the initiation of \ntreatment. \n3See section 4.4 \n4Cases of aggression and anger have been reported particularly early in treatment of after treatment \ndiscontinuation. \n5Cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or \nearly after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4) \n \nDiscontinuation of duloxetine (particularly when abrupt) commonly leads to withdrawal symptoms. \nDizziness, sensory disturbances (including paraesthesia), sleep disturbances (including insomnia and \nintense dreams), agitation or anxiety, nausea and/or vomiting, tremor ,headache, irritability, diarrhoea, \nhyperhydrosis and vertigo are the most commonly reported reactions. \nGenerally, for SSRIs and SNRIs, these events are mild to moderate and self-limiting, however, in \nsome patients they may be severe and/or prolonged. It is therefore advised that when duloxetine \ntreatment is no longer required, gradual discontinuation by dose tapering should be carried out (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nIn the 12 week acute phase of three clinical trials of duloxetine in patients with diabetic neuropathic \npain, small but statistically significant increases in fasting blood glucose were observed in duloxetine-\ntreated patients. HbA1c was stable in both duloxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients. In the \nextension phase of these studies, which lasted up to 52 weeks, there was an increase in HbA1c in both \nthe duloxetine and routine care groups, but the mean increase was 0.3% greater in the duloxetine-\ntreated group. There was also a small increase in fasting blood glucose and in total cholesterol in \nduloxetine-treated patients while those laboratory tests showed a slight decrease in the routine care \ngroup.  \n \nElectrocardiograms were obtained from 528 duloxetine-treated and 205 placebo-treated patients with \ndiabetic neuropathic pain in clinical trials lasting up to 13-weeks. The heart rate-corrected QT interval \nin duloxetine-treated patients did not differ from that seen in placebo-treated patients. No clinically \nsignificant differences were observed for QT, PR, QRS, or QTcB measurements between duloxetine-\ntreated and placebo-treated patients. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nCases of overdoses, alone or in combination with other medicinal products, with duloxetine doses of \n5400mg were reported. Some fatalities have occurred, primarily with mixed overdoses, but also with \nduloxetine alone at a dose of approximately 1000 mg. Signs and symptoms of overdose (duloxetine \nalone or in combination with other medicinal products) included somnolence, coma, serotonin \nsyndrome, seizures, vomiting and tachycardia.   \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 11\n\nNo specific antidote is known for duloxetine but if serotonin syndrome ensues, specific treatment \n(such as with cyproheptadine and/or temperature control) may be considered. A free airway should be \nestablished. Monitoring of cardiac and vital signs is recommended, along with appropriate \nsymptomatic and supportive measures. Gastric lavage may be indicated if performed soon after \ningestion or in symptomatic patients. Activated charcoal may be useful in limiting absorption. \nDuloxetine has a large volume of distribution and forced diuresis, haemoperfusion, and exchange \nperfusion are unlikely to be beneficial. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antidepressants. ATC code: N06AX21. \n \nDuloxetine is a combined serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor. It weakly \ninhibits dopamine reuptake with no significant affinity for histaminergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic \nand adrenergic receptors. Duloxetine dose-dependently increases extracellular levels of serotonin and \nnoradrenaline in various brain areas of animals. \n \nDuloxetine normalised pain thresholds in several preclinical models of neuropathic and inflammatory \npain and attenuated pain behaviour in a model of persistent pain. The pain inhibitory action of \nduloxetine is believed to be a result of potentiation of descending inhibitory pain pathways within the \ncentral nervous system. \n \nThe efficacy of duloxetine as a treatment for diabetic neuropathic pain was established in 2 \nrandomised, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed dose studies in adults (22 to 88 years) \nhaving diabetic neuropathic pain for at least 6 months.  Patients meeting diagnostic criteria for major \ndepressive disorder were excluded from these trials.  The primary outcome measure was the weekly \nmean of 24-hour average pain, which was collected in a daily diary by patients on an 11-point Likert \nscale. \n \nIn both studies, duloxetine 60 mg once daily and 60 mg twice daily significantly reduced pain \ncompared with placebo. The effect in some patients was apparent in the first week of treatment. The \ndifference in mean improvement between the two active treatment arms was not significant.  At least \n30% reported pain reduction was recorded in approximately 65% of duloxetine treated patients versus \n40% for placebo. The corresponding figures for at least 50% pain reduction were 50% and 26% \nrespectively. Clinical response rates (50% or greater improvement in pain) were analysed according to \nwhether or not the patient experienced somnolence during treatment. For patients not experiencing \nsomnolence, clinical response was observed in 47% of patients receiving duloxetine and 27% patients \non placebo.  Clinical response rates in patients experiencing somnolence were 60% on duloxetine and \n30% on placebo. Patients not demonstrating a pain reduction of 30% within 60 days of treatment were \nunlikely to reach this level during further treatment. \n \nIn an open label long-term uncontrolled study, the pain reduction in patients responding to 8-weeks of \nacute treatment of DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM 60 mg once daily was maintained \nfor a further 6-months as measured by change on the Brief Pain Inventory(BPI) 24-hour average pain \nitem. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDuloxetine is administered as a single enantiomer. Duloxetine is extensively metabolised by oxidative \nenzymes (CYP1A2 and the polymorphic CYP2D6), followed by conjugation. The pharmacokinetics \nof duloxetine demonstrate large intersubject variability (generally 50-60%), partly due to gender, age, \nsmoking status and CYP2D6 metaboliser status.  \nDuloxetine is well absorbed after oral administration with a Cmax occurring 6 hours post dose. The \nabsolute oral bioavailability of duloxetine ranged from 32% to 80% (mean of 50%). Food delays the \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 12\n\ntime to reach the peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the extent of \nabsorption (approximately 11 %). These changes do not have any clinical significance. Duloxetine is \napproximately 96% bound to human plasma proteins. Duloxetine binds to both albumin and alpha-l \nacid glycoprotein. Protein binding is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment. \n \nDuloxetine is extensively metabolised and the metabolites are excreted principally in urine. Both \ncytochromes P450-2D6 and 1A2 catalyse the formation of the two major metabolites glucuronide \nconjugate of 4-hydroxy duloxetine and sulphate conjugate of 5hydroxy,6-methoxy duloxetine. Based \nupon in vitro studies, the circulating metabolites of duloxetine are considered pharmacologically \ninactive. The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine in patients who are poor metabolisers with respect to \nCYP2D6 has not been specifically investigated. Limited data suggest that the plasma levels of \nduloxetine are higher in these patients. \n \nThe elimination half-life of duloxetine ranges from 8 to 17 hours (mean of 12 hours). After an \nintravenous dose the plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 22 l/hr to 46 l/hr (mean of 36 l/hr).  \nAfter an oral dose the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 33 to 261 l/hr (mean 101 \nl/hr). \n \nSpecial populations: \nGender: pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between males and females (apparent \nplasma clearance is approximatively 50% lower in females). Based upon the overlap in the range of \nclearance, gender-based pharmacokinetic differences do not justify the recommendation for using a \nlower dose for female patients.  \n \nAge: pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between younger and elderly females (≥65 \nyears) (AUC increases by about 25% and half-life is about 25% longer in the elderly), although the \nmagnitude of these changes is not sufficient to justify adjustments to the dose. As a general \nrecommendation, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nRenal impairment: end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving dialysis had 2-fold higher \nduloxetine Cmax and AUC values compared with healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic data on \nduloxetine is limited in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment: moderate liver disease (Child Pugh Class B) affected the pharmacokinetics of \nduloxetine. Compared with healthy subjects, the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine was 79% \nlower, the apparent terminal half-life was 2.3 times longer, and the AUC was 3.7 times higher in \npatients with moderate liver disease. The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine and its metabolites have not \nbeen studied in patients with mild or severe hepatic insufficiency. \n \nNursing mothers: The disposition of duloxetine was studied in 6 lactating women who were at least \n12-weeks postpartum. Duloxetine is detected in breast milk, and steady-state concentrations in breast \nmilk are about one-fourth those in plasma. The amount of duloxetine in breast milk is approximately \n7 µg/day while on 40 mg twice daily dosing. Lactation did not influence duloxetine pharmacokinetics.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nDuloxetine was not genotoxic in a standard battery of tests and was not carcinogenic in rats.  \nMultinucleated cells were seen in the liver in the absence of other histopathological changes in the rat \ncarcinogenicity study. The underlying mechanism and the clinical relevance are unknown. Female \nmice receiving duloxetine for 2 years had an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and \ncarcinomas at the high dose only (144 mg/kg/day), but these were considered to be secondary to \nhepatic microsomal enzyme induction. The relevance of this mouse data to humans is unknown. \nFemale rats receiving duloxetine (45 mg/kg/day) before and during mating and early pregnancy had a \ndecrease in maternal food consumption and body weight, oestrous cycle disruption, decreased live \nbirth indices and progeny survival, and progeny growth retardation at systemic exposure levels \nestimated to be at the most at maximum clinical exposure (AUC).

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM 60 mg hard gastro-resistant capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach capsule contains 60 mg of duloxetine (as hydrochloride). \n \nExcipients: sucrose 17.2 mg. \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard gastro-resistant capsule. \n \nOpaque green body, imprinted with ‘60 mg’ and an opaque blue cap, imprinted with ‘9542’. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain in adults. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \nAdults \nThe starting and recommended maintenance dose is 60 mg daily with or without food. Dosages above \n60 mg once daily, up to a maximum dose of 120 mg per day administered in evenly divided doses, \nhave been evaluated from a safety perspective in clinical trials.  The plasma concentration of \nduloxetine displays large inter-individual variability (see 5.2). Hence, some patients that respond \ninsufficiently to 60 mg may benefit from a higher dose. \n \nResponse to treatment should be evaluated after 2 months. In patients with inadequate initial response, \nadditional response after this time is unlikely. \n \nThe therapeutic benefit should be reassessed regularly (at least every three months) (see Section 5.1). \n \nElderly \nDiabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain: No dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients \nsolely on the basis of age. However, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly (see section \n5.2). \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThere is no experience in children and adolescents (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM should not be used in patients with liver disease \nresulting in hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 16\n\nRenal insufficiency \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine \nclearance 30 to 80 ml/min). DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM should not be used in \npatients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min; see section 4.3).  \n \nDiscontinuation of treatment \nAbrupt discontinuation should be avoided. When stopping treatment with DULOXETINE \nBOEHRINGER INGELHEIM the dose should be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to \ntwo weeks in order to reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). If intolerable \nsymptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming \nthe previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue \ndecreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n \nConcomitant use of DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM with nonselective, irreversible \nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) is contraindicated (see section 4.5). \n \nLiver disease resulting in hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM should not be used in combination with fluvoxamine, \nciprofloxacin or enoxacine (i.e. potent CYP1A2 inhibitors) since the combination results in elevated \nplasma concentrations of duloxetine (see section 4.5). \n \nSevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) (see section 4.4). \n \nThe initiation of treatment with DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM is contraindicated in \npatients with uncontrolled hypertension that could expose patients to a potential risk of hypertensive \ncrisis (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMania and seizures \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM should be used with caution in patients with a history \nof mania or a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and/or seizures. \n \nMydriasis \nMydriasis has been reported in association with duloxetine, therefore, caution should be used when \nprescribing DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM to patients with increased intraocular \npressure, or those at risk of acute narrow-angle glaucoma. \n \nBlood pressure and heart rate \nDuloxetine has been associated with an increase in blood pressure and clinically significant \nhypertension in some patients. This may be due to the noradrenergic effect of duloxetine. Cases of \nhypertensive crisis have been reported with duloxetine, especially in patients with pre-existing \nhypertension. Therefore,in patients with known hypertension and/or other cardiac disease, blood \npressure monitoring is recommended, especially during the first month of treatment. Duloxetine \nshould be used with caution in patients whose conditions could be compromised by an increased heart \nrate or by an increase in blood pressure. Caution should also be exercised when duloxetine is used \nwith medicinal products that may impair its metabolism (see section 4.5). For patients who experience \na sustained increase in blood pressure while receiving duloxetine either dose reduction or gradual \ndiscontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). In patients with uncontrolled hypertension \nduloxetine should not be initiated (see section 4.3). \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 17\n\nRenal impairment \nIncreased plasma concentrations of duloxetine occur in patients with severe renal impairment on \nhaemodialysis (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min).  For patients with severe renal impairment, see \nsection 4.3. See section 4.2 for information on patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction. \n \nUse with antidepressants \nCaution should be exercised when using DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM in \ncombination with antidepressants. In particular the combination with selective reversible MAOIs is not \nrecommended. \n \nSt John’s wort \nUndesirable effects may be more common during concomitant use of DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER \nINGELHEIM and herbal preparations containing St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum). \n \nDepression, suicidal ideation and behaviour \nAlthough DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM is not indicated for the treatment of \ndepression, its active ingredient (duloxetine) also exists as an antidepressant medication. Depression is \nassociated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts, self harm and suicide (suicide-related events). \nThis risk persists until significant remission occurs. As improvement may not occur during the first \nfew weeks or more of treatment, patients should be closely monitored until such improvement occurs. \nIt is general clinical experience that the risk of suicide may increase in the early stages of recovery. \nPatients with a history of suicide-related events or those exhibiting a significant degree of suicidal \nthoughts prior to commencement of treatment are known to be at a greater risk of suicidal thoughts or \nsuicidal behaviour, and should receive careful monitoring during treatment. A meta-analysis of \nplacebo-controlled clinical trials of antidepressant medicinal products in psychiatric disorders showed \nan increased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to placebo in patients less than \n25 years old. \nCases of suicidal thoughts and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or \nearly after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.8). Physicians should encourage patients to report \nany distressing thoughts or feelings or depressive symptoms at any time. If while on DULOXETINE \nBOEHRINGER INGELHEIM therapy, the patient develops agitation or depressive symptoms, \nspecialised medical advice should be sought, as depression is a serious medical condition. If a decision \nto initiate antidepressant pharmacological therapy is taken, the gradual discontinuation of \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM is recommended (see Section 4.2). \n \nUse in children and adolescents under 18 years of age \nNo clinical trials have been conducted with duloxetine in paediatric populations. DULOXETINE \nBOEHRINGER INGELHEIM should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under \nthe age of 18 years. Suicide-related behaviours (suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts), and hostility \n(predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger), were more frequently observed in \nclinical trials among children and adolescents treated with antidepressants compared to those treated \nwith placebo. If, based on clinical need, a decision to treat is nevertheless taken, the patient should be \ncarefully monitored for the appearance of suicidal symptoms. In addition, long-term safety data in \nchildren and adolescents concerning growth, maturation and cognitive and behavioural development \nare lacking. \n \nHaemorrhage  \nThere have been reports of bleeding abnormalities, such as ecchymoses, purpura and gastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin/noradrenaline \nreuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Caution is advised in patients taking anticoagulants and/or medicinal \nproducts known to affect platelet function, and in patients with known bleeding tendencies. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 18\n\nHyponatremia \nHyponatremia has been reported rarely, predominantly in the elderly, when administering \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM. Caution is required in patients at increased risk for \nhyponatremia; such as elderly, cirrhotic, or dehydrated patients or patients treated with diuretics. \nHyponatremia may be due to a syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). \n \nDiscontinuation of treatment \nWithdrawal symptoms when treatment is discontinued are common, particularly if discontinuation is \nabrupt (see section 4.8). In clinical trials adverse events seen on abrupt treatment discontinuation \noccurred in approximately 45% of patients treated with DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM \nand 23% of patients taking placebo.  \nThe risk of withdrawal symptoms seen with SSRI’s and SNRI’s may be dependent on several factors \nincluding the duration and dose of therapy and the rate of dose reduction. The most commonly \nreported reactions are listed in section 4.8. Generally these symptoms are mild to moderate, however, \nin some patients they may be severe in intensity.  They usually occur within the first few days of \ndiscontinuing treatment, but there have been very rare reports of such symptoms in patients who have \ninadvertently missed a dose. Generally these symptoms are self-limiting and usually resolve within 2 \nweeks, though in some individuals they may be prolonged (2-3 months or more).  It is therefore \nadvised that duloxetine should be gradually tapered when discontinuing treatment over a period of no \nless than 2 weeks, according to the patient’s needs (see section 4.2). \n \nAkathisia/psychomotor restlessness \nThe use of duloxetine has been associated with the development of akathisia, characterised by a \nsubjectively unpleasant or distressing restlessness and need to move often accompanied by an inability \nto sit or stand still. This is most likely to occur within the first few weeks of treatment. In patients who \ndevelop these symptoms, increasing the dose may be detrimental. \n \nMedicinal products containing duloxetine \nDuloxetine is used under different trademarks in several indications (treatment of diabetic neuropathic \npain, major depressive episodes as well as stress urinary incontinence). The use of more than one of \nthese products concomitantly should be avoided. \n \nHepatitis/increased liver enzymes \nCases of liver injury, including severe elevations of liver enzymes (>10 times upper limit of normal), \nhepatitis and jaundice have been reported with duloxetine (see section 4.8). Most of them occurred \nduring the first months of treatment. The pattern of liver damage was predominantly hepatocellular. \nDuloxetine should be used with caution in patients treated with other medicinal products associated \nwith hepatic injury. \n \nSucrose \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM gastro-resistant capsules contain sucrose. Patients with \nrare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrose-\nisomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCNS medicinal products: the risk of using duloxetine in combination with other CNS-active medicinal \nproducts has not been systematically evaluated, except in the cases described in this section. \nConsequently, caution is advised when DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM is taken in \ncombination with other centrally acting medicinal products and substances including alcohol and \nsedative medicinal products (e.g. benzodiazepines, morphinomimetics, antipsychotics, phenobarbital, \nsedative antihistamines). \n \nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): due to the risk of serotonin syndrome, DULOXETINE \nBOEHRINGER INGELHEIM should not be used in combination with nonselective irreversible \nmonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or within at least 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 19\n\nMAOI. Based on the half-life of duloxetine, at least 5 days should be allowed after stopping \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM before starting an MAOI (see section 4.3). \n \nFor selective, reversible MAOIs, like moclobemide, the risk of serotonin syndrome is lower. However, \nthe concomitant use of DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM with selective, reversible \nMAOIs is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nSerotonin syndrome: in rare cases, serotonin syndrome has been reported in patients using SSRIs (e.g. \nparoxetine, fluoxetine) concomitantly with serotonergic medicinal products. Caution is advisable if \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM is used concomitantly with serotonergic \nantidepressants like SSRIs, tricyclics like clomipramine or amitriptyline, St John’s wort (Hypericum \nperforatum), venlafaxine or triptans, tramadol, pethidine and tryptophan. \n \nEffect of duloxetine on other medicinal products \nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP1A2: The pharmacokinetics of theophylline, a CYP1A2 \nsubstrate, were not significantly affected by co-administration with duloxetine (60 mg twice daily).  \nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6: Duloxetine is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6. When \nduloxetine was administered at a dose of 60 mg twice daily with a single dose of desipramine, a \nCYP2D6 substrate, the AUC of desipramine increased 3-fold. The co-administration of duloxetine (40 \nmg twice daily) increases steady state AUC of tolterodine (2 mg twice daily) by 71 %, but does not \naffect the pharmacokinetics of its active 5-hydroxyl metabolite and no dosage adjustment is \nrecommended. Caution is advised if DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM is co-administered \nwith medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by CYP2D6 (risperidone, tricyclic \nantidepressants [TCAs] such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine) particularly if they have a \nnarrow therapeutic index (such as flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol). \n \nOral contraceptives and other steroidal agents: results of in vitro studies demonstrate that duloxetine \ndoes not induce the catalytic activity of CYP3A. Specific in vivo drug interaction studies have not \nbeen performed. \n \nAnticoagulants and antiplatelet agents: Caution should be exercised when duloxetine is combined \nwith oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents due to a potential increased risk of bleeding attributable \nto a pharmacodynamic interaction. Furthermore, increases in INR values have been reported when \nduloxetine was co-administered to patients treated with warfarin. However, concomitant \nadministration of duloxetine with warfarin under steady state conditions, in healthy volunteers, as part \nof a clinical pharmacology study, did not result in a clinically significant change in INR from baseline \nor in the pharmacokinetics of R- or S-warfarin. \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on duloxetine \nAntacids and H2 antagonists: co-administration of duloxetine with aluminium- and magnesium-\ncontaining antacids or duloxetine with famotidine had no significant effect on the rate or extent of \nduloxetine absorption after administration of a 40 mg oral dose. \n \nInhibitors of CYP 1A2: because CYP1A2 is involved in duloxetine metabolism, concomitant use of \nduloxetine with potent inhibitors of CYP1A2 is likely to result in higher concentrations of duloxetine. \nFluvoxamine (100 mg once daily), a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, decreased the apparent plasma \nclearance of duloxetine by about 77% and increased AUCo-t 6-fold. Therefore DULOXETINE \nBOEHRINGER INGELHEIM should not be administered in combination with potent inhibitors of \nCYP1A2 like fluvoxamine (see section 4.3). \n \nInducers of CYP1A2: Population pharmacokinetic analyses have shown that smokers have almost 50% \nlower plasma concentrations of duloxetine compared with non-smokers. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 20\n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy  \nThere are no data on the use of duloxetine in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity at systemic exposure levels (AUC) of duloxetine lower than the maximum \nclinical exposure (see section 5.3).  \nThe potential risk for humans is unknown. As with other serotonergic medicinal products, \ndiscontinuation symptoms may occur in the neonate after maternal duloxetine use near term. \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM should be used in pregnancy only if the potential \nbenefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. Women should be advised to notify their physician if \nthey become pregnant, or intend to become pregnant, during therapy.  \n \nBreast feeding \nDuloxetine is very weakly excreted into human milk based on a study of 6 lactating patients, who did  \nnot breast feed their children . The estimated daily infant dose on a mg/kg basis is approximately \n0.14% of the maternal dose (see section 5.2). As the safety of duloxetine in infants is not known, the \nuse of DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM while breast-feeding is not recommended. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM may be associated with sedation and dizziness. \nPatients should be instructed that if they experience sedation or dizziness they should avoid potentially \nhazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nTable 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled \nclinical trials (comprising a total of 6828 patients, 4199 on duloxetine and 2629 on placebo).  \nThe most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients with diabetic neuropathic pain treated with \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM were: nausea; headache, dry mouth and somnolence \nand dizziness. \n \nTable 1: Adverse reactions \nFrequency estimate: Very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 and <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 and \n<1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 and <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated

syncope have been reported especially at the initiation of \ntreatment. \n3See section 4.4 \n4Cases of aggression and anger have been reported particularly early in treatment of after treatment \ndiscontinuation. \n5Cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or \nearly after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4) \n \nDiscontinuation of duloxetine (particularly when abrupt) commonly leads to withdrawal symptoms. \nDizziness, sensory disturbances (including paraesthesia), sleep disturbances (including insomnia and \nintense dreams), agitation or anxiety, nausea and/or vomiting, tremor, headache, irritability, diarrhoea, \nhyperhydrosis and vertigo are the most commonly reported reactions. \nGenerally, for SSRIs and SNRIs, these events are mild to moderate and self-limiting, however, in \nsome patients they may be severe and/or prolonged. It is therefore advised that when duloxetine \ntreatment is no longer required, gradual discontinuation by dose tapering should be carried out (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nIn the 12 week acute phase of three clinical trials of duloxetine in patients with diabetic neuropathic \npain, small but statistically significant increases in fasting blood glucose were observed in duloxetine-\ntreated patients HbA1c was stable in both duloxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients. In the \nextension phase of these studies, which lasted up to 52 weeks, there was an increase in HbA1c in both \nthe duloxetine and routine care groups, but the mean increase was 0.3% greater in the duloxetine-\ntreated group. There was also a small increase in fasting blood glucose and in total cholesterol in \nduloxetine-treated patients while those laboratory tests showed a slight decrease in the routine care \ngroup.  \n \nElectrocardiograms were obtained from 528 duloxetine-treated and 205 placebo-treated patients with \ndiabetic neuropathic pain in clinical trials lasting up to 13-weeks. The heart rate-corrected QT interval \nin duloxetine-treated patients did not differ from that seen in placebo-treated patients. No clinically \nsignificant differences were observed for QT, PR, QRS, or QTcB measurements between duloxetine-\ntreated and placebo-treated patients. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nCases of overdoses, alone or in combination with other medicinal products, with duloxetine doses of \n5400mg were reported. Some fatalities have occurred, primarily with mixed overdoses, but also with \nduloxetine alone at a dose of approximately 1000 mg. Signs and symptoms of overdose (duloxetine \nalone or in combination with other medicinal products) included somnolence, coma, serotonin \nsyndrome, seizures, vomiting and tachycardia.   \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 24\n\nNo specific antidote is known for duloxetine but if serotonin syndrome ensues, specific treatment \n(such as with cyproheptadine and/or temperature control) may be considered. A free airway should be \nestablished. Monitoring of cardiac and vital signs is recommended, along with appropriate \nsymptomatic and supportive measures. Gastric lavage may be indicated if performed soon after \ningestion or in symptomatic patients. Activated charcoal may be useful in limiting absorption. \nDuloxetine has a large volume of distribution and forced diuresis, haemoperfusion, and exchange \nperfusion are unlikely to be beneficial. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antidepressants. ATC code: N06AX21. \n \nDuloxetine is a combined serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor. It weakly \ninhibits dopamine reuptake with no significant affinity for histaminergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic \nand adrenergic receptors. Duloxetine dose-dependently increases extracellular levels of serotonin and \nnoradrenaline in various brain areas of animals. \n \nDuloxetine normalised pain thresholds in several preclinical models of neuropathic and inflammatory \npain and attenuated pain behaviour in a model of persistent pain. The pain inhibitory action of \nduloxetine is believed to be a result of potentiation of descending inhibitory pain pathways within the \ncentral nervous system. \n \nThe efficacy of duloxetine as a treatment for diabetic neuropathic pain was established in 2 \nrandomised, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed dose studies in adults (22 to 88 years) \nhaving diabetic neuropathic pain for at least 6 months.  Patients meeting diagnostic criteria for major \ndepressive disorder were excluded from these trials.  The primary outcome measure was the weekly \nmean of 24-hour average pain, which was collected in a daily diary by patients on an 11-point Likert \nscale. \n \nIn both studies, duloxetine 60 mg once daily and 60 mg twice daily significantly reduced pain \ncompared with placebo. The effect in some patients was apparent in the first week of treatment. The \ndifference in mean improvement between the two active treatment arms was not significant.  At least \n30% reported pain reduction was recorded in approximately 65% of duloxetine treated patients versus \n40% for placebo. The corresponding figures for at least 50% pain reduction were 50% and 26% \nrespectively. Clinical response rates (50% or greater improvement in pain) were analysed according to \nwhether or not the patient experienced somnolence during treatment. For patients not experiencing \nsomnolence, clinical response was observed in 47% of patients receiving duloxetine and 27% patients \non placebo.  Clinical response rates in patients experiencing somnolence were 60% on duloxetine and \n30% on placebo. Patients not demonstrating a pain reduction of 30% within 60 days of treatment were \nunlikely to reach this level during further treatment. \n \nIn an open label long-term uncontrolled study, the pain reduction in patients responding to 8-weeks of \nacute treatment of DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM 60 mg once daily was maintained \nfor a further 6-months as measured by change on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) 24-hour average pain \nitem. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDuloxetine is administered as a single enantiomer. Duloxetine is extensively metabolised by oxidative \nenzymes (CYP1A2 and the polymorphic CYP2D6), followed by conjugation. The pharmacokinetics \nof duloxetine demonstrate large intersubject variability (generally 50-60%), partly due to gender, age, \nsmoking status and CYP2D6 metaboliser status.  \nDuloxetine is well absorbed after oral administration with a Cmax occurring 6 hours post dose. The \nabsolute oral bioavailability of duloxetine ranged from 32% to 80% (mean of 50%). Food delays the \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 25\n\ntime to reach the peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the extent of \nabsorption (approximately 11 %). These changes do not have any clinical significance. Duloxetine is \napproximately 96% bound to human plasma proteins. Duloxetine binds to both albumin and alpha-l \nacid glycoprotein. Protein binding is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment. \n \nDuloxetine is extensively metabolised and the metabolites are excreted principally in urine. Both \ncytochromes P450-2D6 and 1A2 catalyse the formation of the two major metabolites glucuronide \nconjugate of 4-hydroxy duloxetine and sulphate conjugate of 5hydroxy,6-methoxy duloxetine. Based \nupon in vitro studies, the circulating metabolites of duloxetine are considered pharmacologically \ninactive. The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine in patients who are poor metabolisers with respect to \nCYP2D6 has not been specifically investigated. Limited data suggest that the plasma levels of \nduloxetine are higher in these patients. \n \nThe elimination half-life of duloxetine ranges from 8 to 17 hours (mean of 12 hours). After an \nintravenous dose the plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 22 l/hr to 46 l/hr (mean of 36 l/hr).  \nAfter an oral dose the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 33 to 261 l/hr (mean 101 \nl/hr). \n \nSpecial populations: \nGender: pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between males and females (apparent \nplasma clearance is approximatively 50% lower in females). Based upon the overlap in the range of \nclearance, gender-based pharmacokinetic differences do not justify the recommendation for using a \nlower dose for female patients.  \n \nAge: pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between younger and elderly females (≥65 \nyears) (AUC increases by about 25% and half-life is about 25% longer in the elderly), although the \nmagnitude of these changes is not sufficient to justify adjustments to the dose. As a general \nrecommendation, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nRenal impairment: end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving dialysis had 2-fold higher \nduloxetine Cmax and AUC values compared with healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic data on \nduloxetine is limited in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment: moderate liver disease (Child Pugh Class B) affected the pharmacokinetics of \nduloxetine. Compared with healthy subjects, the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine was 79% \nlower, the apparent terminal half-life was 2.3 times longer, and the AUC was 3.7 times higher in \npatients with moderate liver disease. The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine and its metabolites have not \nbeen studied in patients with mild or severe hepatic insufficiency. \n \nNursing mothers: The disposition of duloxetine was studied in 6 lactating women who were at least \n12-weeks postpartum. Duloxetine is detected in breast milk, and steady-state concentrations in breast \nmilk are about one-fourth those in plasma. The amount of duloxetine in breast milk is approximately \n7 µg/day while on 40 mg twice daily dosing. Lactation did not influence duloxetine pharmacokinetics \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nDuloxetine was not genotoxic in a standard battery of tests and was not carcinogenic in rats.  \nMultinucleated cells were seen in the liver in the absence of other histopathological changes in the rat \ncarcinogenicity study. The underlying mechanism and the clinical relevance are unknown. Female \nmice receiving duloxetine for 2 years had an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and \ncarcinomas at the high dose only (144 mg/kg/day), but these were considered to be secondary to \nhepatic microsomal enzyme induction. The relevance of this mouse data to humans is unknown. \nFemale rats receiving duloxetine (45 mg/kg/day) before and during mating and early pregnancy had a \ndecrease in maternal food consumption and body weight, oestrous cycle disruption, decreased live \nbirth indices and progeny survival, and progeny growth retardation at systemic exposure levels \nestimated to be at the most at maximum clinical exposure (AUC). In an embryotoxicity study in the \nrabbit, a higher incidence of cardiovascular and skeletal malformations was observed at systemic \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 26\n\nexposure levels below the maximum clinical exposure (AUC).

There may be loss of feeling in the affected area, or sensations such as touch, heat, cold or \npressure may cause pain). \n \nThe effect of DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM may be noticeable in many patients with \ndiabetic neuropathic pain within 1 week of treatment. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM \n \nDO NOT take DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM if you: \n− are allergic (hypersensitive) to duloxetine or any of the other ingredients of DULOXETINE \n\nBOEHRINGER INGELHEIM \n− have liver disease \n− have severe kidney disease are taking or have recently taken within the last 14 days, another \n\nantidepressant medicine called a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) (see also below in \nsection: ‘Taking other medicines’) \n\n−  \n− are taking fluvoxamine which is usually used to treat depression, ciprofloxacin or enoxacine \n\nwhich are used to treat some infections \n \nTalk to your doctor if you have high blood pressure. Your doctor will tell you if you should be taking \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM. \n \nTake special care with DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 40\n\nThe following are reasons why DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM may not be suitable for \nyou. Talk to your doctor before you take the medicine if you: \n \n- are taking other medicines to treat depression(see ‘Taking other medicines’) \n- are taking St. John’s Wort, a herbal treatment (Hypericum perforatum) \n- have kidney disease \n- have had seizures (fits) \n- have had mania  \n- suffer from  bipolar disorder \n- have eye problems, such as certain kinds of glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye) \n- have a history of bleeding disorders (tendency to develop bruises) \n- are at risk of low sodium levels \n- are currently being treated with another medicine which may cause liver damage \n- are taking other medicines containing duloxetine \n- have intolerance to some sugars (see end of Section 2) \n- are considering stopping DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM (see section 3) \n \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM may cause a sensation of restlessness or an inability to \nsit or stand still. You should tell your doctor if this happens to you. \n \nThoughts of suicide and worsening of your depression or anxiety disorder \nIf you are depressed and/or have anxiety disorders you can sometimes have thoughts of harming or \nkilling yourself. These may be increased when first starting antidepressants, since these medicines all \ntake time to work, usually about two weeks but sometimes longer. \nYou may be more likely to think like this if you:  \n- have previously had thoughts about killing or harming yourself. \n- are a young adult. Information from clinical trials has shown an increased risk of suicidal \n\nbehaviour in adults aged less than 25 years with psychiatric conditions who were treated with an \nantidepressant.     \n\nIf you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact your doctor or go to a \nhospital straight away. \nYou may find it helpful to tell a relative or close friend that you are depressed or have an anxiety \ndisorder, and ask them to read this leaflet. You might ask them to tell you if they think your depression \nor anxiety is getting worse, or if they are worried about changes in your behaviour. \n \nUse in children and adolescents under 18 years of age \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM should normally not be used for children and \nadolescents under 18 years. Also, you should know that patients under 18 have an increased risk of \nside-effects such as suicide attempt, suicidal thoughts and hostility (predominantly aggression, \noppositional behaviour and anger) when they take this class of medicines. Despite this, your doctor \nmay prescribe DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM for patients under 18 because he/she \ndecides that this is in their best interests. If your doctor has prescribed DULOXETINE \nBOEHRINGER INGELHEIM for a patient under 18 and you want to discuss this, please go back to \nyour doctor. You should inform your doctor if any of the symptoms listed above develop or worsen \nwhen patients under 18 are taking DULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM. Also, the long-term \nsafety effects concerning growth, maturation, and cognitive and behavioural development of \nDULOXETINE BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM in this age group have not yet been demonstrated. \n \nTaking other medicines \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription.
