NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nEMEND 40 mg hard capsules\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach capsule contains 40 mg of aprepitant.\n\nExcipient with known effect\nEach capsule contains 40 mg of sucrose.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nHard capsule.\n\nCapsules are opaque with a white body and mustard yellow cap with “464” and “40 mg” printed \nradially in black ink on the body.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nEMEND 40 mg is indicated for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in \nadults.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nClinical treatment guidelines should be considered as regards the need for prophylactic treatment \nagainst postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).\n\nThe recommended oral dose of EMEND is a single 40 mg dose within 3 hours prior to induction of \nanaesthesia.\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly ( 65 years)\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for the elderly (see section 5.2).\n\nGender\nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on gender (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment or for patients with end stage renal \ndisease undergoing haemodialysis (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. There are limited data in \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment and no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nAprepitant should be used with caution in these patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of EMEND 40 mg in children and adolescents below 18 years of age has not \nyet been established. Currently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2, but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made.\n\nMethod of administration\nThe hard capsule should be swallowed whole.\nEMEND may be taken with or without food.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPatients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment\nThere are limited data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and no data in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment. EMEND should be used with caution in these patients (see section 5.2).\n\nCYP3A4 interactions\nEMEND (40 mg) should be used with caution in patients receiving concomitant administration of \npimozide, terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride or ergot alkaloid derivatives. Inhibition of cytochrome \nP450 isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) by aprepitant could result in elevated plasma concentrations of these \nactive substances, potentially causing serious adverse reactions (see section 4.5).\n\nCo-administration with hormonal contraceptives\nThe efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days after administration \nof EMEND. Alternative non-hormonal back-up methods of contraception should be used during \ntreatment with EMEND and for 2 months following the last dose of EMEND (see section 4.5).\n\nFor further information on interaction potential of aprepitant at higher and multiple doses, please refer \nto the Summary of Product Characteristics for EMEND 80 mg hard capsules and EMEND 125 mg \nhard capsules.\n\nExcipients\nEMEND capsules contain sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, \nglucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrose-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nAprepitant is a substrate, and a dose-dependent inhibitor, and an inducer of CYP3A4. Aprepitant is \nalso an inducer of CYP2C9. During treatment, the single 40 mg dose of aprepitant recommended for \nPONV results in a weak inhibition of CYP3A4. After the treatment, EMEND causes a transient mild \ninduction of CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and glucuronidation. Aprepitant has been studied at higher doses. \nDuring treatment for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the 3-day 125 mg/80 mg \nregimen of aprepitant is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4. Aprepitant does not seem to interact with \nthe P-glycoprotein transporter, as suggested by the lack of interaction of aprepitant with digoxin.\n\nEffect of aprepitant on the pharmacokinetics of other active substances\nCYP3A4 inhibition\nAs a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, aprepitant (40 mg) can increase plasma concentrations of orally \nco-administered active substances that are metabolised through CYP3A4. The total exposure of orally \nadministered CYP3A4 substrates may increase up to approximately 1.5-fold after a single 40 mg dose \nof aprepitant; the effect of aprepitant on the plasma concentrations of intravenously administered \nCYP3A4 substrates is expected to be smaller.\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nEMEND 40 mg should be used with caution in patients receiving pimozide, terfenadine, astemizole, \ncisapride, or ergot alkaloid derivatives. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by aprepitant could result in elevated \nplasma concentrations of these active substances, potentially causing serious reactions.\n\nCorticosteroids \nDexamethasone: A single 40 mg dose of aprepitant, when co-administered with a single oral dose of \ndexamethasone 20 mg, increased the AUC of dexamethasone by 1.45-fold. No dose adjustment is \nrecommended.\n\nMethylprednisolone: Although the concomitant administration of methylprednisolone with the single \n40 mg dose of aprepitant has not been studied, a single 40 mg dose of aprepitant produces a weak \ninhibition of CYP3A4 and it is not expected to alter the plasma concentrations of methylprednisolone \nto a clinically significant degree. Therefore, no dose adjustment is recommended. \n\nMidazolam\nThe AUC of orally administrated midazolam increased by 1.2-fold when a single dose of 40 mg \naprepitant was co-administered with a single oral dose of 2 mg midazolam; this effect was not \nconsidered clinically important.\n\nInduction\nAs a mild inducer of CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and glucuronidation, aprepitant can decrease plasma \nconcentrations of substrates eliminated by these routes within two weeks following initiation of \ntreatment. For CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 substrates the induction is transient with a maximum effect \nreached after 3-5 days. The effect may be maintained for a few days, and is expected to be clinically \ninsignificant by two weeks after the end of treatment with EMEND. Data are lacking regarding effects \nof CYP2C8 and CYP2C19. Co-administration of EMEND with active substances that are known to be \nmetabolized by CYP2C9 (e.g., phenytoin, warfarin), may result in lower plasma concentrations of \nthese active substances. Based on interaction studies with tolbutamide and oral contraceptives, total \nexposure of concomitantly administered active substances metabolised by CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 may \nbe reduced up to 15-30 %.\n\nHormonal contraceptives\nThe efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days after administration \nof EMEND. Alternative non-hormonal back-up methods of contraception should be used during \ntreatment with EMEND and for 2 months following the last dose of EMEND. \n\n5-HT3 antagonists\nIn clinical interaction studies, aprepitant did not have clinically important effects on the \npharmacokinetics of ondansetron, granisetron, or hydrodolasetron (the active metabolite of \ndolasetron).\n\nEffect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant\nConcomitant administration of EMEND with active substances that inhibit CYP3A4 activity (e.g., \nketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone, \nand protease inhibitors) should be approached cautiously, as the combination is expected to result in \nseveral-fold increased plasma concentrations of aprepitant (see section 4.4).\n\nConcomitant administration of EMEND with active substances that strongly induce CYP3A4 activity \n(e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) should be avoided as the combination \nresults in reductions of the plasma concentrations of aprepitant that may result in decreased efficacy of \nEMEND. Concomitant administration of EMEND with herbal preparations containing St. John’s Wort \n(Hypericum perforatum) is not recommended.\n\nKetoconazole \nWhen a single 125 mg dose of aprepitant was administered on Day 5 of a 10-day regimen of \n400 mg/day of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the AUC of aprepitant increased \napproximately 5-fold and the mean terminal half-life of aprepitant increased approximately 3-fold.\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nRifampicin\nWhen a single 375 mg dose of aprepitant was administered on Day 9 of a 14-day regimen of \n600 mg/day of rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, the AUC of aprepitant decreased 91 % and the \nmean terminal half-life decreased 68 %. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nContraception in males and females\nThe efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days after administration \nof EMEND. Alternative non-hormonal back-up methods of contraception should be used during \ntreatment with EMEND and for 2 months following the last dose of EMEND (see sections 4.4 and \n4.5).\n\nPregnancy\nFor aprepitant no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. In animal studies there was no \nindication of direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). The potential effects on \nreproduction of alterations in neurokinin regulation are unknown. EMEND should not be used during \npregnancy unless clearly necessary.\n\nBreast-feeding\nAprepitant is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether aprepitant is excreted in \nhuman milk; therefore, breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with EMEND.\n\nFertility\nFertility studies did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to mating performance, \nfertility, embryonic/foetal development, or sperm count and motility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nEMEND may have minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness and fatigue \nmay occur following administration of EMEND (see section 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe safety profile of aprepitant was evaluated in approximately 6,500 adults.\n\nAdverse reactions were reported in approximately 4 % of adults treated with 40 mg aprepitant \ncompared with approximately 6 % of patients treated with 4 mg ondansetron intravenously. In \ncontrolled clinical studies in adults receiving general anaesthesia, 564 patients were administered \n40 mg aprepitant orally and 538 patients were administered 4 mg ondansetron intravenously. Most \nadverse reactions reported in these clinical studies were described as mild to moderate in intensity. \n\nThe most common adverse reaction reported at a greater incidence in adults treated with 40 mg \naprepitant (1.1 %) than with ondansetron (1.0 %) was ALT increased.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe following adverse reactions were observed in PONV studies in adults treated with aprepitant at a \ngreater incidence than with ondansetron or in postmarketing use:\n\nFrequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot \nbe estimated from the available data).\n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction Frequency\nImmune system disorders hypersensitivity reactions including \n\nanaphylactic reactions\nnot known\n\nPsychiatric disorders insomnia uncommon\nNervous system disorders dysarthria, hypoaesthesia, sensory disturbance uncommon\nEye disorders miosis, visual acuity reduced uncommon\nCardiac disorders bradycardia uncommon\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\n\ndyspnoea, wheezing uncommon\n\nGastrointestinal disorders abdominal pain upper, bowel sounds \nabnormal, dry mouth, nausea, stomach \ndiscomfort, constipation*, sub-ileus*\n\nuncommon\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\npruritus, rash, urticaria, Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis\n\nnot known\n\nInvestigations ALT increased common\n*Reported in patients taking a higher dose of aprepitant.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nAdditional adverse reactions were observed in adults treated with the aprepitant (125 mg/80 mg) \nregimen for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and at a greater incidence than with \nstandard therapy: abdominal distension, abdominal pain, acne, anaemia, anxiety, AST increased, \nasthenia, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, blood sodium decreased, candidiasis, cardiovascular \ndisorder, chest discomfort, cognitive disorder, conjunctivitis, cough, decreased appetite, disorientation, \ndizziness, duodenal ulcer perforation, dysgeusia, dyspepsia, dysuria, eructation, euphoric mood, faeces \nhard, fatigue, febrile neutropenia, flatulence, gait disturbance, gastroesophageal reflux disease, glucose \nurine present, hiccups, hot flush, hyperhidrosis, lethargy, malaise, muscle spasms, muscular weakness, \nnausea*, neutropenic colitis, neutrophil count decreased, oedema, oropharyngeal pain, palpitations, \nphotosensitivity reaction, pollakiuria, polydipsia, postnasal drip, rash pruritic, red blood cells urine \npositive, seborrhoea, skin lesion, sneezing, somnolence, staphylococcal infection, stomatitis, throat \nirritation, tinnitus, urine output increased, vomiting*, weight decreased.\n*Nausea and vomiting were efficacy parameters in the first 5 days of post-chemotherapy treatment and were \nreported as reactions only thereafter.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nIn the event of overdose, EMEND should be discontinued and general supportive treatment and \nmonitoring should be provided. Because of the antiemetic activity of aprepitant, emesis induced by a \nmedicinal product may not be effective.\n\nAprepitant cannot be removed by haemodialysis.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiemetics and antinauseants, ATC code: A04AD12\n\nAprepitant is a selective high-affinity antagonist at human substance P neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7\n\nIn 2 multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active comparator-controlled, parallel-group phase III \nclinical studies in adults, aprepitant was compared with ondansetron for the prevention of PONV in \n1,658 patients undergoing open abdominal surgery. The majority of adults were women (> 90 %), \nmainly undergoing gynaecological surgery. Patients were randomised to receive 40 mg aprepitant, \n125 mg aprepitant, or 4 mg ondansetron. Aprepitant was given orally with 50 mL of water 1 to 3 hours \nbefore anaesthesia. Ondansetron was given intravenously immediately before induction of anaesthesia. \nThe antiemetic activity of aprepitant was evaluated during the 0 to 48 hour period following the end of \nsurgery.\n\nThe results show that a higher percentage of post-surgical adults experienced complete response (no \nemesis and no use of rescue) with aprepitant 40 mg than with ondansetron 4 mg (lower bound of C.I. \nis 0.0 indicating borderline significance) as described in Table 1.\n\nTable 1\nPercent of post-operative adults responding by treatment group\n\nCombined results from 2 Phase III trials\n\nAprepitant\n40 mg orally\n\n(N=541)\n\nOndansetron\n4 mg intravenously\n\n(N=526)\n\nPercentage point\ndifference (%) §\n\nand 95 % C.I. #\n\nn/m (%) n/m (%) % 95 % C.I.\n\nComplete response (0-24 \nhours) †\n\n298/541 (55.1) 258/526 (49.0) 5.9 (0.0, 11.8)\n\n† Complete response: No emesis and no use of rescue\n§ Difference (%) calculated as Aprepitant 40 mg minus Ondansetron 4 mg\n# Difference (%) and 95 % C.I. calculated using stratified Miettinen-Nurminen method using Cochran-\n\nMantel-Haenszel weights\n\nThe reduction in risk for a vomiting episode over the 0 to 24 hour period with aprepitant 40 mg \nrelative to ondansetron 4 mg was 53.3 % (95 % C.I.: 35.3 to 66.3) in an analysis that censors patients \nat the time of rescue use.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and exploratory efficacy of aprepitant were evaluated in a Phase I clinical study (n=50) \nusing a 40 mg powder for oral suspension. The percentage of subjects reporting no vomiting over the \nfirst 24 hours following surgery was similar for subjects receiving aprepitant versus ondansetron. No \nnew safety concerns were identified. However, the data from this small study do not support a \nconclusion on the optimal dosing regimen. Further studies evaluating the use of aprepitant in \npaediatric patients are on-going (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAprepitant displays non-linear pharmacokinetics. Both clearance and absolute bioavailability decrease \nwith increasing dose.\n\nAbsorption\nThe mean absolute oral bioavailability of aprepitant is 67 % for the 80 mg capsule and 59 % for the \n125 mg capsule. The mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of aprepitant occurred at approximately \n4 hours (tmax).\n\nFollowing oral administration of a single 40 mg dose of EMEND in the fasted state, the AUC0-\n(mean ± SD) was 8.0 ± 2.1 µg  h/mL and the Cmax was 0.7 ± 0.24 µg/mL. The median tmax was \n3.0 hours.\n\nConcomitant intake of a 40 mg dose with a standard breakfast decreased the aprepitant Cmax by 18 % \nbut did not affect AUC. This is not considered to be clinically important.\n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nDistribution\nAprepitant is highly protein bound, with a mean of 97 %. The geometric mean apparent volume of \ndistribution at steady state (Vdss) is approximately 66 L in humans.\n\nBiotransformation\nAprepitant undergoes extensive metabolism. In healthy young adults, aprepitant accounts for \napproximately 19 % of the radioactivity in plasma over 72 hours following a single intravenous \nadministration 100 mg dose of [14C]-fosaprepitant, a prodrug for aprepitant, indicating a substantial \npresence of metabolites in the plasma. Twelve metabolites of aprepitant have been identified in human \nplasma. The metabolism of aprepitant occurs largely via oxidation at the morpholine ring and its side \nchains and the resultant metabolites were only weakly active. In vitro studies using human liver \nmicrosomes indicate that aprepitant is metabolised primarily by CYP3A4 and potentially with minor \ncontribution by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19.\n\nElimination\nAprepitant is not excreted unchanged in urine. Metabolites are excreted in urine and via biliary \nexcretion in faeces. Following a single intravenously administered 100 mg dose of [14C]-fosaprepitant, \na prodrug for aprepitant to healthy subjects, 57 % of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and 45 % \nin faeces.\n\nThe plasma clearance of aprepitant is dose-dependent, decreasing with increased dose and ranged from \napproximately 60 to 72 mL/min in the therapeutic dose range. The terminal half-life is approximately \n9 hours after administration of a single 40 mg dose.\n\nPharmacokinetics in special populations\nElderly: Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of aprepitant on Day 1 and 80 mg once \ndaily on Days 2 through 5, the AUC0-24hr of aprepitant was 21 % higher on Day 1 and 36 % higher on \nDay 5 in elderly ( 65 years) relative to younger adults. The Cmax was 10 % higher on Day 1 and 24 % \nhigher on Day 5 in elderly relative to younger adults. These differences are not considered clinically \nmeaningful. No dose adjustment for EMEND is necessary in elderly patients.\n\nGender: Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of aprepitant, the Cmax for aprepitant is \n16 % higher in females as compared with males. The half-life of aprepitant is 25 % lower in females \nas compared with males and its tmax occurs at approximately the same time. These differences are not \nconsidered clinically meaningful. No dose adjustment for EMEND is necessary based on gender.\n\nHepatic impairment: Mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) does not affect the \npharmacokinetics of aprepitant to a clinically relevant extent. No dose adjustment is necessary for \npatients with mild hepatic impairment. Conclusions regarding the influence of moderate hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh class B) on aprepitant pharmacokinetics cannot be drawn from available data. \nThere are no clinical or pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nclass C).\n\nRenal impairment: A single 240 mg dose of aprepitant was administered to patients with severe renal \nimpairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) and to patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring \nhaemodialysis.\n\nIn patients with severe renal impairment, the AUC0- of total aprepitant (unbound and protein bound) \ndecreased by 21 % and Cmax decreased by 32 %, relative to healthy subjects. In patients with ESRD \nundergoing haemodialysis, the AUC0- of total aprepitant decreased by 42 % and Cmax decreased by \n32 %. Due to modest decreases in protein binding of aprepitant in patients with renal disease, the AUC \nof pharmacologically active unbound aprepitant was not significantly affected in patients with renal \nimpairment compared with healthy subjects. Haemodialysis conducted 4 or 48 hours after dosing had \nno significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant; less than 0.2 % of the dose was recovered \nin the dialysate.\n\n \n\n\n\n9\n\nNo dose adjustment for EMEND is necessary for patients with renal impairment or for patients with \nESRD undergoing haemodialysis.\n\nPaediatric population: In a study using a powder for oral suspension formulation, a single dose of \n40 mg aprepitant administered to adolescent patients (aged 12 through 17 years) resulted in a mean \nAUC0-48hr of 6 µg/mL with a mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 0.5 µg/mL occurring at \napproximately 4 hours. Administration of body surface area adjusted doses to patients 6 months to less \nthan 12 years achieved a mean AUC0-48hr above 4 µg/mL with a mean Cmax above 0.5 µg/mL occurring \nat approximately 3 hours.\n\nRelationship between concentration and effect\nUsing a highly specific NK1-receptor tracer, positron emission tomography (PET) studies in healthy \nyoung men have shown that aprepitant penetrates into the brain and occupies NK1 receptors in a dose-\nand plasma-concentration-dependent manner. Aprepitant plasma concentrations achieved with the \n3-day regimen of EMEND are predicted to provide greater than 95 % occupancy of brain NK1\nreceptors.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nPre-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and \nrepeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction and development. \nIt should be noted that systemic exposure in adult male rats was lower than the therapeutic exposure in \nhumans at 40 mg. Consequently, no adequate assessment of potential effects on male fertility in rats \ncan be made. However, in a 9 month study in dogs, no organ weight changes nor gross or \nhistomorphologic findings were present in male reproductive organs at systemic exposures 35-fold \nabove the therapeutic exposure in humans at 40 mg. Although no adverse effects were noted in \nreproduction studies when adult female animals were exposed 3.5-to 4-fold above the therapeutic \nexposure in humans at 40 mg, the potential effects on reproduction of alterations in neurokinin \nregulation are unknown.\n\nIn a juvenile toxicity study in rats treated from post natal day 10 to day 63 aprepitant led to an earlier\nvaginal opening in females from 250 mg/kg b.i.d. and to a delayed preputial separation in males, from\n10 mg/kg b.i.d. There were no margins to clinically relevant exposure. There were no \ntreatment-related effects on mating, fertility or embryonic/foetal survival, and no pathological changes \nin the reproductive organs. In a juvenile toxicity study in dogs treated from post natal day 14 to \nday 42, a decreased testicular weight and Leydig cell size were seen in the males at 6 mg/kg/day and \nincreased uterine weight, hypertrophy of the uterus and cervix, and oedema of vaginal tissues were \nseen in females from 4 mg/kg/day. There were no margins to clinically relevant exposure of \naprepitant. For short term treatment according to recommended dose regimen these findings are\nconsidered unlikely to be clinically relevant.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nPrevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic \ncisplatin-based cancer chemotherapy in adults. \n\nPrevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in \nadults.\n\nEMEND 165 mg is given as part of combination therapy (see section 4.2).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nEMEND 165 mg is given on Day 1 only, approximately one hour before the start of chemotherapy, as \npart of a regimen that includes a corticosteroid and a 5-HT3 antagonist. \n\nThe following regimens are recommended in adults for the prevention of nausea and vomiting \nassociated with emetogenic cancer chemotherapy:\n\n \n\n\n\n12\n\nHighly Emetogenic Chemotherapy Regimen\nDay 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4\n\nEMEND 165 mg orally none none none\nDexamethasone 12 mg orally 8 mg orally 8 mg orally \n\ntwice daily\n8 mg orally \ntwice daily\n\n5-HT3 antagonists Standard dose of \n5-HT3 antagonists.\n\nSee the product \ninformation for the \n\nselected 5-HT3\nantagonist for the \nappropriate dosing \n\ninformation\n\nnone none none\n\nDexamethasone should be administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy treatment on Day 1 and in \nthe morning on Days 2 to 4. Dexamethasone should also be administered in the evenings on Days 3 \nand 4. The dose of dexamethasone accounts for active substance interactions.\n\nModerately Emetogenic Chemotherapy Regimen\nDay 1\n\nEMEND 165 mg orally\nDexamethasone 12 mg orally\n\n5-HT3 antagonists Standard dose of 5-HT3\nantagonists. See the\n\nproduct information for \nthe selected 5-HT3\nantagonist for the \nappropriate dosing \n\ninformation\n\nDexamethasone should be administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy treatment on Day 1. The \ndose of dexamethasone accounts for active substance interactions.\n\nEfficacy data in combination with other corticosteroids and 5-HT3 antagonists are limited. For \nadditional information on the co-administration with corticosteroids, see section 4.5. Please refer to the \nSummary of Product Characteristics of co-administered 5-HT3 antagonist medicinal products.\n\nFosaprepitant 150 mg, a lyophilised prodrug of aprepitant for intravenous administration, is also \navailable as a single dose and may be used as an alternative to oral EMEND 165 mg.\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly ( 65 years)\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for the elderly (see section 5.2).\n\nGender\nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on gender (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment or for patients with end stage renal \ndisease undergoing haemodialysis (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. There are limited data in \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment and no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nAprepitant should be used with caution in these patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\n \n\n\n\n13\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of EMEND 165 mg in children and adolescents below 18 years of age has not \nbeen established. No data are available. Other pharmaceutical forms/strengths may be more \nappropriate for administration to this population.\n\nMethod of administration\nThe hard capsule should be swallowed whole.\nEMEND may be taken with or without food.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nCo-administration with pimozide, terfenadine, astemizole or cisapride (see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPatients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment\nThere are limited data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and no data in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment. EMEND should be used with caution in these patients (see section 5.2).\n\nCYP3A4 interactions\nEMEND should be used with caution in patients receiving concomitant active substances that are \nmetabolised primarily through CYP3A4 and with a narrow therapeutic range, such as cyclosporine, \ntacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, alfentanil, ergot alkaloid derivatives, fentanyl, and quinidine (see \nsection 4.5). Additionally, concomitant administration with irinotecan should be approached with \nparticular caution as the combination might result in increased toxicity.\n\nCo-administration with warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate)\nIn patients on chronic warfarin therapy, the International Normalised Ratio (INR) should be monitored \nclosely during treatment with EMEND and for 14 days following the use of EMEND (see section 4.5).\n\nCo-administration with hormonal contraceptives\nThe efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days after administration \nof EMEND. Alternative non-hormonal back-up methods of contraception should be used during \ntreatment with EMEND and for 2 months following the last dose of EMEND (see section 4.5).\n\nExcipients\nEMEND capsules contain sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, \nglucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrose-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nAprepitant is a substrate, a moderate inhibitor, and an inducer of CYP3A4. Aprepitant is also an \ninducer of CYP2C9. During treatment with EMEND, CYP3A4 is inhibited for up to 4 days. EMEND \ncauses a transient mild induction of CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and glucuronidation approximately one week \nafter treatment. Aprepitant does not seem to interact with the P-glycoprotein transporter, as suggested \nby the lack of interaction of aprepitant with digoxin.\n\nEffect of aprepitant on the pharmacokinetics of other active substances\nCYP3A4 inhibition\nAs a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, aprepitant can increase plasma concentrations of co-administered \nactive substances that are metabolised through CYP3A4. The total exposure of orally administered\nCYP3A4 substrates may increase up to approximately 3-fold for 2 days following a single 165 mg \ndose of EMEND and decreasing to baseline approximately 4 days after dosing of 165 mg EMEND. \nThe effect of aprepitant on the plasma concentrations of intravenously administered CYP3A4 \nsubstrates is expected to be smaller. EMEND must not be used concurrently with pimozide, \n\n \n\n\n\n14\n\nterfenadine, astemizole, or cisapride (see section 4.3). Inhibition of CYP3A4 by aprepitant could result \nin elevated plasma concentrations of these active substances, potentially causing serious or life-\nthreatening reactions. Caution is advised during concomitant administration of EMEND and active \nsubstances that are metabolised primarily through CYP3A4 and with a narrow therapeutic range, such \nas cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, alfentanil, diergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, and \nquinidine (see section 4.4).\n\nCorticosteroids\nDexamethasone: Interaction studies with aprepitant 165 mg and dexamethasone have not been \nconducted; however, the following study with 200 mg of aprepitant should be considered when using \nEMEND 165 mg with oral dexamethasone. Aprepitant, when given as a single dose of 200 mg in the \nfed state (standard light breakfast) on Day 1 with oral dexamethasone, co-administered orally as 12 mg \non Day 1 and 8 mg on Days 2 through 4, increased the AUC0-24hr of dexamethasone by 2.1- and \n2.3-fold on Days 1 and 2, to a lesser extent (1.4-fold increase) on Day 3, and had no effect on Day 4 \n(1.1-fold). The daily dose of dexamethasone on Days 1 and 2 should be reduced by approximately \n50 % when co-administered with EMEND 165 mg on Day 1 to achieve exposures of dexamethasone \nsimilar to those obtained when given without EMEND 165 mg.\n\nMethylprednisolone: Interaction studies with aprepitant 165 mg and methylprednisolone have not \nbeen conducted; however, the following study with the aprepitant 125 mg/80 mg regimen should be \nconsidered when using EMEND 165 mg with methylprednisolone. EMEND, when given as a regimen \nof 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, increased the AUC of methylprednisolone, a \nCYP3A4 substrate, by 1.3-fold on Day 1 and by 2.5-fold on Day 3, when methylprednisolone was \nco-administered intravenously as 125 mg on Day 1 and orally as 40 mg on Days 2 and 3. \n\nDuring continuous treatment with methylprednisolone, the AUC of methylprednisolone may decrease \nat later time points within 14 days following initiation of the EMEND dose, due to the inducing effect \nof aprepitant on CYP3A4. This effect may be expected to be more pronounced for orally administered \nmethylprednisolone.\n\nChemotherapeutic medicinal products\nInteraction studies with aprepitant 165 mg and chemotherapeutic medicinal products have not been \nconducted; however, based on studies with 3-day regimen of oral aprepitant and docetaxel and \nvinorelbine, EMEND 165 mg is not expected to have a clinically relevant interaction with \nintravenously administered docetaxel and vinorelbine. In pharmacokinetic studies, EMEND, when \ngiven as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, did not influence the \npharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered intravenously on Day 1 or vinorelbine administered \nintravenously on Day 1 or Day 8. Because the effect of EMEND on the pharmacokinetics of orally \nadministered CYP3A4 substrates is greater than the effect of EMEND on the pharmacokinetics of \nintravenously administered CYP3A4 substrates, an interaction with orally administered \nchemotherapeutic medicinal products metabolised primarily or partly by CYP3A4 (e.g., etoposide, \nvinorelbine) cannot be excluded. Caution is advised and additional monitoring may be appropriate in \npatients receiving medicinal products metabolized primarily or partly by CYP3A4 (see section 4.4). \nPost-marketing events of neurotoxicity, a potential adverse reaction of ifosfamide, have been reported \nafter aprepitant and ifosfamide co-administration.\n\nImmunosuppressants\nFollowing a single 165 mg aprepitant dose, a transient moderate increase for two days possibly \nfollowed by a mild decrease in exposure of immunosuppressants metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g.,\ncyclosporine, tacrolimus, everolimus and sirolimus) is expected. Given the short duration of increased \nexposure, dose reduction of the immunosuppressant based on Therapeutic Dose Monitoring is not \nrecommended on the day of and the day after administration of EMEND 165 mg.\n\nMidazolam\nInteraction studies with aprepitant 165 mg and midazolam have not been conducted; however, the \nfollowing study with 200 mg of aprepitant should be considered when using EMEND 165 mg with \nmedicinal products metabolised via CYP3A4. In a study with 2 mg midazolam orally co-administered \n\n \n\n\n\n15\n\nwith 200 mg aprepitant in the fed state (standard light breakfast), the AUC0-∞ of midazolam, a \nsensitive CYP3A4 substrate, was increased 3.2-fold on Day 1. No clinically important effect resulted \non Day 4 (midazolam AUC0-∞ 1.2-fold increase) and a slight change in midazolam AUC0-∞ was \nobserved on Day 8 (35 % decrease).\n\nThe potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of midazolam or other benzodiazepines \nmetabolised via CYP3A4 (alprazolam, triazolam) should be considered when co-administering these \nmedicinal products with EMEND 165 mg.\n\nInduction\nAs a mild inducer of CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and glucuronidation, aprepitant can decrease plasma \nconcentrations of substrates eliminated by these routes. This effect may become apparent \napproximately 7 days following the single dose administration of EMEND 165 mg. The effect is \nmaintained for a few days, thereafter slowly declines and is clinically insignificant within 14 days after \nend of EMEND treatment. A single dose of aprepitant 200 mg on Day 1 co-administered with \nmidazolam, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, on Days 1, 4 and 8 resulted in a 35 % reduction of \nmidazolam AUC0-∞ on Day 8. It is anticipated that EMEND 165 mg would cause similar induction of \nCYP2C9, CYP3A4, and glucuronidation than that caused by the administration of the 3-day oral \naprepitant regimen, for which a transient induction with its maximum effect 6 to 8 days after first \naprepitant dose has been observed. The 3-day oral aprepitant regimen resulted in an about 30-35 % \nreduction in AUC of CYP2C9 substrates and up to a 64 % decrease in ethinyl estradiol trough \nconcentrations. Data are lacking regarding effects on CYP2C8 and CYP2C19. Caution is advised \nwhen warfarin, acenocoumarol, tolbutamide, phenytoin or other active substances that are known to be \nmetabolised by CYP2C9 are administered with EMEND 165 mg.\n\nWarfarin\nIn patients on chronic warfarin therapy, the prothrombin time (INR) should be monitored closely \nduring treatment and for 14 days following the use of EMEND 165 mg for chemotherapy induced \nnausea and vomiting (see section 4.4). When a single 125 mg dose of EMEND was administered on \nDay 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3 to healthy subjects who were stabilised on chronic warfarin \ntherapy, there was no effect of EMEND on the plasma AUC of R(+) or S(-) warfarin determined on \nDay 3; however, there was a 34 % decrease in S(-) warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) trough \nconcentration accompanied by a 14 % decrease in INR 5 days after completion of EMEND. \n\nTolbutamide\nEMEND, when given as 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, decreased the AUC of \ntolbutamide (a CYP2C9 substrate) by 23 % on Day 4, 28 % on Day 8, and 15 % on Day 15, when a \nsingle dose of tolbutamide 500 mg was administered orally prior to the administration of the 3-day \nregimen of EMEND and on Days 4, 8, and 15.\n\nHormonal contraceptives\nThe efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days after administration \nof EMEND. Alternative non-hormonal back-up methods of contraception should be used during \ntreatment with EMEND and for 2 months following the last dose of EMEND. \n\nIn a clinical study, single doses of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone \nwere administered on Days 1 through 21 with EMEND, given as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 8 and \n80 mg/day on Days 9 and 10 with ondansetron 32 mg intravenously on Day 8 and oral dexamethasone \ngiven as 12 mg on Day 8 and 8 mg/day on Days 9, 10, and 11. During days 9 through 21 in this study, \nthere was as much as a 64 % decrease in ethinyl estradiol trough concentrations and as much as a 60 % \ndecrease in norethindrone trough concentrations. \n\n5-HT3 antagonists\nIn clinical interaction studies, aprepitant, when given as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg on \nDays 2 and 3, did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron, \ngranisetron, or hydrodolasetron (the active metabolite of dolasetron).\n\n \n\n\n\n16\n\nEffect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant\nConcomitant administration of EMEND with active substances that inhibit CYP3A4 activity (e.g., \nketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone, \nand protease inhibitors) should be approached cautiously, as the combination is expected to result in \nseveral-fold increased plasma concentrations of aprepitant (see section 4.4). \n\nConcomitant administration of EMEND with active substances that strongly induce CYP3A4 activity \n(e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) should be avoided as the combination \nresults in reductions of the plasma concentrations of aprepitant that may result in decreased efficacy of \nEMEND. Concomitant administration of EMEND with herbal preparations containing St. John’s Wort \n(Hypericum perforatum) is not recommended.\n\nKetoconazole\nWhen a single 125 mg dose of aprepitant was administered on Day 5 of a 10-day regimen of \n400 mg/day of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the AUC of aprepitant increased \napproximately 5-fold and the mean terminal half-life of aprepitant increased approximately 3-fold.\n\nRifampicin\nWhen a single 375 mg dose of aprepitant was administered on Day 9 of a 14-day regimen of \n600 mg/day of rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, the AUC of aprepitant decreased 91 % and the \nmean terminal half-life decreased 68 %. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nContraception in males and females\nThe efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days after administration \nof EMEND. Alternative non-hormonal back-up methods of contraception should be used during \ntreatment with EMEND and for 2 months following the last dose of EMEND (see sections 4.4 and \n4.5).\n\nPregnancy\nFor aprepitant no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. The potential for reproductive \ntoxicity of aprepitant has not been fully characterised, since exposure levels above the therapeutic \nexposure in humans at the 125 mg/80 mg and 165 mg doses could not be attained in animal studies. \nThese studies did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, \nembryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). The potential \neffects on reproduction of alterations in neurokinin regulation are unknown. EMEND should not be \nused during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\n\nBreast-feeding\nAprepitant is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether aprepitant is excreted in \nhuman milk; therefore, breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with EMEND.\n\nFertility\nThe potential for effects of aprepitant on fertility has not been fully characterised because exposure \nlevels above the therapeutic exposure in humans could not be attained in animal studies. These fertility \nstudies did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to mating performance, fertility, \nembryonic/foetal development, or sperm count and motility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nEMEND may have minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness and fatigue \nmay occur following administration of EMEND (see section 4.8).\n\n \n\n\n\n17\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe safety profile of aprepitant was evaluated in approximately 6,500 adults.\n\nBased on a comparable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, the 1-day oral regimen of \nEMEND 165 mg is anticipated to have a similar safety and tolerability profile to that of the 1-day \nregimen of fosaprepitant 150 mg and the 3-day oral aprepitant regimen in chemotherapy patients (see \nsection 5.2).\n\nThe most common adverse reactions reported at a greater incidence in adults treated with the 3-day \noral aprepitant regimen than with standard therapy in patients receiving Highly Emetogenic \nChemotherapy (HEC) were: hiccups (4.6 % versus 2.9 %), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased \n(2.8 % versus 1.1 %), dyspepsia (2.6 % versus 2.0 %), constipation (2.4 % versus 2.0 %), headache \n(2.0 % versus 1.8 %), and decreased appetite (2.0 % versus 0.5 %). The most common adverse \nreaction reported at a greater incidence in patients treated with the 3-day oral aprepitant regimen than \nwith standard therapy in patients receiving Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy (MEC) was fatigue \n(1.4 % versus 0.9 %).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe following adverse reactions were observed in a pooled analysis of the HEC and MEC studies at a \ngreater incidence with aprepitant than with standard therapy in adults or postmarketing use:\n\nFrequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot \nbe estimated from the available data).\n\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction Frequency\nInfection and infestations candidiasis, staphylococcal infection rare\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders\n\nfebrile neutropenia, anaemia uncommon\n\nImmune system disorders hypersensitivity reactions including \nanaphylactic reactions\n\nnot known\n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders\n\ndecreased appetite common\npolydipsia rare\n\nPsychiatric disorders anxiety uncommon\ndisorientation, euphoric mood rare\n\nNervous system disorders headache common\ndizziness, somnolence uncommon\ncognitive disorder, lethargy, dysgeusia rare\n\nEye disorders conjunctivitis rare\nEar and labyrinth disorders tinnitus rare\nCardiac disorders palpitations uncommon\n\nbradycardia, cardiovascular disorder rare\nVascular disorders hot flush uncommon\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\n\nhiccups common\noropharyngeal pain, sneezing, cough, \npostnasal drip, throat irritation\n\nrare\n\nGastrointestinal disorders constipation, dyspepsia common\neructation, nausea*, vomiting*, \ngastroesophageal reflux disease, abdominal \npain, dry mouth, flatulence\n\nuncommon\n\nduodenal ulcer perforation, stomatitis, \nabdominal distension, faeces hard, neutropenic \ncolitis\n\nrare\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue rash, acne uncommon\n\n \n\n\n\n18\n\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction Frequency\ndisorders photosensitivity reaction, hyperhidrosis, \n\nseborrhoea, skin lesion, rash pruritic, \nStevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis\n\nrare\n\npruritus, urticaria not known\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders\n\nmuscular weakness, muscle spasms rare\n\nRenal and urinary disorders dysuria uncommon\npollakiuria rare\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nfatigue common\nasthenia, malaise uncommon\noedema, chest discomfort, gait disturbance rare\n\nInvestigations ALT increased common\nAST increased, blood alkaline phosphatase \nincreased\n\nuncommon\n\nred blood cells urine positive, blood sodium \ndecreased, weight decreased, neutrophil count \ndecreased, glucose urine present, urine output \nincreased\n\nrare\n\n*Nausea and vomiting were efficacy parameters in the first 5 days of post-chemotherapy treatment and were \nreported as adverse reactions only thereafter.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nThe adverse reactions profiles in adults in the Multiple-Cycle extension of HEC and MEC studies for \nup to 6 additional cycles of chemotherapy were generally similar to those observed in Cycle 1.\n\nIn an additional active-controlled clinical study in 1,169 adult patients receiving the 3-day oral \naprepitant regimen and HEC, the adverse reactions profile was generally similar to that seen in the \nother HEC studies with the 3-day oral aprepitant regimen.\n\nAdditional adverse reactions were observed in patients treated with aprepitant for postoperative nausea \nand vomiting (PONV) and a greater incidence than with ondansetron: abdominal pain upper, bowel \nsounds abnormal, constipation*, dysarthria, dyspnoea, hypoaesthesia, insomnia, miosis, nausea, \nsensory disturbance, stomach discomfort, sub-ileus*, visual acuity reduced, wheezing.\n*Reported in patients taking a higher dose of aprepitant.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nIn the event of overdose, EMEND should be discontinued and general supportive treatment and \nmonitoring should be provided. Because of the antiemetic activity of aprepitant, emesis induced by a \nmedicinal product may not be effective.\n\nAprepitant cannot be removed by haemodialysis.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiemetics and antinauseants, ATC code: A04AD12\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n19\n\nAprepitant is a selective high-affinity antagonist at human substance P neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors. \nFosaprepitant, a prodrug of aprepitant, when administered intravenously is rapidly converted to \naprepitant.\n\nBased on a comparable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, the 1-day oral regimen of \nEMEND 165 mg is anticipated to have a similar efficacy profile to that of the 1-day regimen of \nfosaprepitant 150 mg and 3-day regimen of oral aprepitant (see section 5.2) \n\n3-day regimen of aprepitant in adults\nIn 2 randomised, double-blind studies encompassing a total of 1,094 adult patients receiving\nchemotherapy that included cisplatin  70 mg/m2, aprepitant in combination with an \nondansetron/dexamethasone regimen (see section 4.2) was compared with a standard regimen (placebo \nplus ondansetron 32 mg intravenously administered on Day 1 plus dexamethasone 20 mg orally on \nDay 1 and 8 mg orally twice daily on Days 2 to 4). Although a 32 mg intravenous dose of ondansetron \nwas used in clinical trials, this is no longer the recommended dose. See the product information for the \nselected 5-HT3 antagonist for appropriate dosing information.\n\nEfficacy was based on evaluation of the following composite measure: complete response (defined as \nno emetic episodes and no use of rescue therapy) primarily during Cycle 1. The results were evaluated \nfor each individual study and for the 2 studies combined.\n\nA summary of the key study results from the combined analysis is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1\nPercent of adult patients receiving Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy responding \n\nby treatment group and phase — Cycle 1\n\nCOMPOSITE MEASURES\n\nAprepitant \nregimen\n\n(N= 521) †\n\n%\n\nStandard \ntherapy\n\n(N= 524) †\n\n%\n\nDifferences*\n\n         %             (95 % CI)\n\nComplete response (no emesis and no rescue therapy)\nOverall (0-120 hours)\n0-24 hours\n25-120 hours\n\n67.7\n86.0\n71.5\n\n47.8\n73.2\n51.2\n\n19.9\n12.7\n20.3\n\n(14.0, 25.8)\n(7.9, 17.6)\n(14.5, 26.1)\n\nINDIVIDUAL MEASURES\nNo emesis (no emetic episodes regardless of use of rescue therapy)\n\nOverall (0-120 hours)\n0-24 hours\n25-120 hours\n\n71.9\n86.8\n76.2\n\n49.7\n74.0\n53.5\n\n22.2\n12.7\n22.6\n\n(16.4, 28.0)\n(8.0, 17.5)\n(17.0, 28.2)\n\nNo significant nausea (maximum VAS < 25 mm on a scale of 0-100 mm)\nOverall (0-120 hours)\n25-120 hours \n\n72.1\n74.0\n\n64.9\n66.9\n\n7.2\n7.1\n\n(1.6, 12.8)\n(1.5, 12.6)\n\n* The confidence intervals were calculated with no adjustment for gender and concomitant chemotherapy, which \nwere included in the primary analysis of odds ratios and logistic models.\n†  One patient in the Aprepitant regimen only had data in the acute phase and was excluded from the overall and \ndelayed phase analyses; one patient in the Standard regimen only had data in the delayed phase and was \nexcluded from the overall and acute phase analyses.\n\n \n\n\n\n20\n\nThe estimated time to first emesis in the combined analysis is depicted by the Kaplan-Meier plot in \nFigure 1.\n\nFigure 1\nPercent of adult patients receiving Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy \n\nwho remain emesis free over time – Cycle 1\n\n0 12 24 36 48 60 72 84 96 108 120\n0\n\n40%\n\n50%\n\n60%\n\n70%\n\n80%\n\n90%\n\n100%\n\nP\ne\n\nrc\ne\n\nn\nt \n\no\nf \n\nP\na\n\nti\ne\nn\n\nts\n\nAprepitant Regimen (N=520)\nStandard Therapy (N=523)\n\nTime (hours)\n\nStatistically significant differences in efficacy were also observed in each of the 2 individual studies.\n\nIn the same 2 clinical studies, 851 adult patients continued into the Multiple-Cycle extension for up to \n5 additional cycles of chemotherapy.

The efficacy of the aprepitant regimen was apparently \nmaintained during all cycles.\n\nIn a second multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, clinical study, the aprepitant \nregimen was compared with standard therapy in 848 adult patients (652 females, 196 males) receiving \na chemotherapy regimen that included any intravenous dose of oxaliplatin, carboplatin, epirubicin, \nidarubicin, ifosfamide, irinotecan, daunorubicin, doxorubicin; cyclophosphamide intravenously \n(< 1,500 mg/m2); or cytarabine intravenously (> 1 g/m2). Patients receiving the aprepitant regimen \nwere receiving chemotherapy for a variety of tumour types including 52 % with breast cancer, 21 % \nwith gastrointestinal cancers including colorectal cancer, 13 % with lung cancer and 6 % with \ngynaecological cancers. The aprepitant regimen in combination with an ondansetron/dexamethasone \nregimen (see section 4.2) was compared with standard therapy (placebo in combination with \nondansetron 8 mg orally (twice on Day 1, and every 12 hours on Days 2 and 3) plus dexamethasone \n20 mg orally on Day 1).\n\nEfficacy was based on the evaluation of the following primary and key secondary endpoints: No \nvomiting in the overall period (0 to 120 hours post-chemotherapy), evaluation of safety and \ntolerability of the aprepitant regimen for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), and \ncomplete response (defined as no vomiting and no use of rescue therapy) in the overall period (0 to \n120 hours post-chemotherapy). Additionally, no significant nausea in the overall period (0 to \n120 hours post-chemotherapy) was evaluated as an exploratory endpoint, and in the acute and delayed \nphases as a post-hoc analysis.\n\nA summary of the key study results is shown in Table 3.\n\n \n\n\n\n22\n\nTable 3\nPercent of adult patients responding by treatment group and phase for Study 2 – Cycle 1\n\nModerately Emetogenic Chemotherapy\n\nAprepitant \nregimen\n(N= 425)\n\n%\n\nStandard \ntherapy\n\n(N= 406)\n%\n\nDifferences*\n\n        %             (95 % CI)\n\nComplete response (no emesis and no rescue therapy)\nOverall (0-120 hours)\n0-24 hours\n25-120 hours\n\n68.7\n\n89.2\n70.8\n\n56.3\n\n80.3\n60.9\n\n12.4\n8.9\n9.9\n\n(5.9, 18.9)\n(4.0, 13.8)\n(3.5, 16.3)\n\nNo emesis (no emetic episodes regardless of use of rescue therapy)\nOverall (0-120 hours)\n0-24 hours\n25-120 hours\n\n76.2\n92.0\n77.9\n\n62.1\n83.7\n66.8\n\n14.1\n8.3\n11.1\n\n(7.9, 20.3)\n(3.9, 12.7)\n(5.1, 17.1)\n\nNo significant nausea (maximum VAS < 25 mm on a scale of 0-100 mm)\nOverall (0-120 hours)\n0-24 hours\n25-120 hours\n\n73.6\n\n90.9\n74.9\n\n66.4\n\n86.3\n69.5\n\n7.2\n4.6\n5.4\n\n(1.0, 13.4)\n(0.2, 9.0)\n(-0.7, 11.5)\n\n*The confidence intervals were calculated with no adjustment for gender and region, which were included in the \nprimary analysis using logistic models.\n\nThe benefit of aprepitant combination therapy in the full study population was mainly driven by the \nresults observed in patients with poor control with the standard regimen such as in women, even \nthough the results were numerically better regardless of age, tumour type or gender. Complete \nresponse to the aprepitant regimen and standard therapy, respectively, was reached in 209/324 (65 %) \nand 161/320 (50 %) in women and 83/101 (82 %) and 68/87 (78 %) of men.\n\n1-day regimen of fosaprepitant 150 mg in adults\n\nIn a randomised, parallel, double-blind, active-controlled study, fosaprepitant 150 mg (N=1,147) was \ncompared with a 3-day aprepitant regimen (N=1,175) in adult patients receiving a HEC regimen that \nincluded cisplatin (≥ 70 mg/m2). The fosaprepitant regimen consisted of fosaprepitant 150 mg on \nDay 1 in combination with intravenous ondansetron 32 mg on Day 1 and dexamethasone 12 mg on \nDay 1, 8 mg on Day 2, and 8 mg twice daily on Days 3 and 4. The aprepitant regimen consisted of \naprepitant 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3 in combination with intravenous \nondansetron 32 mg on Day 1 and dexamethasone 12 mg on Day 1 and 8 mg daily on Days 2 \nthrough 4. Fosaprepitant placebo, aprepitant placebo, and dexamethasone placebo (in the evenings on \nDays 3 and 4) were used to maintain blinding (see section 4.2). Although a 32 mg intravenous dose of \nondansetron was used in clinical trials, this is no longer the recommended dose. See the product \ninformation for the selected 5-HT3 antagonist for appropriate dosing information.\n\nEfficacy was based on evaluation of the following composite measures: complete response in both the \noverall and delayed phases and no vomiting in the overall phase. Fosaprepitant 150 mg was shown to \nbe non-inferior to that of the 3-day regimen of aprepitant.

Both clearance and absolute bioavailability decrease \nwith increasing dose.\n\nAbsorption\nThe AUC0-∞ of aprepitant following oral administration of 165 mg was equivalent to the AUC0-∞ of \n150 mg fosaprepitant administered intravenously, while the Cmax was 2.4-fold lower.\n\nFollowing a single oral dose of aprepitant 165 mg to healthy volunteers, the mean AUC0-∞ of \naprepitant was 32.5 µghr/mL and the mean maximal aprepitant concentration was 1.67 µg/mL.\n\nThe mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of aprepitant occurred at approximately 4 hours (Tmax). \nOral administration of the capsule with a standard light breakfast and a high-fat breakfast resulted in \nan up to an 8 % and a 47 % increase in AUC0-∞ of aprepitant, respectively. This increase is not \nconsidered clinically relevant.\n\nDistribution\nAprepitant is highly protein bound, with a mean of 97 %. The geometric mean apparent volume of \ndistribution at steady state (Vdss) is approximately 66 L in humans.\n\nBiotransformation\nAprepitant undergoes extensive metabolism. In healthy young adults, aprepitant accounts for \napproximately 19 % of the radioactivity in plasma over 72 hours following a single intravenous \nadministration 100 mg dose of [14C]-fosaprepitant, a prodrug for aprepitant, indicating a substantial \npresence of metabolites in the plasma. Twelve metabolites of aprepitant have been identified in human \nplasma. The metabolism of aprepitant occurs largely via oxidation at the morpholine ring and its side \nchains and the resultant metabolites were only weakly active. In vitro studies using human liver \nmicrosomes indicate that aprepitant is metabolised primarily by CYP3A4 and potentially with minor \ncontribution by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19.\n\n \n\n\n\n24\n\nElimination\nAprepitant is not excreted unchanged in urine. Metabolites are excreted in urine and via biliary \nexcretion in faeces. Following a single intravenously administered 100 mg dose of [14C]-fosaprepitant, \na prodrug for aprepitant, to healthy subjects, 57 % of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and \n45 % in faeces.\n\nThe plasma clearance of aprepitant is dose-dependent, decreasing with increased dose and ranged from \napproximately 60 to 72 mL/min in the therapeutic dose range. The terminal half-life ranged from \napproximately 9 to 13 hours.\n\nPharmacokinetics in special populations\nElderly: Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of aprepitant on Day 1 and 80 mg once \ndaily on Days 2 through 5, the AUC0-24hr of aprepitant was 21 % higher on Day 1 and 36 % higher on \nDay 5 in elderly ( 65 years) relative to younger adults. The Cmax was 10 % higher on Day 1 and 24 % \nhigher on Day 5 in elderly relative to younger adults. These differences are not considered clinically \nmeaningful. No dose adjustment for EMEND is necessary in elderly patients.\n\nGender: Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of aprepitant, the Cmax for aprepitant is \n16 % higher in females as compared with males. The half-life of aprepitant is 25 % lower in females \nas compared with males and its tmax occurs at approximately the same time. These differences are not \nconsidered clinically meaningful. No dose adjustment for EMEND is necessary based on gender.\n\nHepatic impairment: Mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) does not affect the \npharmacokinetics of aprepitant to a clinically relevant extent. No dose adjustment is necessary for \npatients with mild hepatic impairment. Conclusions regarding the influence of moderate hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh class B) on aprepitant pharmacokinetics cannot be drawn from available data. \nThere are no clinical or pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nclass C).\n\nRenal impairment: A single 240 mg dose of aprepitant was administered to patients with severe renal \nimpairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) and to patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring \nhaemodialysis.\n\nIn patients with severe renal impairment, the AUC0- of total aprepitant (unbound and protein bound) \ndecreased by 21 % and Cmax decreased by 32 %, relative to healthy subjects. In patients with ESRD \nundergoing haemodialysis, the AUC0- of total aprepitant decreased by 42 % and Cmax decreased by \n32 %. Due to modest decreases in protein binding of aprepitant in patients with renal disease, the AUC \nof pharmacologically active unbound aprepitant was not significantly affected in patients with renal \nimpairment compared with healthy subjects. Haemodialysis conducted 4 or 48 hours after dosing had \nno significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant; less than 0.2 % of the dose was recovered \nin the dialysate.\n\nNo dose adjustment for EMEND is necessary for patients with renal impairment or for patients with \nESRD undergoing haemodialysis.\n\nRelationship between concentration and effect\nUsing a highly specific NK1-receptor tracer, positron emission tomography (PET) studies in healthy \nyoung men have shown that aprepitant penetrates into the brain and occupies NK1 receptors in a dose-\nand plasma-concentration-dependent manner. Aprepitant plasma concentrations achieved with the \n3-day regimen of EMEND are predicted to provide greater than 95 % occupancy of brain NK1\nreceptors.\n\nA PET study in healthy young men administered a single oral dose of 165 mg aprepitant or a single \nintravenous dose of 150 mg fosaprepitant demonstrated similar brain NK1 receptor occupancy at Tmax,\n(≥ 99 %), 24 hours (≥ 99 %), 48 hours (≥ 97 %), and 120 hours (37 to 76 %) following dosing. \nOccupancy of brain NK1 receptors by aprepitant correlate well with aprepitant plasma concentrations.\n\n \n\n\n\n25\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nPre-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and \nrepeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction and development. \nHowever, it should be noted that systemic exposure in rodents was similar or even lower than \ntherapeutic exposure in humans at the 125 mg/80 mg and 165 mg doses. In particular, although no \nadverse effects were noted in reproduction studies at human exposure levels, the animal exposures are \nnot sufficient to make an adequate risk assessment in man.\n\nIn a juvenile toxicity study in rats treated from post natal day 10 to day 63 aprepitant led to an earlier \nvaginal opening in females from 250 mg/kg b.i.d. and to a delayed preputial separation in males, from \n10 mg/kg b.i.d. There were no margins to clinically relevant exposure. There were no \ntreatment-related effects on mating, fertility or embryonic/foetal survival, and no pathological changes \nin the reproductive organs. In a juvenile toxicity study in dogs treated from post natal day 14 to \nday 42, a decreased testicular weight and Leydig cell size were seen in the males at 6 mg/kg/day and \nincreased uterine weight, hypertrophy of the uterus and cervix, and oedema of vaginal tissues were \nseen in females from 4 mg/kg/day. There were no margins to clinically relevant exposure of \naprepitant. For short term treatment according to recommended dose regimen these findings are \nconsidered unlikely to be clinically relevant.\n\n6.

See the \n\nproduct information for \nthe selected 5-HT3\n\nantagonist for \nappropriate dosing \n\ninformation\n\nnone none\n\nDexamethasone should be administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy treatment on Day 1. The \ndose of dexamethasone accounts for active substance interactions.\n\nPaediatric population\nAdolescents (aged 12 through 17 years)\nEMEND is given for 3 days as part of a regimen that includes a 5-HT3 antagonist. The recommended \ndose of capsules of EMEND is 125 mg orally on Day 1 and 80 mg orally on Days 2 and 3. EMEND is \nadministered orally 1 hour prior to chemotherapy on Days 1, 2 and 3. If no chemotherapy is given on \nDays 2 and 3, EMEND should be administered in the morning. See the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics (SmPC) for the selected 5-HT3 antagonist for appropriate dosing information. If a \ncorticosteroid, such as dexamethasone, is co-administered with EMEND, the dose of the corticosteroid \nshould be administered at 50 % of the usual dose (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).\n\nThe safety and efficacy of the 80 mg and 125 mg capsules have not been demonstrated in children less \nthan 12 years of age. No data are available. Refer to the powder for oral suspension SmPC for \nappropriate dosing in infants, toddlers and children aged 6 months to less than 12 years.\n\nGeneral\nEfficacy data in combination with other corticosteroids and 5-HT3 antagonists are limited. For \nadditional information on the co-administration with corticosteroids, see section 4.5. Please refer to the \nSmPC of co-administered 5-HT3 antagonist medicinal products.\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly (≥ 65 years)\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for the elderly (see section 5.2).\n\nGender\nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on gender (see section 5.2).\n\n \n\n\n\n29\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment or for patients with end stage renal \ndisease undergoing haemodialysis (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. There are limited data in \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment and no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nAprepitant should be used with caution in these patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nMethod of administration\nThe hard capsule should be swallowed whole.\nEMEND may be taken with or without food.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nCo-administration with pimozide, terfenadine, astemizole or cisapride (see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPatients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment\nThere are limited data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and no data in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment. EMEND should be used with caution in these patients (see section 5.2).\n\nCYP3A4 interactions\nEMEND should be used with caution in patients receiving concomitant orally administered active \nsubstances that are metabolised primarily through CYP3A4 and with a narrow therapeutic range, such \nas cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, alfentanil, ergot alkaloid derivatives, fentanyl, and \nquinidine (see section 4.5). Additionally, concomitant administration with irinotecan should be \napproached with particular caution as the combination might result in increased toxicity.\n\nCo-administration with warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate)\nIn patients on chronic warfarin therapy, the International Normalised Ratio (INR) should be monitored \nclosely during treatment with EMEND and for 14 days following each 3-day course of EMEND (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nCo-administration with hormonal contraceptives\nThe efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days after administration \nof EMEND. Alternative non-hormonal back-up methods of contraception should be used during \ntreatment with EMEND and for 2 months following the last dose of EMEND (see section 4.5).\n\nExcipients\nEMEND capsules contain sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, \nglucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrose-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nAprepitant (125 mg/80 mg) is a substrate, a moderate inhibitor, and an inducer of CYP3A4. Aprepitant \nis also an inducer of CYP2C9. During treatment with EMEND, CYP3A4 is inhibited. After the end of \ntreatment, EMEND causes a transient mild induction of CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and glucuronidation. \nAprepitant does not seem to interact with the P-glycoprotein transporter, as suggested by the lack of \ninteraction of aprepitant with digoxin.\n\n \n\n\n\n30\n\nEffect aprepitant on the pharmacokinetics of other active substances\nCYP3A4 inhibition\nAs a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, aprepitant (125 mg/80 mg) can increase plasma concentrations of \nco-administered active substances that are metabolised through CYP3A4. The total exposure of orally \nadministered CYP3A4 substrates may increase up to approximately 3-fold during the 3-day treatment \nwith EMEND; the effect of aprepitant on the plasma concentrations of intravenously administered \nCYP3A4 substrates is expected to be smaller. EMEND must not be used concurrently with pimozide, \nterfenadine, astemizole, or cisapride (see section 4.3). Inhibition of CYP3A4 by aprepitant could result \nin elevated plasma concentrations of these active substances, potentially causing serious or \nlife-threatening reactions. Caution is advised during concomitant administration of EMEND and orally \nadministered active substances that are metabolised primarily through CYP3A4 and with a narrow \ntherapeutic range, such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, alfentanil, diergotamine, \nergotamine, fentanyl, and quinidine (see section 4.4).\n\nCorticosteroids\nDexamethasone: The usual oral dexamethasone dose should be reduced by approximately 50 % when \nco-administered with EMEND 125 mg/80 mg regimen. The dose of dexamethasone in chemotherapy \ninduced nausea and vomiting clinical trials was chosen to account for active substance interactions \n(see section 4.2). EMEND, when given as a regimen of 125 mg with dexamethasone co-administered \norally as 20 mg on Day 1, and EMEND when given as 80 mg/day with dexamethasone \nco-administered orally as 8 mg on Days 2 through 5, increased the AUC of dexamethasone, a \nCYP3A4 substrate, 2.2-fold on Days 1 and 5.\n\nMethylprednisolone: The usual intravenously administered methylprednisolone dose should be \nreduced approximately 25 %, and the usual oral methylprednisolone dose should be reduced \napproximately 50 % when co-administered with EMEND 125 mg/80 mg regimen. EMEND, when \ngiven as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, increased the AUC of \nmethylprednisolone, a CYP3A4 substrate, by 1.3-fold on Day 1 and by 2.5-fold on Day 3, when \nmethylprednisolone was co-administered intravenously as 125 mg on Day 1 and orally as 40 mg on \nDays 2 and 3.\n\nDuring continuous treatment with methylprednisolone, the AUC of methylprednisolone may decrease \nat later time points within 2 weeks following initiation of the EMEND dose, due to the inducing effect \nof aprepitant on CYP3A4. This effect may be expected to be more pronounced for orally administered \nmethylprednisolone.\n\nChemotherapeutic medicinal products\nIn pharmacokinetic studies, EMEND, when given as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on \nDays 2 and 3, did not influence the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered intravenously on \nDay 1 or vinorelbine administered intravenously on Day 1 or Day 8. Because the effect of EMEND on \nthe pharmacokinetics of orally administered CYP3A4 substrates is greater than the effect of EMEND \non the pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered CYP3A4 substrates, an interaction with orally \nadministered chemotherapeutic medicinal products metabolised primarily or partly by CYP3A4 (e.g.,\netoposide, vinorelbine) cannot be excluded. Caution is advised and additional monitoring may be \nappropriate in patients receiving medicinal products metabolized primarily or partly by CYP3A4 (see \nsection 4.4). Post-marketing events of neurotoxicity, a potential adverse reaction of ifosfamide, have \nbeen reported after aprepitant and ifosfamide co-administration.\n\nImmunosuppressants\nDuring the 3-day CINV regimen, a transient moderate increase followed by a mild decrease in \nexposure of immunosuppressants metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, everolimus \nand sirolimus) is expected. Given the short duration of the 3-day regimen and the time-dependent \nlimited changes in exposure, dose reduction of the immunosuppressant is not recommended during the \n3 days of co-administration with EMEND.\n\n \n\n\n\n31\n\nMidazolam\nThe potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of midazolam or other benzodiazepines \nmetabolised via CYP3A4 (alprazolam, triazolam) should be considered when co-administering these \nmedicinal products with EMEND (125 mg/80 mg).\n\nEMEND increased the AUC of midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, 2.3-fold on Day 1 and \n3.3-fold on Day 5, when a single oral dose of 2 mg midazolam was co-administered on Days 1 and 5 \nof a regimen of EMEND 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 to 5.\n\nIn another study with intravenous administration of midazolam, EMEND was given as 125 mg on \nDay 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, and 2 mg midazolam was given intravenously prior to the \nadministration of the 3-day regimen of EMEND and on Days 4, 8, and 15. EMEND increased the \nAUC of midazolam 25 % on Day 4 and decreased the AUC of midazolam 19 % on Day 8 and 4 % on \nDay 15. These effects were not considered clinically important. \n\nIn a third study with intravenous and oral administration of midazolam, EMEND was given as 125 mg \non Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, together with ondansetron 32 mg Day 1, dexamethasone \n12 mg Day 1 and 8 mg Days 2-4. This combination (i.e. EMEND, ondansetron and dexamethasone)\ndecreased the AUC of oral midazolam 16 % on Day 6, 9 % on Day 8, 7 % on Day 15 and 17 % on \nDay 22. These effects were not considered clinically important.\n\nAn additional study was completed with intravenous administration of midazolam and EMEND. \nIntravenous 2 mg midazolam was given 1 hour after oral administration of a single dose of EMEND \n125 mg. The plasma AUC of midazolam was increased by 1.5-fold. This effect was not considered \nclinically important.\n\nInduction\nAs a mild inducer of CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and glucuronidation, aprepitant can decrease plasma \nconcentrations of substrates eliminated by these routes within two weeks following initiation and \ntreatment. This effect may become apparent only after the end of a 3-day treatment with EMEND. For \nCYP2C9 and CYP3A4 substrates, the induction is transient with a maximum effect reached 3-5 days \nafter end of the EMEND 3-day treatment. The effect is maintained for a few days, thereafter slowly \ndeclines and is clinically insignificant by two weeks after end of EMEND treatment. Mild induction of \nglucuronidation is also seen with 80 mg oral aprepitant given for 7 days. Data are lacking regarding \neffects on CYP2C8 and CYP2C19. Caution is advised when warfarin, acenocoumarol, tolbutamide, \nphenytoin or other active substances that are known to be metabolised by CYP2C9 are administered \nduring this time period.\n\nWarfarin\nIn patients on chronic warfarin therapy, the prothrombin time (INR) should be monitored closely \nduring treatment with EMEND and for 2 weeks following each 3-day course of EMEND for \nchemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (see section 4.4). When a single 125 mg dose of EMEND \nwas administered on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3 to healthy subjects who were stabilised on \nchronic warfarin therapy, there was no effect of EMEND on the plasma AUC of R(+) or S(-) warfarin \ndetermined on Day 3; however, there was a 34 % decrease in S(-) warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) \ntrough concentration accompanied by a 14 % decrease in INR 5 days after completion of treatment \nwith EMEND. \n\nTolbutamide\nEMEND, when given as 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, decreased the AUC of \ntolbutamide (a CYP2C9 substrate) by 23 % on Day 4, 28 % on Day 8, and 15 % on Day 15, when a \nsingle dose of tolbutamide 500 mg was administered orally prior to the administration of the 3-day \nregimen of EMEND and on Days 4, 8, and 15.\n\n \n\n\n\n32\n\nHormonal contraceptives\nThe efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days after administration \nof EMEND. Alternative non-hormonal back-up methods of contraception should be used during \ntreatment with EMEND and for 2 months following the last dose of EMEND.\n\nIn a clinical study, single doses of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone \nwere administered on Days 1 through 21 with EMEND, given as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 8 and \n80 mg/day on Days 9 and 10 with ondansetron 32 mg intravenously on Day 8 and oral dexamethasone \ngiven as 12 mg on Day 8 and 8 mg/day on Days 9, 10, and 11. During days 9 through 21 in this study, \nthere was as much as a 64 % decrease in ethinyl estradiol trough concentrations and as much as a 60 % \ndecrease in norethindrone trough concentrations. \n\n5-HT3 antagonists\nIn clinical interaction studies, aprepitant did not have clinically important effects on the \npharmacokinetics of ondansetron, granisetron, or hydrodolasetron (the active metabolite of \ndolasetron).\n\nEffect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant\nConcomitant administration of EMEND with active substances that inhibit CYP3A4 activity (e.g., \nketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone,\nand protease inhibitors) should be approached cautiously, as the combination is expected to result \nseveral-fold in increased plasma concentrations of aprepitant (see section 4.4). \n\nConcomitant administration of EMEND with active substances that strongly induce CYP3A4 activity \n(e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) should be avoided as the combination \nresults in reductions of the plasma concentrations of aprepitant that may result in decreased efficacy of \nEMEND. Concomitant administration of EMEND with herbal preparations containing St. John’s Wort \n(Hypericum perforatum) is not recommended.\n\nKetoconazole\nWhen a single 125 mg dose of aprepitant was administered on Day 5 of a 10-day regimen of \n400 mg/day of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the AUC of aprepitant increased \napproximately 5-fold and the mean terminal half-life of aprepitant increased approximately 3-fold.\n\nRifampicin\nWhen a single 375 mg dose of aprepitant was administered on Day 9 of a 14-day regimen of \n600 mg/day of rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, the AUC of aprepitant decreased 91 % and the \nmean terminal half-life decreased 68 %.\n\nPaediatric population\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nContraception in males and females\nThe efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days after administration \nof EMEND. Alternative non-hormonal back-up methods of contraception should be used during \ntreatment with EMEND and for 2 months following the last dose of EMEND (see sections 4.4 and \n4.5).\n\nPregnancy\nFor aprepitant no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. The potential for reproductive \ntoxicity of aprepitant has not been fully characterised, since exposure levels above the therapeutic \nexposure in humans at the 125 mg/80 mg dose could not be attained in animal studies. These studies \ndid not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). The potential effects on \n\n \n\n\n\n33\n\nreproduction of alterations in neurokinin regulation are unknown. EMEND should not be used during \npregnancy unless clearly necessary.\n\nBreast-feeding\nAprepitant is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether aprepitant is excreted in \nhuman milk; therefore, breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with EMEND.\n\nFertility\nThe potential for effects of aprepitant on fertility has not been fully characterised because exposure \nlevels above the therapeutic exposure in humans could not be attained in animal studies. These fertility \nstudies did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to mating performance, fertility, \nembryonic/foetal development, or sperm count and motility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nEMEND may have minor influence on the ability to drive, cycle and use machines. Dizziness and \nfatigue may occur following administration of EMEND (see section 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe safety profile of aprepitant was evaluated in approximately 6,500 adults in more than 50 studies \nand 184 children and adolescents in 2 pivotal paediatric clinical trials.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions reported at a greater incidence in adults treated with the \naprepitant regimen than with standard therapy in patients receiving Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy \n(HEC) were: hiccups (4.6 % versus 2.9 %), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (2.8 % versus \n1.1 %), dyspepsia (2.6 % versus 2.0 %), constipation (2.4 % versus 2.0 %), headache (2.0 % versus \n1.8 %), and decreased appetite (2.0 % versus 0.5 %). The most common adverse reaction reported at a \ngreater incidence in patients treated with the aprepitant regimen than with standard therapy in patients \nreceiving Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy (MEC) was fatigue (1.4 % versus 0.9 %).\n\nThe most common adverse reactions reported at a greater incidence in paediatric patients treated with \nthe aprepitant regimen than with the control regimen while receiving emetogenic cancer chemotherapy \nwere hiccups (3.3 % versus 0.0 %) and flushing (1.1 % versus 0.0 %).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe following adverse reactions were observed in a pooled analysis of the HEC and MEC studies at a \ngreater incidence with aprepitant than with standard therapy in adults or paediatric patients or in \npostmarketing use. The frequency categories given in the table are based on the studies in adults; the \nobserved frequencies in the paediatric studies were similar or lower, unless shown in the table. Some \nless common ADRs in the adult population were not observed in the paediatric studies.\n\nFrequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot \nbe estimated from the available data).\n\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction Frequency\nInfection and infestations candidiasis, staphylococcal infection rare\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders\n\nfebrile neutropenia, anaemia uncommon\n\nImmune system disorders hypersensitivity reactions including \nanaphylactic reactions\n\nnot known\n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders\n\ndecreased appetite common\n\npolydipsia rare\n\n \n\n\n\n34\n\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction Frequency\nPsychiatric disorders anxiety uncommon\n\ndisorientation, euphoric mood rare\n\nNervous system disorders headache common\n\ndizziness, somnolence uncommon\n\ncognitive disorder, lethargy, dysgeusia rare\n\nEye disorders conjunctivitis rare\nEar and labyrinth disorders tinnitus rare\nCardiac disorders palpitations uncommon\n\nbradycardia, cardiovascular disorder rare\n\nVascular disorders hot flush/flushing uncommon\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\n\nhiccups common\n\noropharyngeal pain, sneezing, cough, \npostnasal drip, throat irritation\n\nrare\n\nGastrointestinal disorders constipation, dyspepsia common\n\neructation, nausea†, vomiting†, \ngastroesophageal reflux disease, abdominal \npain, dry mouth, flatulence\n\nuncommon\n\nduodenal ulcer perforation, stomatitis, \nabdominal distension, faeces hard, neutropenic \ncolitis\n\nrare\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nrash, acne uncommon\n\nphotosensitivity reaction, hyperhidrosis, \nseborrhoea, skin lesion, rash pruritic, \nStevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis\n\nrare\n\npruritus, urticaria not known\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders\n\nmuscular weakness, muscle spasms rare\n\nRenal and urinary disorders dysuria uncommon\n\npollakiuria rare\n\n \n\n\n\n35\n\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction Frequency\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nfatigue common\n\nasthenia, malaise uncommon\n\noedema, chest discomfort, gait disturbance rare\n\nInvestigations ALT increased common\n\nAST increased, blood alkaline phosphatase \nincreased\n\nuncommon\n\nred blood cells urine positive, blood sodium \ndecreased, weight decreased, neutrophil count \ndecreased, glucose urine present, urine output \nincreased\n\nrare\n\n†Nausea and vomiting were efficacy parameters in the first 5 days of post-chemotherapy treatment and were \nreported as adverse reactions only thereafter.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nThe adverse reactions profiles in adults in the Multiple-Cycle extension of HEC and MEC studies for \nup to 6 additional cycles of chemotherapy were generally similar to those observed in Cycle 1.\n\nIn an additional active-controlled clinical study in 1,169 adult patients receiving aprepitant and HEC,\nthe adverse reactions profile was generally similar to that seen in the other HEC studies with \naprepitant.\n\nAdditional adverse reactions were observed in adult patients treated with aprepitant for postoperative \nnausea and vomiting (PONV) and a greater incidence than with ondansetron: abdominal pain upper, \nbowel sounds abnormal, constipation*, dysarthria, dyspnoea, hypoaesthesia, insomnia, miosis, nausea, \nsensory disturbance, stomach discomfort, sub-ileus*, visual acuity reduced, wheezing.\n*Reported in patients taking a higher dose of aprepitant.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nIn the event of overdose, EMEND should be discontinued and general supportive treatment and \nmonitoring should be provided. Because of the antiemetic activity of aprepitant, emesis induced by a \nmedicinal product may not be effective.\n\nAprepitant cannot be removed by haemodialysis.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiemetics and antinauseants, ATC code: A04AD12\n\nAprepitant is a selective high-affinity antagonist at human substance P neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n36\n\n3-day regimen of aprepitant in adults\nIn 2 randomised, double-blind studies encompassing a total of 1,094 adult patients receiving \nchemotherapy that included cisplatin  70 mg/m2, aprepitant in combination with an \nondansetron/dexamethasone regimen (see section 4.2) was compared with a standard regimen (placebo \nplus ondansetron 32 mg intravenously administered on Day 1 plus dexamethasone 20 mg orally on \nDay 1 and 8 mg orally twice daily on Days 2 to 4). Although a 32 mg intravenous dose of ondansetron \nwas used in clinical trials, this is no longer the recommended dose.

The efficacy of the aprepitant regimen was apparently \nmaintained during all cycles.\n\nIn a second multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, clinical study, the aprepitant \nregimen was compared with standard therapy in 848 adult patients (652 females, 196 males) receiving \na chemotherapy regimen that included any intravenous dose of oxaliplatin, carboplatin, epirubicin, \nidarubicin, ifosfamide, irinotecan, daunorubicin, doxorubicin; cyclophosphamide intravenously \n(< 1,500 mg/m2); or cytarabine intravenously (> 1 g/m2). Patients receiving the aprepitant regimen \nwere receiving chemotherapy for a variety of tumour types including 52 % with breast cancer, 21 % \nwith gastrointestinal cancers including colorectal cancer, 13 % with lung cancer and 6 % with \ngynaecological cancers. The aprepitant regimen in combination with an ondansetron/dexamethasone \nregimen (see section 4.2) was compared with standard therapy (placebo in combination with \nondansetron 8 mg orally (twice on Day 1, and every 12 hours on Days 2 and 3) plus dexamethasone \n20 mg orally on Day 1).\n\nEfficacy was based on the evaluation of the following primary and key secondary endpoints: No \nvomiting in the overall period (0 to 120 hours post-chemotherapy), evaluation of safety and \ntolerability of the aprepitant regimen for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), and \ncomplete response (defined as no vomiting and no use of rescue therapy) in the overall period (0 to \n120 hours post-chemotherapy). Additionally, no significant nausea in the overall period (0 to \n120 hours post-chemotherapy) was evaluated as an exploratory endpoint, and in the acute and delayed \nphases as a post-hoc analysis.\n\nA summary of the key study results is shown in Table 3.\n\n \n\n\n\n39\n\nTable 3\nPercent of adult patients responding by treatment group and phase for Study 2 – Cycle 1\n\nModerately Emetogenic Chemotherapy\n\nAprepitant \nregimen\n(N= 425)\n\n%\n\nStandard \ntherapy\n\n(N= 406)\n%\n\nDifferences*\n\n        %             (95 % CI)\n\nComplete response (no emesis and no rescue therapy)\nOverall (0-120 hours)\n0-24 hours\n25-120 hours\n\n68.7\n\n89.2\n70.8\n\n56.3\n\n80.3\n60.9\n\n12.4\n8.9\n9.9\n\n(5.9, 18.9)\n(4.0, 13.8)\n(3.5, 16.3)\n\nNo emesis (no emetic episodes regardless of use of rescue therapy)\nOverall (0-120 hours)\n0-24 hours\n25-120 hours\n\n76.2\n92.0\n77.9\n\n62.1\n83.7\n66.8\n\n14.1\n8.3\n11.1\n\n(7.9, 20.3)\n(3.9, 12.7)\n(5.1, 17.1)\n\nNo significant nausea (maximum VAS < 25 mm on a scale of 0-100 mm)\nOverall (0-120 hours)\n0-24 hours\n25-120 hours\n\n73.6\n\n90.9\n74.9\n\n66.4\n\n86.3\n69.5\n\n7.2\n4.6\n5.4\n\n(1.0, 13.4)\n(0.2, 9.0)\n(-0.7, 11.5)\n\n*The confidence intervals were calculated with no adjustment for gender and region, which were included in the \nprimary analysis using logistic models.\n\nThe benefit of aprepitant combination therapy in the full study population was mainly driven by the \nresults observed in patients with poor control with the standard regimen such as in women, even \nthough the results were numerically better regardless of age, tumour type or gender. Complete \nresponse to the aprepitant regimen and standard therapy, respectively, was reached in 209/324 (65 %) \nand 161/320 (50 %) in women and 83/101 (82 %) and 68/87 (78 %) of men.\n\nPaediatric population\nIn a randomised, double-blind, active comparator-controlled clinical study that included 302 children \nand adolescents (aged 6 months to 17 years) receiving moderately or highly emetogenic \nchemotherapy, the aprepitant regimen was compared to a control regimen for the prevention of CINV. \nThe efficacy of the aprepitant regimen was evaluated in a single cycle (Cycle 1). Patients had the \nopportunity to receive open-label aprepitant in subsequent cycles (Optional Cycles 2-6); however \nefficacy was not assessed in these optional cycles. The aprepitant regimen for adolescents aged \n12 through 17 years (n=47) consisted of EMEND capsules 125 mg orally on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on \nDays 2 and 3 in combination with ondansetron on Day 1. The aprepitant regimen for children aged \n6 months to less than 12 years (n=105) consisted of EMEND powder for oral suspension 3.0 mg/kg \n(up to 125 mg) orally on Day 1 and 2.0 mg/kg (up to 80 mg) orally on Days 2 and 3 in combination \nwith ondansetron on Day 1. The control regimen in adolescents aged 12 through 17 years (n=48) and \nchildren aged 6 months to less than 12 years (n=102) consisted of placebo for aprepitant on Days 1, 2 \nand 3 in combination with ondansetron on Day 1. EMEND or placebo and ondansetron were \nadministered 1 hour and 30 minutes prior to initiation of chemotherapy, respectively. Intravenous \ndexamethasone was permitted as part of the antiemetic regimen for paediatric patients in both age \ngroups, at the discretion of the physician. A dose reduction (50 %) of dexamethasone was required for \npaediatric patients receiving aprepitant. No dose reduction was required for paediatric patients \nreceiving the control regimen. Of the paediatric patients, 29 % in the aprepitant regimen and 28 % in \nthe control regimen used dexamethasone as part of the regimen in Cycle 1.\n\nThe antiemetic activity of EMEND was evaluated over a 5-day (120 hour) period following the \ninitiation of chemotherapy on Day 1. The primary endpoint was complete response in the delayed \nphase (25 to 120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy) in Cycle 1. A summary of the key study \nresults are shown in Table 4.\n\n \n\n\n\n40\n\nTable 4\nNumber (%) of paediatric patients with complete response and no vomiting by treatment group and \n\nphase – Cycle 1 (Intent to treat population)\n\nAprepitant regimen\nn/m (%)\n\nControl regimen\nn/m (%)\n\nPRIMARY ENDPOINT\nComplete response* – Delayed phase 77/152 (50.7)† 39/150 (26.0)\nOTHER PRESPECIFIED ENDPOINTS\nComplete response* – Acute phase 101/152 (66.4)‡ 78/150 (52.0)\nComplete response* – Overall phase 61/152 (40.1)† 30/150 (20.0)\nNo vomiting§ – Overall phase 71/152 (46.7)† 32/150 (21.3)\n*Complete response = No vomiting or retching or dry heaves and no use of rescue medication.\n†p < 0.01 when compared to control regimen\n‡p < 0.05 when compared to control regimen\n§No vomiting = No vomiting or retching or dry heaves\nn/m = Number of patients with desired response/number of patients included in time point.\nAcute phase: 0 to 24 hours following initiation of chemotherapy.\nDelayed phase: 25 to 120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy.\nOverall phase: 0 to 120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy.\n\nThe estimated time to first vomiting after initiation of chemotherapy treatment was longer with the \naprepitant regimen (estimated median time to first vomiting was 94.5 hours) compared with the \ncontrol regimen group (estimated median time to first vomiting was 26.0 hours) as depicted in the \nKaplan-Meier curves in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2\nTime to first vomiting episode from start of chemotherapy administration - paediatric patients in the \n\noverall phase-Cycle 1 (Intent to treat population)\n\nAn analysis of efficacy in subpopulations in Cycle 1 demonstrated that, regardless of age category, \ngender, use of dexamethasone for antiemetic prophylaxis, and emetogenicity of chemotherapy, the \naprepitant regimen provided better control than the control regimen with respect to the complete \nresponse endpoints.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAprepitant displays non-linear pharmacokinetics. Both clearance and absolute bioavailability decrease \nwith increasing dose.\n\n \n\n\n\n41\n\nAbsorption\nThe mean absolute oral bioavailability of aprepitant is 67 % for the 80 mg capsule and 59 % for the \n125 mg capsule. The mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of aprepitant occurred at approximately \n4 hours (tmax). Oral administration of the capsule with an approximately 800 Kcal standard breakfast \nresulted in an up to 40 % increase in AUC of aprepitant. This increase is not considered clinically \nrelevant.\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aprepitant is non-linear across the clinical dose range. In healthy young \nadults, the increase in AUC0- was 26 % greater than dose proportional between 80 mg and 125 mg \nsingle doses administered in the fed state.\n\nFollowing oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of EMEND on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on \nDays 2 and 3, the AUC0-24hr (mean±SD) was 19.6 ± 2.5 µgh/mL and 21.2 ± 6.3 µg h/mL on \nDays 1 and 3, respectively. Cmax was 1.6 ± 0.36 µg/mL and 1.4 ± 0.22 µg/mL on Days 1 and 3, \nrespectively.\n\nDistribution\nAprepitant is highly protein bound, with a mean of 97 %. The geometric mean apparent volume of \ndistribution at steady state (Vdss) is approximately 66 L in humans.\n\nBiotransformation\nAprepitant undergoes extensive metabolism. In healthy young adults, aprepitant accounts for \napproximately 19 % of the radioactivity in plasma over 72 hours following a single intravenous \nadministration 100-mg dose of [14C]-fosaprepitant, a prodrug for aprepitant, indicating a substantial \npresence of metabolites in the plasma. Twelve metabolites of aprepitant have been identified in human \nplasma. The metabolism of aprepitant occurs largely via oxidation at the morpholine ring and its side \nchains and the resultant metabolites were only weakly active. In vitro studies using human liver \nmicrosomes indicate that aprepitant is metabolised primarily by CYP3A4 and potentially with minor \ncontribution by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19.\n\nElimination\nAprepitant is not excreted unchanged in urine. Metabolites are excreted in urine and via biliary \nexcretion in faeces. Following a single intravenously administered 100 mg dose of [14C]-fosaprepitant, \na prodrug for aprepitant, to healthy subjects, 57 % of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and \n45 % in faeces.\n\nThe plasma clearance of aprepitant is dose-dependent, decreasing with increased dose and ranged from \napproximately 60 to 72 mL/min in the therapeutic dose range. The terminal half-life ranged from \napproximately 9 to 13 hours.\n\nPharmacokinetics in special populations\nElderly: Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of aprepitant on Day 1 and 80 mg once \ndaily on Days 2 through 5, the AUC0-24hr of aprepitant was 21 % higher on Day 1 and 36 % higher on \nDay 5 in elderly ( 65 years) relative to younger adults. The Cmax was 10 % higher on Day 1 and 24 % \nhigher on Day 5 in elderly relative to younger adults. These differences are not considered clinically \nmeaningful. No dose adjustment for EMEND is necessary in elderly patients.\n\nGender: Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of aprepitant, the Cmax for aprepitant is \n16 % higher in females as compared with males. The half-life of aprepitant is 25 % lower in females \nas compared with males and its tmax occurs at approximately the same time. These differences are not \nconsidered clinically meaningful. No dose adjustment for EMEND is necessary based on gender.\n\nHepatic impairment: Mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) does not affect the \npharmacokinetics of aprepitant to a clinically relevant extent. No dose adjustment is necessary for \npatients with mild hepatic impairment. Conclusions regarding the influence of moderate hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh class B) on aprepitant pharmacokinetics cannot be drawn from available data. \n\n \n\n\n\n42\n\nThere are no clinical or pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nclass C).\n\nRenal impairment: A single 240 mg dose of aprepitant was administered to patients with severe renal \nimpairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) and to patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring \nhaemodialysis.\n\nIn patients with severe renal impairment, the AUC0- of total aprepitant (unbound and protein bound) \ndecreased by 21 % and Cmax decreased by 32 %, relative to healthy subjects. In patients with ESRD \nundergoing haemodialysis, the AUC0- of total aprepitant decreased by 42 % and Cmax decreased by \n32 %. Due to modest decreases in protein binding of aprepitant in patients with renal disease, the AUC \nof pharmacologically active unbound aprepitant was not significantly affected in patients with renal \nimpairment compared with healthy subjects. Haemodialysis conducted 4 or 48 hours after dosing had \nno significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant; less than 0.2 % of the dose was recovered \nin the dialysate.\n\nNo dose adjustment for EMEND is necessary for patients with renal impairment or for patients with \nESRD undergoing haemodialysis.\n\nPaediatric population: As part of a 3-day regimen, dosing of aprepitant capsules (125/80/80-mg) in \nadolescent patients (aged 12 through 17 years) achieved an AUC0-24hr above 17 µg•hr/mL on Day 1 \nwith concentrations (Cmin) at the end of Days 2 and 3 above 0.4 µg/mL in a majority of patients. The \nmedian peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was approximately 1.3 µg/mL on Day 1, occurring at \napproximately 4 hours. As part of a 3-day regimen, dosing of aprepitant powder for oral suspension \n(3/2/2-mg/kg) in patients aged 6 months to less than12 years achieved an AUC0-24hr above \n17 µg•hr/mL on Day 1 with concentrations (Cmin) at the end of Days 2 and 3 above 0.1 µg/mL in a \nmajority of patients. The median peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was approximately 1.2 µg/mL on \nDay 1, occurring between 5 and 7 hours.\n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis of aprepitant in paediatric patients (aged 6 months through \n17 years) suggests that gender and race have no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics \nof aprepitant.\n\nRelationship between concentration and effect\nUsing a highly specific NK1-receptor tracer, positron emission tomography (PET) studies in healthy \nyoung men have shown that aprepitant penetrates into the brain and occupies NK1 receptors in a dose-\nand plasma-concentration-dependent manner. Aprepitant plasma concentrations achieved with the \n3-day regimen of EMEND in adults are predicted to provide greater than 95 % occupancy of brain \nNK1 receptors.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nPre-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and \nrepeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction and development. \nHowever, it should be noted that systemic exposure in rodents was similar or even lower than \ntherapeutic exposure in humans at the 125 mg/80 mg dose. In particular, although no adverse effects \nwere noted in reproduction studies at human exposure levels, the animal exposures are not sufficient to \nmake an adequate risk assessment in man.\n\nIn a juvenile toxicity study in rats treated from post natal day 10 to day 63 aprepitant led to an earlier \nvaginal opening in females from 250 mg/kg b.i.d. and to a delayed preputial separation in males, from \n10 mg/kg b.i.d. There were no margins to clinically relevant exposure. There were no \ntreatment-related effects on mating, fertility or embryonic/foetal survival, and no pathological changes \nin the reproductive organs. In a juvenile toxicity study in dogs treated from post natal day 14 to \nday 42, a decreased testicular weight and Leydig cell size were seen in the males at 6 mg/kg/day and \nincreased uterine weight, hypertrophy of the uterus and cervix, and oedema of vaginal tissues were \nseen in females from 4 mg/kg/day. There were no margins to clinically relevant exposure of \n\n \n\n\n\n43\n\naprepitant. For short term treatment according to recommended dose regimen these findings are \nconsidered unlikely to be clinically relevant.\n\n6.

There are limited data in \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment and no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nAprepitant should be used with caution in these patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nMethod of administration\nThe oral suspension may be taken with or without food.\nFor details on preparation and administration of the suspension, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nCo-administration with pimozide, terfenadine, astemizole or cisapride (see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPatients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment\nThere are limited data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and no data in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment. EMEND should be used with caution in these patients (see section 5.2).\n\nCYP3A4 interactions\nEMEND should be used with caution in patients receiving concomitant orally administered active \nsubstances that are metabolised primarily through CYP3A4 and with a narrow therapeutic range, such \nas cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, alfentanil, ergot alkaloid derivatives, fentanyl, and \nquinidine (see section 4.5). Additionally, concomitant administration with irinotecan should be \napproached with particular caution as the combination might result in increased toxicity.\n\nCo-administration with warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate)\nIn patients on chronic warfarin therapy, the International Normalised Ratio (INR) should be monitored \nclosely during treatment with EMEND and for 14 days following each 3-day course of EMEND (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nCo-administration with hormonal contraceptives\nThe efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days after administration \nof EMEND. Alternative non-hormonal back-up methods of contraception should be used during \ntreatment with EMEND and for 2 months following the last dose of EMEND (see section 4.5).\n\n \n\n\n\n47\n\nExcipients\nEMEND powder for oral suspension contains sucrose and lactose. Patients with rare hereditary \nproblems of fructose or galactose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption, Lapp lactase \ndeficiency, or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nAprepitant (125 mg/80 mg) is a substrate, a moderate inhibitor, and an inducer of CYP3A4. Aprepitant \nis also an inducer of CYP2C9. During treatment with EMEND, CYP3A4 is inhibited. After the end of \ntreatment, EMEND causes a transient mild induction of CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and glucuronidation. \nAprepitant does not seem to interact with the P-glycoprotein transporter, as suggested by the lack of \ninteraction of aprepitant with digoxin.\n\nEffect of aprepitant on the pharmacokinetics of other active substances\nCYP3A4 inhibition\nAs a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, aprepitant (125 mg/80 mg) can increase plasma concentrations of \nco-administered active substances that are metabolised through CYP3A4. The total exposure of orally \nadministered CYP3A4 substrates may increase up to approximately 3-fold during the 3-day treatment \nwith EMEND; the effect of aprepitant on the plasma concentrations of intravenously administered \nCYP3A4 substrates is expected to be smaller. EMEND must not be used concurrently with pimozide, \nterfenadine, astemizole, or cisapride (see section 4.3). Inhibition of CYP3A4 by aprepitant could result \nin elevated plasma concentrations of these active substances, potentially causing serious or \nlife-threatening reactions. Caution is advised during concomitant administration of EMEND and orally \nadministered active substances that are metabolised primarily through CYP3A4 and with a narrow \ntherapeutic range, such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, alfentanil, diergotamine, \nergotamine, fentanyl, and quinidine (see section 4.4).\n\nCorticosteroids\nDexamethasone: The usual oral dexamethasone dose should be reduced by approximately 50 % when \nco-administered with EMEND 125 mg/80 mg regimen. The dose of dexamethasone in chemotherapy \ninduced nausea and vomiting clinical trials was chosen to account for active substance interactions \n(see section 4.2). EMEND, when given as a regimen of 125 mg with dexamethasone co-administered \norally as 20 mg on Day 1, and EMEND when given as 80 mg/day with dexamethasone \nco-administered orally as 8 mg on Days 2 through 5, increased the AUC of dexamethasone, a \nCYP3A4 substrate, 2.2-fold on Days 1 and 5.\n\nMethylprednisolone: The usual intravenously administered methylprednisolone dose should be \nreduced approximately 25 %, and the usual oral methylprednisolone dose should be reduced \napproximately 50 % when co-administered with EMEND 125 mg/80 mg regimen. EMEND, when \ngiven as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, increased the AUC of \nmethylprednisolone, a CYP3A4 substrate, by 1.3-fold on Day 1 and by 2.5-fold on Day 3, when \nmethylprednisolone was co-administered intravenously as 125 mg on Day 1 and orally as 40 mg on \nDays 2 and 3.\n\nDuring continuous treatment with methylprednisolone, the AUC of methylprednisolone may decrease \nat later time points within 2 weeks following initiation of the EMEND dose, due to the inducing effect \nof aprepitant on CYP3A4. This effect may be expected to be more pronounced for orally administered \nmethylprednisolone.\n\nChemotherapeutic medicinal products\nIn pharmacokinetic studies, EMEND, when given as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on \nDays 2 and 3, did not influence the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered intravenously on \nDay 1 or vinorelbine administered intravenously on Day 1 or Day 8. Because the effect of EMEND on \nthe pharmacokinetics of orally administered CYP3A4 substrates is greater than the effect of EMEND\non the pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered CYP3A4 substrates, an interaction with orally \nadministered chemotherapeutic medicinal products metabolised primarily or partly by CYP3A4 (e.g.,\n\n \n\n\n\n48\n\netoposide, vinorelbine) cannot be excluded. Caution is advised and additional monitoring may be \nappropriate in patients receiving medicinal products metabolized primarily or partly by CYP3A4 (see \nsection 4.4). Post-marketing events of neurotoxicity, a potential adverse reaction of ifosfamide, have \nbeen reported after aprepitant and ifosfamide co-administration.\n\nImmunosuppressants\nDuring the 3-day CINV regimen, a transient moderate increase followed by a mild decrease in \nexposure of immunosuppressants metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, everolimus \nand sirolimus) is expected. Given the short duration of the 3-day regimen and the time-dependent \nlimited changes in exposure, dose reduction of the immunosuppressant is not recommended during the \n3 days of co-administration with EMEND.\n\nMidazolam\nThe potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of midazolam or other benzodiazepines \nmetabolised via CYP3A4 (alprazolam, triazolam) should be considered when co-administering these \nmedicinal products with EMEND (125 mg/80 mg).\n\nEMEND increased the AUC of midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, 2.3-fold on Day 1 and \n3.3-fold on Day 5, when a single oral dose of 2 mg midazolam was co-administered on Days 1 and 5 \nof a regimen of EMEND 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 to 5.\n\nIn another study with intravenous administration of midazolam, EMEND was given as 125 mg on \nDay 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, and 2 mg midazolam was given intravenously prior to the \nadministration of the 3-day regimen of EMEND and on Days 4, 8, and 15. EMEND increased the \nAUC of midazolam 25 % on Day 4 and decreased the AUC of midazolam 19 % on Day 8 and 4 % on \nDay 15. These effects were not considered clinically important. \n\nIn a third study with intravenous and oral administration of midazolam, EMEND was given as 125 mg \non Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, together with ondansetron 32 mg Day 1, dexamethasone \n12 mg Day 1 and 8 mg Days 2-4. This combination (i.e. EMEND, ondansetron and dexamethasone)\ndecreased the AUC of oral midazolam 16 % on Day 6, 9 % on Day 8, 7 % on Day 15 and 17 % on \nDay 22. These effects were not considered clinically important.\n\nAn additional study was completed with intravenous administration of midazolam and EMEND. \nIntravenous 2 mg midazolam was given 1 hour after oral administration of a single dose of EMEND \n125 mg. The plasma AUC of midazolam was increased by 1.5-fold. This effect was not considered \nclinically important.\n\nInduction\nAs a mild inducer of CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and glucuronidation, aprepitant can decrease plasma \nconcentrations of substrates eliminated by these routes within two weeks following initiation and \ntreatment. This effect may become apparent only after the end of a 3-day treatment with EMEND. For \nCYP2C9 and CYP3A4 substrates, the induction is transient with a maximum effect reached 3-5 days \nafter end of the EMEND 3-day treatment. The effect is maintained for a few days, thereafter slowly \ndeclines and is clinically insignificant by two weeks after end of EMEND treatment. Mild induction of \nglucuronidation is also seen with 80 mg oral aprepitant given for 7 days. Data are lacking regarding \neffects on CYP2C8 and CYP2C19. Caution is advised when warfarin, acenocoumarol, tolbutamide, \nphenytoin or other active substances that are known to be metabolised by CYP2C9 are administered \nduring this time period.\n\nWarfarin\nIn patients on chronic warfarin therapy, the prothrombin time (INR) should be monitored closely \nduring treatment with EMEND and for 2 weeks following each 3-day course of EMEND for \nchemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (see section 4.4). When a single 125 mg dose of EMEND \nwas administered on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3 to healthy subjects who were stabilised on \nchronic warfarin therapy, there was no effect of EMEND on the plasma AUC of R(+) or S(-) warfarin \ndetermined on Day 3; however, there was a 34 % decrease in S(-) warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) \n\n \n\n\n\n49\n\ntrough concentration accompanied by a 14 % decrease in INR 5 days after completion of treatment \nwith EMEND. \n\nTolbutamide\nEMEND, when given as 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, decreased the AUC of \ntolbutamide (a CYP2C9 substrate) by 23 % on Day 4, 28 % on Day 8, and 15 % on Day 15, when a \nsingle dose of tolbutamide 500 mg was administered orally prior to the administration of the 3-day \nregimen of EMEND and on Days 4, 8, and 15.\n\nHormonal contraceptives\nThe efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days after administration \nof EMEND. Alternative non-hormonal back-up methods of contraception should be used during \ntreatment with EMEND and for 2 months following the last dose of EMEND. \n\nIn a clinical study, single doses of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone \nwere administered on Days 1 through 21 with EMEND, given as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 8 and \n80 mg/day on Days 9 and 10 with ondansetron 32 mg intravenously on Day 8 and oral dexamethasone \ngiven as 12 mg on Day 8 and 8 mg/day on Days 9, 10, and 11. During days 9 through 21 in this study, \nthere was as much as a 64 % decrease in ethinyl estradiol trough concentrations and as much as a 60 % \ndecrease in norethindrone trough concentrations. \n\n5-HT3 antagonists\nIn clinical interaction studies, aprepitant did not have clinically important effects on the \npharmacokinetics of ondansetron, granisetron, or hydrodolasetron (the active metabolite of \ndolasetron).\n\nEffect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant\nConcomitant administration of EMEND with active substances that inhibit CYP3A4 activity (e.g., \nketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone, \nand protease inhibitors) should be approached cautiously, as the combination is expected to result \nseveral-fold in increased plasma concentrations of aprepitant (see section 4.4). \n\nConcomitant administration of EMEND with active substances that strongly induce CYP3A4 activity \n(e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) should be avoided as the combination \nresults in reductions of the plasma concentrations of aprepitant that may result in decreased efficacy of \nEMEND. Concomitant administration of EMEND with herbal preparations containing St. John’s Wort \n(Hypericum perforatum) is not recommended.\n\nKetoconazole\nWhen a single 125 mg dose of aprepitant was administered on Day 5 of a 10-day regimen of \n400 mg/day of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the AUC of aprepitant increased \napproximately 5-fold and the mean terminal half-life of aprepitant increased approximately 3-fold.\n\nRifampicin\nWhen a single 375 mg dose of aprepitant was administered on Day 9 of a 14-day regimen of \n600 mg/day of rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, the AUC of aprepitant decreased 91 % and the \nmean terminal half-life decreased 68 %. \n\nPaediatric population\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nContraception in males and females\nThe efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days after administration \nof EMEND. Alternative non-hormonal back-up methods of contraception should be used during \n\n \n\n\n\n50\n\ntreatment with EMEND and for 2 months following the last dose of EMEND (see sections 4.4 and \n4.5).\n\nPregnancy\nFor aprepitant no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. The potential for reproductive \ntoxicity of aprepitant has not been fully characterised, since exposure levels above the therapeutic \nexposure in humans at the 125 mg/80 mg dose could not be attained in animal studies. These studies \ndid not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). The potential effects on \nreproduction of alterations in neurokinin regulation are unknown. EMEND should not be used during \npregnancy unless clearly necessary.\n\nBreast-feeding\nAprepitant is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether aprepitant is excreted in \nhuman milk; therefore, breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with EMEND.\n\nFertility\nThe potential for effects of aprepitant on fertility has not been fully characterised because exposure \nlevels above the therapeutic exposure in humans could not be attained in animal studies. These fertility \nstudies did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to mating performance, fertility, \nembryonic/foetal development, or sperm count and motility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nEMEND may have minor influence on the ability to ride a bicycle and use machines. Dizziness and \nfatigue may occur following administration of EMEND (see section 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe safety profile of aprepitant was evaluated in approximately 6,500 adults in more than 50 studies\nand 184 children and adolescents in 2 pivotal paediatric clinical trials.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions reported at a greater incidence in adults treated with the aprepitant \nregimen than with standard therapy in patients receiving Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy (HEC) \nwere: hiccups (4.6 % versus 2.9 %), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (2.8 % versus 1.1 %), \ndyspepsia (2.6 % versus 2.0 %), constipation (2.4 % versus 2.0 %), headache (2.0 % versus 1.8 %), and \ndecreased appetite (2.0 % versus 0.5 %). The most common adverse reaction reported at a greater \nincidence in patients treated with the aprepitant regimen than with standard therapy in adults receiving \nModerately Emetogenic Chemotherapy (MEC) was fatigue (1.4 % versus 0.9 %).\n\nThe most common adverse reactions reported at a greater incidence in paediatric patients treated with \nthe aprepitant regimen than with the control regimen while receiving emetogenic cancer chemotherapy \nwere hiccups (3.3 % versus 0.0 %) and flushing (1.1 % versus 0.0 %).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe following adverse reactions were observed in a pooled analysis of the HEC and MEC studies at a \ngreater incidence with aprepitant than with standard therapy or in postmarketing use. The frequency \ncategories given in the table are based on the studies in adults; the observed frequencies in the \npaediatric studies were similar or lower, unless shown in the table. Some less common ADRs in the \nadult population were not observed in the paediatric studies.\n\nFrequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot \nbe estimated from the available data).\n\n \n\n\n\n51\n\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction Frequency\nInfection and infestations candidiasis, staphylococcal infection rare\n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders\n\nfebrile neutropenia, anaemia uncommon\n\nImmune system disorders hypersensitivity reactions including \nanaphylactic reactions\n\nnot known\n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders\n\ndecreased appetite common\n\npolydipsia rare\n\nPsychiatric disorders anxiety uncommon\n\ndisorientation, euphoric mood rare\n\nNervous system disorders headache common\n\ndizziness, somnolence uncommon\n\ncognitive disorder, lethargy, dysgeusia rare\n\nEye disorders conjunctivitis rare\nEar and labyrinth disorders tinnitus rare\nCardiac disorders palpitations uncommon\n\nbradycardia, cardiovascular disorder rare\n\nVascular disorders hot flush/flushing uncommon\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\n\nhiccups common\n\noropharyngeal pain, sneezing, cough, \npostnasal drip, throat irritation\n\nrare\n\nGastrointestinal disorders constipation, dyspepsia common\n\neructation, nausea†, vomiting†, \ngastroesophageal reflux disease, abdominal \npain, dry mouth, flatulence\n\nuncommon\n\nduodenal ulcer perforation, stomatitis, \nabdominal distension, faeces hard, neutropenic \ncolitis\n\nrare\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nrash, acne uncommon\n\nphotosensitivity reaction, hyperhidrosis, \nseborrhoea, skin lesion, rash pruritic, \nStevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis\n\nrare\n\npruritus, urticaria not known\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders\n\nmuscular weakness, muscle spasms rare\n\nRenal and urinary disorders dysuria uncommon\n\npollakiuria rare\n\n \n\n\n\n52\n\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction Frequency\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nfatigue common\n\nasthenia, malaise uncommon\n\noedema, chest discomfort, gait disturbance rare\n\nInvestigations ALT increased common\n\nAST increased, blood alkaline phosphatase \nincreased\n\nuncommon\n\nred blood cells urine positive, blood sodium \ndecreased, weight decreased, neutrophil count \ndecreased, glucose urine present, urine output \nincreased\n\nrare\n\n†Nausea and vomiting were efficacy parameters in the first 5 days of post-chemotherapy treatment and were \nreported as adverse reactions only thereafter.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nThe adverse reactions profiles in adults in the Multiple-Cycle extension of HEC and MEC studies for \nup to 6 additional cycles of chemotherapy were generally similar to those observed in Cycle 1.\n\nIn an additional active-controlled clinical study in 1,169 patients receiving aprepitant and HEC, the \nadverse reactions profile was generally similar to that seen in the other HEC studies with aprepitant.\n\nAdditional adverse reactions were observed in adult patients treated with aprepitant for postoperative \nnausea and vomiting (PONV) and a greater incidence than with ondansetron: abdominal pain upper, \nbowel sounds abnormal, constipation*, dysarthria, dyspnoea, hypoaesthesia, insomnia, miosis, nausea, \nsensory disturbance, stomach discomfort, sub-ileus*, visual acuity reduced, wheezing.\n*Reported in patients taking a higher dose of aprepitant.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nIn the event of overdose, EMEND should be discontinued and general supportive treatment and \nmonitoring should be provided. Because of the antiemetic activity of aprepitant, emesis induced by a \nmedicinal product may not be effective.\n\nAprepitant cannot be removed by haemodialysis.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiemetics and antinauseants, ATC code: A04AD12\n\nAprepitant is a selective high-affinity antagonist at human substance P neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n53\n\n3-day regimen of aprepitant in adults\nIn 2 randomised, double-blind studies encompassing a total of 1,094 adult patients receiving \nchemotherapy that included cisplatin  70 mg/m2, aprepitant in combination with an \nondansetron/dexamethasone regimen (see section 4.2) was compared with a standard regimen (placebo \nplus ondansetron 32 mg intravenously administered on Day 1 plus dexamethasone 20 mg orally on \nDay 1 and 8 mg orally twice daily on Days 2 to 4). Although a 32 mg intravenous dose of ondansetron \nwas used in clinical trials, this is no longer the recommended dose. See the product information for the \nselected 5-HT3 antagonist for appropriate dosing information.\n\nEfficacy was based on evaluation of the following composite measure: complete response (defined as \nno emetic episodes and no use of rescue therapy) primarily during Cycle 1.

The efficacy of the aprepitant regimen was apparently \nmaintained during all cycles.\n\nIn a second multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, clinical study, the aprepitant \nregimen was compared with standard therapy in 848 adult patients (652 females, 196 males) receiving \na chemotherapy regimen that included any intravenous dose of oxaliplatin, carboplatin, epirubicin, \nidarubicin, ifosfamide, irinotecan, daunorubicin, doxorubicin; cyclophosphamide intravenously \n(< 1,500 mg/m2); or cytarabine intravenously (> 1 g/m2). Patients receiving the aprepitant regimen \nwere receiving chemotherapy for a variety of tumour types including 52 % with breast cancer, 21 % \nwith gastrointestinal cancers including colorectal cancer, 13 % with lung cancer and 6 % with \ngynaecological cancers. The aprepitant regimen in combination with an ondansetron/dexamethasone \nregimen (see section 4.2) was compared with standard therapy (placebo in combination with \nondansetron 8 mg orally (twice on Day 1, and every 12 hours on Days 2 and 3) plus dexamethasone \n20 mg orally on Day 1).\n\nEfficacy was based on the evaluation of the following primary and key secondary endpoints: No \nvomiting in the overall period (0 to 120 hours post-chemotherapy), evaluation of safety and \ntolerability of the aprepitant regimen for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), and \ncomplete response (defined as no vomiting and no use of rescue therapy) in the overall period (0 to \n120 hours post-chemotherapy). Additionally, no significant nausea in the overall period (0 to \n120 hours post-chemotherapy) was evaluated as an exploratory endpoint, and in the acute and delayed \nphases as a post-hoc analysis.\n\nA summary of the key study results is shown in Table 3.\n\n \n\n\n\n56\n\nTable 3\nPercent of adult patients responding by treatment group and phase for Study 2 – Cycle 1\n\nModerately Emetogenic Chemotherapy\n\nAprepitant \nregimen\n(N= 425)\n\n%\n\nStandard \ntherapy\n\n(N= 406)\n%\n\nDifferences*\n\n        %             (95 % CI)\n\nComplete response (no emesis and no rescue therapy)\nOverall (0-120 hours)\n0-24 hours\n25-120 hours\n\n68.7\n\n89.2\n70.8\n\n56.3\n\n80.3\n60.9\n\n12.4\n8.9\n9.9\n\n(5.9, 18.9)\n(4.0, 13.8)\n(3.5, 16.3)\n\nNo emesis (no emetic episodes regardless of use of rescue therapy)\nOverall (0-120 hours)\n0-24 hours\n25-120 hours\n\n76.2\n92.0\n77.9\n\n62.1\n83.7\n66.8\n\n14.1\n8.3\n11.1\n\n(7.9, 20.3)\n(3.9, 12.7)\n(5.1, 17.1)\n\nNo significant nausea (maximum VAS < 25 mm on a scale of 0-100 mm)\nOverall (0-120 hours)\n0-24 hours\n25-120 hours\n\n73.6\n\n90.9\n74.9\n\n66.4\n\n86.3\n69.5\n\n7.2\n4.6\n5.4\n\n(1.0, 13.4)\n(0.2, 9.0)\n(-0.7, 11.5)\n\n*The confidence intervals were calculated with no adjustment for gender and region, which were included in the \nprimary analysis using logistic models.\n\nThe benefit of aprepitant combination therapy in the full study population was mainly driven by the \nresults observed in patients with poor control with the standard regimen such as in women, even \nthough the results were numerically better regardless of age, tumour type or gender. Complete \nresponse to the aprepitant regimen and standard therapy, respectively, was reached in 209/324 (65 %) \nand 161/320 (50 %) in women and 83/101 (82 %) and 68/87 (78 %) of men.\n\nPaediatric population\nIn a randomised, double-blind, active comparator-controlled clinical study that included 302 children \nand adolescents (aged 6 months to 17 years) receiving moderately or highly emetogenic \nchemotherapy, the aprepitant regimen was compared to a control regimen for the prevention of CINV. \nThe efficacy of the aprepitant regimen was evaluated in a single cycle (Cycle 1). Patients had the \nopportunity to receive open-label aprepitant in subsequent cycles (Optional Cycles 2-6); however \nefficacy was not assessed in these optional cycles. The aprepitant regimen for adolescents aged 12 \nthrough 17 years (n=47) consisted of EMEND capsules 125 mg orally on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on \nDays 2 and 3 in combination with ondansetron on Day 1. The aprepitant regimen for children aged \n6 months to less than 12 years (n=105) consisted of EMEND powder for oral suspension 3.0 mg/kg \n(up to 125 mg) orally on Day 1 and 2.0 mg/kg (up to 80 mg) orally on Days 2 and 3 in combination \nwith ondansetron on Day 1. The control regimen in adolescents aged 12 through 17 years (n=48) and \nchildren aged 6 months to less than 12 years (n=102) consisted of placebo for aprepitant on Days 1, 2 \nand 3 in combination with ondansetron on Day 1. EMEND or placebo and ondansetron were \nadministered 1 hour and 30 minutes prior to initiation of chemotherapy, respectively. Intravenous \ndexamethasone was permitted as part of the antiemetic regimen for paediatric patients in both age \ngroups, at the discretion of the physician. A dose reduction (50 %) of dexamethasone was required for \npaediatric patients receiving aprepitant. No dose reduction was required for paediatric patients \nreceiving the control regimen. Of the paediatric patients, 29 % in the aprepitant regimen and 28 % in \nthe control regimen used dexamethasone as part of the regimen in Cycle 1.\n\nThe antiemetic activity of EMEND was evaluated over a 5-day (120 hour) period following the \ninitiation of chemotherapy on Day 1. The primary endpoint was complete response in the delayed \nphase (25 to 120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy) in Cycle 1. A summary of the key study \nresults are shown in Table 4.\n\n \n\n\n\n57\n\nTable 4\nNumber (%) of paediatric patients with complete response and no vomiting by treatment group and \n\nphase – Cycle 1 (Intent to treat population)\n\nAprepitant regimen\nn/m (%)\n\nControl regimen\nn/m (%)\n\nPRIMARY ENDPOINT\nComplete response* – Delayed phase 77/152 (50.7)† 39/150 (26.0)\nOTHER PRESPECIFIED ENDPOINTS\nComplete response* – Acute phase 101/152 (66.4)‡ 78/150 (52.0)\nComplete response* – Overall phase 61/152 (40.1)† 30/150 (20.0)\nNo vomiting§ – Overall phase 71/152 (46.7)† 32/150 (21.3)\n*Complete response = No vomiting or retching or dry heaves and no use of rescue medication.\n†p < 0.01 when compared to control regimen\n‡p < 0.05 when compared to control regimen\n§No vomiting = No vomiting or retching or dry heaves\nn/m = Number of patients with desired response/number of patients included in time point.\nAcute phase: 0 to 24 hours following initiation of chemotherapy.\nDelayed phase: 25 to 120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy.\nOverall phase: 0 to 120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy.\n\nThe estimated time to first vomiting after initiation of chemotherapy treatment was longer with the \naprepitant regimen (estimated median time to first vomiting was 94.5 hours) compared with the \ncontrol regimen group (estimated median time to first vomiting was 26.0 hours) as depicted in the \nKaplan-Meier curves in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2\nTime to first vomiting episode from start of chemotherapy administration - paediatric patients in the \n\noverall phase-Cycle 1 (Intent to treat population)\n\nAn analysis of efficacy in subpopulations in Cycle 1 demonstrated that, regardless of age category, \ngender, use of dexamethasone for antiemetic prophylaxis, and emetogenicity of chemotherapy, the \naprepitant regimen provided better control than the control regimen with respect to the complete \nresponse endpoints.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAprepitant displays non-linear pharmacokinetics. Both clearance and absolute bioavailability decrease \nwith increasing dose.\n\n \n\n\n\n58\n\nAbsorption\nThe mean absolute oral bioavailability of aprepitant is 67 % for the 80 mg capsule and 59 % for the \n125 mg capsule. The mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of aprepitant occurred at approximately \n4 hours (tmax). Oral administration of the capsule with an approximately 800 Kcal standard breakfast \nresulted in an up to 40 % increase in AUC of aprepitant. This increase is not considered clinically \nrelevant.\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aprepitant is non-linear across the clinical dose range. In healthy young \nadults, the increase in AUC0- was 26 % greater than dose proportional between 80 mg and 125 mg \nsingle doses administered in the fed state.\n\nFollowing oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of EMEND on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on \nDays 2 and 3, the AUC0-24hr (mean±SD) was 19.6 ± 2.5 µgh/mL and 21.2 ± 6.3 µg h/mL on \nDays 1 and 3, respectively. Cmax was 1.6 ± 0.36 µg/mL and 1.4 ± 0.22 µg/mL on Days 1 and 3, \nrespectively.\n\nDistribution\nAprepitant is highly protein bound, with a mean of 97 %. The geometric mean apparent volume of \ndistribution at steady state (Vdss) is approximately 66 L in humans.\n\nBiotransformation\nAprepitant undergoes extensive metabolism. In healthy young adults, aprepitant accounts for\napproximately 19 % of the radioactivity in plasma over 72 hours following a single intravenous \nadministration 100 mg dose of [14C]-fosaprepitant, a prodrug for aprepitant, indicating a substantial \npresence of metabolites in the plasma. Twelve metabolites of aprepitant have been identified in human \nplasma. The metabolism of aprepitant occurs largely via oxidation at the morpholine ring and its side \nchains and the resultant metabolites were only weakly active. In vitro studies using human liver \nmicrosomes indicate that aprepitant is metabolised primarily by CYP3A4 and potentially with minor \ncontribution by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19.\n\nElimination\nAprepitant is not excreted unchanged in urine. Metabolites are excreted in urine and via biliary \nexcretion in faeces. Following a single intravenously administered 100 mg dose of [14C]-fosaprepitant, \na prodrug for aprepitant, to healthy subjects, 57 % of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and \n45 % in faeces.\n\nThe plasma clearance of aprepitant is dose-dependent, decreasing with increased dose and ranged from \napproximately 60 to 72 mL/min in the therapeutic dose range. The terminal half-life ranged from \napproximately 9 to 13 hours.\n\nPharmacokinetics in special populations\nGender: Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of aprepitant, the Cmax for aprepitant is \n16 % higher in females as compared with males. The half-life of aprepitant is 25 % lower in females \nas compared with males and its tmax occurs at approximately the same time. These differences are not \nconsidered clinically meaningful. No dose adjustment for EMEND is necessary based on gender.\n\nHepatic impairment: Mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) does not affect the \npharmacokinetics of aprepitant to a clinically relevant extent. No dose adjustment is necessary for \npatients with mild hepatic impairment. Conclusions regarding the influence of moderate hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh class B) on aprepitant pharmacokinetics cannot be drawn from available data. \nThere are no clinical or pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nclass C).\n\nRenal impairment: A single 240 mg dose of aprepitant was administered to patients with severe renal \nimpairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) and to patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring \nhaemodialysis.\n\n \n\n\n\n59\n\nIn patients with severe renal impairment, the AUC0- of total aprepitant (unbound and protein bound) \ndecreased by 21 % and Cmax decreased by 32 %, relative to healthy subjects. In patients with ESRD \nundergoing haemodialysis, the AUC0- of total aprepitant decreased by 42 % and Cmax decreased by \n32 %. Due to modest decreases in protein binding of aprepitant in patients with renal disease, the AUC \nof pharmacologically active unbound aprepitant was not significantly affected in patients with renal \nimpairment compared with healthy subjects. Haemodialysis conducted 4 or 48 hours after dosing had \nno significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant; less than 0.2 % of the dose was recovered \nin the dialysate.\n\nNo dose adjustment for EMEND is necessary for patients with renal impairment or for patients with \nESRD undergoing haemodialysis.\n\nPaediatric population: As part of a 3-day regimen, dosing of aprepitant capsules (125/80/80-mg) in \nadolescent patients (aged 12 through 17 years) achieved an AUC0-24hr above 17 µg•hr/mL on Day 1 \nwith concentrations (Cmin) at the end of Days 2 and 3 above 0.4 µg/mL in a majority of patients. The \nmedian peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was approximately 1.3 µg/mL on Day 1, occurring at \napproximately 4 hours. As part of a 3-day regimen, dosing of aprepitant powder for oral suspension \n(3/2/2-mg/kg) in patients aged 6 months to less than12 years achieved an AUC0-24hr above \n17 µg•hr/mL on Day 1 with concentrations (Cmin) at the end of Days 2 and 3 above 0.1 µg/mL in a \nmajority of patients. The median peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was approximately 1.2 µg/mL on \nDay 1, occurring between 5 and 7 hours.\n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis of aprepitant in paediatric patients (aged 6 months through \n17 years) suggests that gender and race have no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics \nof aprepitant.\nRelationship between concentration and effect\nUsing a highly specific NK1-receptor tracer, positron emission tomography (PET) studies in healthy \nyoung men have shown that aprepitant penetrates into the brain and occupies NK1 receptors in a dose-\nand plasma-concentration-dependent manner. Aprepitant plasma concentrations achieved with the \n3-day regimen of EMEND in adults are predicted to provide greater than 95 % occupancy of brain \nNK1 receptors.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nPre-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and \nrepeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction and development. \nHowever, it should be noted that systemic exposure in rodents was similar or even lower than \ntherapeutic exposure in humans at the 125 mg/80 mg dose. In particular, although no adverse effects \nwere noted in reproduction studies at human exposure levels, the animal exposures are not sufficient to \nmake an adequate risk assessment in man.\n\nIn a juvenile toxicity study in rats treated from post natal day 10 to day 63 aprepitant led to an earlier \nvaginal opening in females from 250 mg/kg b.i.d. and to a delayed preputial separation in males, from \n10 mg/kg b.i.d. There were no margins to clinically relevant exposure. There were no \ntreatment-related effects on mating, fertility or embryonic/foetal survival, and no pathological changes \nin the reproductive organs. In a juvenile toxicity study in dogs treated from post natal day 14 to \nday 42, a decreased testicular weight and Leydig cell size were seen in the males at 6 mg/kg/day and \nincreased uterine weight, hypertrophy of the uterus and cervix, and oedema of vaginal tissues were \nseen in females from 4 mg/kg/day. There were no margins to clinically relevant exposure of \naprepitant. For short term treatment according to recommended dose regimen these findings are \nconsidered unlikely to be clinically relevant.\n\n \n\n\n\n60\n\n6.

What EMEND is and what it is used for\n\nEMEND contains the active substance aprepitant and belongs to a group of medicines called \n\"neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonists\". The brain has a specific area that controls nausea and \nvomiting. EMEND works by blocking signals to that area, thereby reducing nausea and vomiting. \nEMEND is used in adults in combination with other medicines to prevent nausea and vomiting \ncaused by chemotherapy (cancer treatment) containing cisplatin (a strong trigger of nausea and \nvomiting) and with chemotherapy that is a moderate trigger of nausea and vomiting (such as \ncyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or epirubicin). \n\n2.

There are some \nmedicines that should not be taken with EMEND (such as pimozide, terfenadine, astemizole, and \ncisapride) or that require a dose adjustment (see also Do not take EMEND). \n\nThe effects of EMEND or other medicines might be influenced if you take EMEND together with \nother medicines including those listed below.

If you are pregnant or \nbreast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice\nbefore taking this medicine.\n\nFor information regarding birth control, see 'Other medicines and EMEND'.\n\nIt is not known whether EMEND is excreted in human milk; therefore, breast-feeding is not \nrecommended during treatment with this medicine.

What EMEND is and what it is used for\n\nEMEND contains the active substance ‘aprepitant.’ It belongs to a group of medicines called \n‘neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonists’.\nThe brain has a specific area that controls nausea and vomiting. EMEND works by blocking signals to \nthat area, thereby reducing nausea and vomiting.\nThe powder for oral suspension is used in children aged 6 months to less than 12 years in \ncombination with other medicines to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy (cancer \ntreatment) that are strong and moderate triggers of nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin, \ncyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or epirubicin).\n\n2. What you need to know before you give EMEND\n\nDo not give EMEND:\n- if the child is allergic to aprepitant or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n- if the child is using medicines that contain ‘pimozide’ (for mental health problems).\n- if the child is using ‘terfenadine’ or ‘astemizole’ (for hay fever and other allergies).\n- if the child is using ‘cisapride’ - (for problems with digestion).\nDo not give this medicine if any of the above applies to the child and tell the child’s doctor if they are \nusing any of the medicines above.

This is because EMEND can affect how other medicines work, during and after treatment \nwith EMEND. Also, some other medicines can affect the way this medicine works.\n\nDo not give EMEND and tell the doctor or pharmacist if the child is using any of the following \nmedicines (see also under ‘Do not give EMEND’).
