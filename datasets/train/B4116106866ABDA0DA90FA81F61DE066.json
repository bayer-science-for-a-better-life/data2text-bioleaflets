No data are available. \n \nElderly  \nNo dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (\u2265 65 years) (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Data from \npatients 75 years of age or older are too limited to draw conclusions on this population. \n \nRenal impairment \nBased on the population pharmacokinetic (PK) results, no dose adjustment is required in patients with \nmild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). Data from patients with severe renal impairment \nare too limited to draw conclusions on this population. \n \nHepatic impairment \nBased on the population PK results, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic \nimpairment (see section 5.2). Data from patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment are too \nlimited to draw conclusions on these populations. Nivolumab BMS must be administered with \ncaution in patients with moderate (total bilirubin > 1.5 \u00d7 to 3 \u00d7 the upper limit of normal [ULN] \nand any AST) or severe (total bilirubin > 3 \u00d7 ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. \n \n\n \nMethod of administration  \n\nNivolumab BMS is for intravenous use only. It is to be administered as an intravenous infusion over a \nperiod of 60 minutes. The infusion must be administered through a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein \nbinding in-line filter with a pore size of 0.2-1.2 \u00b5m. \n \nNivolumab BMS must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection. \n \nThe total dose of Nivolumab BMS required can be infused directly as a 10 mg/mL solution or can be \ndiluted to as low as 1 mg/mL with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose \n50 mg/mL (5%) solution for injection.  \n \nFor instructions on the handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nNivolumab is associated with immune-related adverse reactions. Patients should be monitored \ncontinuously (at least up to 5 months after the last dose) as an adverse reaction with nivolumab may \noccur at any time during or after discontinuation of nivolumab therapy.  \n \nFor suspected immune-related adverse reactions, adequate evaluation should be performed to confirm \naetiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, nivolumab should be \nwithheld and corticosteroids administered. If immunosuppression with corticosteroids is used to treat \nan adverse reaction, a taper of at least 1 month duration should be initiated upon improvement. Rapid \ntapering may lead to worsening of the adverse reaction. Non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive \ntherapy should be added if there is worsening or no improvement despite corticosteroid use.  \nNivolumab should not be resumed while the patient is receiving immunosuppressive doses of \ncorticosteroids or other immunosuppressive therapy. Prophylactic antibiotics should be used to prevent \nopportunistic infections in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nNivolumab must be permanently discontinued for any severe immune related adverse reaction that \nrecurs and for any life threatening immune related adverse reaction. \n \n\nSevere pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease, including fatal cases, has been observed with \nnivolumab treatment (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of \npneumonitis such as radiographic changes (e.g., focal ground glass opacities, patchy filtrates), \ndyspnoea, and hypoxia. Infectious and disease-related aetiologies should be ruled out. \n\nImmune-related pneumonitis \n\n \nFor Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis, nivolumab must be permanently discontinued, and corticosteroids \nshould be initiated at a dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. \n \nFor Grade 2 (symptomatic) pneumonitis, nivolumab should be withheld and corticosteroids initiated at \na dose of 1 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. Upon improvement, nivolumab may be \nresumed after corticosteroid taper. If worsening or no improvement occurs despite initiation of \ncorticosteroids, corticosteroid dose should be increased to 2 to 4 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone \nequivalents and nivolumab must be permanently discontinued. \n \n\nSevere diarrhoea or colitis has been observed with nivolumab treatment (see section 4.8). Patients \nshould be monitored for diarrhoea and additional symptoms of colitis, such as abdominal pain and \nmucus or blood in stool. Infectious and disease-related aetiologies should be ruled out.  \n\nImmune-related colitis \n\n \nFor Grade 4 diarrhoea or colitis, nivolumab must be permanently discontinued, and corticosteroids \nshould be initiated at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. \n \nFor Grade 3 diarrhoea or colitis, nivolumab should be withheld and corticosteroids initiated at a dose \nof 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. Upon improvement, nivolumab may be resumed \nafter corticosteroid taper. If worsening or no improvement occurs despite initiation of corticosteroids, \nnivolumab must be permanently discontinued. \n \nFor Grade 2 diarrhoea or colitis, nivolumab should be withheld. Persistent diarrhoea or colitis should \nbe managed with corticosteroids at a dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. \nUpon improvement, nivolumab may be resumed after corticosteroid taper, if needed. If worsening or \nno improvement occurs despite initiation of corticosteroids, corticosteroid dose should be increased \nto 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents and nivolumab must be permanently \ndiscontinued. \n \n\nSevere hepatitis has been observed with nivolumab treatment. Patients should be monitored for signs \nand symptoms of hepatitis such as transaminase and total bilirubin elevations. Infectious and \ndisease-related aetiologies should be ruled out. \n\nImmune-related hepatitis \n\n \nFor Grade 3 or 4 transaminase or total bilirubin elevation, nivolumab must be permanently \ndiscontinued, and corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone \nequivalents. \n \nFor Grade 2 transaminase or total bilirubin elevation, nivolumab should be withheld. Persistent \nelevations in these laboratory values should be managed with corticosteroids at a dose \nof 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. Upon improvement, nivolumab may be \nresumed after corticosteroid taper, if needed. If worsening or no improvement occurs despite initiation \nof corticosteroids, corticosteroid dose should be increased to 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone \nequivalents and nivolumab must be permanently discontinued. \n \n\nSevere nephritis or renal dysfunction has been observed with nivolumab treatment (see section 4.8). \nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of nephritis and renal dysfunction.

Disease-related aetiologies should be ruled \nout. \n \nFor Grade 4 serum creatinine elevation, nivolumab must be permanently discontinued, and \ncorticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. \n \nFor Grade 2 or 3 serum creatinine elevation, nivolumab should be withheld, and corticosteroids should \nbe initiated at a dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. Upon improvement, \nnivolumab may be resumed after corticosteroid taper. If worsening or no improvement occurs despite \ninitiation of corticosteroids, corticosteroid dose should be increased to 1 to 2 mg/kg/day \nmethylprednisolone equivalents, and nivolumab must be permanently discontinued. \n \n\nSevere endocrinopathies, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, \nhypophysitis, diabetes mellitus, and diabetic ketoacidosis have been observed with nivolumab \ntreatment.  \n\nImmune-related endocrinopathies \n\n \nPatients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of endocrinopathies and for changes in \nthyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on \nclinical evaluation). Patients may present with fatigue, headache, mental status changes, abdominal \npain, unusual bowel habits, and hypotension, or nonspecific symptoms which may resemble other \ncauses such as brain metastasis or underlying disease. Unless an alternate etiology has been identified, \nsigns or symptoms of endocrinopathies should be considered immune-related. \n \nFor symptomatic hypothyroidism, nivolumab should be withheld, and thyroid hormone replacement \nshould be initiated as needed. For symptomatic hyperthyroidism, nivolumab should be withheld and \nmethimazole should be initiated as needed. Corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day \nmethylprednisolone equivalents should also be considered if acute inflammation of the thyroid is \nsuspected. Upon improvement, nivolumab may be resumed after corticosteroid taper, if needed. \nMonitoring of thyroid function should continue to ensure appropriate hormone replacement is utilised. \n \nFor symptomatic adrenal insufficiency, nivolumab should be withheld, and physiologic corticosteroid \nreplacement should be initiated as needed. Monitoring of adrenal function and hormone levels should \ncontinue to ensure appropriate corticosteroid replacement is utilised. \n \nFor symptomatic hypophysitis, nivolumab should be withheld, and hormone replacement should be \ninitiated as needed. Corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents \nshould also be considered if acute inflammation of the pituitary gland is suspected. Upon \nimprovement, nivolumab may be resumed after corticosteroid taper, if needed. Monitoring of pituitary \nfunction and hormone levels should continue to ensure appropriate hormone replacement is utilised. \n \nFor symptomatic diabetes, nivolumab should be withheld, and insulin replacement should be initiated \nas needed. Monitoring of blood sugar should continue to ensure appropriate insulin replacement is \nutilised.  \n \n\nSevere rash has been observed with nivolumab treatment that may be immune-related (see \nsection 4.8). Nivolumab should be withheld for Grade 3 rash and discontinued for Grade 4 rash. \nSevere rash should be managed with high-dose corticosteroid at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone \nequivalents.  \n\nImmune-related rash \n\n \nCaution should be used when considering the use of nivolumab in a patient who has previously \nexperienced a severe or life-threatening skin adverse reaction on prior treatment with other immune-\nstimulatory anticancer agents. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nThe following immune-related adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients treated with \nnivolumab in clinical trials across doses and tumour types: pancreatitis, uveitis, demyelination, \nautoimmune neuropathy (including facial and abducens nerve paresis), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, \nhypopituitarism, and myasthenic syndrome. \n\nOther immune-related adverse reactions \n\n \nFor suspected immune-related adverse reactions, adequate evaluation should be performed to confirm \naetiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, nivolumab should be \nwithheld and corticosteroids administered. Upon improvement, nivolumab may be resumed after \ncorticosteroid taper. Nivolumab must be permanently discontinued for any severe immune-related \nadverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-related adverse reaction. \n \n\nSevere infusion reactions have been reported in clinical trials (see section 4.8). In case of a severe \ninfusion reaction, nivolumab infusion must be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy \nadministered. Patients with mild or moderate infusion reaction may receive nivolumab with close \nmonitoring. \n\nInfusion reactions \n\n \n\nPatients with a baseline performance score \u2265 2, active brain metastases or autoimmune disease, \nsymptomatic interstitial lung disease, and patients who had been receiving systemic \nimmunosuppressants prior to study entry were excluded from the clinical trials of NSCLC (see \nsections 4.5 and 5.1). In the absence of data, nivolumab should be used with caution in these \npopulations after careful consideration of the potential risk-benefit on an individual basis. \n\nSpecial populations  \n\n \n\nEach mL of this medicinal product contains 0.1 mmol (or 2.5 mg) sodium. To be taken into \nconsideration when treating patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n\nPatients on controlled sodium diet \n\n \nPatient Alert Card \nAll prescribers of Nivolumab BMS must be familiar with the Physician Information and Management \nGuidelines. The prescriber must discuss the risks of Nivolumab BMS therapy with the patient. The \npatient will be provided with the Patient Alert Card with each prescription. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNivolumab is a human monoclonal antibody, as such pharmacokinetic interaction studies have not \nbeen conducted. As monoclonal antibodies are not metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes \nor other drug metabolising enzymes, inhibition or induction of these enzymes by co-administered \nmedicinal products is not anticipated to affect the pharmacokinetics of nivolumab.  \n \n\n \nOther forms of interaction  \n\nThe use of systemic corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants at baseline, before starting \nnivolumab, should be avoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic \nactivity. However, systemic corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants can be used after starting \nnivolumab to treat immune-related adverse reactions. The preliminary results show that systemic \nimmunosuppression after starting nivolumab treatment does not appear to preclude the response on \nnivolumab. \n\nSystemic immunosuppression \n\n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nThere are no data on the use of nivolumab in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nembryofoetal toxicity (see section 5.3). Human IgG4 is known to cross the placental barrier and \nnivolumab is an IgG4; therefore nivolumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the \n\nPregnancy \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\ndeveloping foetus. Nivolumab is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing \npotential not using effective contraception unless the clinical benefit outweighs the potential risk. \nEffective contraception should be used for at least 5 months following the last dose of \nNivolumab BMS. \n \n\nIt is unknown whether nivolumab is secreted in human milk. Because many medicinal products, \nincluding antibodies, can be secreted in human milk, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be \nexcluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue from \nnivolumab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nStudies to evaluate the effect of nivolumab on fertility have not been performed. Thus, the effect of \nnivolumab on male and female fertility is unknown. \n\nFertility \n\n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBased on its pharmacodynamic properties, nivolumab is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use \nmachines. Because of potential adverse reactions such as fatigue (see section 4.8), patients should be \nadvised to use caution when driving or operating machinery until they are certain that nivolumab does \nnot adversely affect them. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nNivolumab is most commonly associated with immune-related adverse reactions. Most of these, \nincluding severe reactions, resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy or withdrawal \nof nivolumab (see \u201cDescription of selected adverse reactions\u201d below). \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \nIn the pooled dataset of two studies in squamous NSCLC (CA209017 and CA209063), the most \nfrequent adverse reactions (\u2265 10% of patients) were fatigue (33%), decreased appetite (15%), and \nnausea (12%). The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2).  \n \n\nAdverse reactions reported in the pooled dataset (n=248) of CA209017 and CA209063 are presented \nin Table 2. These reactions are presented by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are \ndefined as: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); \nrare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000).

There was no worsening to Grade 3 or 4 in \nincreased ALT, increased alkaline phosphatase, and increased creatinine. \n\nLaboratory abnormalities \n\n \nIn study CA209017, hypercalcaemia was more frequently reported in the nivolumab group (31/130, \n24%) than in the docetaxel group (9/124, 7%). The exact cause is not known. Although \nhyperparathyroidism was not reported in CA209017, immune-related hyperparathyroidism might be \nconsidered especially if associated with hypophosphataemia (reported in 6 hypercalcemic patients in \nthis study). \n \n\nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for an immune response to nivolumab. Of the \n497 patients who were treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks and evaluable for the presence \nof anti-product-antibodies, 51 (10.3%) patients tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-product \nantibodies by an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay. Only 4 (0.8%) patients were persistent \npositive. Neutralising antibodies were detected in only 5 (1.0% of the total) of the positive \nanti-product-antibody patients. There was no evidence of altered pharmacokinetic or toxicity profile \nassociated with anti-product-antibody development. \n\nImmunogenicity \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies. ATC code: L01XC17. \n \n\nNivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (HuMAb), which binds to \nthe programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 \nreceptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of \nT-cell immune responses. Engagement of PD-1 with the ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are \nexpressed in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour \nmicroenvironment, results in inhibition of T-cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. Nivolumab \npotentiates T-cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to \nPD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands. In syngeneic mouse models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased \ntumour growth. \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nThe safety and efficacy of nivolumab 3 mg/kg as a single agent for the treatment of advanced or \nmetastatic squamous NSCLC were evaluated in a phase 3, randomised, open-label study (CA209017). \nThe study included patients (18 years or older) who have experienced disease progression during or \nafter one prior platinum doublet-based chemotherapy regimen and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology \nGroup (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1. Patients were enrolled regardless of their PD-L1 \nstatus. Patients with active autoimmune disease, symptomatic interstitial lung disease, or untreated \nbrain metastasis were excluded from the study. Patients with treated brain metastases were eligible if \nneurologically returned to baseline at least 2 weeks prior to enrolment, and either off corticosteroids, \nor on a stable or decreasing dose of <10 mg daily prednisone equivalents. \n\nRandomised phase 3 study vs. docetaxel (CA209017) \n\n \nA total of 272 patients were randomised to receive either nivolumab 3 mg/kg (N = 135) administered \nintravenously over 60 minutes every 2 weeks or docetaxel (n = 137) 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. \nTreatment was continued as long as clinical benefit was observed or until treatment was no longer \ntolerated. Tumour assessments, according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours \n(RECIST), version 1.1, were conducted 9 weeks after randomisation and continued every 6 weeks \nthereafter. The primary efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS). Key secondary efficacy \noutcome measures were investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free \nsurvival (PFS). In addition, symptom improvement and overall health status were assessed using the \nLung Cancer Symptom Score (LCSS) average symptom burden index and the EQ-5D Visual \nAnalogue Scale (EQ-VAS), respectively.  \n \nBaseline characteristics were generally balanced between the two groups. The median age \nwas 63 years (range: 39-85) with 44% \u226565 years of age and 11% \u226575 years of age. The majority of \npatients were white (93%) and male (76%). Thirty-one percent had progressive disease reported as the \nbest response to their most recent prior regimen and 45% received nivolumab within 3 months of \ncompleting their most recent prior regimen. Baseline ECOG performance status score was 0 (24%) or \n1 (76%).  \n \nThe Kaplan-Meier curves for OS are shown in Figure 1. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n13 \n\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier curves of OS (CA209017)  \n \n\n \nOverall Survival (Months) \n\nNumber of Subjects at Risk \nNivolumab 3 mg/kg \n\n135 113 86 69 52 31 15 7 0 \nDocetaxel \n\n137 103 68 45 30 14 7 2 0 \n Nivolumab 3 mg/kg (events : 86/135), median and 95% CI : 9.23 (7.33, 13.27) \n\n Docetaxel (events : 113/137), median and 95% CI : 6.01 (5.13, 7.33) \n \nThe observed OS benefit was consistently demonstrated across subgroups of patients. Survival benefit \nwas observed regardless of whether patients had tumours that were designated PD-L1 negative or PD-\nL1 positive (tumour membrane expression cut off of 1%, 5% or 10%). However, the role of this \nbiomarker (PD-L1 expression) has not been fully elucidated. \n \nStudy CA209017 included a limited number of patients \u2265 75 years (11 in the nivolumab group and \n18 in the docetaxel group). Nivolumab showed numerically less effect on OS (HR 1.85; 95% CI: 0.76, \n4.51), PFS (HR=1.76; 95%-CI: 0.77, 4.05 ) and ORR (9.1% vs 16.7%).

The geometric \nmean clearance (CL), terminal half-life, and average exposure at steady state at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks \nof nivolumab were 9.5 mL/h, 26.7 days, and 75.3 \u00b5g/mL, respectively, based on a population PK \nanalysis. \n \nNivolumab CL increased with increasing body weight. Body weight normalised dosing produced \napproximately uniform steady-state trough concentration over a wide range of body weights \n(34-162 kg).  \n \nThe metabolic pathway of nivolumab has not been characterised. Nivolumab is expected to be \ndegraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as \nendogenous IgG. \n \n\n \nSpecial populations \n\nA population PK analysis suggested no difference in CL of nivolumab based on age, gender, race, \ntumour type, tumour size, and hepatic impairment. Although ECOG status, baseline glomerular \nfiltration rate (GFR), albumin, body weight, and mild hepatic impairment had an effect on nivolumab \nCL, the effect was not clinically meaningful. \n \n\nThe effect of renal impairment on the CL of nivolumab was evaluated in patients with mild (GFR < 90 \nand \u2265 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; n = 379), moderate (GFR < 60 and \u2265 30 mL/min/1.73 m2; n = 179), or \nsevere (GFR < 30 and \u2265 15 mL/min/1.73 m2; n = 2) renal impairment compared to patients with \nnormal renal function (GFR \u2265 90 mL/min/1.73 m2; n = 342) in population PK analyses. No clinically \nimportant differences in the CL of nivolumab were found between patients with mild or moderate \nrenal impairment and patients with normal renal function. Data from patients with severe renal \nimpairment are too limited to draw conclusions on this population (see section 4.2).  \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the CL of nivolumab was evaluated in patients with mild hepatic \nimpairment (total bilirubin 1.0 \u00d7 to 1.5 \u00d7 ULN or AST > ULN as defined using the National Cancer \nInstitute criteria of hepatic dysfunction; n = 92) compared to patients with normal hepatic function \n(total bilirubin and AST \u2264 ULN; n = 804) in the population PK analyses. No clinically important \ndifferences in the CL of nivolumab were found between patients with mild hepatic impairment and \nnormal hepatic function. Nivolumab has not been studied in patients with moderate (total \nbilirubin > 1.5 \u00d7 to 3 \u00d7 ULN and any AST) or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 \u00d7 ULN \nand any AST) (see section 4.2). \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nBlockade of PD-L1 signalling has been shown in murine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance \nto the foetus and to increase foetal loss. The effects of nivolumab on prenatal and postnatal \ndevelopment were evaluated in monkeys that received nivolumab twice weekly from the onset of \norganogenesis in the first trimester through delivery, at exposure levels either 8 or 35 times higher \nthan those observed at the clinical dose of 3 mg/kg of nivolumab (based on AUC). There was a \ndose-dependent increase in foetal losses and increased neonatal mortality beginning in the third \ntrimester. \n \nThe remaining offspring of nivolumab-treated females survived to scheduled termination, with no \ntreatment-related clinical signs, alterations to normal development, organ-weight effects, or gross and \nmicroscopic pathology changes. Results for growth indices, as well as teratogenic, neurobehavioral, \nimmunological, and clinical pathology parameters throughout the 6-month postnatal period were \ncomparable to the control group.

What Nivolumab BMS is and what it is used for \n \nNivolumab BMS is a medicine used to treat advanced non-small cell lung cancer (a type of lung \ncancer) in adults. It contains the active substance nivolumab, which is a monoclonal antibody, a type \nof protein designed to recognise and attach to a specific target substance in the body.  \n \nNivolumab attaches to a target protein called programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) that can switch off \nthe activity of T cells (a type of white blood cell that forms part of the immune system, the body\u2019s \nnatural defences). By attaching to PD-1, nivolumab blocks its action and prevents it from switching \noff your T cells. This helps increase their activity against the lung cancer cells. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Nivolumab BMS \n \nYou should not be given Nivolumab BMS \n\uf0a7 if you are allergic to nivolumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6 \"Contents of the pack and other information\"). Talk to your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before using Nivolumab BMS as it may cause: \n\uf0a7 Problems with your lungs such as breathing difficulties or cough. These may be signs of \n\ninflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease). \n\uf0a7 Diarrhoea (watery, loose or soft stools) or any symptoms of inflammation of the intestines \n\n(colitis), such as stomach pain and mucus or blood in stool. \n\uf0a7 Inflammation of the liver (hepatitis). Signs and symptoms of hepatitis may include abnormal \n\nliver function tests, eye or skin yellowing (jaundice), pain on the right side of your stomach \narea, or tiredness. \n\n\uf0a7 Inflammation or problems with your kidneys. Signs and symptoms may include abnormal \nkidney function tests, or decreased volume of urine. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n30 \n\n\uf0a7 Problems with your hormone producing glands (including the pituitary, the thyroid and \nadrenal glands) that may affect how these glands work. Signs and symptoms that these glands \nare not working properly may include fatigue (extreme tiredness), weight change or headache \nand visual disturbances. \n\n\uf0a7 Diabetes (symptoms include excessive thirst, the passing of a greatly increased amount of urine, \nincrease in appetite with a loss of weight, feeling tired, drowsy, weak, depressed, irritable and \ngenerally unwell) or diabetic ketoacidosis (acid in the blood produced from diabetes). \n\n\uf0a7 Inflammation of the skin that can lead to rash and itching. \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you have any of these signs or symptoms or if they get worse. Do \nnot try to treat your symptoms with other medicines on your own. Your doctor may \n\uf0a7 give you other medicines in order to prevent complications and reduce your symptoms, \n\uf0a7 withhold the next dose of Nivolumab BMS, \n\uf0a7 or stop your treatment with Nivolumab BMS altogether. \nPlease note that these signs and symptoms are sometimes delayed, and may develop weeks or months \nafter your last dose. Before treatment, your doctor will check your general health. You will also have \nblood tests during your treatment. \n \nCheck with your doctor or nurse before you are given Nivolumab BMS if: \n\uf0a7 you have been told that your cancer has spread to your brain \n\uf0a7 you have an autoimmune disease (a condition where the body attacks its own cells); \n\uf0a7 you have any history of inflammation of the lungs; \n\uf0a7 you have been taken medicines to suppress your immune system. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nNivolumab BMS should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Nivolumab BMS \nBefore you are given Nivolumab BMS, tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines that \nsuppress your immune system, such as corticosteroids, since these medicines may interfere with the \neffect of Nivolumab BMS. However, once you are treated with Nivolumab BMS, your doctor may \ngive you corticosteroids to reduce any possible side-effects that you may have during your treatment \nand this will not impact the effect of the medicine. \nTell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. Do not take any other \nmedicines during your treatment without talking to your doctor first. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are pregnant or think you might be, if you are planning to become pregnant, \nor if you are breast-feeding. \n \nDo not use Nivolumab BMS if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically tells you to. The \neffects of Nivolumab BMS in pregnant women are not known, but it is possible that the active \nsubstance, nivolumab, could harm an unborn baby. \n\uf0a7 You must use effective contraception while you are being treated with Nivolumab BMS and \n\nfor at least 5 months following the last dose of Nivolumab BMS, if you are a woman who could \nbecome pregnant. \n\n\uf0a7 If you become pregnant while using Nivolumab BMS tell your doctor. \n \nIt is not known whether nivolumab gets into breast milk. A risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be \nexcluded. Ask your doctor if you can breast-feed during or after treatment with Nivolumab BMS. \n \nDriving and using machines \nNivolumab is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines; however, use caution when \nperforming these activities until you are sure that nivolumab does not adversely affect you. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n31 \n\nNivolumab BMS contains sodium \nTell your doctor if you are on a low-sodium (low-salt) diet before you are given Nivolumab BMS. \nThis medicine contains 2.5 mg sodium per mL of concentrate. \n \nYou will also find this information in the Patient Alert Card you have been given by your doctor.

Based on this prescribed dose, calculate the \ntotal dose to be given. More than one vial of Nivolumab BMS concentrate may be needed to give the \ntotal dose for the patient. \n \n\uf0a7 The total nivolumab dose in mg = the patient\u2019s weight in kg \u00d7 the prescribed dose in mg/kg.  \n\uf0a7 The volume of Nivolumab BMS concentrate to prepare the dose (mL) = the total dose in mg, \n\ndivided by 10 (the Nivolumab BMS concentrate strength is 10 mg/mL).  \n \nPreparing the infusion \nTake care to ensure aseptic handling when you prepare the infusion. The infusion should be \nprepared in a laminar flow hood or safety cabinet using standard precautions for the safe handling of \nintravenous agents. \n \nNivolumab BMS can be used for intravenous administration either: \n\uf0a7 without dilution, after transfer to an infusion container using an appropriate sterile syringe; \n\nor \n\uf0a7 after diluting to concentrations as low as 1 mg/mL. The final infusion concentration should \n\nrange between 1 and 10 mg/mL. Nivolumab BMS concentrate may be diluted with either:  \n\uf0a7 sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection; or \n\uf0a7 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose solution for injection.  \n\n \nSTEP 1 \n\uf0a7 Inspect the Nivolumab BMS concentrate for particulate matter or discoloration. Do not shake \n\nthe vial. Nivolumab BMS concentrate is a clear to opalescent, colourless to pale yellow liquid \nthat may contain few light particles.  \n\n\uf0a7 Withdraw the required volume of Nivolumab BMS concentrate using an appropriate sterile \nsyringe.  \n\n \nSTEP 2 \n\uf0a7 Transfer the concentrate into a sterile, evacuated glass bottle or intravenous container (PVC or \n\npolyolefin).  \n\uf0a7 If applicable, dilute with the required volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for \n\ninjection or 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose solution for injection. Gently mix the infusion by manual \nrotation. Do not shake. \n\n \nAdministration \nNivolumab BMS infusion must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection. \nAdminister the Nivolumab BMS infusion intravenously over a period of 60 minutes. \n \nNivolumab BMS infusion should not be infused at the same time in the same intravenous line with \nother agents. Use a separate infusion line for the infusion. \n \nUse an infusion set and an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein binding filter (pore size \nof 0.2 \u03bcm to 1.2 \u03bcm). \n \nNivolumab BMS infusion is compatible with: \n\uf0a7 PVC containers \n\uf0a7 Polyolefin containers \n\uf0a7 Glass bottles \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n36 \n\n\uf0a7 PVC infusion sets \n\uf0a7 In-line filters with polyethersulfone membranes with pore sizes of 0.2 \u00b5m to 1.2 \u00b5m. \n \nAfter administration of the nivolumab dose, flush the line with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) \nsolution for injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose solution for injection. \n \nStorage conditions and shelf life \nUnopened vial \nNivolumab BMS must be stored in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). The vials must be kept in the original \npackage in order to protect from light. Nivolumab BMS should not be frozen. \n \nDo not use Nivolumab BMS after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the vial label \nafter EXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nNivolumab BMS infusion \nNivolumab BMS infusion must be completed within 24 hours of preparation. If not used immediately, \nthe solution may be stored under refrigeration conditions (2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C) and protected from light for up \nto 24 hours [a maximum of 4 hours of the total 24 hours can be at room temperature (20\u00b0C-25\u00b0C) and \nroom light]. Other in-use storage time and conditions are the responsibility of the user. \n \nDisposal \nDo not store any unused portion of the infusion solution for reuse. Any unused medicine or waste \nmaterial should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

of lung cancer) in adults. it contains the active substance nivolumab, which is a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein designed to recognise and attach to a specific target substance in the body. nivolumab attaches to a target protein called programmed death-1 receptor (pd-1) that can switch off the activity of t cells (a type of white blood cell that forms part of the immune system, the body's natural defences). by attaching to pd-1, nivolumab blocks its action and prevents it from switching off your t cells. this helps increase their activity against the lung cancer cells.",

allergic to nivolumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6 \"contents of the pack and other information\"). talk to your doctor if you are not sure. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before using nivolumab bms as it may cause: problems with your lungs such as breathing difficulties or cough. these may be signs of inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease). diarrhoea (watery, loose or soft stools) or any symptoms of inflammation of the intestines (colitis), such as stomach pain and mucus or blood in stool. inflammation of the liver (hepatitis). signs and symptoms of hepatitis may include abnormal liver function tests, eye or skin yellowing (jaundice), pain on the right side of your stomach area, or tiredness. inflammation or problems with your kidneys. signs and symptoms may include abnormal kidney function tests, or decreased volume of urine. problems with your hormone producing glands (including the pituitary, the thyroid and adrenal glands) that may affect how these glands work. signs and symptoms that these glands are not working properly may include fatigue (extreme tiredness), weight change or headache and visual disturbances. diabetes (symptoms include excessive thirst, the passing of a greatly increased amount of urine, increase in appetite with a loss of weight, feeling tired, drowsy, weak, depressed, irritable and generally unwell) or diabetic ketoacidosis (acid in the blood produced from diabetes). inflammation of the skin that can lead to rash and itching. tell your doctor immediately if you have any of these signs or symptoms or if they get worse. do not try to treat your symptoms with other medicines on your own. your doctor may give you other medicines in order to prevent complications and reduce your symptoms, withhold the next dose of nivolumab bms, or stop your treatment with nivolumab bms altogether. please note that these signs and symptoms are sometimes delayed, and may develop weeks or months after your last dose. before treatment, your doctor will check your general health. you will also have blood tests during your treatment. check with your doctor or nurse before you are given nivolumab bms if: you have been told that your cancer has spread to your brain you have an autoimmune disease (a condition where the body attacks its own cells); you have any history of inflammation of the lungs; you have been taken medicines to suppress your immune system. children and adolescents nivolumab bms should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. other medicines and nivolumab bms before you are given nivolumab bms, tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines that suppress your immune system, such as corticosteroids, since these medicines may interfere with the effect of nivolumab bms. however, once you are treated with nivolumab bms, your doctor may give you corticosteroids to reduce any possible side-effects that you may have during your treatment and this will not impact the effect of the medicine. tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. do not take any other medicines during your treatment without talking to your doctor first. pregnancy and breast-feeding tell your doctor if you are pregnant or think you might be, if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are breast-feeding. do not use nivolumab bms if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically tells you to. the effects of nivolumab bms in pregnant women are not known, but it is possible that the active substance, nivolumab, could harm an unborn baby. you must use effective contraception while you are being treated with nivolumab bms and for at least 5 months following the last dose of nivolumab bms, if you are a woman who could become pregnant. if you become pregnant while using nivolumab bms tell your doctor. it is not known whether nivolumab gets into breast milk. a risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be excluded. ask your doctor if you can breast-feed during or after treatment with nivolumab bms. driving and using machines nivolumab is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines; however, use caution when performing these activities until you are sure that nivolumab does not adversely affect you. nivolumab bms contains sodium tell your doctor if you are on a low-sodium (low-salt) diet before you are given nivolumab bms. this medicine contains 2.5 mg sodium per ml of concentrate. you will also find this information in the patient alert card
