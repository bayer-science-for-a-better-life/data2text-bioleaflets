CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nINTELENCE, in combination with a boosted protease inhibitor and other antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts, is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in \nantiretroviral treatment-experienced adult patients and in antiretroviral treatment-experienced \npaediatric patients from 2 years of age (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.\n\nPosology\n\nINTELENCE must always be given in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products.\n\nAdults\nThe recommended dose of etravirine for adults is 200 mg (one 200 mg tablet or two 100 mg tablets) \ntaken orally twice daily following a meal (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population (2 years to less than 18 years of age)\nThe recommended dose of etravirine for paediatric patients (2 years to less than 18 years of age and \nweighing at least 10 kg) is based on body weight (see table below). INTELENCE tablet(s) should be \ntaken orally, following a meal (see section 5.2).\n\nTable 1: Recommended dose of etravirine for paediatric patients 2 years to less than \n18 years of age\n\nBody weight Dose Tablets\n\u2265 10 to < 20 kg 100 mg twice \n\ndaily \nfour 25 mg tablets twice daily or\n\none 100 mg tablet twice daily\n\u2265 20 to < 25 kg 125 mg twice \n\ndaily \nfive 25 mg tablets twice daily or\n\none 100 mg tablet and one 25 mg tablet twice daily\n\u2265 25 to < 30 kg 150 mg twice \n\ndaily \nsix 25 mg tablets twice daily or\n\none 100 mg tablet and two 25 mg tablets twice daily\n\u2265 30 kg 200 mg twice \n\ndaily \neight 25 mg tablets twice daily or\n\ntwo 100 mg tablets twice daily\nor one 200 mg tablet twice daily\n\nMissed dose\n\nIf the patient misses a dose of INTELENCE within 6 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient \nshould take it following a meal as soon as possible and then take the next dose at the regularly \nscheduled time. If a patient misses a dose by more than 6 hours of the time it is usually taken, the \npatient should not take the missed dose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule.\n\nIf a patient vomits within 4 hours of taking the medicine, another dose of INTELENCE should be \ntaken following a meal as soon as possible. If a patient vomits more than 4 hours after taking the \nmedicine, the patient does not need to take another dose until the next regularly scheduled time.\n\nElderly\nThere is limited information regarding the use of INTELENCE in patients > 65 years of age (see \nsection 5.2), therefore caution should be used in this population.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is suggested in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nClass A or B); INTELENCE should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic \n\n\n\n4\n\nimpairment. The pharmacokinetics of etravirine have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Therefore, INTELENCE is not recommended in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population (less than 2 years of age)\nINTELENCE should not be used in children less than 2 years of age. Currently available data for \nchildren between 1 and 2 years old are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 and suggest that the \nbenefits do not outweigh the risks in this age group. No data are available for children less than 1 year \nof age.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nOral use.\nPatients should be instructed to swallow the tablet(s) whole with a liquid such as water. Patients who \nare unable to swallow the tablet(s) whole may disperse the tablet(s) in a glass of water (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nFor instructions on dispersion of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nCo-administration with elbasvir/grazoprevir (see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission \nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines.\n\nINTELENCE should optimally be combined with other antiretrovirals that exhibit activity against the \npatient\u2019s virus (see section 5.1).\n\nA decreased virologic response to etravirine was observed in patients with viral strains harbouring 3 or \nmore among the following mutations V90I, A98G, L100I, K101E/P, V106I, V179D/F, Y181C/I/V, \nand G190A/S (see section 5.1).\n\nConclusions regarding the relevance of particular mutations or mutational patterns are subject to \nchange with additional data, and it is recommended to always consult current interpretation systems \nfor analysing resistance test results.\n\nNo data other than drug-drug interaction data (see section 4.5) are available when etravirine is \ncombined with raltegravir or maraviroc.\n\nSevere cutaneous and hypersensitivity reactions\n\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported with etravirine. In clinical trials, \nStevens-Johnson Syndrome and erythema multiforme have been rarely (< 0.1%) reported. Treatment \nwith INTELENCE should be discontinued if a severe cutaneous reaction develops.\n\nThe clinical data are limited and an increased risk of cutaneous reactions in patients with a history of \nNNRTI-associated cutaneous reactions cannot be excluded. Caution should be observed in such\npatients, especially in case of history of a severe cutaneous drug reaction.\n\n\n\n5\n\nCases of severe hypersensitivity syndromes, including DRESS (Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and\nSystemic Symptoms) and TEN (toxic epidermal necrolysis), sometimes fatal, have been reported with \nthe use of etravirine (see section 4.8). The DRESS syndrome is characterised by rash, fever, \neosinophilia and systemic involvement (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied \nby fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, hepatitis\nand eosinophilia). Time to onset is usually around 3-6 weeks and the outcome in most cases is \nfavourable upon discontinuation and after initiation of corticosteroid therapy.\n\nPatients should be informed to seek medical advice if severe rash or hypersensitivity reactions occur. \nPatients who are diagnosed with a hypersensitivity reaction whilst on therapy must discontinue \nINTELENCE immediately.\n\nDelay in stopping INTELENCE treatment after the onset of severe rash may result in a life-threatening \nreaction.\n\nPatients who have stopped treatment due to hypersensitivity reactions should not restart therapy with \nINTELENCE.\n\nRash\n\nRash has been reported with etravirine. Most frequently, rash was mild to moderate, occurred in the \nsecond week of therapy, and was infrequent after week 4. Rash was mostly self-limiting and generally \nresolved within 1 to 2 weeks on continued therapy. When prescribing INTELENCE to females, \nprescribers should be aware that the incidence of rash was higher in females (see section 4.8).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nFor children who cannot swallow the tablet(s) whole, the tablet(s) may be dispersed in liquid. This \nshould only be considered if the child is likely to take the entire dose of the tablet(s) in liquid (see \nsections 4.2 and 6.6). The importance of consuming the entire dose needs to be highlighted to the child \nand his/her caregiver to avoid too low exposure and lack of virologic response. In case of any doubt \nthat a child will take the entire dose of the tablet(s) dispersed in liquid, treatment with another \nantiretroviral product needs to be considered.\n\nElderly\n\nExperience in geriatric patients is limited: in the Phase III trials, 6 patients aged 65 years or older and \n53 patients aged 56-64 years received etravirine. The type and incidence of adverse reactions in \npatients > 55 years of age were similar to the ones in younger patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nPregnancy\n\nGiven the increased etravirine exposure during pregnancy, caution should be applied for those \npregnant patients that require concomitant medicinal products or have comorbidities that may further \nincrease etravirine exposure.\n\nPatients with coexisting conditions\n\nHepatic impairment\nEtravirine is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver and highly bound to plasma proteins. \nEffects on unbound exposure could be expected (has not been studied) and therefore caution is advised \nin patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Etravirine has not been studied in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) and its use is therefore not recommended in this group of \npatients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\n\n\n6\n\nCo-infection with HBV (hepatitis B virus) or HCV (hepatitis C virus)\nCaution should be exercised in patients co-infected with hepatitis B or C virus due to the current \nlimited data available. A potential increased risk of liver enzymes increase cannot be excluded.\n\nWeight and metabolic parameters\nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.\n\nImmune reconstitution syndrome\n\nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause \nserious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed \nwithin the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus \nretinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. Any \ninflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.\n\nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.8).\n\nOsteonecrosis\n\nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART. \nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint \nstiffness or difficulty in movement.\n\nInteractions with medicinal products\n\nIt is not recommended to combine etravirine with tipranavir/ritonavir, due to a marked \npharmacokinetic interaction (76% decrease of etravirine AUC) that could significantly impair the \nvirologic response to etravirine.\n\nThe combination of etravirine with daclatasvir, atazanavir/cobicistat or darunavir/cobicistat is not \nrecommended (see section 4.5).\n\nFor further information on interactions with medicinal products see section 4.5.\n\nLactose intolerance and lactase deficiency\n\nINTELENCE 25 mg tablets\nEach tablet contains 40 mg of lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of \ngalactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take \nthis medicine.\n\nINTELENCE 100 mg tablets\nEach tablet contains 160 mg of lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of \ngalactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take \nthis medicine.\n\n\n\n7\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nMedicinal products that affect etravirine exposure\n\nEtravirine is metabolised by CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 followed by glucuronidation of the \nmetabolites by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UDPGT). Medicinal products that \ninduce CYP3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 may increase the clearance of etravirine, resulting in lowered \nplasma concentrations of etravirine.\nCo-administration of etravirine and medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 \nmay decrease the clearance of etravirine and may result in increased plasma concentrations of \netravirine.\n\nMedicinal products that are affected by the use of etravirine\n\nEtravirine is a weak inducer of CYP3A4. Co-administration of etravirine with medicinal products \nprimarily metabolised by CYP3A4 may result in decreased plasma concentrations of such medicinal \nproducts, which could decrease or shorten their therapeutic effects.\nEtravirine is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Etravirine is also a weak inhibitor of \nP-glycoprotein. Co-administration with medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP2C9 or \nCYP2C19, or transported by P-glycoprotein, may result in increased plasma concentrations of such \nmedicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect or alter their adverse \nevents profile.\n\nKnown and theoretical interactions with selected antiretrovirals and non-antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts are listed in table 2. The table is not all-inclusive.\n\nInteraction table\n\nInteractions between etravirine and co-administered medicinal products are listed in table 2 (increase \nis indicated as \u201c\u2191\u201d, decrease as \u201c\u2193\u201d, no change as \u201c\u2194\u201d, not done as \u201cND\u201d, confidence interval as \n\u201cCI\u201d).\n\nTable 2: Interactions and dose recommendations with other medicinal products\nMedicinal products by \ntherapeutic areas\n\nEffects on drug levels\nLeast Squares Mean Ratio\n(90% CI; 1.00 = No effect)\n\nRecommendations \nconcerning \nco-administration\n\nANTI-INFECTIVES\nAntiretrovirals\nNRTIs\n\nDidanosine\n400 mg once daily\n\ndidanosine\nAUC \u2194 0.99 (0.79-1.25)\nCmin ND\nCmax \u2194 0.91 (0.58-1.42)\netravirine\nAUC \u2194 1.11 (0.99-1.25)\nCmin \u2194 1.05 (0.93-1.18)\nCmax \u2194 1.16 (1.02-1.32)\n\nNo significant effect on \ndidanosine and etravirine PK \nparameters is seen. \nINTELENCE and didanosine \ncan be used without dose \nadjustments.\n\nTenofovir disoproxil\n245 mg once dailyb\n\ntenofovir\nAUC \u2194 1.15 (1.09-1.21)\nCmin \u2191 1.19 (1.13-1.26)\nCmax \u2191 1.15 (1.04-1.27)\netravirine\nAUC \u2193 0.81 (0.75-0.88)\nCmin \u2193 0.82 (0.73-0.91)\nCmax \u2193 0.81 (0.75-0.88)\n\nNo significant effect on \ntenofovir and etravirine PK \nparameters is seen. \nINTELENCE and tenofovir \ncan be used without dose \nadjustments.\n\nOther NRTIs Not studied, but no interaction expected based \non the primary renal elimination route for other \nNRTIs (e.g., abacavir, emtricitabine, \nlamivudine, stavudine and zidovudine).\n\nINTELENCE can be used \nwith these NRTIs without \ndose adjustment.\n\n\n\n8\n\nNNRTIs\nEfavirenz\nNevirapine\nRilpivirine\n\nCombining two NNRTIs has not been shown to \nbe beneficial.

Studies in animals do not indicate direct or indirect harmful \neffects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development \n(see section 5.3). Based on animal data the malformative risk is unlikely in humans. The clinical data \ndo not raise safety concern but are very limited.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nEtravirine is excreted in human milk.\nAs a general rule, it is recommended that mothers infected by HIV do not breastfeed their babies under \nany circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV.\n\nFertility\n\nNo human data on the effect of etravirine on fertility are available. In rats, there was no effect on \nmating or fertility with etravirine treatment (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nINTELENCE has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. No studies on the effects \nof INTELENCE on the ability to drive or operate machines have been performed. Adverse reactions \nsuch as somnolence and vertigo have been reported in etravirine-treated patients and should be \nconsidered when assessing a patient\u2019s ability to drive or operate machinery (see section 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most frequent (incidence \u2265 10%) adverse reactions of all intensities reported for etravirine were \nrash, diarrhoea, nausea and headache. In the Phase III studies, the rates of discontinuation due to any \nadverse reaction were 7.2% in patients receiving etravirine. The most common adverse reaction\nleading to discontinuation was rash.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions reported in patients treated with etravirine are summarised in Table 3. The adverse \nreactions are listed by system organ class (SOC) and frequency. Within each frequency grouping, \nadverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are defined as very \ncommon (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10) and uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and very rare (< 1/10,000).\n\nTable 3: Adverse reactions observed with etravirine in clinical trials and post-marketing \nexperience\n\nSystem Organ Class \n(SOC)\n\nFrequency \ncategory\n\nAdverse Reaction\n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders\n\ncommon thrombocytopaenia, anaemia, decreased neutrophils\nuncommon decreased white blood cell count\n\n\n\n16\n\nImmune system \ndisorders\n\ncommon drug hypersensitivity\nuncommon immune reconstitution syndrome\n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders\n\ncommon diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia, \nhypercholesterolaemia, increased low density \nlipoprotein (LDL), hypertriglyceridaemia, \nhyperlipidaemia, dyslipidaemia, anorexia\n\nPsychiatric disorders common anxiety, insomnia, sleep disorders\nuncommon confusional state, disorientation, nightmares, \n\nnervousness, abnormal dreams\nNervous system \ndisorders\n\nvery common headache\ncommon peripheral neuropathy, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, \n\namnesia, somnolence \nuncommon convulsion, syncope, tremor, hypersomnia, disturbance \n\nin attention\nEye disorders common blurred vision\nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders\n\nuncommon vertigo\n\nCardiac disorders common myocardial infarction\nuncommon atrial fibrillation, angina pectoris \n\nVascular disorders common hypertension\nrare haemorrhagic strokea\n\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders\n\ncommon exertional dyspnoea\nuncommon bronchospasm\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nvery common diarrhoea, nausea\ncommon gastrooesophageal reflux disease, vomiting, abdominal \n\npain, abdominal distension, flatulence, gastritis, \nconstipation, dry mouth, stomatitis, lipase increased, \nblood amylase increased\n\nuncommon pancreatitis, haematemesis, retching\nHepatobiliary disorders common increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased \n\naspartate aminotransferase (AST)\nuncommon hepatitis, hepatic steatosis, cytolytic hepatitis, \n\nhepatomegaly\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nvery common rash\ncommon night sweats, dry skin, prurigo\nuncommon angioneurotic oedemaa, swelling face, hyperhidrosis \nrare Stevens-Johnson Syndromea, erythema multiformea\n\nvery rare toxic epidermal necrolysisa, DRESSb\n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders\n\ncommon renal failure, blood creatinine increased\n\nReproductive system \nand breast disorders\n\nuncommon gynaecomastia\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions\n\ncommon fatigue\nuncommon sluggishness\n\na\nThese adverse reactions were observed in other clinical trials than DUET-1 and DUET-2.\n\nb\nThese adverse reactions have been identified through postmarketing experience with etravirine.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nRash\nRash was most frequently mild to moderate, generally macular to maculopapular or erythematous, \nmostly occurred in the second week of therapy, and was infrequent after week 4. Rash was mostly \nself-limiting, and generally resolved within 1-2 weeks on continued therapy (see section 4.4). The \nincidence of rash was higher in women compared to men in the etravirine arm in the DUET trials \n\n\n\n17\n\n(rash \u2265 grade 2 was reported in 9/60 [15.0%] women versus 51/539 [9.5%] men; discontinuations due \nto rash were reported in 3/60 [5.0%] women versus 10/539 [1.9%] men) (see section 4.4). There was \nno gender difference in severity or treatment discontinuation due to rash. The clinical data are limited \nand an increased risk of cutaneous reactions in patients with a history of NNRTI-associated cutaneous \nreaction cannot be excluded (see section 4.4).\n\nMetabolic parameters\nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see \nsection 4.4)\n\nImmune reconstitution syndrome\nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).\n\nOsteonecrosis\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy. The \nfrequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).\n\nPaediatric population (1 year to less than 18 years of age)\n\nThe safety assessment in children and adolescents is based on two single-arm trials. PIANO \n(TMC125-C213) is a Phase II trial in which 101 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected \npaediatric patients 6 years to less than 18 years of age received INTELENCE in combination with \nother antiretroviral agents. TMC125-C234/IMPAACT P1090 is a Phase I/II trial in which \n26 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged 1 years to less than \n6 years received INTELENCE in combination with other antiretroviral agents (see section 5.1).\n\nIn PIANO and TMC125-C234/IMPAACT P1090, the frequency, type and severity of adverse \nreactions in paediatric patients were comparable to those observed in adults. In PIANO, rash was \nreported more frequently in female subjects than in male subjects (rash \u2265 grade 2 was reported in \n13/64 [20.3%] females versus 2/37 [5.4%] males; discontinuations due to rash were reported in 4/64 \n[6.3%] females versus 0/37 [0%] males) (see section 4.4). Most often, rash was mild to moderate, of \nmacular/papular type, and occurred in the second week of therapy. Rash was mostly self-limiting and \ngenerally resolved within 1 week on continued therapy.\n\nIn a postmarketing retrospective cohort study aiming at substantiating the long-term safety profile of \netravirine in HIV-1-infected children and adolescents receiving etravirine with other HIV-1 \nantiretrovirals (N = 182), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome was reported at a higher incidence (1%) than has \nbeen reported in adult clinical trials (< 0.1%).\n\nOther special populations\n\nPatients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus\nIn the pooled analysis for DUET-1 and DUET-2, the incidence of hepatic events tended to be higher in \nco-infected subjects treated with etravirine compared to co-infected subjects in the placebo group. \nINTELENCE should be used with caution in these patients (see also sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n18\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere are no data with regard to symptomatic overdose with etravirine, but it is possible that the most \nfrequent adverse reactions of etravirine, i.e. rash, diarrhoea, nausea, and headache would be the most \ncommon symptoms noted. There is no specific antidote for overdose with etravirine. Treatment of \noverdose with INTELENCE consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital \nsigns and observation of the clinical status of the patient. Since etravirine is highly protein bound, \ndialysis is unlikely to result in significant removal of the active substance.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors, ATC code: J05AG04.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nEtravirine is an NNRTI of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Etravirine binds directly to \nreverse transcriptase (RT) and blocks the RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase \nactivities by causing a disruption of the enzyme\u2019s catalytic site.\n\nAntiviral activity in vitro\n\nEtravirine exhibits activity against wild type HIV-1 in T-cell lines and primary cells with median \nEC50 values ranging from 0.9 to 5.5 nM. Etravirine demonstrates activity against HIV-1 group M \n(subtypes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G) and HIV-1 group O primary isolates with EC50 values ranging from \n0.3 to 1.7 nM and from 11.5 to 21.7 nM, respectively. Although etravirine demonstrates in vitro \nactivity against wild type HIV-2 with median EC50 values ranging from 5.7 to 7.2 \u00b5M, treatment of \nHIV-2 infection with etravirine is not recommended in the absence of clinical data. Etravirine retains \nactivity against HIV-1 viral strains resistant to nucleoside reverse transcriptase and/or protease \ninhibitors. In addition, etravirine demonstrates a fold change (FC) in EC50 \u2264 3 against 60% of \n6,171 NNRTI-resistant clinical isolates.\n\nResistance\n\nEtravirine efficacy in relation to NNRTI resistance at baseline has mainly been analysed with \netravirine given in combination with darunavir/ritonavir (DUET-1 and DUET-2). Boosted protease\ninhibitors, like darunavir/ritonavir, show a higher barrier to resistance compared to other classes of \nantiretrovirals. The breakpoints for reduced efficacy with etravirine (> 2 etravirine-associated \nmutations at baseline, see clinical results section) applies when etravirine is given in combination with \na boosted protease inhibitor. This breakpoint might be lower in antiretroviral combination therapy not \nincluding a boosted protease inhibitor.\n\nIn the Phase III trials DUET-1 and DUET-2, mutations that developed most commonly in patients \nwith virologic failure to the etravirine containing regimen were V108I, V179F, V179I, Y181C and \nY181I, which usually emerged in a background of multiple other NNRTI resistance-associated \nmutations (RAMs). In all the other trials conducted with etravirine in HIV-1 infected patients, the \nfollowing mutations emerged most commonly: L100I, E138G, V179F, V179I, Y181C and H221Y.\n\nCross-resistance\n\nFollowing virologic failure of an etravirine-containing regimen it is not recommended to treat patients \nwith efavirenz and/or nevirapine.\n\n\n\n19\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nTreatment-experienced adult patients\nPivotal studies\nThe evidence of efficacy of etravirine is based on 48-week data from 2 Phase III trials DUET-1 and \nDUET-2.

In the TMC125-C227 study, etravirine (N = 59) was administered with \n2 investigator-selected NRTIs (i.e. without a ritonavir-boosted PI) and compared to an \ninvestigator-selected combination of a PI with 2 NRTIs (N = 57). The trial population included \nPI-na\u00efve, NNRTI-experienced patients with evidence of NNRTI resistance.\n\nAt week 12, virologic response was greater in the control-PI arm (-2.2 log10 copies/ml from baseline; \nn = 53) compared to the etravirine arm (-1.4 log10 copies/ml from baseline; n = 40). This difference \nbetween treatment arms was statistically significant.\n\nBased on these trial results, etravirine is not recommended for use in combination with N(t)RTIs only \nin patients who have experienced virological failure on an NNRTI- and N(t)RTI-containing regimen.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nTreatment-experienced paediatric patients (6 years to less than 18 years of age)\nPIANO is a single-arm, Phase II trial evaluating the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and efficacy \nof etravirine in 101 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric patients 6 years to \nless than 18 years of age and weighing at least 16 kg. The study enrolled patients on a stable but \nvirologically failing antiretroviral treatment regimen, with a confirmed HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load \n\u2265 500 copies/ml.

The study enrolled patients on a \nvirologically failing antiretroviral treatment regimen for at least 8 weeks or on a treatment interruption \nof at least 4 weeks with a history of virologic failure while on an antiretroviral regimen, with a \nconfirmed HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load greater than 1,000 copies/ml and with no evidence of \nphenotypic resistance to etravirine at screening.\n\nTable 8 summarizes the virologic response results for the TMC125-C234/IMPAACT P1090 study.\n\nTable 8: Virologic responses (ITT-FDA Snapshot*) at week 48 in the TMC125-C234/IMPAACT \nP1090 Study\n\nCohort I\n\u2265 2 to < 6 years\n\n(N = 20)\n\nCohort II\n\u2265 1 to < 2 years\n\n(N = 6)\nBaseline\n\nPlasma HIV-1 RNA 4.4 log10 copies/ml 4.4 log10 copies/ml\nMedian CD4+ cell count \nMedian baseline CD4+ \npercentage\n\n817.5 x 106 cells/l\n(27.6%)\n\n1,491.5 x 106 cells/l\n(26.9%)\n\n\n\n23\n\nWeek 48\nVirologic Response (plasma \nviral load < 400 HIV-1 RNA \ncopies/ml) \n\n16/20\n(80.0%)\n\n1/6\n(16.7%)\n\nMedian change in plasma \nHIV-1 RNA from baseline to \nWeek 48 \n\n-2.31 log10 copies/ml -0.665 log10 copies/ml\n\nMedian CD4+ change from \nbaseline\n\n298.5 x 106 cells/l\n(5.15%)\n\n0 x 106 cells/l\n(-2.2%)\n\nN = number of subjects per treatment group.\n* Intent-to-treat-FDA Snapshot approach.\n\nSubgroup analyses showed that for subjects aged 2 to less than 6 years virologic response [HIV RNA \n< 400 copies/ml] was 100.0% [6/6] for subjects who swallowed the etravirine tablet whole, 100% \n[4/4] for subjects who took a combination of both etravirine dispersed in liquid and etravirine tablet \nwhole and 60% [6/10] for subjects who took etravirine dispersed in liquid. Of the 4 subjects who did \nnot show virologic response and took etravirine dispersed in liquid, 3 showed virologic failure and had \nadherence issues, and one discontinued prior to Week 48 for safety reasons.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nINTELENCE in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in human immunodeficiency virus \ninfection, as per Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) decision in the granted indication (see section 4.2 \nfor information on paediatric use).\n\nPregnancy and postpartum\n\nEtravirine (200 mg twice daily), evaluated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products \nin a study of 15 pregnant women during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and postpartum, \ndemonstrated that exposure to total etravirine was generally higher during pregnancy compared with \npostpartum, and less so for unbound etravirine exposure (see section 5.2). There were no new \nclinically relevant safety findings in the mothers or in the newborns in this trial.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of etravirine have been evaluated in adult healthy subjects and in adult \nand paediatric treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected patients. Exposure to etravirine was lower \n(35-50%) in HIV-1 infected patients than in healthy subjects.\n\nTable 9: Population pharmacokinetic estimates of etravirine 200 mg twice daily in HIV-1\ninfected adult subjects (integrated data from Phase III trials at week 48)*\n\nParameter Etravirine 200 mg twice daily\nN = 575\n\nAUC12h (ng\u2022h/ml)\nGeometric Mean \u00b1 Standard Deviation 4,522 \u00b1 4,710\nMedian (Range) 4,380 (458 - 59,084)\n\nC0h (ng/ml)\nGeometric Mean \u00b1 Standard Deviation 297 \u00b1 391\nMedian (Range) 298 (2 - 4,852)\n\n* All HIV-1 infected subjects enrolled in Phase III clinical trials received darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily as \npart of their background regimen. Therefore, the pharmacokinetic parameter estimates shown in the table account for \nreductions in the pharmacokinetic parameters of etravirine due to co-administration of etravirine with \ndarunavir/ritonavir.\n\nNote: The median protein binding adjusted EC50 for MT4 cells infected with HIV-1/IIIB in vitro = 4 ng/ml.\n\nAbsorption\n\nAn intravenous formulation of etravirine is unavailable, thus, the absolute bioavailability of etravirine \nis unknown. After oral administration with food, the maximum plasma concentration of etravirine is \ngenerally achieved within 4 hours.\n\n\n\n24\n\nIn healthy subjects, the absorption of etravirine is not affected by co-administration of oral ranitidine \nor omeprazole, medicinal products that are known to increase gastric pH.\n\nEffect of food on absorption\nThe systemic exposure (AUC) to etravirine was decreased by about 50% when etravirine was \nadministered under fasting conditions, as compared to administration following a meal. Therefore, \nINTELENCE should be taken following a meal.\n\nDistribution\n\nEtravirine is approximately 99.9% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin (99.6%) and \u03b11-acid \nglycoprotein (97.66%-99.02%) in vitro. The distribution of etravirine into compartments other than \nplasma (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid, genital tract secretions) has not been evaluated in humans.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nIn vitro experiments with human liver microsomes (HLMs) indicate that etravirine primarily \nundergoes oxidative metabolism by the hepatic cytochrome CYP450 (CYP3A) system and, to a lesser \nextent, by the CYP2C family, followed by glucuronidation.\n\nElimination\n\nAfter administration of a radiolabeled 14C-etravirine dose, 93.7% and 1.2% of the administered dose of \n14C-etravirine could be retrieved in faeces and urine, respectively. Unchanged etravirine accounted for \n81.2% to 86.4% of the administered dose in faeces. Unchanged etravirine in faeces is likely to be \nunabsorbed drug. Unchanged etravirine was not detected in urine. The terminal elimination half-life of \netravirine was approximately 30-40 hours.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPaediatric population (1 year to less than 18 years of age)\nThe pharmacokinetics of etravirine in 122 treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric patients, \n1 year to less than 18 years of age, showed that the administered weight-based dosages resulted in \netravirine exposure comparable to that in adults receiving etravirine 200 mg twice daily (see \nsections 4.2 and 5.2). The population pharmacokinetic estimates for etravirine AUC12h and C0h are \nsummarised in the table below.\n\nTable 10: Pharmacokinetic parameters for etravirine in treatment-experienced HIV-1 \ninfected paediatric patients 1 year to less than 18 years of age (TMC125-\nC234/IMPAACT P1090 [48 week analysis, intensive PK] and PIANO [48 Weeks \nanalysis, population PK])\n\nAge Range (years) \u2265 1 year to < 2 years\n(Cohort II)\n\n\u2265 2 years to < 6 years\n(Cohort I) \n\n6 years to < 18 years\n\nParameter Etravirine\nN = 6\n\nEtravirine\nN = 15\n\nEtravirine\nN = 101\n\nAUC12h (ng\u2022h/ml)\nGeometric \nMean \u00b1 Standard \nDeviation\n\n3,328 \u00b1 3,138 3,824 \u00b1 3,613 3,729 \u00b1 4,305\n\nMedian (Range) 3,390 (1,148 - 9,989) 3,709 (1,221 - 12,999) 4,560 (62 - 28,865)\n\nC0h (ng/ml)\nGeometric \nMean \u00b1 Standard \nDeviation\n\n193 \u00b1 186 203 \u00b1 280 205 \u00b1 342\n\nMedian (Range) 147 (0a - 503) 180 (54 - 908) 287 (2 - 2,276)\na\n\nOne subject in Cohort II had etravirine predose concentrations below the detection limit at the intensive PK visit.\n\n\n\n25\n\nElderly\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis in HIV infected patients showed that etravirine pharmacokinetics \nare not considerably different in the age range (18 to 77 years) evaluated, with 6 subjects aged \n65 years or older (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nGender\nNo significant pharmacokinetic differences have been observed between males and females. A limited \nnumber of females were included in the studies.\n\nRace\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of etravirine in HIV infected patients indicated no apparent \ndifference in the exposure to etravirine between Caucasian, Hispanic and Black subjects. The \npharmacokinetics in other races have not been sufficiently evaluated.\n\nHepatic impairment\nEtravirine is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver. In a study comparing 8 patients with \nmild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment to 8 matched controls and 8 patients with moderate \n(Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment to 8 matched controls, the multiple dose pharmacokinetic \ndisposition of etravirine was not altered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.\nHowever, unbound concentrations have not been assessed. Increased unbound exposure could be\nexpected. No dose adjustment is suggested but caution is advised in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment. INTELENCE has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh Class C) and is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nHepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of the DUET-1 and DUET-2 trials showed reduced clearance \n(potentially leading to increased exposure and alteration of the safety profile) for etravirine in HIV-1 \ninfected patients with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection. In view of the limited data \navailable in hepatitis B and/or C co-infected patients, particular caution should be paid when \nINTELENCE is used in these patients (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nRenal impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of etravirine have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency. Results \nfrom a mass balance study with radioactive 14C-etravirine showed that < 1.2% of the administered \ndose of etravirine is excreted in the urine. No unchanged drug was detected in urine so the impact of \nrenal impairment on etravirine elimination is expected to be minimal. As etravirine is highly bound to \nplasma proteins, it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal \ndialysis (see section 4.2).\n\nPregnancy and postpartum\nStudy TMC114HIV3015 evaluated etravirine 200 mg twice daily in combination with other \nantiretroviral medicinal products in 15 pregnant women during the second and third trimesters of \npregnancy and postpartum. The total etravirine exposure after intake of etravirine 200 mg twice daily\nas part of an antiretroviral regimen was generally higher during pregnancy compared with postpartum \n(see Table 11). The differences were less pronounced for unbound etravirine exposure.\nIn women receiving etravirine 200 mg twice daily, higher mean values for Cmax, AUC12h and Cmin were \nobserved during pregnancy compared to postpartum. During the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy \nmean values of these parameters were comparable.\n\nTable 11: Pharmacokinetic results of total etravirine after administration of etravirine \n200 mg twice daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen, during the 2nd trimester of \npregnancy, the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, and postpartum.\n\nPharmacokinetics of \netravirine\nMean \u00b1 SD (median)\n\nEtravirine 200 mg \ntwice daily\npostpartum\n\nN = 10\n\nEtravirine 200 mg \ntwice daily 2nd\n\ntrimester\nN = 13\n\nEtravirine 200 mg \ntwice daily 3rd\n\ntrimester\nN = 10a\n\nCmin, ng/ml 269 \u00b1 182 (284) 383 \u00b1 210 (346) 349 \u00b1 103 (371)\n\n\n\n26\n\nCmax, ng/ml\nAUC12h, h*ng /ml\n\n569 \u00b1 261 (528)\n5004 \u00b1 2521 (5246)\n\n774 \u00b1 300 (828)\n6617 \u00b1 2766 (6836)\n\n785 \u00b1 238 (694)\n6846 \u00b1 1482 (6028)\n\na\nn = 9 for AUC12h\n\nEach subject served as her own control, and with an intra-individual comparison, the total etravirine\nCmin, Cmax and AUC12h values were 1.2-, 1.4- and 1.4-fold higher, respectively, during the 2\n\nnd trimester \nof pregnancy as compared to postpartum, and 1.1-, 1.4- and 1.2-fold higher, respectively, based during \nthe 3rd trimester of pregnancy as compared to postpartum.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAnimal toxicology studies have been conducted with etravirine in mice, rats, rabbits and dogs. In \nmice, the key target organs identified were the liver and the coagulation system. Haemorrhagic \ncardiomyopathy was only observed in male mice and was considered to be secondary to severe \ncoagulopathy mediated via the vitamin K pathway. In the rat, the key target organs identified were the \nliver, the thyroid and the coagulation system. Exposure in mice was equivalent to human exposure \nwhile in rats it was below the clinical exposure at the recommended dose. In the dog, changes were \nobserved in the liver and gall bladder at exposures approximately 8-fold higher than human exposure \nobserved at the recommended dose (200 mg twice daily).\n\nIn a study conducted in rats, there were no effects on mating or fertility at exposure levels equivalent \nto those in humans at the clinically recommended dose. There was no teratogenicity with etravirine in \nrats and rabbits at exposures equivalent to those observed in humans at the recommended clinical \ndose. Etravirine had no effect on offspring development during lactation or post weaning at maternal \nexposures equivalent to those observed at the recommended clinical dose.\n\nEtravirine was not carcinogenic in rats and in male mice. An increase in the incidences of \nhepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas were observed in female mice. The observed hepatocellular \nfindings in female mice are generally considered to be rodent specific, associated with liver enzyme \ninduction, and of limited relevance to humans. At the highest tested doses, the systemic exposures \n(based on AUC) to etravirine were 0.6-fold (mice) and between 0.2- and 0.7-fold (rats), relative to \nthose observed in humans at the recommended therapeutic dose (200 mg twice daily).\nIn vitro and in vivo studies with etravirine revealed no evidence of a mutagenic potential.\n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n\n\n46\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nINTELENCE 25 mg tablets\netravirine\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them,\n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What INTELENCE is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take INTELENCE\n3. How to take INTELENCE\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store INTELENCE\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What INTELENCE is and what it is used for\n\nINTELENCE contains the active substance etravirine. INTELENCE belongs to a group of anti-HIV \nmedicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).\n\nINTELENCE is a medicine used for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) \ninfection. INTELENCE works by reducing the amount of HIV in your body. This will improve your \nimmune system and reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection.\n\nINTELENCE is used in combination with other anti-HIV medicines to treat adults and children \n2 years of age and older who are infected by HIV and who have used other anti-HIV medicines before.\n\nYour doctor will discuss with you which combination of medicines is best for you.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take INTELENCE\n\nDo not take INTELENCE\n- if you are allergic to etravirine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6)\n- if you are taking elbasvir/grazoprevir (a medicine to treat hepatitis C infection).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking INTELENCE.\n\nINTELENCE is not a cure for HIV infection. It is part of a treatment reducing the amount of virus in \nthe blood. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by \neffective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your physician the precautions needed to avoid infecting \nother people.\n\nElderly\nINTELENCE has only been used in a limited number of patients of 65 years or older. If you belong to \nthis age group, please discuss the use of INTELENCE with your doctor.\n\n\n\n47\n\nWeight and increased blood lipids and glucose\nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.\n\nBone problems\nSome patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe \nimmunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for \ndeveloping this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the \nhip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor.\n\nTell your doctor about your situation\nMake sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.\n- Tell your doctor if you develop a rash. If a rash occurs, it usually appears soon after anti-HIV \n\ntreatment with INTELENCE is started and often disappears within 1 to 2 weeks, even with \ncontinued use of the medicine. Rarely, during INTELENCE treatment, you can experience \nsevere skin rash with blisters or peeling skin, particularly around the mouth or eyes or \nhypersensitivity reaction (allergic reaction including rash and fever but also swelling of the face,\ntongue or throat, difficulty in breathing or swallowing) which could be potentially \nlife-threatening. Please contact your doctor immediately if you experience these symptoms. \nYour doctor will advise you how to deal with your symptoms and whether INTELENCE must\nbe stopped. If you have stopped treatment due to a hypersensitivity reaction, you should not \nrestart therapy with INTELENCE.\n\n- Tell your doctor if you have or have had problems with your liver, including hepatitis B and/or \nC. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can take \nINTELENCE.\n\n- Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infections. In some patients with \nadvanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of \ninflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is \nbelieved that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body\u2019s immune response,\nenabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms.\n\n- In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \nfor the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after \nthe start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as \nmuscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of \nthe body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek \nnecessary treatment.\n\nChildren and adolescents\n\nDo not give this medicine to children less than 2 years of age and weighing less than 10 kg because the \npotential benefits and risks have not been established.\n\nOther medicines and INTELENCE\nINTELENCE might interact with other medicines. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, \nhave recently taken, or might take any other medicines.\n\nIn most cases, INTELENCE can be combined with anti-HIV medicines belonging to another class.\nHowever, some combinations are not recommended. In other cases, increased monitoring and/or a \nchange in the dose of the medicine may be needed. Therefore, always tell your doctor which other \nanti-HIV medicines you take. Furthermore, it is important that you carefully read the package leaflets \nthat are provided with these medicines. Follow your doctor\u2019s instruction carefully on which medicines \ncan be combined.\n\n\n\n48\n\nIt is not recommended to combine INTELENCE with any of the following medicines:\n- tipranavir/ritonavir, efavirenz, nevirapine, rilpivirine, indinavir, atazanavir/cobicistat, \n\ndarunavir/cobicistat (anti-HIV medicine)\n- carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (medicines to prevent seizures)\n- rifampicin, because it is contraindicated with boosted protease inhibitors, and rifapentine \n\n(medicines to treat some infections such as tuberculosis)\n- products that contain St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal product used for \n\ndepression)\n- daclatasvir (a medicine to treat hepatitis C infection).\n\nIf you are taking any of these, ask your doctor for advice.\n\nThe effects of INTELENCE or other medicines might be influenced if you take INTELENCE \ntogether with any of the following medicines. The dosages of some medicines might need to be \nchanged since their therapeutic effect or side effects may be influenced when combined with \nINTELENCE. Tell your doctor if you take:\n- dolutegravir, maraviroc, amprevanir/ritonavir and fosamprenavir/ritonavir (anti-HIV medicine)\n- amiodarone, bepridil, digoxin, disopyramide, flecainide, lidocaine, mexiletine, propafenone and \n\nquinidine (medicines to treat certain heart disorders, e.g., abnormal heart beat)\n- warfarin (a medicine used to reduce clotting of the blood). Your doctor will have to check your\n\nblood\n- fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole (medicines to treat fungal\n\ninfections)\n- clarithromycin, rifabutin (antibiotics)\n- artemether/lumefantrine (a medicine to treat malaria)\n- diazepam (medicines to treat trouble with sleeping and/or anxiety)\n- dexamethasone (a corticosteroid used in a variety of conditions such as inflammation and \n\nallergic reactions)\n- atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin (cholesterol-lowering medicines)\n- cyclosporine, sirolimus, tacrolimus (immunosuppressants \u2013 medicines used to dampen down \n\nyour immune system)\n- sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil (medicines to treat erectile dysfunction and/or pulmonary arterial\n\nhypertension)\n- clopidogrel (a medicine to prevent blood clots).\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nTell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant.

What you need to know before you take INTELENCE\n3. How to take INTELENCE\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store INTELENCE\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What INTELENCE is and what it is used for\n\nINTELENCE contains the active substance etravirine. INTELENCE belongs to a group of anti-HIV \nmedicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).\n\nINTELENCE is a medicine used for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) \ninfection. INTELENCE works by reducing the amount of HIV in your body. This will improve your \nimmune system and reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection.\n\nINTELENCE is used in combination with other anti-HIV medicines to treat adults and children \n2 years of age and older who are infected by HIV and who have used other anti-HIV medicines before.\n\nYour doctor will discuss with you which combination of medicines is best for you.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take INTELENCE\n\nDo not take INTELENCE\n- if you are allergic to etravirine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6)\n- if you are taking elbasvir/grazoprevir (a medicine to treat hepatitis C infection).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking INTELENCE.\n\nINTELENCE is not a cure for HIV infection. It is part of a treatment reducing the amount of virus in \nthe blood. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by \neffective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your physician the precautions needed to avoid infecting \nother people.\n\nElderly\nINTELENCE has only been used in a limited number of patients of 65 years or older. If you belong to \nthis age group, please discuss the use of INTELENCE with your doctor.\n\n\n\n55\n\nWeight and increased blood lipids and glucose\nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.\n\nBone problems\nSome patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe \nimmunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for \ndeveloping this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the \nhip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor.\n\nTell your doctor about your situation\nMake sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.\n- Tell your doctor if you develop a rash. If a rash occurs, it usually appears soon after anti-HIV \n\ntreatment with INTELENCE is started and often disappears within 1 to 2 weeks, even with \ncontinued use of the medicine. Rarely, during INTELENCE treatment, you can experience \nsevere skin rash with blisters or peeling skin, particularly around the mouth or eyes or \nhypersensitivity reaction (allergic reaction including rash and fever but also swelling of the face, \ntongue or throat, difficulty in breathing or swallowing) which could be potentially \nlife-threatening. Please contact your doctor immediately if you experience these symptoms. \nYour doctor will advise you how to deal with your symptoms and whether INTELENCE must \nbe stopped. If you have stopped treatment due to a hypersensitivity reaction, you should not \nrestart therapy with INTELENCE.\n\n- Tell your doctor if you have or have had problems with your liver, including hepatitis B and/or \nC. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can take \nINTELENCE.\n\n- Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infections. In some patients with \nadvanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of \ninflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is \nbelieved that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body\u2019s immune response, \nenabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms.\n\n- In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \nfor the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after \nthe start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as \nmuscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of \nthe body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek \nnecessary treatment.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nDo not give this medicine to children less than 2 years of age and weighing less than 10 kg because the \npotential benefits and risks have not been established.\n\nOther medicines and INTELENCE\nINTELENCE might interact with other medicines. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking,\nhave recently taken, or might take any other medicines.\n\nIn most cases, INTELENCE can be combined with anti-HIV medicines belonging to another class.\nHowever, some combinations are not recommended. In other cases, increased monitoring and/or a \nchange in the dose of the medicine may be needed. Therefore, always tell your doctor which other \nanti-HIV medicines you take. Furthermore, it is important that you carefully read the package leaflets \nthat are provided with these medicines. Follow your doctor\u2019s instruction carefully on which medicines \ncan be combined.\n\n\n\n56\n\nIt is not recommended to combine INTELENCE with any of the following medicines:\n- tipranavir/ritonavir, efavirenz, nevirapine, rilpivirine, indinavir, atazanavir/cobicistat, \n\ndarunavir/cobicistat (anti-HIV medicine)\n- carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (medicines to prevent seizures)\n- rifampicin, because it is contraindicated with boosted protease inhibitors, and rifapentine \n\n(medicines to treat some infections such as tuberculosis)\n- products that contain St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal product used for \n\ndepression)\n- daclatasvir (a medicine to treat hepatitis C infection).\n\nIf you are taking any of these, ask your doctor for advice.\n\nThe effects of INTELENCE or other medicines might be influenced if you take INTELENCE \ntogether with any of the following medicines. The dosages of some medicines might need to be \nchanged since their therapeutic effect or side effects may be influenced when combined with \nINTELENCE. Tell your doctor if you take:\n- dolutegravir, maraviroc, amprevanir/ritonavir and fosamprenavir/ritonavir (anti-HIV medicine)\n- amiodarone, bepridil, digoxin, disopyramide, flecainide, lidocaine, mexiletine, propafenone and \n\nquinidine (medicines to treat certain heart disorders, e.g., abnormal heart beat)\n- warfarin (a medicine used to reduce clotting of the blood). Your doctor will have to check your \n\nblood\n- fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole (medicines to treat fungal \n\ninfections)\n- clarithromycin, rifabutin (antibiotics)\n- artemether/lumefantrine (a medicine to treat malaria)\n- diazepam (medicines to treat trouble with sleeping and/or anxiety)\n- dexamethasone (a corticosteroid used in a variety of conditions such as inflammation and \n\nallergic reactions)\n- atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin (cholesterol-lowering medicines)\n- cyclosporine, sirolimus, tacrolimus (immunosuppressants \u2013 medicines used to dampen down \n\nyour immune system)\n- sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil (medicines to treat erectile dysfunction and/or pulmonary arterial\n\nhypertension)\n- clopidogrel (a medicine to prevent blood clots).\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nTell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant. Pregnant women should not take INTELENCE \nunless specifically directed by the doctor.\nHIV infected mothers must not breast-feed, as there is a possibility of infecting the baby with HIV.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not drive or operate machines if you feel sleepy or dizzy after taking your medicines.\n\nINTELENCE contains lactose\nINTELENCE tablets contain lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \nintolerance to some sugars (lactose), contact your doctor before taking this medicine.\n\nINTELENCE contains sodium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium \nfree\u2019.\n\n3.

What you need to know before you take INTELENCE\n3. How to take INTELENCE\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store INTELENCE\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What INTELENCE is and what it is used for\n\nINTELENCE contains the active substance etravirine. INTELENCE belongs to a group of anti-HIV \nmedicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).\n\nINTELENCE is a medicine used for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) \ninfection. INTELENCE works by reducing the amount of HIV in your body. This will improve your \nimmune system and reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection.\n\nINTELENCE is used in combination with other anti-HIV medicines to treat adults and children \n2 years of age and older who are infected by HIV and who have used other anti-HIV medicines before.\n\nYour doctor will discuss with you which combination of medicines is best for you.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take INTELENCE\n\nDo not take INTELENCE\n- if you are allergic to etravirine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6)\n- if you are taking elbasvir/grazoprevir (a medicine to treat hepatitis C infection).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking INTELENCE.\n\nINTELENCE is not a cure for HIV infection. It is part of a treatment reducing the amount of virus in \nthe blood. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by \neffective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your physician the precautions needed to avoid infecting \nother people.\n\nElderly\nINTELENCE has only been used in a limited number of patients of 65 years or older. If you belong to \nthis age group, please discuss the use of INTELENCE with your doctor.\n\n\n\n63\n\nWeight and increased blood lipids and glucose\nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.\n\nBone problems\nSome patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe \nimmunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for \ndeveloping this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the \nhip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor.\n\nTell your doctor about your situation\nMake sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.\n- Tell your doctor if you develop a rash. If a rash occurs, it usually appears soon after anti-HIV \n\ntreatment with INTELENCE is started and often disappears within 1 to 2 weeks, even with \ncontinued use of the medicine. Rarely, during INTELENCE treatment, you can experience \nsevere skin rash with blisters or peeling skin, particularly around the mouth or eyes or\nhypersensitivity reaction (allergic reaction including rash and fever but also swelling of the face, \ntongue or throat, difficulty in breathing or swallowing) which could be potentially \nlife-threatening. Please contact your doctor immediately if you experience these symptoms. \nYour doctor will advise you how to deal with your symptoms and whether INTELENCE must \nbe stopped. If you have stopped treatment due to a hypersensitivity reaction, you should not \nrestart therapy with INTELENCE.\n\n- Tell your doctor if you have or have had problems with your liver, including hepatitis B and/or \nC. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can take \nINTELENCE.\n\n- Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infections. In some patients with \nadvanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of \ninflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is \nbelieved that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body\u2019s immune response, \nenabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms.\n\n- In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \nfor the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after \nthe start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as \nmuscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of \nthe body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek \nnecessary treatment.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nDo not give this medicine to children less than 2 years of age and weighing less than 10 kg because the \npotential benefits and risks have not been established.\n\nOther medicines and INTELENCE\nINTELENCE might interact with other medicines. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking,\nhave recently taken, or might take any other medicines.\n\nIn most cases, INTELENCE can be combined with anti-HIV medicines belonging to another class.\nHowever, some combinations are not recommended. In other cases, increased monitoring and/or a \nchange in the dose of the medicine may be needed. Therefore, always tell your doctor which other \nanti-HIV medicines you take. Furthermore, it is important that you carefully read the package leaflets \nthat are provided with these medicines. Follow your doctor\u2019s instruction carefully on which medicines \ncan be combined.\n\n\n\n64\n\nIt is not recommended to combine INTELENCE with any of the following medicines:\n- tipranavir/ritonavir, efavirenz, nevirapine, rilpivirine, indinavir, atazanavir/cobicistat, \n\ndarunavir/cobicistat (anti-HIV medicine)\n- carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (medicines to prevent seizures)\n- rifampicin, because it is contraindicated with boosted protease inhibitors, and rifapentine \n\n(medicines to treat some infections such as tuberculosis)\n- products that contain St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal product used for \n\ndepression)\n- daclatasvir (a medicine to treat hepatitis C infection).\n\nIf you are taking any of these, ask your doctor for advice.\n\nThe effects of INTELENCE or other medicines might be influenced if you take INTELENCE \ntogether with any of the following medicines. The dosages of some medicines might need to be \nchanged since their therapeutic effect or side effects may be influenced when combined with \nINTELENCE. Tell your doctor if you take:\n- dolutegravir, maraviroc, amprevanir/ritonavir and fosamprenavir/ritonavir (anti-HIV medicine)\n- amiodarone, bepridil, digoxin, disopyramide, flecainide, lidocaine, mexiletine, propafenone and \n\nquinidine (medicines to treat certain heart disorders, e.g., abnormal heart beat)\n- warfarin (a medicine used to reduce clotting of the blood). Your doctor will have to check your \n\nblood\n- fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole (medicines to treat fungal \n\ninfections)\n- clarithromycin, rifabutin (antibiotics)\n- artemether/lumefantrine (a medicine to treat malaria)\n- diazepam (medicines to treat trouble with sleeping and/or anxiety)\n- dexamethasone (a corticosteroid used in a variety of conditions such as inflammation and \n\nallergic reactions)\n- atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin (cholesterol-lowering medicines)\n- cyclosporine, sirolimus, tacrolimus (immunosuppressants \u2013 medicines used to dampen down \n\nyour immune system)\n- sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil (medicines to treat erectile dysfunction and/or pulmonary arterial \n\nhypertension)\n- clopidogrel (a medicine to prevent blood clots).\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nTell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant. Pregnant women should not take INTELENCE \nunless specifically directed by the doctor.\nHIV infected mothers must not breast-feed, as there is a possibility of infecting the baby with HIV.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not drive or operate machines if you feel sleepy or dizzy after taking your medicines.\n\nINTELENCE contains sodium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium \nfree\u2019.\n\n3. How to take INTELENCE\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.\n\nUse in adults\nThe recommended dose of INTELENCE is one tablet twice a day.\nIn the morning, take one 200 milligram INTELENCE tablet, following a meal.\nIn the evening, take one 200 milligram INTELENCE tablet, following a meal.\n\n\n\n65\n\nUse in children and adolescents 2 years of age and older and weighing at least 10 kg\nThe doctor will work out the right dose based on the weight of the child.\nThe doctor will inform you exactly how much INTELENCE the child should take.\n\nInstructions for taking INTELENCE for all patients\nIt is important that you take INTELENCE following a meal. If you take INTELENCE on an empty \nstomach, only half the amount of INTELENCE is absorbed. Follow your doctor\u2019s advice on the type \nof meal you should be taking with INTELENCE.\n\nSwallow the INTELENCE tablet(s) whole with a glass of water. Do not chew the tablet(s).\n\nIf you are unable to swallow the INTELENCE tablet(s) whole, you may do the following:\n- place the tablet(s) in 5 ml (1 teaspoon) of water, or at least enough liquid to cover the \n\nmedicine,\n- stir well for about 1 minute until the water looks milky,\n- if desired, add up to 30 ml (2 tablespoons) more of water or alternatively orange juice or \n\nmilk (do not place the tablets directly in orange juice or milk),\n- drink it immediately,\n- rinse the glass several times with water, orange juice, or milk and completely swallow the \n\nrinse each time to make sure you take the entire dose.\n\nIf you mix INTELENCE tablet(s) with a liquid, take this first, before other liquid anti-HIV medicines \nthat you need to take at the same time.\n\nContact your doctor if you are not able to swallow the entire dose when mixed with a liquid.\n\nIf your child needs to take INTELENCE tablet(s) mixed with a liquid, it is very important that he/she\ntakes the entire dose so that the right amount of medicine enters into the body. If the full dose is not\ntaken, the risk of the virus developing resistance is higher. Contact your doctor if your child is not able \nto swallow the entire dose when mixed with a liquid, as they may consider giving another medicine to \ntreat your child.\n\nDo not use warm (40\u00b0C and above) or carbonated beverages when taking INTELENCE tablet(s).\n\nRemoving the child resistant cap\n\nThe plastic bottle comes with a child resistant cap and should be opened as \nfollows:\n- Push the plastic screw cap down while turning it counter clockwise.\n- Remove the unscrewed cap.\n\nIf you take more INTELENCE than you should\nContact your doctor or pharmacist immediately. The most frequent side effects of INTELENCE are \nrash, diarrhoea, nausea, and headache (see section \u20184. Possible side effects\u2019).\n\nIf you forget to take INTELENCE\nIf you notice within 6 hours of the time you usually take INTELENCE, you must take the tablet as \nsoon as possible. Always take the tablet following a meal. Then take the next dose as usual. If you \nnotice after 6 hours, then skip the intake and take the next doses as usual. Do not take a double dose \nto make up for a forgotten dose.\n\nIf you vomit less than 4 hours after taking INTELENCE, take another dose following a meal. If you \nvomit more than 4 hours after taking INTELENCE, then you do not need to take another dose until \nyour regularly scheduled dose.\n\n\n\n66\n\nContact your doctor if you are uncertain about what to do if you miss a dose or vomit.\n\nDo not stop taking INTELENCE without talking to your doctor first\nHIV therapy may increase your sense of well-being. Even if you feel better, do not stop taking \nINTELENCE or your other anti-HIV medicines. Doing so could increase the risk of the virus \ndeveloping resistance. Talk to your doctor first.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4.

know before you take intelence", "Section_Content": "do not take intelence - if you are allergic to etravirine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) - if you are taking elbasvir/grazoprevir (a medicine to treat hepatitis c infection). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking intelence. intelence is not a cure for hiv infection. it is part of a treatment reducing the amount of virus in the blood. you can still pass on hiv when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. discuss with your physician the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people. elderly intelence has only been used in a limited number of patients of 65 years or older. if you belong to this age group, please discuss the use of intelence with your doctor. weight and increased blood lipids and glucose during hiv therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. this is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the hiv medicines themselves. your doctor will test for these changes. bone problems some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). the length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. if you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor. tell your doctor about your situation make sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you. - tell your doctor if you develop a rash. if a rash occurs, it usually appears soon after anti-hiv treatment with intelence is started and often disappears within 1 to 2 weeks, even with continued use of the medicine. rarely, during intelence treatment, you can experience severe skin rash with blisters or peeling skin, particularly around the mouth or eyes or hypersensitivity reaction (allergic reaction including rash and fever but also swelling of the face, tongue or throat, difficulty in breathing or swallowing) which could be potentially life-threatening. please contact your doctor immediately if you experience these symptoms. your doctor will advise you how to deal with your symptoms and whether intelence must be stopped. if you have stopped treatment due to a hypersensitivity reaction, you should not restart therapy with intelence. - tell your doctor if you have or have had problems with your liver, including hepatitis b and/or c. your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can take intelence. - tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infections. in some patients with advanced hiv infection and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-hiv treatment is started. it is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. - in addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your hiv infection. autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. if you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. children and adolescents do not give this medicine to children less than 2 years of age and weighing less than 10 kg because the potential benefits and risks have not been established. other medicines and intelence intelence might interact with other medicines. tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. in most cases, intelence can be combined with anti-hiv medicines belonging to another class. however, some combinations are not recommended. in other cases, increased monitoring and/or a change in the dose of the medicine may be needed. therefore, always tell your doctor which other anti-hiv medicines you take. furthermore, it is important that you carefully read the package
