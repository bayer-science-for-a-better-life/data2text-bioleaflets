This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.  \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nXerava 50 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 50 mg eravacycline.  \n \nAfter reconstitution each mL contains 10 mg eravacycline. \nAfter further dilution 1 mL contains 0.3 mg eravacycline. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion (powder for concentrate). \n \nPale yellow to dark yellow cake. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nXerava is indicated for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) in adults (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose regimen is 1 mg/kg eravacycline every 12 hours for 4 to 14 days.  \n \nStrong CYP3A4 inducers \nIn patients co-administered strong CYP3A4 inducers the recommended dose regimen is 1.5 mg/kg \neravacycline every 12 hours for 4 to 14 days (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nElderly (≥ 65 years old) \nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment or in patients undergoing \nhaemodialysis. Eravacycline may be administered without regard to the timing of haemodialysis (see \nsection 5.2).  \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Xerava in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age have not been \nestablished. No data are available. Xerava should not be used in children aged under 8 years because \nof teeth discolouration (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nIntravenous use. \n \nXerava is administered only by intravenous infusion over approximately 1 hour (see section 4.4). \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nHypersensitivity to tetracycline class antibiotics. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAnaphylactic reactions \n \nSerious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity reactions are possible and have been reported with \nother tetracycline class antibiotics (see section 4.3). In case of hypersensitivity reactions, treatment \nwith eravacycline must be discontinued immediately and appropriate emergency measures must be \ninitiated. \n \nClostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea \n \nAntibiotic-associated colitis and pseudomembranous colitis have been reported with the use of nearly \nall antibiotics and may range in severity from mild to life-threatening. It is important to consider this \ndiagnosis in patients who present with diarrhoea during or subsequent to treatment with eravacycline \n(see section 4.8). In such circumstances, the discontinuation of eravacycline and the use of supportive \nmeasures together with the administration of specific treatment for Clostridium difficile should be \nconsidered. Medicinal products that inhibit peristalsis should not be given. \n \nInfusion-site reactions \n \nEravacycline is administered via intravenous infusion, using an infusion time of approximately 1 hour \nto minimise the risk of infusion-site reactions. Infusion-site erythema, pain/tenderness, phlebitis and \nthrombophlebitis were observed with intravenous eravacycline in clinical trials (see section 4.8). In \ncase of serious reactions, eravacycline should be discontinued until a new intravenous access site is \nestablished. Additional measures to reduce the occurrence and severity of infusion site reactions \ninclude decreasing the eravacycline infusion rate and/or concentration. \n \nNon-susceptible micro-organisms \n \nProlonged use may result in the overgrowth of non-susceptible micro-organisms, including fungi. If \nsuperinfection occurs during therapy, it may require interruption of treatment. Other appropriate \nmeasures should be taken and alternative antimicrobial treatment should be considered in accordance \nwith existing therapeutic guidelines. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPancreatitis \n \nPancreatitis has been reported with eravacycline and other tetracycline class antibiotics, and has been \nsevere in some cases (see section 4.8). If pancreatitis is suspected, eravacycline should be \ndiscontinued. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nXerava should not be used during tooth development (during the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy, \nand in children under 8 years of age) as it may cause permanent discolouration of the teeth (yellow-\ngrey-brown) (see sections 4.2 and 4.6). \n \nConcomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers  \n \nMedicines that induce CYP3A4 are expected to increase the rate and extent of metabolism of \neravacycline. CYP3A4 inducers exert their effect in a time-dependent manner, and may take at least 2 \nweeks to reach maximal effect after introduction. Conversely, on discontinuation, CYP3A4 induction \nmay take at least 2 weeks to decline. Co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer (such as \nphenobarbital, rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s Wort) is expected to reduce the effect \nof eravacycline (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n \nPatients with severe hepatic impairment \n \nExposure may be increased in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). \nTherefore, such patients should be monitored for adverse reactions (see Section 4.8), particularly if \nthese patients are obese and/or are also being treated with strong CYP3A inhibitors where the \nexposure may be further increased (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). In these cases, no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. \n \nLimitations of the clinical data \n \nIn clinical trials in cIAI, there were no immunocompromised patients, and the majority of patients \n(80%) had APACHE II scores <10 at baseline; 5.4% of the patients had concurrent bacteraemia at \nbaseline; 34% of the patients had complicated appendicitis. \n \nUrinary tract infections  \n \nClinical trials have failed to demonstrate the efficacy of Xerava for the treatment of complicated \nurinary tract infections. Xerava is therefore not indicated for the treatment of complicated urinary tract \ninfections. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPotential for other medicinal products to affect the pharmacokinetics of eravacycline \n \nConcomitant administration of the strong CYP 3A4/3A5 inducer rifampicin altered the \npharmacokinetics of eravacycline, decreasing exposure by approximately 32% and increasing clearance \nby approximately 54%. The eravacycline dose should be increased by approximately 50% (1.5 mg/kg \nIV q12h) when co-administered with rifampicin or other strong CYP3A inducers such as phenobarbital, \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin and St. John’s Wort (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nConcomitant administration of the strong CYP3A inhibitor itraconazole altered the pharmacokinetics of \neravacycline, increasing Cmax by approximately 5% and AUC0-24 by approximately 23%, and decreasing \nclearance. The increased exposure is not likely to be clinically significant; thus, no dose adjustment is \nrequired when eravacycline is co-administered with CYP3A inhibitors. However, patients receiving \nstrong CYP3A inhibitors (for example ritonavir, itraconazole, clarithromycin) with a combination of \n\n\n\n5 \n\nfactors that may increase the exposure, such as severe hepatic impairment and/or obesity should be \nmonitored for adverse reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nIn vitro, eravacycline was shown to be a substrate for the transporters P-gp, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. \nA drug-drug interaction in vivo cannot be excluded and co-administration of eravacycline and other \nmedicinal products that inhibit these transporters (examples of OATP1B1/3 inhibitors; atazanavir, \ncyclosporine, lopinavir, and saquinavir) may increase the eravacycline plasma concentration.   \n \nPotential for eravacycline to affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products \n \nIn vitro, eravacycline and its metabolites are not inhibitors or inducers of CYP enzymes or transport \nproteins (see section 5.2). Interactions with medicinal products that are substrates for these enzymes or \ntransporters are therefore unlikely.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are limited data on the use of eravacycline in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.  \n \nAs for other tetracycline class antibiotics, eravacycline may induce permanent dental defects \n(discolouration and enamel defects) and a delay in ossification processes in foetuses exposed in utero \nduring the 2nd and 3rd trimester, due to accumulation in tissues with a high calcium turnover and \nformation of calcium chelate complexes (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). Xerava should not be used during \npregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with eravacycline. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant while receiving eravacycline. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether eravacycline and its metabolites are excreted in human breast milk. Animal \nstudies have shown excretion of eravacycline and its metabolites in breast milk (see section 5.3).  \n \nLong term use of other tetracyclines during breast-feeding may result in significant absorption by the \nbreast-fed infant and is not recommended because of the risk of dental discolouration and delay in \nossification processes of the breast-fed infant. \n \nA decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with \nXerava should be made, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child, and the benefit \nof therapy for the woman.  \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no human data on the effect of eravacycline on fertility. Eravacycline did affect mating and \nfertility in male rats at clinically relevant exposures (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nEravacycline may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness may \noccur following administration of eravacycline (see section 4.8).  \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions in patients with cIAI treated with eravacycline \n(n=576) were nausea (3.0%), vomiting, infusion site phlebitis (each 1.9%), phlebitis (1.4%), infusion \nsite thrombosis (0.9%), diarrhoea (0.7%), vessel puncture site erythema (0.5%), hyperhidrosis, \nthrombophlebitis, infusion site hypoaesthesia, and headache (each 0.3%), which were generally mild \nor moderate in severity.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions identified with eravacycline are presented in Table 1. Adverse reactions are \nclassified according to MedDRA system organ classification and frequency. Frequency categories are \nderived according to the following conventions: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000). Within each \nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1  Tabulated list of adverse reactions to eravacycline in clinical trials \n\nSystem Organ Class Common Uncommon \n\nHepatobiliary disorders  \nAspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased \nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased \nHyperbilirubinaemia \n\nImmune system disorders  Hypersensitivity \n\nNervous system disorders  Dizziness Headache \n\nVascular disorders Thrombophlebitis\na \n\nPhlebitisb \n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  Nausea Vomiting \nPancreatitis \nDiarrhoea \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n Rash \nHyperhidrosis \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions Infusion site reactions\n\nc  \n\na. Thrombophlebitis includes the preferred terms thrombophlebitis and infusion site thrombosis  \nb. Phlebitis includes the preferred terms phlebitis, infusion site phlebitis, superficial phlebitis and injection \n\nsite phlebitis \nc. Infusion site reactions includes the preferred terms injection site erythema, infusion site hypoaesthesia, \n\nvessel puncture site erythema and vessel puncture site pain \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfusion site reactions \nMild to moderate infusion site reactions, including pain or discomfort, erythema and swelling or \ninflammation at the injection site as well as superficial thrombophlebitis and/or phlebitis have been \nreported in patients treated with eravacycline. Infusion site reactions can be mitigated by reducing the \neravacycline infusion concentration or the infusion rate. \n \nTetracycline class effects \nTetracycline class adverse reactions include photosensitivity, pseudotumor cerebri, and anti-anabolic \naction which have led to increased BUN, azotaemia, acidosis, and hyperphosphataemia. \n \nDiarrhoea \nAntibiotic class adverse reactions include pseudomembranous colitis, and overgrowth of non-\nsusceptible organisms, including fungi (see section 4.4). In clinical trials, treatment-related diarrhoea \noccurred in 0.7% of patients; all cases were mild in severity. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn studies administering up to 3 mg/kg eravacycline to healthy volunteers it has been observed that doses \nhigher than the recommended dose lead to a higher rate of nausea and vomiting.  \nIn the case of suspected overdose Xerava should be discontinued and the patient monitored for adverse \nreactions.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, tetracyclines, ATC code: J01AA13. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe mechanism of action of eravacycline involves the disruption of bacterial protein synthesis by \nbinding to the 30S ribosomal subunit thus preventing the incorporation of amino acid residues into \nelongating peptide chains.  \n \nThe C-7 and C-9 substitutions in eravacycline are not present in any naturally occurring or semisynthetic \ntetracyclines and the substitution pattern imparts microbiological activities including retention of in vitro \npotency against Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains expressing tetracycline-specific resistance \nmechanism(s) (i.e., efflux mediated by tet(A), tet(B), and tet(K); ribosomal protection as encoded by \ntet(M) and tet(Q)). Eravacycline is not a substrate for the MepA pump in Staphylococcus aureus that has \nbeen described as a resistance mechanism for tigecycline. Eravacycline is also not affected by \naminoglycoside inactivating or modifying enzymes. \n \nMechanism of resistance \n \nResistance to eravacycline has been observed in Enterococcus harbouring mutations in rpsJ. There is \nno target-based cross-resistance between eravacycline and other classes of antibiotics such as \nquinolones, penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. \n \nOther bacterial resistance mechanisms that could potentially affect eravacycline are associated with \nupregulated, non-specific intrinsic multidrug-resistant (MDR) efflux. \n \nSusceptibility testing breakpoints \n \nMinimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints established by the European Committee on \nAntimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) for eravacycline are: \n \n\nPathogen MIC Breakpoints (µg/mL) Susceptible (S ≤) Resistant (R >) \nEscherichia coli 0.5 0.5 \nStaphylococcus aureus  0.25 0.25 \nEnterococcus spp.  0.125 0.125 \nViridans Streptococcus spp. 0.125 0.125 \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \n \nThe area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) divided by the minimum inhibitory \nconcentration (MIC) of eravacycline has been shown to be the best predictor of efficacy in vitro, \nutilising human steady state exposures in a chemostat and confirmed in vivo in animal models of \ninfection.  \n \nClinical efficacy against specific pathogens \n \nEfficacy has been demonstrated in clinical studies against the pathogens listed for cIAI that were \nsusceptible to eravacycline in vitro: \n \n• Escherichia coli \n• Klebsiella pneumoniae \n• Staphylococcus aureus  \n• Enterococcus faecalis  \n• Enterococcus faecium  \n• Viridans Streptococcus spp. \n \nAntibacterial activity against other relevant pathogens \n \nIn vitro data indicate that the following pathogen is not susceptible to eravacycline: \n• Pseudomonas aeruginosa \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXerava in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in cIAI (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption  \n \nEravacycline is administered intravenously and therefore has 100% bioavailability. \n \nThe mean pharmacokinetic parameters of eravacycline after single and multiple intravenous infusions \n(60 minutes) of 1 mg/ kg administered to healthy adults every 12 hours are presented in Table 2. \n \nTable 2 Mean (%CV) plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of eravacycline after single and  \n\nmultiple intravenous and in healthy adults \n\nEravacycline dosing \n\n PK parameters \narithmetic mean (%CV) \n\nCmax \n(ng/mL) \n\ntmaxa \n(h) \n\nAUC0-12b \n(ng*h/mL) \n\nt1/2 \n(h) \n\n1.0 mg/kg IV every 12 hours (n=6) Day 1 2125 (15) 1.0 (1.0-1.0) 4305 (14) 9 (21) Day 10 1825 (16) 1.0 (1.0-1.0) 6309 (15) 39 (32) \na Mean (range) represented \nb AUC of Day 1 = AUC 0-12 after the first dose and AUC for Day 10 = steady state AUC0- 12 \n \nDistribution \n \nThe in vitro binding of eravacycline to human plasma proteins increases with increasing \nconcentrations, with 79%, 86% and 90% (bound) at 0.1, 1 and10 µg/mL, respectively. The mean \n(%CV) volume of distribution at steady-state in healthy normal volunteers following 1 mg/kg every \n12h is approximately 321 L (6.35), which is greater than total body water. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nBiotransformation \n \nUnchanged eravacycline is the major medicinal product-related component in human plasma and \nhuman urine. Eravacycline is metabolised primarily by CYP3A4- and FMO-mediated oxidation of the \npyrrolidine ring to TP-6208, and by chemical epimerisation at C-4 to TP-498. Additional minor \nmetabolites are formed by glucuronidation, oxidation and hydrolysis. TP-6208 and TP-498 are not \nconsidered to be pharmacologically active. \n \nEravacycline is a substrate for the transporters P-gp, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 but not for BCRP.  \n \nElimination \n \nEravacycline is excreted in both urine and faeces. Renal clearance and biliary and direct intestinal \nexcretion account for approximately 35% and 48% of total body clearance after administration of a \nsingle IV dose of 60 mg 14C-eravacycline, respectively. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nThe Cmax and AUC of eravacycline in healthy adults increase approximately in proportion to an \nincrease in dose. There is approximately a 45% accumulation following intravenous dosing of 1 mg/kg \nevery 12 hours. \n \nWithin the range of eravacycline multiple intravenous doses studied clinically, the pharmacokinetic \nparameters AUC and Cmax demonstrate linearity, but with increasing doses the increase in both AUC \nand Cmax are slightly less than dose-proportional. \n \nPotential for drug-drug interactions \n \nEravacycline and its metabolites are not inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, \nCYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 in vitro. Eravacycline, TP-498 and TP-6208 are not inducers of \nCYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4. \n \nEravacycline, TP-498 and TP-6208 are not inhibitors of BCRP, BSEP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, \nOAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 or MATE2-K transporters. The metabolites TP-498 and TP-6208 are \nnot inhibitors of P-gp in vitro. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nThe geometric least square mean Cmax for eravacycline was increased by 8.8% for subjects with end \nstage renal disease (ESRD) versus healthy subjects with 90% CI -19.4, 45.2. The geometric least \nsquare mean AUC0-inf for eravacycline was decreased by 4.0% for subjects with ESRD versus healthy \nsubjects with 90% CI -14.0, 12.3.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe geometric mean Cmax for eravacycline was increased by 13.9%, 16.3%, and 19.7% for subjects \nwith mild (Child-Pugh Class A), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B), and severe (Child-Pugh Class C) \nhepatic impairment versus healthy subjects, respectively. The geometric mean AUC0-inf for \neravacycline was increased by 22.9%, 37.9%, and 110.3% for subjects with mild, moderate, and \nsevere hepatic impairment versus healthy subjects, respectively.  \n \nGender \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of eravacycline, no clinically relevant differences in AUC by \ngender were observed for eravacycline.  \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nElderly (≥ 65 years) \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of eravacycline, no clinically relevant differences in the \npharmacokinetics of eravacycline were observed with respect to age.  \n \nBody weight \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis it was shown that eravacycline disposition (clearance and \nvolume) was dependent on body weight. However, the resulting difference in exposure to eravacycline \nin terms of AUC does not warrant dose adjustments in the weight range studied. No data are available \nfor patients weighing more than 137 kg. The potential influence of severe obesity on eravacycline \nexposure has not been studied. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn repeated dose toxicity studies in rats, dogs and monkeys, lymphoid depletion/atrophy of lymph \nnodes, spleen and thymus, decreased erythrocytes, reticulocytes, leukocytes, and platelets (dog and \nmonkey), in association with bone marrow hypocellularity, and adverse gastrointestinal effects (dog \nand monkey) were observed with eravacycline. These findings were reversible or partially reversible \nduring recovery periods of 3- to 7-weeks.  \n \nBone discolouration (in the absence of histological findings), which was not fully reversible over \nrecovery periods of up to 7-weeks, was observed in rats and monkeys after 13 weeks of dosing. \n \nIntravenous administration of high doses of eravacycline has been associated with cutaneous responses \n(including hives, scratching, swelling, and/or skin erythema) in rat and dog studies. \n \nIn fertility studies in male rats, eravacycline administered at about 5 times the clinical exposure (based \non AUC), gave rise to a significantly reduced number of pregnancies. These findings were reversible \nfollowing a 70-day (10-week) recovery period, equivalent to a spermatogenic cycle in the rat. Findings \non the male reproductive organs were also observed in rats in the repeated dose toxicity studies for 14 \ndays or 13 weeks at exposures more than 10- or 5-fold the clinical exposure based on AUC. The \nobservations included degeneration of the seminiferous tubules, oligospermia, and cellular debris in \nthe epididymides, spermatid retention in the seminiferous tubules, increase of spermatid head retention \nin Sertoli cells, and vacuolation of Sertoli cells and decreased sperm counts. No adverse effects on \nmating or fertility were observed in female rats. \n \nIn embryo-foetal studies, no adverse effects were observed in rats at exposures comparable to clinical \nexposure or in rabbits at exposures 1.9-fold higher than the clinical exposure (based on AUC) in rats \nand rabbits respectively. Doses more than 2- or 4-fold higher than the clinical exposure (based on \nAUC) were associated with maternal toxicity (clinical observations and reduced body weight gain and \nfood consumption), and reduced foetal body weights and delays in skeletal ossification in both species \nand abortion in the rabbit. \n \nAnimal studies indicate that eravacycline crosses the placenta and is found in foetal plasma. \nEravacycline (and metabolites) is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n \nEravacycline is not genotoxic. Carcinogenicity studies with eravacycline have not been conducted. \n \nEnvironmental risk assessment studies have shown that Xerava may pose a risk for the aquatic \ncompartment.  \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n26 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nXerava 50 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \neravacycline  \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Xerava is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you are given Xerava  \n3. How you will be given Xerava \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Xerava \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Xerava is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Xerava is \n \nXerava is an antibiotic medicine that contains the active substance eravacycline. It belongs to a group \nof antibiotics called ‘tetracyclines’ which work by stopping the growth of certain infectious bacteria.  \n \nWhat Xerava is used for \n \nXerava is used to treat adults with a complicated infection in the abdomen.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Xerava  \n \nYou must not receive Xerava:  \n \n- if you are allergic to eravacycline or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).  \n- if you are allergic to any tetracycline antibiotics (e.g., minocycline and doxycycline) because \n\nyou may also be allergic to eravacycline.  \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you receive Xerava if you are concerned about any of the \nfollowing: \n \nAnaphylactic reactions \nAnaphylactic (allergic) reactions have been reported with other tetracycline antibiotics. These can \ndevelop suddenly and can potentially be life-threatening. Seek urgent medical attention if you \nsuspect you have an anaphylactic reaction whilst receiving Xerava. Symptoms to look out for include \n\n\n\n27 \n\nrash, swelling of the face, feeling lightheaded or faint, tightness of the chest, breathing difficulties, fast \nheartbeat, or losing consciousness (see also section 4).  \n \nDiarrhoea \nTalk to your doctor or nurse if you are suffering from diarrhoea before being given Xerava. If you \ndevelop diarrhoea during or after your treatment, tell your doctor straight away. Do not take any \nmedicine to treat your diarrhoea without first checking with your doctor (see also section 4). \n \nInfusion site reactions \nXerava is given by an infusion (drip) directly into your vein. Tell your doctor or nurse if you notice \nany of the following at the site of infusion during or after your treatment: redness of the skin, rash, \ninflammation, or pain or tenderness.  \n \nNew infection \nAlthough antibiotics including Xerava fight certain bacteria, other bacteria and fungi may continue to \ngrow. This is called ‘overgrowth’ or ‘superinfection’.

If the same intravenous line is used for \nsequential infusion of different medicinal products, the line should be flushed before and after infusion \nwith sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. \n \nThe dose should be calculated based on the patient’s weight; 1 mg/kg body weight. \n \nInstructions for reconstitution \n \nAseptic technique must be followed when preparing the infusion solution. Each vial should be \nreconstituted with 5 mL water for injections, and swirled gently until the powder has dissolved \nentirely. Shaking or rapid movement should be avoided as it may cause foaming.  \n \nReconstituted Xerava should be a clear, pale yellow to orange solution. The solution should not be \nused if particles are present or the solution is cloudy. \n \nPreparation of the infusion solution \n \nFor administration, the reconstituted solution must be further diluted using sodium chloride 9 mg/ml \n(0.9%) solution for injection. The calculated volume of the reconstituted solution should be added to \nthe infusion bag to a target concentration of 0.3 mg/mL, within a range of 0.2 to 0.6 mg/mL. See \nexample calculations in Table 1. \n \nGently invert the bag to mix the solution. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nTable 1 Example calculations for weights ranging from 40 kg to 200 kg \n \nPatient weight  \n(kg) \n\nTotal Dose \n(mg) \n\nNumber of vials \nto reconstitute \n\nTotal volume to be \ndiluted (mL) \n\nRecommended infusion \nbag size \n\n40 40 1 4 100 mL \n60 60 2 6 250 mL \n80 80 2 8 250 mL \n100 100 2 10 250 mL \n150 150 3 15 500 mL \n200 200 4 20 500 mL \n1 The exact dose needs to be calculated based on the specific patient weight. \n  \nFor patients weighing ≥ 40 kg – 49 kg: \nCalculate the required volume of the reconstituted solution based on the patient’s weight and inject into a 100 \nmL infusion bag. \nFor patients weighing 50 kg – 100 kg: \nCalculate the required volume of the reconstituted solution based on the patient’s weight and inject into a 250 \nmL infusion bag. \nFor patients weighing >100 kg: \nCalculate the required volume of the reconstituted solution based on the patient’s weight and inject into a 500 \nmL infusion bag. \n \nInfusion \n \nThe infusion solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to administration. \nReconstituted and diluted solutions containing visible particles or that are cloudy in appearance should \nbe discarded.  \n \nFollowing dilution, Xerava is administered intravenously over approximately 1 hour. The \nrecommended dose regimen of Xerava is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours for 4 to 14 days. \n \nThe reconstituted and diluted solution must be administered as an intravenous infusion only.
