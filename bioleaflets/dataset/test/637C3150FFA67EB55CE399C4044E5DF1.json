After reconstitution \neach ml contains 10 mg of infliximab.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion (powder for concentrate).\n\nThe powder is a freeze-dried white pellet.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nRheumatoid arthritis\nRemicade, in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for the reduction of signs and symptoms as \nwell as the improvement in physical function in:\n\uf0b7 adult patients with active disease when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs \n\n(DMARDs), including methotrexate, has been inadequate.\n\uf0b7 adult patients with severe, active and progressive disease not previously treated with \n\nmethotrexate or other DMARDs.\nIn these patient populations, a reduction in the rate of the progression of joint damage, as measured by \nX-ray, has been demonstrated (see section 5.1).\n\nAdult Crohn\u2019s disease\nRemicade is indicated for:\n\uf0b7 treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease, in adult patients who have not \n\nresponded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an \nimmunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such \ntherapies.\n\n\uf0b7 treatment of fistulising, active Crohn\u2019s disease, in adult patients who have not responded \ndespite a full and adequate course of therapy with conventional treatment (including antibiotics, \ndrainage and immunosuppressive therapy).\n\nPaediatric Crohn\u2019s disease\nRemicade is indicated for treatment of severe, active Crohn\u2019s disease, in children and adolescents \naged 6 to 17 years, who have not responded to conventional therapy including a corticosteroid, an \nimmunomodulator and primary nutrition therapy; or who are intolerant to or have contraindications \nfor such therapies. Remicade has been studied only in combination with conventional \nimmunosuppressive therapy.\n\nUlcerative colitis\nRemicade is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients \nwho have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and \n\n\n\n3\n\n6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical \ncontraindications for such therapies.\n\nPaediatric ulcerative colitis\nRemicade is indicated for treatment of severely active ulcerative colitis, in children and adolescents\naged 6 to 17 years, who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including \ncorticosteroids and 6-MP or AZA, or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such \ntherapies.\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis\nRemicade is indicated for treatment of severe, active ankylosing spondylitis, in adult patients who \nhave responded inadequately to conventional therapy.\n\nPsoriatic arthritis\nRemicade is indicated for treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adult patients when \nthe response to previous DMARD therapy has been inadequate.\nRemicade should be administered\n\uf0b7 in combination with methotrexate\n\uf0b7 or alone in patients who show intolerance to methotrexate or for whom methotrexate is \n\ncontraindicated\nRemicade has been shown to improve physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to \nreduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients with \npolyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease (see section 5.1).\n\nPsoriasis\nRemicade is indicated for treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who failed \nto respond to, or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy including \nciclosporin, methotrexate or PUVA (see section 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nRemicade treatment is to be initiated and supervised by qualified physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, ankylosing spondylitis, \npsoriatic arthritis or psoriasis. Remicade should be administered intravenously. Remicade infusions \nshould be administered by qualified healthcare professionals trained to detect any infusion-related \nissues. Patients treated with Remicade should be given the package leaflet and the patient reminder \ncard.\n\nDuring Remicade treatment, other concomitant therapies, e.g., corticosteroids and \nimmunosuppressants should be optimised.\n\nPosology\nAdults (\u2265 18 years)\nRheumatoid arthritis\n3 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 3 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and \n6 weeks after the first infusion, then every 8 weeks thereafter.\n\nRemicade must be given concomitantly with methotrexate.\n\nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. If a \npatient has an inadequate response or loses response after this period, consideration may be given to \nincrease the dose step-wise by approximately 1.5 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 7.5 mg/kg every \n8 weeks. Alternatively, administration of 3 mg/kg as often as every 4 weeks may be considered. If \nadequate response is achieved, patients should be continued on the selected dose or dose frequency. \nContinued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in patients who show no evidence of therapeutic \nbenefit within the first 12 weeks of treatment or after dose adjustment.\n\n\n\n4\n\nModerately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease\n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by an additional 5 mg/kg infusion 2 weeks after \nthe first infusion. If a patient does not respond after 2 doses, no additional treatment with infliximab \nshould be given. Available data do not support further infliximab treatment, in patients not responding \nwithin 6 weeks of the initial infusion.\n\nIn responding patients, the alternative strategies for continued treatment are:\n\uf0b7 Maintenance: Additional infusion of 5 mg/kg at 6 weeks after the initial dose, followed by \n\ninfusions every 8 weeks or\n\uf0b7 Re-administration: Infusion of 5 mg/kg if signs and symptoms of the disease recur (see \n\n\u2018Re-administration\u2019 below and section 4.4).\n\nAlthough comparative data are lacking, limited data in patients who initially responded to 5 mg/kg but \nwho lost response indicate that some patients may regain response with dose escalation (see \nsection 5.1). Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in patients who show no evidence of \ntherapeutic benefit after dose adjustment.\n\nFistulising, active Crohn\u2019s disease\n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusions at 2 and 6 weeks \nafter the first infusion. If a patient does not respond after 3 doses, no additional treatment with \ninfliximab should be given.\n\nIn responding patients, the alternative strategies for continued treatment are:\n\uf0b7 Maintenance: Additional infusions of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks or\n\uf0b7 Re-administration: Infusion of 5 mg/kg if signs and symptoms of the disease recur followed by \n\ninfusions of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks (see \u2018Re-administration\u2019 below and section 4.4).\n\nAlthough comparative data are lacking, limited data in patients who initially responded to 5 mg/kg but \nwho lost response indicate that some patients may regain response with dose escalation (see \nsection 5.1). Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in patients who show no evidence of \ntherapeutic benefit after dose adjustment.\n\nIn Crohn\u2019s disease, experience with re-administration if signs and symptoms of disease recur is \nlimited and comparative data on the benefit/risk of the alternative strategies for continued treatment \nare lacking.\n\nUlcerative colitis\n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and \n6 weeks after the first infusion, then every 8 weeks thereafter.\n\nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 14 weeks of treatment, i.e. \nthree doses. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in patients who show no evidence of \ntherapeutic benefit within this time period.\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis\n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and \n6 weeks after the first infusion, then every 6 to 8 weeks. If a patient does not respond by 6 weeks (i.e. \nafter 2 doses), no additional treatment with infliximab should be given.\n\nPsoriatic arthritis\n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and \n6 weeks after the first infusion, then every 8 weeks thereafter.\n\n\n\n5\n\nPsoriasis\n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and \n6 weeks after the first infusion, then every 8 weeks thereafter. If a patient shows no response after \n14 weeks (i.e. after 4 doses), no additional treatment with infliximab should be given.\n\nRe-administration for Crohn\u2019s disease and rheumatoid arthritis\nIf the signs and symptoms of disease recur, Remicade can be re-administered within 16 weeks \nfollowing the last infusion. In clinical studies, delayed hypersensitivity reactions have been \nuncommon and have occurred after Remicade-free intervals of less than 1 year (see sections 4.4 and \n4.8). The safety and efficacy of re-administration after a Remicade-free interval of more than \n16 weeks has not been established. This applies to both Crohn\u2019s disease patients and rheumatoid \narthritis patients.\n\nRe-administration for ulcerative colitis\nThe safety and efficacy of re-administration, other than every 8 weeks, has not been established (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nRe-administration for ankylosing spondylitis\nThe safety and efficacy of re-administration, other than every 6 to 8 weeks, has not been established \n(see sections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nRe-administration for psoriatic arthritis\nThe safety and efficacy of re-administration, other than every 8 weeks, has not been established (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nRe-administration for psoriasis\nLimited experience from re-treatment with one single Remicade dose in psoriasis after an interval of \n20 weeks suggests reduced efficacy and a higher incidence of mild to moderate infusion reactions \nwhen compared to the initial induction regimen (see section 5.1).\n\nLimited experience from re-treatment following disease flare by a re-induction regimen suggests a \nhigher incidence of infusion reactions, including serious ones, when compared to 8-weekly \nmaintenance treatment (see section 4.8).\n\nRe-administration across indications\nIn case maintenance therapy is interrupted, and there is a need to restart treatment, use of a \nre-induction regimen is not recommended (see section 4.8). In this situation, Remicade should be \nre-initiated as a single dose followed by the maintenance dose recommendations described above.\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly\nSpecific studies of Remicade in elderly patients have not been conducted. No major age-related \ndifferences in clearance or volume of distribution were observed in clinical studies. No dose \nadjustment is required (see section 5.2). For more information about the safety of Remicade in elderly \npatients (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nRenal and/or hepatic impairment\nRemicade has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made \n(see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nCrohn\u2019s disease (6 to 17 years)\n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and \n6 weeks after the first infusion, then every 8 weeks thereafter. Available data do not support further \ninfliximab treatment in children and adolescents not responding within the first 10 weeks of treatment \n(see section 5.1).\n\n\n\n6\n\nSome patients may require a shorter dosing interval to maintain clinical benefit, while for others a \nlonger dosing interval may be sufficient. Patients who have had their dose interval shortened to less \nthan 8 weeks may be at greater risk for adverse reactions. Continued therapy with a shortened interval \nshould be carefully considered in those patients who show no evidence of additional therapeutic \nbenefit after a change in dosing interval.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Remicade have not been studied in children with Crohn\u2019s disease below the \nage of 6 years. Currently available pharmacokinetic data are described in section 5.2 but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made in children younger than 6 years.\n\nUlcerative colitis (6 to 17 years)\n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and \n6 weeks after the first infusion, then every 8 weeks thereafter. Available data do not support further\ninfliximab treatment in paediatric patients not responding within the first 8 weeks of treatment (see \nsection 5.1).\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Remicade have not been studied in children with ulcerative colitis below \nthe age of 6 years. Currently available pharmacokinetic data are described in section 5.2 but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made in children younger than 6 years.\n\nPsoriasis\nThe safety and efficacy of Remicade in children and adolescents younger than 18 years for the \nindication of psoriasis have not been established. Currently available data are described in section 5.2 \nbut no recommendation on a posology can be made.\n\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis\nThe safety and efficacy of Remicade in children and adolescents younger than 18 years for the \nindications of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis have not been \nestablished. Currently available data are described in section 5.2 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made.\n\nJuvenile rheumatoid arthritis\nThe safety and efficacy of Remicade in children and adolescents younger than 18 years for the \nindication of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis have not been established. Currently available data are\ndescribed in sections 4.8 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made.\n\nMethod of administration\nRemicade should be administered intravenously over a 2 hour period. All patients administered \nRemicade are to be observed for at least 1-2 hours post-infusion for acute infusion-related reactions. \nEmergency equipment, such as adrenaline, antihistamines, corticosteroids and an artificial airway \nmust be available. Patients may be pre-treated with e.g., an antihistamine, hydrocortisone and/or \nparacetamol and infusion rate may be slowed in order to decrease the risk of infusion-related reactions \nespecially if infusion-related reactions have occurred previously (see section 4.4).\n\nShortened infusions across adult indications\nIn carefully selected adult patients who have tolerated at least 3 initial 2-hour infusions of Remicade \n(induction phase) and are receiving maintenance therapy, consideration may be given to administering \nsubsequent infusions over a period of not less than 1 hour. If an infusion reaction occurs in \nassociation with a shortened infusion, a slower infusion rate may be considered for future infusions if \ntreatment is to be continued. Shortened infusions at doses > 6 mg/kg have not been studied (see \nsection 4.8).\n\nFor preparation and administration instructions, see section 6.6.\n\n\n\n7\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to other murine proteins, or to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1.\n\nPatients with tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, abscesses, and opportunistic \ninfections (see section 4.4).\n\nPatients with moderate or severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nInfusion reactions and hypersensitivity\nInfliximab has been associated with acute infusion-related reactions, including anaphylactic shock, \nand delayed hypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.8).\n\nAcute infusion reactions including anaphylactic reactions may develop during (within seconds) or \nwithin a few hours following infusion. If acute infusion reactions occur, the infusion must be \ninterrupted immediately. Emergency equipment, such as adrenaline, antihistamines, corticosteroids \nand an artificial airway must be available. Patients may be pre-treated with e.g., an antihistamine, \nhydrocortisone and/or paracetamol to prevent mild and transient effects.\nAntibodies to infliximab may develop and have been associated with an increased frequency of \ninfusion reactions. A low proportion of the infusion reactions was serious allergic reactions. An \nassociation between development of antibodies to infliximab and reduced duration of response has \nalso been observed. Concomitant administration of immunomodulators has been associated with \nlower incidence of antibodies to infliximab and a reduction in the frequency of infusion reactions. The \neffect of concomitant immunomodulator therapy was more profound in episodically-treated patients \nthan in patients given maintenance therapy. Patients who discontinue immunosuppressants prior to or \nduring Remicade treatment are at greater risk of developing these antibodies. Antibodies to infliximab \ncannot always be detected in serum samples. If serious reactions occur, symptomatic treatment must \nbe given and further Remicade infusions must not be administered (see section 4.8).\n\nIn clinical studies, delayed hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Available data suggest an \nincreased risk for delayed hypersensitivity with increasing Remicade-free interval. Patients should be \nadvised to seek immediate medical advice if they experience any delayed adverse reaction (see\nsection 4.8). If patients are re-treated after a prolonged period, they must be closely monitored for \nsigns and symptoms of delayed hypersensitivity.\n\nInfections\nPatients must be monitored closely for infections including tuberculosis before, during and after \ntreatment with Remicade. Because the elimination of infliximab may take up to six months, \nmonitoring should be continued throughout this period. Further treatment with Remicade must not be \ngiven if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis.\n\nCaution should be exercised when considering the use of Remicade in patients with chronic infection \nor a history of recurrent infections, including concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. Patients \nshould be advised of and avoid exposure to potential risk factors for infection as appropriate.\n\nTumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\uf061) mediates inflammation and modulates cellular immune \nresponses. Experimental data show that TNF\uf061 is essential for the clearing of intracellular infections. \n\n\n\n8\n\nClinical experience shows that host defence against infection is compromised in some patients treated \nwith infliximab.\n\nIt should be noted that suppression of TNF\uf061 may mask symptoms of infection such as fever. Early \nrecognition of atypical clinical presentations of serious infections and of typical clinical presentation \nof rare and unusual infections is critical in order to minimise delays in diagnosis and treatment.\n\nPatients taking TNF-blockers are more susceptible to serious infections.\nTuberculosis, bacterial infections, including sepsis and pneumonia, invasive fungal, viral, and other \nopportunistic infections have been observed in patients treated with infliximab. Some of these \ninfections have been fatal; the most frequently reported opportunistic infections with a mortality rate \nof > 5% include pneumocystosis, candidiasis, listeriosis and aspergillosis.\nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Remicade, should be \nmonitored closely and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of Remicade should \nbe discontinued if a patient develops a new serious infection or sepsis, and appropriate antimicrobial \nor antifungal therapy should be initiated until the infection is controlled.\n\nTuberculosis\nThere have been reports of active tuberculosis in patients receiving Remicade. It should be noted that \nin the majority of these reports tuberculosis was extrapulmonary, presenting as either local or \ndisseminated disease.\n\nBefore starting treatment with Remicade, all patients must be evaluated for both active and inactive \n(\u2018latent\u2019) tuberculosis. This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with personal history \nof tuberculosis or possible previous contact with tuberculosis and previous and/or current \nimmunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests (e.g. tuberculin skin test, chest X-ray, and/or \nInterferon Gamma Release Assay), should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may \napply). It is recommended that the conduct of these tests should be recorded in the patient\u2019s reminder \ncard. Prescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in \npatients who are severely ill or immunocompromised.\n\nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Remicade therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3).\n\nIf latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should \nbe consulted. In all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of Remicade therapy should be\nvery carefully considered.\n\nIf inactive (\u2018latent\u2019) tuberculosis is diagnosed, treatment for latent tuberculosis must be started with \nantituberculosis therapy before the initiation of Remicade, and in accordance with local \nrecommendations.\n\nIn patients who have several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis and have a negative test for \nlatent tuberculosis, antituberculosis therapy should be considered before the initiation of Remicade.\n\nUse of antituberculosis therapy should also be considered before the initiation of Remicade in patients \nwith a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be \nconfirmed.\nSome cases of active tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with Remicade during and \nafter treatment for latent tuberculosis.\nAll patients should be informed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis\n(e.g. persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low-grade fever) appear during or after Remicade \ntreatment.\n\nInvasive fungal infections\nIn patients treated with Remicade, an invasive fungal infection such as aspergillosis, candidiasis, \npneumocystosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis should be suspected if they \n\n\n\n9\n\ndevelop a serious systemic illness, and a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of \ninvasive fungal infections should be consulted at an early stage when investigating these patients. \nInvasive fungal infections may present as disseminated rather than localised disease, and antigen and \nantibody testing may be negative in some patients with active infection. Appropriate empiric \nantifungal therapy should be considered while a diagnostic workup is being performed taking into \naccount both the risk for severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy.\n\nFor patients who have resided in or travelled to regions where invasive fungal infections such as \nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis are endemic, the benefits and risks of Remicade \ntreatment should be carefully considered before initiation of Remicade therapy.\n\nFistulising Crohn\u2019s disease\nPatients with fistulising Crohn\u2019s disease with acute suppurative fistulas must not initiate Remicade \ntherapy until a source for possible infection, specifically abscess, has been excluded (see section 4.3).\n\nHepatitis B (HBV) reactivation\nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including infliximab, \nwho are chronic carriers of this virus. Some cases have had fatal outcome.\n\nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Remicade. For patients \nwho test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of \nhepatitis B is recommended. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with Remicade should be closely \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months \nfollowing termination of therapy. Adequate data of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with \nantiviral therapy in conjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not \navailable. In patients who develop HBV reactivation, Remicade should be stopped and effective \nantiviral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated.\n\nHepatobiliary events\nCases of jaundice and non-infectious hepatitis, some with features of autoimmune hepatitis, have been \nobserved in the post-marketing experience of Remicade. Isolated cases of liver failure resulting in \nliver transplantation or death have occurred. Patients with symptoms or signs of liver dysfunction \nshould be evaluated for evidence of liver injury. If jaundice and/or ALT elevations \u2265 5 times the \nupper limit of normal develop(s), Remicade should be discontinued, and a thorough investigation of \nthe abnormality should be undertaken.\n\nConcurrent administration of TNF-alpha inhibitor and anakinra\nSerious infections and neutropenia were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and \nanother TNF\uf061-blocking agent, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept \nalone. Because of the nature of the adverse reactions seen with combination of etanercept and \nanakinra therapy, similar toxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other \nTNF\uf061-blocking agents. Therefore, the combination of Remicade and anakinra is not recommended.\n\nConcurrent administration of TNF-alpha inhibitor and abatacept\nIn clinical studies concurrent administration of TNF-antagonists and abatacept has been associated \nwith an increased risk of infections including serious infections compared to TNF-antagonists alone, \nwithout increased clinical benefit. The combination of Remicade and abatacept is not recommended.\n\nConcurrent administration with other biological therapeutics\nThere is insufficient information regarding the concomitant use of infliximab with other biological \ntherapeutics used to treat the same conditions as infliximab. The concomitant use of infliximab with \nthese biologics is not recommended because of the possibility of an increased risk of infection, and \nother potential pharmacological interactions.\n\n\n\n10\n\nSwitching between biological DMARDS\nCare should be taken and patients should continue to be monitored when switching from one biologic \nto another, since overlapping biological activity may further increase the risk for adverse reactions, \nincluding infection.\n\nVaccinations\nIt is recommended that patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all vaccinations in agreement \nwith current vaccination guidelines prior to initiating Remicade therapy. Patients on infliximab may \nreceive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines (see sections 4.5 and 4.6).\n\nIn a subset of 90 adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis from the ASPIRE study a similar proportion \nof patients in each treatment group (methotrexate plus: placebo [n = 17], 3 mg/kg [n = 27] or 6 mg/kg \nRemicade [n = 46]) mounted an effective two-fold increase in titers to a polyvalent pneumococcal \nvaccine, indicating that Remicade did not interfere with T-cell independent humoral immune \nresponses. However, studies from the published literature in various indications (e.g. rheumatoid \narthritis, psoriasis, Crohn\u2019s disease) suggest that non-live vaccinations received during treatment with \nanti-TNF therapies, including Remicade, may elicit a lower immune response than in patients not \nreceiving anti-TNF therapy.\n\nLive vaccines/therapeutic infectious agents\nIn patients receiving anti-TNF therapy, limited data are available on the response to vaccination with \nlive vaccines or on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines. Use of live vaccines can \nresult in clinical infections, including disseminated infections. The concurrent administration of live \nvaccines with Remicade is not recommended.\n\nIn infants exposed in utero to infliximab, fatal outcome due to disseminated Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin \n(BCG) infection has been reported following administration of BCG vaccine after birth. At least a six \nmonth waiting period following birth is recommended before the administration of live vaccines to \ninfants exposed in utero to infliximab (see section 4.6).\n\nOther uses of therapeutic infectious agents such as live attenuated bacteria (e.g., BCG bladder \ninstillation for the treatment of cancer) could result in clinical infections, including disseminated \ninfections. It is recommended that therapeutic infectious agents not be given concurrently with \nRemicade.\n\nAutoimmune processes\nThe relative deficiency of TNF\uf061 caused by anti-TNF therapy may result in the initiation of an \nautoimmune process. If a patient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following \ntreatment with Remicade and is positive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further \ntreatment with Remicade must not be given (see section 4.8).\n\nNeurological events\nUse of TNF-blocking agents, including infliximab, has been associated with cases of new onset or \nexacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system \ndemyelinating disorders, including multiple sclerosis, and peripheral demyelinating disorders, \nincluding Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. In patients with pre-existing or recent onset of demyelinating \ndisorders, the benefits and risks of anti-TNF treatment should be carefully considered before initiation \nof Remicade therapy. Discontinuation of Remicade should be considered if these disorders develop.\n\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders\nIn the controlled portions of clinical studies of TNF-blocking agents, more cases of malignancies \nincluding lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF blocker compared with \ncontrol patients. During clinical studies of Remicade across all approved indications the incidence of \nlymphoma in Remicade-treated patients was higher than expected in the general population, but the \noccurrence of lymphoma was rare. In the post-marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been \nreported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for \n\n\n\n11\n\nlymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, \ninflammatory disease, which complicates risk estimation.\n\nIn an exploratory clinical study evaluating the use of Remicade in patients with moderate to severe \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies were reported in \nRemicade-treated patients compared with control patients. All patients had a history of heavy \nsmoking. Caution should be exercised in considering treatment of patients with increased risk for \nmalignancy due to heavy smoking.\n\nWith the current knowledge, a risk for the development of lymphomas or other malignancies in \npatients treated with a TNF-blocking agent cannot be excluded (see section 4.8). Caution should be \nexercised when considering TNF-blocking therapy for patients with a history of malignancy or when \nconsidering continuing treatment in patients who develop a malignancy.\n\nCaution should also be exercised in patients with psoriasis and a medical history of extensive \nimmunosuppressant therapy or prolonged PUVA treatment.\n\nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-blocking agents (initiation of therapy \u2264 18 years of age), including \nRemicade in the post-marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other \ncases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually \nassociated with immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in patients treated \nwith TNF-blockers cannot be excluded.\n\nPost-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) have been reported in patients \ntreated with TNF-blocking agents including infliximab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very \naggressive disease course and is usually fatal. Almost all patients had received treatment with AZA or \n6-MP concomitantly with or immediately prior to a TNF-blocker. The vast majority of Remicade \ncases have occurred in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis and most were reported in \nadolescent or young adult males. The potential risk with the combination of AZA or 6-MP and \nRemicade should be carefully considered. A risk for the development for hepatosplenic T-cell \nlymphoma in patients treated with Remicade cannot be excluded (see section 4.8).\n\nMelanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma have been reported in patients treated with TNF blocker \ntherapy, including Remicade (see section 4.8). Periodic skin examination is recommended, \nparticularly for patients with risk factors for skin cancer.\n\nA population-based retrospective cohort study using data from Swedish national health registries \nfound an increased incidence of cervical cancer in women with rheumatoid arthritis treated with \ninfliximab compared to biologics-na\u00efve patients or the general population, including those over \n60 years of age. Periodic screening should continue in women treated with Remicade, including those \nover 60 years of age.\n\nAll patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon carcinoma (for \nexample, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis), or who had \na prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for dysplasia at regular intervals \nbefore therapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation should include colonoscopy and \nbiopsies per local recommendations. Current data do not indicate that infliximab treatment influences \nthe risk for developing dysplasia or colon cancer.\n\nSince the possibility of increased risk of cancer development in patients with newly diagnosed \ndysplasia treated with Remicade is not established, the risk and benefits of continued therapy to the \nindividual patients should be carefully considered by the clinician.\n\n\n\n12\n\nHeart failure\nRemicade should be used with caution in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II). Patients \nshould be closely monitored and Remicade must not be continued in patients who develop new or \nworsening symptoms of heart failure (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).\n\nHaematologic reactions\nThere have been reports of pancytopenia, leucopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia in patients \nreceiving TNF-blockers, including Remicade. All patients should be advised to seek immediate \nmedical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias (e.g. persistent \nfever, bruising, bleeding, pallor). Discontinuation of Remicade therapy should be considered in \npatients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities.\n\nOthers\nThere is limited safety experience of Remicade treatment in patients who have undergone surgical \nprocedures, including arthroplasty. The long half-life of infliximab should be taken into consideration \nif a surgical procedure is planned. A patient who requires surgery while on Remicade should be \nclosely monitored for infections, and appropriate actions should be taken.\n\nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn\u2019s disease may indicate the presence of a fixed fibrotic \nstricture that may require surgical treatment. There is no evidence to suggest that infliximab worsens\nor causes fibrotic strictures.\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly\nThe incidence of serious infections in Remicade-treated patients 65 years and older was greater than \nin those under 65 years of age. Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular attention regarding the \nrisk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly (see section 4.8).\n\nPaediatric population\nInfections\nIn clinical studies, infections have been reported in a higher proportion of paediatric patients \ncompared to adult patients (see section 4.8).\n\nVaccinations\nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all vaccinations in \nagreement with current vaccination guidelines prior to initiating Remicade therapy. Paediatric patients \non infliximab may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines (see sections 4.5 and 4.6).\n\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders\nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-blocking agents (initiation of therapy \u2264 18 years of age), including \nRemicade in the post-marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other \ncases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually \nassociated with immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and \nadolescents treated with TNF-blockers cannot be excluded.\n\nPost-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated with\nTNF-blocking agents including infliximab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive \ndisease course and is usually fatal. Almost all patients had received treatment with AZA or 6-MP \nconcomitantly with or immediately prior to a TNF-blocker. The vast majority of Remicade cases have \noccurred in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis and most were reported in adolescent or \nyoung adult males. The potential risk with the combination of AZA or 6-MP and Remicade should be \ncarefully considered. A risk for the development for hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients \ntreated with Remicade cannot be excluded (see section 4.8).\n\n\n\n13\n\nSodium content\nRemicade contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \nRemicade is however, diluted in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. This should \nbe taken into consideration for patients on a controlled sodium diet (see section 6.6).\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo interaction studies have been performed.\n\nIn rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease patients, there are indications that \nconcomitant use of methotrexate and other immunomodulators reduces the formation of antibodies \nagainst infliximab and increases the plasma concentrations of infliximab. However, the results are \nuncertain due to limitations in the methods used for serum analyses of infliximab and antibodies \nagainst infliximab.\n\nCorticosteroids do not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of infliximab to a clinically relevant \nextent.\n\nThe combination of Remicade with other biological therapeutics used to treat the same conditions as \nRemicade, including anakinra and abatacept, is not recommended (see section 4.4).\n\nIt is recommended that live vaccines not be given concurrently with Remicade. It is also \nrecommended that live vaccines not be given to infants after in utero exposure to infliximab for at \nleast 6 months following birth (see section 4.4).\n\nIt is recommended that therapeutic infectious agents not be given concurrently with Remicade (see \nsection 4.4).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent \npregnancy and continue its use for at least 6 months after the last Remicade treatment.\n\nPregnancy\nThe moderate number of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to infliximab resulting in live \nbirth with known outcomes, including approximately 1100 exposed during the first trimester, does not \nindicate an increase in the rate of malformation in the newborn.\n\nBased on an observational study from Northern Europe, an increased risk (OR, 95% CI; p-value) for \nC-section (1.50, 1.14-1.96; p = 0.0032), preterm birth (1.48, 1.05-2.09; p = 0.024), small for \ngestational age (2.79, 1.54-5.04; p = 0.0007), and low birth weight (2.03, 1.41-2.94; p = 0.0002) was \nobserved in women exposed during pregnancy to infliximab (with or without \nimmunomodulators/corticosteroids, 270 pregnancies) as compared to women exposed to \nimmunomodulators and/or corticosteroids only (6,460 pregnancies). The potential contribution of \nexposure to infliximab and/or the severity of the underlying disease in these outcomes remains \nunclear.\n\nDue to its inhibition of TNF\uf061, infliximab administered during pregnancy could affect normal immune \nresponses in the newborn. In a developmental toxicity study conducted in mice using an analogous \nantibody that selectively inhibits the functional activity of mouse TNF\uf061, there was no indication of \nmaternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity (see section 5.3).\n\nThe available clinical experience is limited. Infliximab should only be used during pregnancy if \nclearly needed.\n\n\n\n14\n\nInfliximab crosses the placenta and has been detected in the serum of infants up to 6 months following\nbirth. After in utero exposure to infliximab, infants may be at increased risk of infection, including \nserious disseminated infection that can become fatal. Administration of live vaccines (e.g. BCG \nvaccine) to infants exposed to infliximab in utero is not recommended for at least 6 months after birth \n(see sections 4.4 and 4.5). Cases of agranulocytosis have also been reported (see section 4.8).\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether infliximab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion. \nBecause human immunoglobulins are excreted in milk, women must not breast feed for at least \n6 months after Remicade treatment.\n\nFertility\nThere are insufficient preclinical data to draw conclusions on the effects of infliximab on fertility and \ngeneral reproductive function (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nRemicade may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness may occur \nfollowing administration of Remicade (see section 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nUpper respiratory tract infection was the most common adverse drug reaction (ADR) reported in \nclinical trials, occurring in 25.3% of infliximab-treated patients compared with 16.5% of control \npatients. The most serious ADRs associated with the use of TNF blockers that have been reported for \nRemicade include HBV reactivation, CHF (congestive heart failure), serious infections (including \nsepsis, opportunistic infections and TB), serum sickness (delayed hypersensitivity reactions), \nhaematologic reactions, systemic lupus erythematosus/lupus-like syndrome, demyelinating disorders, \nhepatobiliary events, lymphoma, HSTCL, leukaemia, Merkel cell carcinoma, melanoma, paediatric \nmalignancy, sarcoidosis/sarcoid-like reaction, intestinal or perianal abscess (in Crohn\u2019s disease), and \nserious infusion reactions (see section 4.4).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nTable 1 lists ADRs based on experience from clinical studies as well as adverse reactions, some with \nfatal outcome, reported from post-marketing experience. Within the organ system classes, adverse \nreactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following categories: very common \n(\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within \neach frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 1\nUndesirable effects in clinical studies and from post-marketing

reactions\nAn infusion-related reaction was defined in clinical studies as any adverse event occurring during an \ninfusion or within 1 hour after an infusion. In Phase III clinical studies, 18% of infliximab-treated \npatients compared with 5% of placebo-treated patients experienced an infusion-related reaction. \n\n\n\n17\n\nOverall, a higher proportion of patients receiving infliximab monotherapy experienced an \ninfusion-related reaction compared to patients receiving infliximab with concomitant \nimmunomodulators. Approximately 3% of patients discontinued treatment due to infusion-related \nreactions and all patients recovered with or without medical therapy. Of infliximab-treated patients \nwho had an infusion reaction during the induction period, through week 6, 27% experienced an \ninfusion reaction during the maintenance period, week 7 through week 54. Of patients who did not \nhave an infusion reaction during the induction period, 9% experienced an infusion reaction during the \nmaintenance period.\n\nIn a clinical study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ASPIRE), infusions were to be administered \nover 2 hours for the first 3 infusions. The duration of subsequent infusions could be shortened to not \nless than 40 minutes in patients who did not experience serious infusion reactions. In this trial, sixty \nsix percent of the patients (686 out of 1,040) received at least one shortened infusion of 90 minutes or \nless and 44% of the patients (454 out of 1,040) received at least one shortened infusion of 60 minutes \nor less. Of the infliximab-treated patients who received at least one shortened infusion, \ninfusion-related reactions occurred in 15% of patients and serious infusion reactions occurred in 0.4% \nof patients.\n\nIn a clinical study of patients with Crohn\u2019s disease (SONIC), infusion-related reactions occurred in \n16.6% (27/163) of patients receiving infliximab monotherapy, 5% (9/179) of patients receiving \ninfliximab in combination with AZA, and 5.6% (9/161) of patients receiving AZA monotherapy. One\nserious infusion reaction (< 1%) occurred in a patient on infliximab monotherapy.\n\nIn post-marketing experience, cases of anaphylactic-like reactions, including laryngeal/pharyngeal \noedema and severe bronchospasm, and seizure have been associated with Remicade administration\n(see section 4.4).\nCases of transient visual loss occurring during or within 2 hours of Remicade infusion have been \nreported. Events (some fatal) of myocardial ischaemia/infarction and arrhythmia have been reported, \nsome in close temporal association with infusion of infliximab; cerebrovascular accidents have also \nbeen reported in close temporal association with infusion of infliximab.\n\nInfusion reactions following re-administration of Remicade\nA clinical study in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis was designed to assess the efficacy and \nsafety of long-term maintenance therapy versus re-treatment with an induction regimen of Remicade \n(maximum of four infusions at 0, 2, 6 and 14 weeks) following disease flare. Patients did not receive \nany concomitant immunosuppressant therapy. In the re-treatment arm, 4% (8/219) of patients \nexperienced a serious infusion reaction versus < 1% (1/222) on maintenance therapy. The majority of \nserious infusion reactions occurred during the second infusion at week 2. The interval between the \nlast maintenance dose and the first re-induction dose ranged from 35-231 days. Symptoms included, \nbut were not limited to, dyspnea, urticaria, facial oedema, and hypotension. In all cases, Remicade \ntreatment was discontinued and/or other treatment instituted with complete resolution of signs and \nsymptoms.\n\nDelayed hypersensitivity\nIn clinical studies delayed hypersensitivity reactions have been uncommon and have occurred after \nRemicade-free intervals of less than 1 year. In the psoriasis studies, delayed hypersensitivity reactions \noccurred early in the treatment course. Signs and symptoms included myalgia and/or arthralgia with \nfever and/or rash, with some patients experiencing pruritus, facial, hand or lip oedema, dysphagia, \nurticaria, sore throat and headache.\n\nThere are insufficient data on the incidence of delayed hypersensitivity reactions after Remicade-free \nintervals of more than 1 year but limited data from clinical studies suggest an increased risk for \ndelayed hypersensitivity with increasing Remicade-free interval (see section 4.4).\n\nIn a 1-year clinical study with repeated infusions in patients with Crohn's disease (ACCENT I study), \nthe incidence of serum sickness-like reactions was 2.4%.\n\n\n\n18\n\nImmunogenicity\nPatients who developed antibodies to infliximab were more likely (approximately 2-3 fold) to develop \ninfusion-related reactions. Use of concomitant immunosuppressant agents appeared to reduce the \nfrequency of infusion-related reactions.\nIn clinical studies using single and multiple infliximab doses ranging from 1 to 20 mg/kg, antibodies \nto infliximab were detected in 14% of patients with any immunosuppressant therapy, and in 24% \nof patients without immunosuppressant therapy. In rheumatoid arthritis patients who received the\nrecommended repeated treatment dose regimens with methotrexate, 8% of patients developed \nantibodies to infliximab. In psoriatic arthritis patients who received 5 mg/kg with and without \nmethotrexate, antibodies occurred overall in 15% of patients (antibodies occurred in 4% of patients \nreceiving methotrexate and in 26% of patients not receiving methotrexate at baseline). In Crohn's \ndisease patients who received maintenance treatment, antibodies to infliximab occurred overall in \n3.3% of patients receiving immunosuppressants and in 13.3% of patients not receiving \nimmunosuppressants. The antibody incidence was 2-3 fold higher for patients treated episodically. \nDue to methodological limitations, a negative assay did not exclude the presence of antibodies to \ninfliximab. Some patients who developed high titres of antibodies to infliximab had evidence of \nreduced efficacy. In psoriasis patients treated with infliximab as a maintenance regimen in the \nabsence of concomitant immunomodulators, approximately 28% developed antibodies to infliximab \n(see section 4.4: \u201cInfusion reactions and hypersensitivity\u201d).\n\nInfections\nTuberculosis, bacterial infections, including sepsis and pneumonia, invasive fungal, viral, and other \nopportunistic infections have been observed in patients receiving Remicade. Some of these infections \nhave been fatal; the most frequently reported opportunistic infections with a mortality rate of > 5% \ninclude pneumocystosis, candidiasis, listeriosis and aspergillosis (see section 4.4).\n\nIn clinical studies 36% of infliximab-treated patients were treated for infections compared with 25% \nof placebo-treated patients.\n\nIn rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies, the incidence of serious infections including pneumonia was \nhigher in infliximab plus methotrexate-treated patients compared with methotrexate alone especially \nat doses of 6 mg/kg or greater (see section 4.4).\n\nIn post-marketing spontaneous reporting, infections are the most common serious adverse reaction. \nSome of the cases have resulted in a fatal outcome. Nearly 50% of reported deaths have been \nassociated with infection. Cases of tuberculosis, sometimes fatal, including miliary tuberculosis and \ntuberculosis with extra-pulmonary location have been reported (see section 4.4).\n\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders\nIn clinical studies with infliximab in which 5,780 patients were treated, representing 5,494 patient \nyears, 5 cases of lymphomas and 26 non-lymphoma malignancies were detected as compared with no \nlymphomas and 1 non-lymphoma malignancy in 1,600 placebo-treated patients representing\n941 patient years.\n\nIn long-term safety follow-up of clinical studies with infliximab of up to 5 years, representing \n6,234 patients-years (3,210 patients), 5 cases of lymphoma and 38 cases of non-lymphoma \nmalignancies were reported.\n\nCases of malignancies, including lymphoma, have also been reported in the post-marketing setting \n(see section 4.4).\n\nIn an exploratory clinical study involving patients with moderate to severe COPD who were either \ncurrent smokers or ex-smokers, 157 adult patients were treated with Remicade at doses similar to \nthose used in rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn\u2019s disease. Nine of these patients developed \nmalignancies, including 1 lymphoma. The median duration of follow-up was 0.8 years (incidence \n\n\n\n19\n\n5.7% [95% CI 2.65%-10.6%]. There was one reported malignancy amongst 77 control patients \n(median duration of follow-up 0.8 years; incidence 1.3% [95% CI 0.03%-7.0%]). The majority of the \nmalignancies developed in the lung or head and neck.\n\nA population-based retrospective cohort study found an increased incidence of cervical cancer in \nwomen with rheumatoid arthritis treated with infliximab compared to biologics-na\u00efve patients or the \ngeneral population, including those over 60 years of age (see section 4.4).\n\nIn addition, post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients \ntreated with Remicade with the vast majority of cases occurring in Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative \ncolitis, and most of whom were adolescent or young adult males (see section 4.4).\n\nHeart failure\nIn a Phase II study aimed at evaluating Remicade in CHF, higher incidence of mortality due to \nworsening of heart failure were seen in patients treated with Remicade, especially those treated with \nthe higher dose of 10 mg/kg (i.e. twice the maximum approved dose). In this study 150 patients with \nNYHA Class III-IV CHF (left ventricular ejection fraction \u2264 35%) were treated with 3 infusions of \nRemicade 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or placebo over 6 weeks. At 38 weeks, 9 of 101 patients treated with \nRemicade (2 at 5 mg/kg and 7 at 10 mg/kg) died compared to one death among the 49 patients on \nplacebo.\nThere have been post-marketing reports of worsening heart failure, with and without identifiable \nprecipitating factors, in patients taking Remicade. There have also been post-marketing reports of new \nonset heart failure, including heart failure in patients without known pre-existing cardiovascular \ndisease. Some of these patients have been under 50 years of age.\n\nHepatobiliary events\nIn clinical studies, mild or moderate elevations of ALT and AST have been observed in patients \nreceiving Remicade without progression to severe hepatic injury. Elevations of ALT \u2265 5 x Upper \nLimit of Normal (ULN) have been observed (see Table 2). Elevations of aminotransferases were \nobserved (ALT more common than AST) in a greater proportion of patients receiving Remicade than \nin controls, both when Remicade was given as monotherapy and when it was used in combination \nwith other immunosuppressive agents. Most aminotransferase abnormalities were transient; however, \na small number of patients experienced more prolonged elevations. In general, patients who \ndeveloped ALT and AST elevations were asymptomatic, and the abnormalities decreased or resolved \nwith either continuation or discontinuation of Remicade, or modification of concomitant therapy. In \npost-marketing surveillance, cases of jaundice and hepatitis, some with features of autoimmune \nhepatitis, have been reported in patients receiving Remicade (see section 4.4).\n\nTable 2\nProportion of patients with increased ALT activity in clinical studies\n\nIndication Number of patients3 Median follow-up \n(wks)4\n\n\u2265 3 x ULN \u2265 5 x ULN\n\nplacebo infliximab placebo infliximab placebo infliximab placebo infliximab\nRheumatoid \narthritis1\n\n375 1,087 58.1 58.3 3.2% 3.9% 0.8% 0.9%\n\nCrohn\u2019s \ndisease2\n\n324 1034 53.7 54.0 2.2% 4.9% 0.0% 1.5%\n\nPaediatric \nCrohn\u2019s \ndisease\n\nN/A 139 N/A 53.0 N/A 4.4% N/A 1.5%\n\nUlcerative \ncolitis\n\n242 482 30.1 30.8 1.2% 2.5% 0.4% 0.6%\n\nPaediatric \nUlcerative \ncolitis\n\nN/A 60 N/A 49.4 N/A 6.7% N/A 1.7%\n\nAnkylosing \nspondylitis\n\n76 275 24.1 101.9 0.0% 9.5% 0.0% 3.6%\n\n\n\n20\n\nPsoriatic \narthritis\n\n98 191 18.1 39.1 0.0% 6.8% 0.0% 2.1%\n\nPlaque \npsoriasis\n\n281 1,175 16.1 50.1 0.4% 7.7% 0.0% 3.4%\n\n1\nPlacebo patients received methotrexate while infliximab patients received both infliximab and methotrexate.\n\n2\nPlacebo patients in the 2 Phase III studies in Crohn\u2019s disease, ACCENT I and ACCENT II, received an initial dose of \n5 mg/kg infliximab at study start and were on placebo in the maintenance phase. Patients who were randomised to the \nplacebo maintenance group and then later crossed over to infliximab are included in the infliximab group in the ALT \nanalysis. In the Phase IIIb trial in Crohn\u2019s disease, SONIC, placebo patients received AZA 2.5 mg/kg/day as active \ncontrol in addition to placebo infliximab infusions.\n\n3\nNumber of patients evaluated for ALT.\n\n4\nMedian follow-up is based on patients treated.\n\nAntinuclear antibodies (ANA)/Anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies\nApproximately half of infliximab-treated patients in clinical studies who were ANA negative at \nbaseline developed a positive ANA during the study compared with approximately one fifth of \nplacebo-treated patients. Anti-dsDNA antibodies were newly detected in approximately 17% of \ninfliximab-treated patients compared with 0% of placebo-treated patients. At the last evaluation, 57% \nof infliximab-treated patients remained anti-dsDNA positive. Reports of lupus and lupus-like \nsyndromes, however, remain uncommon (see section 4.4).\n\nPaediatric population\nJuvenile rheumatoid arthritis patients\nRemicade was studied in a clinical study in 120 patients (age range: 4-17 years old) with active \njuvenile rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate. Patients received 3 or 6 mg/kg infliximab as a \n3-dose induction regimen (weeks 0, 2, 6 or weeks 14, 16, 20 respectively) followed by maintenance \ntherapy every 8 weeks, in combination with methotrexate.\n\nInfusion reactions\nInfusion reactions occurred in 35% of patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis receiving 3 mg/kg \ncompared with 17.5% of patients receiving 6 mg/kg. In the 3 mg/kg Remicade group, 4 out of \n60 patients had a serious infusion reaction and 3 patients reported a possible anaphylactic reaction (2 \nof which were among the serious infusion reactions). In the 6 mg/kg group, 2 out of 57 patients had a \nserious infusion reaction, one of whom had a possible anaphylactic reaction (see section 4.4).\n\nImmunogenicity\nAntibodies to infliximab developed in 38% of patients receiving 3 mg/kg compared with 12% of \npatients receiving 6 mg/kg. The antibody titres were notably higher for the 3 mg/kg compared to the \n6 mg/kg group.\n\nInfections\nInfections occurred in 68% (41/60) of children receiving 3 mg/kg over 52 weeks, 65% (37/57) of \nchildren receiving infliximab 6 mg/kg over 38 weeks and 47% (28/60) of children receiving placebo \nover 14 weeks (see section 4.4).\n\nPaediatric Crohn\u2019s disease patients\nThe following adverse reactions were reported more commonly in paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease patients \nin the REACH study (see section 5.1) than in adult Crohn\u2019s disease patients: anaemia (10.7%), blood \nin stool (9.7%), leucopenia (8.7%), flushing (8.7%), viral infection (7.8%), neutropenia (6.8%), \nbacterial infection (5.8%), and respiratory tract allergic reaction (5.8%). In addition, bone fracture \n(6.8%) was reported, however, a causal association has not been established. Other special \nconsiderations are discussed below.\n\nInfusion-related reactions\nIn REACH, 17.5% of randomised patients experienced 1 or more infusion reactions. There were no \nserious infusion reactions, and 2 subjects in REACH had non-serious anaphylactic reactions.\n\n\n\n21\n\nImmunogenicity\nAntibodies to infliximab were detected in 3 (2.9%) paediatric patients.\n\nInfections\nIn the REACH study, infections were reported in 56.3% of randomised subjects treated with \ninfliximab. Infections were reported more frequently for subjects who received q8 week as opposed to \nq12 week infusions (73.6% and 38.0%, respectively), while serious infections were reported for \n3 subjects in the q8 week and 4 subjects in the q12 week maintenance treatment group. The most \ncommonly reported infections were upper respiratory tract infection and pharyngitis, and the most \ncommonly reported serious infection was abscess. Three cases of pneumonia (1 serious) and 2 cases \nof herpes zoster (both non-serious) were reported.\n\nPaediatric ulcerative colitis patients\nOverall, the adverse reactions reported in the paediatric ulcerative colitis trial (C0168T72) and adult \nulcerative colitis (ACT 1 and ACT 2) studies were generally consistent. In C0168T72, the most \ncommon adverse reactions were upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, abdominal pain, fever, \nand headache. The most common adverse event was worsening of ulcerative colitis, the incidence of \nwhich was higher in patients on the q12 week vs. the q8 week dosing regimen.\n\nInfusion-related reactions\nOverall, 8 (13.3%) of 60 treated patients experienced one or more infusion reactions, with 4 of 22 \n(18.2%) in the q8 week and 3 of 23 (13.0%) in the q12 week treatment maintenance group. No serious \ninfusion reactions were reported. All infusion reactions were mild or moderate in intensity.\n\nImmunogenicity\nAntibodies to infliximab were detected in 4 (7.7%) patients through week 54.\n\nInfections\nInfections were reported in 31 (51.7%) of 60 treated patients in C0168T72 and 22 (36.7%) required \noral or parenteral antimicrobial treatment. The proportion of patients with infections in C0168T72 \nwas similar to that in the paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease study (REACH) but higher than the proportion in \nthe adults ulcerative colitis studies (ACT 1 and ACT 2). The overall incidence of infections in \nC0168T72 was 13/22 (59%) in the every 8 week maintenance treatment group and 14/23 (60.9%) in \nthe every 12 week maintenance treatment group. Upper respiratory tract infection (7/60 [12%]) and \npharyngitis (5/60 [8%]) were the most frequently reported respiratory system infections. Serious \ninfections were reported in 12% (7/60) of all treated patients.\n\nIn this study, there were more patients in the 12 to 17 year age group than in the 6 to 11 year age \ngroup (45/60 [75.0%]) vs.15/60 [25.0%]). While the numbers of patients in each subgroup are too \nsmall to make any definitive conclusions about the effect of age on safety events, there were higher \nproportions of patients with serious adverse events and discontinuation due to adverse events in the \nyounger age group than in the older age group. While the proportion of patients with infections was \nalso higher in the younger age group, for serious infections, the proportions were similar in the two \nage groups. Overall proportions of adverse events and infusion reactions were similar between the 6 \nto 11 and 12 to 17 year age groups.\n\nPost-marketing experience\nPost-marketing spontaneous serious adverse reactions with infliximab in the paediatric population \nhave included malignancies including hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas, transient hepatic enzyme \nabnormalities, lupus-like syndromes, and positive auto-antibodies (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nAdditional information on special populations\nElderly\nIn rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies, the incidence of serious infections was greater in infliximab \nplus methotrexate-treated patients 65 years and older (11.3%) than in those under 65 years of age \n\n\n\n22\n\n(4.6%). In patients treated with methotrexate alone, the incidence of serious infections was 5.2% in \npatients 65 years and older compared to 2.7% in patients under 65 (see section 4.4).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo case of overdose has been reported. Single doses up to 20 mg/kg have been administered without \ntoxic effects.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\uf061) inhibitors, \nATC code: L04AB02.\n\nMechanism of action\nInfliximab is a chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to both \nsoluble and transmembrane forms of TNF\uf061 but not to lymphotoxin \uf061 (TNF\u00df).\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nInfliximab inhibits the functional activity of TNF\uf061 in a wide variety of in vitro bioassays. Infliximab \nprevented disease in transgenic mice that develop polyarthritis as a result of constitutive expression of \nhuman TNF\uf061 and when administered after disease onset, it allowed eroded joints to heal. In vivo, \ninfliximab rapidly forms stable complexes with human TNF\uf061, a process that parallels the loss of TNF\uf061\nbioactivity.\n\nElevated concentrations of TNF\uf061 have been found in the joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients and \ncorrelate with elevated disease activity. In rheumatoid arthritis, treatment with infliximab reduced \ninfiltration of inflammatory cells into inflamed areas of the joint as well as expression of molecules \nmediating cellular adhesion, chemoattraction and tissue degradation. After infliximab treatment, \npatients exhibited decreased levels of serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and \nincreased haemoglobin levels in rheumatoid arthritis patients with reduced haemoglobin levels, \ncompared with baseline. Peripheral blood lymphocytes further showed no significant decrease in \nnumber or in proliferative responses to in vitro mitogenic stimulation when compared with untreated \npatients\u2019 cells. In psoriasis patients, treatment with infliximab resulted in decreases in epidermal \ninflammation and normalisation of keratinocyte differentiation in psoriatic plaques. In psoriatic \narthritis, short term treatment with Remicade reduced the number of T-cells and blood vessels in the \nsynovium and psoriatic skin.\n\nHistological evaluation of colonic biopsies, obtained before and 4 weeks after administration of \ninfliximab, revealed a substantial reduction in detectable TNF\uf061. Infliximab treatment of Crohn\u2019s \ndisease patients was also associated with a substantial reduction of the commonly elevated serum \ninflammatory marker, CRP. Total peripheral white blood cell counts were minimally affected in \ninfliximab-treated patients, although changes in lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils reflected \nshifts towards normal ranges. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from infliximab-treated \npatients showed undiminished proliferative responsiveness to stimuli compared with untreated \npatients, and no substantial changes in cytokine production by stimulated PBMC were observed \nfollowing treatment with infliximab. Analysis of lamina propria mononuclear cells obtained by biopsy \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n23\n\nof the intestinal mucosa showed that infliximab treatment caused a reduction in the number of cells \ncapable of expressing TNF\uf061 and interferon\uf067. Additional histological studies provided evidence that \ntreatment with infliximab reduces the infiltration of inflammatory cells into affected areas of the \nintestine and the presence of inflammation markers at these sites. Endoscopic studies of intestinal \nmucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in infliximab-treated patients.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nAdult rheumatoid arthritis\nThe efficacy of infliximab was assessed in two multicentre, randomised, double-blind, pivotal clinical \nstudies: ATTRACT and ASPIRE. In both studies concurrent use of stable doses of folic acid, oral \ncorticosteroids (\u2264 10 mg/day) and/or non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was permitted.\n\nThe primary endpoints were the reduction of signs and symptoms as assessed by the American \nCollege of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20 for ATTRACT, landmark ACR-N for ASPIRE), the \nprevention of structural joint damage, and the improvement in physical function. A reduction in signs \nand symptoms was defined to be at least a 20% improvement (ACR20) in both tender and swollen \njoint counts, and in 3 of the following 5 criteria: (1) evaluator\u2019s global assessment, (2) patient\u2019s global \nassessment, (3) functional/disability measure, (4) visual analogue pain scale and (5) erythrocyte \nsedimentation rate or C-reactive protein. ACR-N uses the same criteria as the ACR20, calculated by \ntaking the lowest percent improvement in swollen joint count, tender joint count, and the median of \nthe remaining 5 components of the ACR response. Structural joint damage (erosions and joint space \nnarrowing) in both hands and feet was measured by the change from baseline in the total van der \nHeijde-modified Sharp score (0-440). The Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ; scale 0-3) was \nused to measure patients\u2019 average change from baseline scores over time, in physical function.\n\nThe ATTRACT study evaluated responses at 30, 54 and 102 weeks in a placebo-controlled study of \n428 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite treatment with methotrexate. Approximately 50% \nof patients were in functional Class III. Patients received placebo, 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg infliximab at \nweeks 0, 2 and 6, and then every 4 or 8 weeks thereafter. All patients were on stable methotrexate \ndoses (median 15 mg/wk) for 6 months prior to enrolment and were to remain on stable doses \nthroughout the study.\nResults from week 54 (ACR20, total van der Heijde-modified Sharp score and HAQ) are shown in \nTable 3. Higher degrees of clinical response (ACR50 and ACR70) were observed in all infliximab \ngroups at 30 and 54 weeks compared with methotrexate alone.\n\nA reduction in the rate of the progression of structural joint damage (erosions and joint space \nnarrowing) was observed in all infliximab groups at 54 weeks (Table 3).\n\nThe effects observed at 54 weeks were maintained through 102 weeks. Due to a number of treatment \nwithdrawals, the magnitude of the effect difference between infliximab and the methotrexate alone \ngroup cannot be defined.\n\nTable 3\nEffects on ACR20, Structural Joint Damage and Physical Function at week 54, ATTRACT\n\ninfliximab\nb\n\nControl\na\n\n3 mg/kg\nq 8 wks\n\n3 mg/kg\nq 4 wks\n\n10 mg/kg\nq 8 wks\n\n10 mg/kg\nq 4 wks\n\nAll \n\ninfliximab\nb\n\nPatients with ACR20 response/\nPatients evaluated (%)\n\n15/88\n(17%)\n\n36/86\n(42%)\n\n41/86\n(48%)\n\n51/87\n(59%)\n\n48/81\n(59%)\n\n176/340\n(52%)\n\nTotal score\nd\n\n(van der \nHeijde-modified Sharp score)\nChange from baseline (Mean \u00b1\n\nSD\nc\n)\n\n7.0 \u00b1 10.3 1.3 \u00b1 6.0 1.6 \u00b1 8.5 0.2 \u00b1 3.6 -0.7 \u00b1 3.8 0.6 \u00b1 5.9\n\nMedian\n(Interquartile range)\n\n4.0\n(0.5,9.7)\n\n0.5\n(-1.5,3.0)\n\n0.1\n(-2.5,3.0)\n\n0.5\n(-1.5,2.0)\n\n-0.5\n(-3.0,1.5)\n\n0.0\n(-1.8,2.0)\n\n\n\n24\n\nPatients with no \ndeterioration/patients evaluated \n\n(%)\nc\n\n13/64\n(20%)\n\n34/71\n(48%)\n\n35/71\n(49%)\n\n37/77\n(48%)\n\n44/66\n(67%)\n\n150/285\n(53%)\n\nHAQ change from baseline over \ntimee (patients evaluated)\n\n87 86 85 87 81 339\n\nMean \u00b1 SD\nc 0.2 \u00b1 0.3 0.4 \u00b1 0.3 0.5 \u00b1 0.4 0.5 \u00b1 0.5 0.4 \u00b1 0.4 0.4 \u00b1 0.4\n\na\ncontrol = All patients had active RA despite treatment with stable methotrexate doses for 6 months prior to enrolment \nand were to remain on stable doses throughout the study.

All patients received methotrexate (optimised to 20 mg/wk by \nweek 8) and either placebo, 3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, and 6 and every 8 weeks \nthereafter. Results from week 54 are shown in Table 4.\n\nAfter 54 weeks of treatment, both doses of infliximab + methotrexate resulted in statistically \nsignificantly greater improvement in signs and symptoms compared to methotrexate alone as\nmeasured by the proportion of patients achieving ACR20, 50 and 70 responses.\n\nIn ASPIRE, more than 90% of patients had at least two evaluable X-rays. Reduction in the rate of \nprogression of structural damage was observed at weeks 30 and 54 in the infliximab + methotrexate \ngroups compared to methotrexate alone.\n\nTable 4\nEffects on ACRn, Structural Joint Damage and Physical Function at week 54, ASPIRE\n\nInfliximab + MTX\nPlacebo + MTX 3 mg/kg 6 mg/kg Combined\n\nSubjects randomised 282 359 363 722\nPercentage ACR improvement\nMean \u00b1 SDa 24.8 \u00b1 59.7 37.3 \u00b1 52.8 42.0 \u00b1 47.3 39.6 \u00b1 50.1\nChange from baseline in total van der \nHeijde-modified Sharp scoreb\n\nMean \u00b1 SDa 3.70 \u00b1 9.61 0.42 \u00b1 5.82 0.51 \u00b1 5.55 0.46 \u00b1 5.68\nMedian 0.43 0.00 0.00 0.00\nImprovement from baseline in HAQ \naveraged over time from week 30 to \nweek 54c\n\nMean \u00b1 SDd 0.68 \u00b1 0.63 0.80 \u00b1 0.65 0.88 \u00b1 0.65 0.84 \u00b1 0.65\na\n\np < 0.001, for each infliximab treatment group vs. control.\nb\n\ngreater values indicate more joint damage.\nc\n\nHAQ = Health Assessment Questionnaire; greater values indicate less disability.\nd\n\np = 0.030 and < 0.001 for the 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg treatment groups respectively vs. placebo + MTX.\n\nData to support dose titration in rheumatoid arthritis come from ATTRACT, ASPIRE and the START \nstudy. START was a randomised, multicenter, double-blind, 3-arm, parallel-group safety study. In one \nof the study arms (group 2, n = 329), patients with an inadequate response were allowed to dose titrate \nwith 1.5 mg/kg increments from 3 up to 9 mg/kg. The majority (67%) of these patients did not require \nany dose titration. Of the patients who required a dose titration, 80% achieved clinical response and \nthe majority (64%) of these required only one adjustment of 1.5 mg/kg.\n\n\n\n25\n\nAdult Crohn\u2019s disease\nInduction treatment in moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease\nThe efficacy of a single dose treatment with infliximab was assessed in 108 patients with active \nCrohn\u2019s disease (Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) \u2265 220 \u2264 400) in a randomised, \ndouble-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-response study. Of these 108 patients, 27 were treated with \nthe recommended dosage of infliximab 5 mg/kg. All patients had experienced an inadequate response \nto prior conventional therapies. Concurrent use of stable doses of conventional therapies was \npermitted, and 92% of patients continued to receive these therapies.\n\nThe primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who experienced a clinical response, defined as a \ndecrease in CDAI by \u2265 70 points from baseline at the 4-week evaluation and without an increase in \nthe use of medicinal products or surgery for Crohn\u2019s disease. Patients who responded at week 4 were \nfollowed to week 12. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients in clinical remission at \nweek 4 (CDAI < 150) and clinical response over time.\n\nAt week 4, following administration of a single dose, 22/27 (81%) of infliximab-treated patients \nreceiving a 5 mg/kg dose achieved a clinical response vs. 4/25 (16%) of the placebo-treated patients \n(p < 0.001). Also at week 4, 13/27 (48%) of infliximab-treated patients achieved a clinical remission \n(CDAI < 150) vs. 1/25 (4%) of placebo-treated patients. A response was observed within 2 weeks, \nwith a maximum response at 4 weeks. At the last observation at 12 weeks, 13/27 (48%) of \ninfliximab-treated patients were still responding.\n\nMaintenance treatment in moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease in adults\nThe efficacy of repeated infusions with infliximab was studied in a 1-year clinical study (ACCENT I).\nA total of 573 patients with moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease (CDAI \u2265 220 \u2264 400) \nreceived a single infusion of 5 mg/kg at week 0. 178 of the 580 enrolled patients (30.7%) were \ndefined as having severe disease (CDAI score > 300 and concomitant corticosteroid and/or \nimmunosuppressants) corresponding to the population defined in the indication (see section 4.1). At \nweek 2, all patients were assessed for clinical response and randomised to one of 3 treatment groups; \na placebo maintenance group, 5 mg/kg maintenance group and 10 mg/kg maintenance group. All \n3 groups received repeated infusions at week 2, 6 and every 8 weeks thereafter.\n\nOf the 573 patients randomised, 335 (58%) achieved clinical response by week 2. These patients were \nclassified as week-2 responders and were included in the primary analysis (see Table 5). Among \npatients classified as non-responders at week 2, 32% (26/81) in the placebo maintenance group and \n42% (68/163) in the infliximab group achieved clinical response by week 6. There was no difference \nbetween groups in the number of late responders thereafter.\n\nThe co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients in clinical remission (CDAI < 150) at \nweek 30 and time to loss of response through week 54. Corticosteroid tapering was permitted after \nweek 6.\n\nTable 5\nEffects on response and remission rate, data from ACCENT I (week-2 responders)\n\nACCENT I (week-2 responders)\n% of Patients\n\nPlacebo Maintenance\n\n(n = 110)\n\nInfliximab \nMaintenance\n\n5 mg/kg\n(n = 113)\n(p value)\n\nInfliximab\nMaintenance\n\n10 mg/kg\n(n = 112)\n(p value)\n\nMedian time to loss of \nresponse through week 54\n\n19 weeks 38 weeks\n(0.002)\n\n> 54 weeks\n(< 0.001)\n\nWeek 30\nClinical Responsea 27.3 51.3\n\n(< 0.001)\n59.1\n\n(< 0.001)\n\n\n\n26\n\nClinical Remission 20.9 38.9\n(0.003)\n\n45.5\n(< 0.001)\n\nSteroid-Free Remission 10.7 (6/56) 31.0 (18/58)\n(0.008)\n\n36.8 (21/57)\n(0.001)\n\nWeek 54\nClinical Responsea 15.5 38.1\n\n(< 0.001)\n47.7\n\n(< 0.001)\nClinical Remission 13.6 28.3\n\n(0.007)\n38.4\n\n(< 0.001)\nSustained Steroid-Free \nRemissionb\n\n5.7 (3/53)\n17.9 (10/56)\n\n(0.075)\n28.6 (16/56)\n\n(0.002)\na\n\nReduction in CDAI \u2265 25% and \u2265 70 points.\nb\n\nCDAI < 150 at both week 30 and 54 and not receiving corticosteroids in the 3 months prior to week 54 among \npatients who were receiving corticosteroids at baseline.\n\nBeginning at week 14, patients who had responded to treatment, but subsequently lost their clinical \nbenefit, were allowed to cross over to a dose of infliximab 5 mg/kg higher than the dose to which they \nwere originally randomised. Eighty nine percent (50/56) of patients who lost clinical response on \ninfliximab 5 mg/kg maintenance therapy after week 14 responded to treatment with infliximab \n10 mg/kg.\n\nImprovements in quality of life measures, a reduction in disease-related hospitalisations and \ncorticosteroid use were seen in the infliximab maintenance groups compared with the placebo \nmaintenance group at weeks 30 and 54.\n\nInfliximab with or without AZA was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, active comparator study \n(SONIC) of 508 adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn\u2019s disease (CDAI \u2265 220 \u2264 450) who \nwere naive to biologics and immunosuppressants and had a median disease duration of 2.3 years. At \nbaseline 27.4% of patients were receiving systemic corticosteroids, 14.2% of patients were receiving \nbudesonide, and 54.3% of patients were receiving 5-ASA compounds. Patients were randomised to \nreceive AZA monotherapy, infliximab monotherapy, or infliximab plus AZA combination therapy. \nInfliximab was administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, 6, and then every 8 weeks. AZA was \ngiven at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg daily.\n\nThe primary endpoint of the study was corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 26, defined as \npatients in clinical remission (CDAI of < 150) who, for at least 3 weeks, had not taken oral systemic \ncorticosteroids (prednisone or equivalent) or budesonide at a dose > 6 mg/day. For results see Table 6. \nThe proportions of patients with mucosal healing at week 26 were significantly greater in the \ninfliximab plus AZA combination (43.9%, p < 0.001) and infliximab monotherapy groups (30.1%, \np = 0.023) compared to the AZA monotherapy group (16.5%).\n\nTable 6\nPercent of patients achieving corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 26, SONIC\n\nAZA\nMonotherapy\n\nInfliximab\nMonotherapy\n\nInfliximab + AZA\nCombination \n\nTherapy\nWeek 26\nAll randomised patients 30.0% (51/170) 44.4% (75/169)\n\n(p = 0.006)*\n56.8% (96/169)\n\n(p < 0.001)*\n\n* P-values represent each infliximab treatment group vs. AZA monotherapy.\n\nSimilar trends in the achievement of corticosteroid-free clinical remission were observed at week 50. \nFurthermore, improved quality of life as measured by IBDQ was observed with infliximab.\n\n\n\n27\n\nInduction treatment in fistulising active Crohn\u2019s disease\nThe efficacy was assessed in a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 94 patients \nwith fistulising Crohn\u2019s disease who had fistulae that were of at least 3 months\u2019 duration. Thirty one \nof these patients were treated with infliximab 5 mg/kg. Approximately 93% of the patients had \npreviously received antibiotic or immunosuppressive therapy.\n\nConcurrent use of stable doses of conventional therapies was permitted, and 83% of patients \ncontinued to receive at least one of these therapies. Patients received three doses of either placebo or \ninfliximab at weeks 0, 2 and 6. Patients were followed up to 26 weeks. The primary endpoint was the \nproportion of patients who experienced a clinical response, defined as \u2265 50% reduction from baseline \nin the number of fistulae draining upon gentle compression on at least two consecutive visits (4 weeks \napart), without an increase in the use of medicinal products or surgery for Crohn\u2019s disease.\n\nSixty eight percent (21/31) of infliximab-treated patients receiving a 5 mg/kg dose regimen achieved a \nclinical response vs. 26% (8/31) placebo-treated patients (p = 0.002). The median time to onset of \nresponse in the infliximab-treated group was 2 weeks. The median duration of response was \n12 weeks. Additionally, closure of all fistulae was achieved in 55% of infliximab-treated patients \ncompared with 13% of placebo-treated patients (p = 0.001).\n\nMaintenance treatment in fistulising active Crohn\u2019s disease\nThe efficacy of repeated infusions with infliximab in patients with fistulising Crohn\u2019s disease was \nstudied in a 1-year clinical study (ACCENT II). A total of 306 patients received 3 doses of infliximab \n5 mg/kg at week 0, 2 and 6. At baseline, 87% of the patients had perianal fistulae, 14% had abdominal \nfistulae, 9% had rectovaginal fistulae. The median CDAI score was 180. At week 14, 282 patients \nwere assessed for clinical response and randomised to receive either placebo or 5 mg/kg infliximab \nevery 8 weeks through week 46.\n\nWeek-14 responders (195/282) were analysed for the primary endpoint, which was time from \nrandomisation to loss of response (see Table 7). Corticosteroid tapering was permitted after week 6.\n\nTable 7\nEffects on response rate, data from ACCENT II (week-14 responders)\n\nACCENT II (week-14 responders)\nPlacebo\n\nMaintenance\n(n = 99)\n\nInfliximab\nMaintenance\n\n(5 mg/kg)\n(n = 96)\n\np-value\n\nMedian time to loss of response through \nweek 54\n\n14 weeks > 40 weeks < 0.001\n\nWeek 54\nFistula Response (%)a 23.5 46.2 0.001\nComplete fistula response (%)b 19.4 36.3 0.009\na\n\nA \u2265 50% reduction from baseline in the number of draining fistulas over a period of \u2265 4 weeks.\nb\n\nAbsence of any draining fistulas.\n\nBeginning at week 22, patients who initially responded to treatment and subsequently lost their \nresponse were eligible to cross over to active re-treatment every 8 weeks at a dose of infliximab \n5 mg/kg higher than the dose to which they were originally randomised. Among patients in the \ninfliximab 5 mg/kg group who crossed over because of loss of fistula response after week 22, 57% \n(12/21) responded to re-treatment with infliximab 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks.\n\nThere was no significant difference between placebo and infliximab for the proportion of patients \nwith sustained closure of all fistulas through week 54, for symptoms such as proctalgia, abscesses and \nurinary tract infection or for number of newly developed fistulas during treatment.\n\n\n\n28\n\nMaintenance therapy with infliximab every 8 weeks significantly reduced disease-related \nhospitalisations and surgeries compared with placebo. Furthermore, a reduction in corticosteroid use \nand improvements in quality of life were observed.\n\nAdult ulcerative colitis\nThe safety and efficacy of Remicade were assessed in two (ACT 1 and ACT 2) randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in adult patients with moderately to severely active \nulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12; Endoscopy subscore \u2265 2) with an inadequate response to \nconventional therapies [oral corticosteroids, aminosalicylates and/or immunomodulators (6-MP, \nAZA)]. Concomitant stable doses of oral aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory \nagents were permitted. In both studies, patients were randomised to receive either placebo, 5 mg/kg \nRemicade, or 10 mg/kg Remicade at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 and 22, and in ACT 1 at weeks 30, 38 and 46. \nCorticosteroid taper was permitted after week 8.\n\nTable 8\nEffects on clinical response, clinical remission and mucosal healing at weeks 8 and 30.\n\nCombined data from ACT 1 & 2\nInfliximab\n\nPlacebo 5 mg/kg 10 mg/kg Combined\nSubjects randomised 244 242 242 484\nPercentage of subjects in clinical response and in sustained clinical response\nClinical response at week 8a 33.2% 66.9% 65.3% 66.1%\nClinical response at week 30a 27.9% 49.6% 55.4% 52.5%\nSustained response\n(clinical response at both\nweek 8 and week 30)a 19.3% 45.0% 49.6% 47.3%\n\nPercentage of subjects in clinical remission and sustained remission\nClinical remission at week 8a 10.2% 36.4% 29.8% 33.1%\nClinical remission at week 30a 13.1% 29.8% 36.4% 33.1%\nSustained remission\n(in remission at both\nweek 8 and week 30)a 5.3% 19.0% 24.4% 21.7%\n\nPercentage of subjects with mucosal healing\nMucosal healing at week 8a 32.4% 61.2% 60.3% 60.7%\nMucosal healing at week 30a 27.5% 48.3% 52.9% 50.6%\na\n\np < 0.001, for each infliximab treatment group vs. placebo.\n\nThe efficacy of Remicade through week 54 was assessed in the ACT 1 study.\nAt 54 weeks, 44.9% of patients in the combined infliximab treatment group were in clinical response \ncompared to 19.8% in the placebo treatment group (p < 0.001). Clinical remission and mucosal \nhealing occurred in a greater proportion of patients in the combined infliximab treatment group \ncompared to the placebo treatment group at week 54 (34.6% vs. 16.5%, p < 0.001 and 46.1% vs. \n18.2%, p < 0.001, respectively). The proportions of patients in sustained response and sustained \nremission at week 54 were greater in the combined infliximab treatment group than in the placebo \ntreatment group (37.9% vs. 14.0%, p < 0.001; and 20.2% vs. 6.6%, p < 0.001, respectively).\n\nA greater proportion of patients in the combined infliximab treatment group were able to discontinue \ncorticosteroids while remaining in clinical remission compared to the placebo treatment group at both \nweek 30 (22.3% vs. 7.2%, p < 0.001, pooled ACT 1 & ACT 2 data) and week 54 (21.0% vs. 8.9%, \np = 0.022, ACT1 data).\n\nThe pooled data analysis from the ACT 1 and ACT 2 studies and their extensions, analysed from \nbaseline through 54 weeks, demonstrated a reduction of ulcerative colitis-related hospitalisations and \nsurgical procedures with infliximab treatment. The number of ulcerative colitis-related \nhospitalisations was significantly lower in the 5 and 10 mg/kg infliximab treatment groups than in the \n\n\n\n29\n\nplacebo group (mean number of hospitalisations per 100 subject-years: 21 and 19 vs. 40 in the \nplacebo group; p = 0.019 and p = 0.007, respectively). The number of ulcerative colitis-related \nsurgical procedures was also lower in the 5 and 10 mg/kg infliximab treatment groups than in the \nplacebo group (mean number of surgical procedures per 100 subject-years: 22 and 19 vs. 34; \np = 0.145 and p = 0.022, respectively).\n\nThe proportion of subjects who underwent colectomy at any time within 54 weeks following the first \ninfusion of study agent were collected and pooled from the ACT 1 and ACT 2 studies and their \nextensions. Fewer subjects underwent colectomy in the 5 mg/kg infliximab group (28/242 or 11.6% \n[N.S.]) and the 10 mg/kg infliximab group (18/242 or 7.4% [p = 0.011]) than in the placebo group \n(36/244; 14.8%).\n\nThe reduction in incidence of colectomy was also examined in another randomised, double-blind \nstudy (C0168Y06) in hospitalised patients (n = 45) with moderately to severely active ulcerative \ncolitis who failed to respond to intravenous corticosteroids and who were therefore at higher risk for \ncolectomy. Significantly fewer colectomies occurred within 3 months of study infusion in patients \nwho received a single dose of 5 mg/kg infliximab compared to patients who received placebo (29.2% \nvs. 66.7% respectively, p = 0.017).\n\nIn ACT 1 and ACT 2, infliximab improved quality of life, confirmed by statistically significant \nimprovement in both a disease specific measure, IBDQ, and by improvement in the generic 36-item \nshort form survey SF-36.\n\nAdult ankylosing spondylitis\nEfficacy and safety of infliximab were assessed in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled \nstudies in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity \nIndex [BASDAI] score \u2265 4 and spinal pain \u2265 4 on a scale of 1-10).\n\nIn the first study (P01522), which had a 3 month double-blind phase, 70 patients received either \n5 mg/kg infliximab or placebo at weeks 0, 2, 6 (35 patients in each group). At week 12, placebo \npatients were switched to infliximab 5 mg/kg every 6 weeks up to week 54. After the first year of the \nstudy, 53 patients continued into an open-label extension to week 102.\n\nIn the second clinical study (ASSERT), 279 patients were randomised to receive either placebo\n(Group 1, n = 78) or 5 mg/kg infliximab (Group 2, n = 201) at 0, 2 and 6 weeks and every 6 weeks to \nweek 24. Thereafter, all subjects continued on infliximab every 6 weeks to week 96. Group 1 received \n5 mg/kg infliximab. In group 2, starting with the week 36 infusion, patients who had a BASDAI \u2265 3 at \n2 consecutive visits, received 7.5 mg/kg infliximab every 6 weeks thereafter through week 96.\n\nIn ASSERT, improvement in signs and symptoms was observed as early as week 2. At week 24, the \nnumber of ASAS 20 responders was 15/78 (19%) in the placebo group, and 123/201 (61%) in the \n5 mg/kg infliximab group (p < 0.001). There were 95 subjects from group 2 who continued on \n5 mg/kg every 6 weeks. At 102 weeks there were 80 subjects still on infliximab treatment and among \nthose, 71 (89%) were ASAS 20 responders.\n\nIn P01522, improvement in signs and symptoms was also observed as early as week 2. At week 12, \nthe number of BASDAI 50 responders were 3/35 (9%) in the placebo group, and 20/35 (57%) in the \n5 mg/kg group (p < 0.01). There were 53 subjects who continued on 5 mg/kg every 6 weeks. At \n102 weeks there were 49 subjects still on infliximab treatment and among those, 30 (61%) were \nBASDAI 50 responders.\n\nIn both studies, physical function and quality of life as measured by the BASFI and the physical \ncomponent score of the SF-36 were also improved significantly.\n\n\n\n30\n\nAdult psoriatic arthritis\nEfficacy and safety were assessed in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in \npatients with active psoriatic arthritis.\n\nIn the first clinical study (IMPACT), efficacy and safety of infliximab were studied in 104 patients \nwith active polyarticular psoriatic arthritis. During the 16-week double-blind phase, patients received \neither 5 mg/kg infliximab or placebo at weeks 0, 2, 6, and 14 (52 patients in each group). Starting at \nweek 16, placebo patients were switched to infliximab and all patients subsequently received 5 mg/kg \ninfliximab every 8 weeks up to week 46. After the first year of the study, 78 patients continued into an \nopen-label extension to week 98.\n\nIn the second clinical study (IMPACT 2), efficacy and safety of infliximab were studied in \n200 patients with active psoriatic arthritis (\u2265 5 swollen joints and \u2265 5 tender joints). Forty six percent \nof patients continued on stable doses of methotrexate (\u2264 25 mg/week). During the 24-week \ndouble-blind phase, patients received either 5 mg/kg infliximab or placebo at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, and 22 \n(100 patients in each group). At week 16, 47 placebo patients with < 10% improvement from baseline \nin both swollen and tender joint counts were switched to infliximab induction (early escape). At \nweek 24, all placebo-treated patients crossed over to infliximab induction. Dosing continued for all \npatients through week 46.\n\nKey efficacy results for IMPACT and IMPACT 2 are shown in Table 9 below:\n\nTable 9\nEffects on ACR and PASI in IMPACT and IMPACT 2\n\nIMPACT IMPACT 2*\nPlacebo \n\n(week 16)\nInfliximab \n(week 16)\n\nInfliximab\n(week 98)\n\nPlacebo\n(week 24)\n\nInfliximab \n(week 24)\n\nInfliximab\n(week 54)\n\nPatients randomised 52 52 N/Aa 100 100 100\n\nACR response\n(% of patients)\n\nN 52 52 78 100 100 100\nACR 20 response* 5(10%) 34 (65%) 48 (62%) 16 (16%) 54 (54%) 53 (53%)\nACR 50 response* 0(0%) 24 (46%) 35 (45%) 4 (4%) 41(41%) 33 (33%)\nACR 70 response* 0(0%) 15 (29%) 27 (35%) 2 (2%) 27 (27%) 20 (20%)\nPASI response\n(% of patients)b\n\nN 87 83 82\nPASI 75 response** 1 (1%) 50 (60%) 40 (48.8%)\n* ITT-analysis where subjects with missing data were included as non-responders.\na\n\nWeek 98 data for IMPACT includes combined placebo crossover and infliximab patients who entered the open-label \nextension.\n\nb\nBased on patients with PASI \u2265 2.5 at baseline for IMPACT, and patients with \u2265 3% BSA psoriasis skin involvement at \nbaseline in IMPACT 2.\n\n** PASI 75 response for IMPACT not included due to low N; p < 0.001 for infliximab vs. placebo at week 24 for \nIMPACT 2.\n\nIn IMPACT and IMPACT 2, clinical responses were observed as early as week 2 and were maintained \nthrough week 98 and week 54 respectively. Efficacy has been demonstrated with or without \nconcomitant use of methotrexate. Decreases in parameters of peripheral activity characteristic of \npsoriatic arthritis (such as number of swollen joints, number of painful/tender joints, dactylitis and \npresence of enthesopathy) were seen in the infliximab-treated patients.\n\nRadiographic changes were assessed in IMPACT 2. Radiographs of hands and feet were collected at \nbaseline, weeks 24 and 54. Infliximab treatment reduced the rate of progression of peripheral joint \ndamage compared with placebo treatment at the week 24 primary endpoint as measured by change \n\n\n\n31\n\nfrom baseline in total modified vdH-S score (mean \u00b1 SD score was 0.82 \u00b1 2.62 in the placebo group \ncompared with -0.70 \u00b1 2.53 in the infliximab group; p < 0.001). In the infliximab group, the mean \nchange in total modified vdH-S score remained below 0 at the week 54 timepoint.\n\nInfliximab-treated patients demonstrated significant improvement in physical function as assessed by \nHAQ. Significant improvements in health-related quality of life were also demonstrated as measured \nby the physical and mental component summary scores of the SF-36 in IMPACT 2.\n\nAdult psoriasis\nThe efficacy of infliximab was assessed in two multicenter, randomised, double-blind studies: SPIRIT \nand EXPRESS. Patients in both studies had plaque psoriasis (Body Surface Area [BSA] \u2265 10% and \nPsoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] score \u2265 12). The primary endpoint in both studies was the \npercent of patients who achieved \u2265 75% improvement in PASI from baseline at week 10.\n\nSPIRIT evaluated the efficacy of infliximab induction therapy in 249 patients with plaque psoriasis \nthat had previously received PUVA or systemic therapy. Patients received either 3 or 5 mg/kg \ninfliximab or placebo infusions at weeks 0, 2 and 6. Patients with a PGA score \u2265 3 were eligible to \nreceive an additional infusion of the same treatment at week 26.\nIn SPIRIT, the proportion of patients achieving PASI 75 at week 10 was 71.7% in the 3 mg/kg \ninfliximab group, 87.9% in the 5 mg/kg infliximab group, and 5.9% in the placebo group (p < 0.001). \nBy week 26, twenty weeks after the last induction dose, 30% of patients in the 5 mg/kg group and \n13.8% of patients in the 3 mg/kg group were PASI 75 responders. Between weeks 6 and 26, \nsymptoms of psoriasis gradually returned with a median time to disease relapse of > 20 weeks. No \nrebound was observed.\nEXPRESS evaluated the efficacy of infliximab induction and maintenance therapy in 378 patients \nwith plaque psoriasis. Patients received 5 mg/kg infliximab- or placebo-infusions at weeks 0, 2 and 6 \nfollowed by maintenance therapy every 8 weeks through week 22 in the placebo group and through \nweek 46 in the infliximab group. At week 24, the placebo group crossed over to infliximab induction \ntherapy (5 mg/kg) followed by infliximab maintenance therapy (5 mg/kg). Nail psoriasis was assessed \nusing the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI). Prior therapy with PUVA, methotrexate, ciclosporin, \nor acitretin had been received by 71.4% of patients, although they were not necessarily therapy \nresistant. Key results are presented in Table 10. In infliximab treated subjects, significant PASI 50 \nresponses were apparent at the first visit (week 2) and PASI 75 responses by the second visit \n(week 6). Efficacy was similar in the subgroup of patients that were exposed to previous systemic \ntherapies compared to the overall study population.\n\nTable 10\nSummary of PASI response, PGA response and percent of patients with all nails cleared at \n\nweeks 10, 24 and 50.

Mean baseline NAPSI scores were \n4.6 and 4.3 in infliximab and placebo group.\n\nSignificant improvements from baseline were demonstrated in DLQI (p < 0.001) and the physical and \nmental component scores of the SF 36 (p < 0.001 for each component comparison).\n\nPaediatric population\nPaediatric Crohn\u2019s disease (6 to 17 years)\nIn the REACH study, 112 patients (6 to 17 years, median age 13.0 years) with moderate to severe, \nactive Crohn\u2019s disease (median paediatric CDAI of 40) and an inadequate response to conventional \ntherapies were to receive 5 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, and 6. All patients were required to be on \na stable dose of 6-MP, AZA or MTX (35% were also receiving corticosteroids at baseline). Patients \nassessed by the investigator to be in clinical response at week 10 were randomised and received \n5 mg/kg infliximab at either q8 weeks or q12 weeks as a maintenance treatment regimen. If response \nwas lost during maintenance treatment, crossing over to a higher dose (10 mg/kg) and/or shorter \ndosing interval (q8 weeks) was allowed. Thirty two (32) evaluable paediatric patients crossed over \n(9 subjects in the q8 weeks and 23 subjects in the q12 weeks maintenance groups). Twenty four of \nthese patients (75.0%) regained clinical response after crossing over.\nThe proportion of subjects in clinical response at week 10 was 88.4% (99/112). The proportion of \nsubjects achieving clinical remission at week 10 was 58.9% (66/112).\nAt week 30, the proportion of subjects in clinical remission was higher in the q8 week (59.6%, 31/52) \nthan the q12 week maintenance treatment group (35.3%, 18/51; p = 0.013). At week 54, the figures \nwere 55.8% (29/52) and 23.5% (12/51) in the q8 weeks and q12 weeks maintenance groups, \nrespectively (p < 0.001).\nData about fistulas were derived from PCDAI scores. Of the 22 subjects that had fistulas at baseline, \n63.6% (14/22), 59.1% (13/22) and 68.2% (15/22) were in complete fistula response at week 10, 30 \nand 54, respectively, in the combined q8 weeks and q12 weeks maintenance groups.\n\nIn addition, statistically and clinically significant improvements in quality of life and height, as well \nas a significant reduction in corticosteroid use, were observed versus baseline.\n\nPaediatric ulcerative colitis (6 to 17 years)\nThe safety and efficacy of infliximab were assessed in a multicenter, randomised, open-label, \nparallel-group clinical study (C0168T72) in 60 paediatric patients aged 6 through 17 years (median \nage 14.5 years) with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (Mayo score of 6 to 12; \nendoscopic subscore \u2265 2) with an inadequate response to conventional therapies. At baseline 53% of \npatients were receiving immunomodulator therapy (6-MP, AZA and/or MTX) and 62% of patients \nwere receiving corticosteroids. Discontinuation of immunomodulators and corticosteroid taper were \npermitted after week 0.\n\nAll patients received an induction regimen of 5 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, and 6. Patients who \ndid not respond to infliximab at week 8 (n = 15) received no further medicinal product and returned \n\n\n\n33\n\nfor safety follow-up. At week 8, 45 patients were randomised and received 5 mg/kg infliximab at \neither q8 weeks or q12 weeks as a maintenance treatment regimen.\n\nThe proportion of patients in clinical response at week 8 was 73.3% (44/60). Clinical response at \nweek 8 was similar between those with or without concomitant immunomodulator use at baseline. \nClinical remission at week 8 was 33.3% (17/51) as measured by the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis \nActivity Index (PUCAI) score.\n\nAt week 54, the proportion of patients in clinical remission as measured by the PUCAI score was 38% \n(8/21) in the q8 week maintenance group and 18% (4/22) in the q12 week maintenance treatment \ngroup. For patients receiving corticosteroids at baseline, the proportion of patients in remission and \nnot receiving corticosteroids at week 54 was 38.5% (5/13) for the q8 week and 0% (0/13) for the \nq12 week maintenance treatment group.\n\nIn this study, there were more patients in the 12 to 17 year age group than in the 6 to 11 year age \ngroup (45/60 vs.15/60). While the numbers of patients in each subgroup are too small to draw \ndefinitive conclusions about the effect of age, there was a higher number of patients in the younger \nage group who stepped up in dose or discontinued treatment due to inadequate efficacy.\n\nOther paediatric indications\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nRemicade in all subsets of the paediatric population in rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic \narthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nSingle intravenous infusions of 1, 3, 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg of infliximab yielded dose proportional \nincreases in the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve \n(AUC). The volume of distribution at steady state (median Vd of 3.0 to 4.1 litres) was not dependent \non the administered dose and indicated that infliximab is predominantly distributed within the \nvascular compartment. No time-dependency of the Pharmacokinetics was observed. The elimination \npathways for infliximab have not been characterised. Unchanged infliximab was not detected in urine. \nNo major age- or weight-related differences in clearance or volume of distribution were observed in \nrheumatoid arthritis patients. The pharmacokinetics of infliximab in elderly patients has not been \nstudied. Studies have not been performed in patients with liver or renal disease.\n\nAt single doses of 3, 5, or 10 mg/kg, the median Cmax values were 77, 118 and 277 micrograms/ml, \nrespectively. The median terminal half-life at these doses ranged from 8 to 9.5 days. In most patients, \ninfliximab could be detected in the serum for at least 8 weeks after the recommended single dose of \n5 mg/kg for Crohn\u2019s disease and the rheumatoid arthritis maintenance dose of 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks.\n\nRepeated administration of infliximab (5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks in fistulising Crohn\u2019s disease, 3 or \n10 mg/kg every 4 or 8 weeks in rheumatoid arthritis) resulted in a slight accumulation of infliximab in \nserum after the second dose. No further clinically relevant accumulation was observed. In most \nfistulising Crohn\u2019s disease patients, infliximab was detected in serum for 12 weeks (range \n4-28 weeks) after administration of the regimen.\n\nPaediatric population\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis based on data obtained from patients with ulcerative colitis \n(N = 60), Crohn\u2019s disease (N = 112), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (N = 117) and Kawasaki disease \n(N = 16) with an overall age range from 2 months to 17 years indicated that exposure to infliximab \nwas dependent on body weight in a non-linear way. Following administration of 5 mg/kg Remicade \nevery 8 weeks, the predicted median steady-state infliximab exposure (area under concentration-time \ncurve at steady state, AUCss) in paediatric patients aged 6 years to 17 years was approximately 20% \nlower than the predicted median steady-state drug exposure in adults. The median AUCss in paediatric \n\n\n\n34\n\npatients aged 2 years to less than 6 years was predicted to be approximately 40% lower than that in \nadults, although the number of patients supporting this estimate is limited.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nInfliximab does not cross react with TNF\uf061 from species other than human and chimpanzees. \nTherefore, conventional preclinical safety data with infliximab are limited. In a developmental \ntoxicity study conducted in mice using an analogous antibody that selectively inhibits the functional \nactivity of mouse TNF\uf061, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or \nteratogenicity. In a fertility and general reproductive function study, the number of pregnant mice was \nreduced following administration of the same analogous antibody. It is not known whether this \nfinding was due to effects on the males and/or the females. In a 6-month repeated dose toxicity study \nin mice, using the same analogous antibody against mouse TNF\uf061, crystalline deposits were observed \non the lens capsule of some of the treated male mice. No specific ophthalmologic examinations have \nbeen performed in patients to investigate the relevance of this finding for humans.\nLong-term studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of infliximab. \nStudies in mice deficient in TNF\uf061 demonstrated no increase in tumours when challenged with known \ntumour initiators and/or promoters.\n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS\n\n6.1 List of excipients\n\nSucrose\nPolysorbate 80\nMonobasic sodium phosphate\nDibasic sodium phosphate\n\n6.2 Incompatibilities\n\nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other \nmedicinal products.\n\n6.3 Shelf life\n\nBefore reconstitution:\n3 years at 2 \u00b0C \u2013 8 \u00b0C.\n\nRemicade may be stored at temperatures up to a maximum of 25 \u00b0C for a single period of up to \n6 months, but not exceeding the original expiry date. The new expiry date must be written on the \ncarton. Upon removal from refrigerated storage, Remicade must not be returned to refrigerated \nstorage.\n\nAfter reconstitution and dilution:\nChemical and physical in use stability of the diluted solution has been demonstrated for up to 28 days \nat 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C and for an additional 24 hours at 25 \u00b0C after removal from refrigeration. From a \nmicrobiological point of view, the infusion solution should be administered immediately, in use \nstorage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be \nlonger than 24 hours at 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C, unless reconstitution/dilution has been taken place in controlled \nand validated aseptic conditions.\n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage\n\nStore in a refrigerator (2 \u00b0C - 8 \u00b0C).\n\n\n\n35\n\nFor storage conditions up to 25 \u00b0C before reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3.\n\nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3.\n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container\n\nType 1 glass vial with rubber stopper and aluminium crimp protected by a plastic cap.\n\nRemicade is available in packs of 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 vials.\n\nNot all pack sizes may be marketed.\n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling\n\n1. Calculate the dose and the number of Remicade vials needed. Each Remicade vial contains \n100 mg infliximab. Calculate the total volume of reconstituted Remicade solution required.\n\n2. Under aseptic conditions, reconstitute each Remicade vial with 10 ml of water for injections, \nusing a syringe equipped with a 21-gauge (0.8 mm) or smaller needle. Remove flip-top from the \nvial and wipe the top with a 70% alcohol swab. Insert the syringe needle into the vial through \nthe centre of the rubber stopper and direct the stream of water for injections to the glass wall of \nthe vial. Gently swirl the solution by rotating the vial to dissolve the lyophilised powder. Avoid \nprolonged or vigorous agitation. DO NOT SHAKE. Foaming of the solution on reconstitution is \nnot unusual. Allow the reconstituted solution to stand for 5 minutes. Check that the solution is \ncolourless to light yellow and opalescent. The solution may develop a few fine translucent \nparticles, as infliximab is a protein. Do not use if opaque particles, discolouration, or other \nforeign particles are present.\n\n3. Dilute the total volume of the reconstituted Remicade solution dose to 250 ml with sodium \nchloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. Do not dilute the reconstituted Remicade \nsolution with any other diluent. The dilution can be accomplished by withdrawing a volume of \nthe sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion from the 250-ml glass bottle or \ninfusion bag equal to the volume of reconstituted Remicade. Slowly add the total volume of \nreconstituted Remicade solution to the 250-ml infusion bottle or bag. Gently mix. For volumes \ngreater than 250 ml, either use a larger infusion bag (e.g. 500 ml, 1000 ml) or use multiple \n250 ml infusion bags to ensure that the concentration of the infusion solution does not exceed \n4 mg/ml. If stored refrigerated after reconstitution and dilution, the infusion solution must be \nallowed to equilibrate at room temperature to 25 \u00b0C for 3 hours prior to Step 4 (infusion). \nStorage beyond 24 hours at 2 \u00b0C - 8 \u00b0C applies to preparation of Remicade in the infusion bag \nonly.\n\n4. Administer the infusion solution over a period of not less than the infusion time recommended \n(see section 4.2). Use only an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low \nprotein-binding filter (pore size 1.2 micrometre or less). Since no preservative is present, it is \nrecommended that the administration of the solution for infusion is to be started as soon as \npossible and within 3 hours of reconstitution and dilution. If not used immediately, in use \nstorage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally \nnot be longer than 24 hours at 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C, unless reconstitution/dilution has been taken place \nin controlled and validated aseptic conditions, (see section 6.3 above). Do not store any unused \nportion of the infusion solution for reuse.\n\n5. No physical biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the \nco-administration of Remicade with other agents. Do not infuse Remicade concomitantly in the \nsame intravenous line with other agents.\n\n\n\n36\n\n6. Visually inspect Remicade for particulate matter or discolouration prior to administration. Do \nnot use if visibly opaque particles, discolouration or foreign particles are observed.\n\n7. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements.\n\n7.

You may need to read it again.\n\uf0b7 Your doctor will also give you a patient reminder card, which contains important safety \n\ninformation you need to be aware of before and during your treatment with Remicade.\n\uf0b7 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor.\n\uf0b7 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n\uf0b7 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet:\n1. What Remicade is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use Remicade\n3. How Remicade will be given\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Remicade\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Remicade is and what it is used for\n\nRemicade contains the active substance infliximab. Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody \u2013 a type of \nprotein that attaches to a specific target in the body called TNF (tumour necrosis factor) alpha.\n\nRemicade belongs to a group of medicines called \u2018TNF blockers\u2019. It is used in adults for the following \ninflammatory diseases:\n\uf0b7 Rheumatoid arthritis\n\uf0b7 Psoriatic arthritis\n\uf0b7 Ankylosing spondylitis (Bechterew\u2019s disease)\n\uf0b7 Psoriasis.\n\nRemicade is also used in adults and children 6 years of age or older for:\n\uf0b7 Crohn\u2019s disease\n\uf0b7 Ulcerative colitis.\n\nRemicade works by selectively attaching to TNF alpha and blocking its action. TNF alpha is involved \nin inflammatory processes of the body so blocking it can reduce the inflammation in your body.\n\nRheumatoid arthritis\nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. If you have active rheumatoid arthritis \nyou will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given \nRemicade which you will take in combination with another medicine called methotrexate to:\n\uf0b7 Reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease\n\uf0b7 Slow down the damage in your joints\n\uf0b7 Improve your physical function.\n\n\n\n49\n\nPsoriatic arthritis\nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints, usually accompanied by psoriasis. If you \nhave active psoriatic arthritis you will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work \nwell enough, you will be given Remicade to:\n\uf0b7 Reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease\n\uf0b7 Slow down the damage in your joints\n\uf0b7 Improve your physical function.\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis (Bechterew\u2019s disease)\nAnkylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory disease of the spine. If you have ankylosing spondylitis \nyou will first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given \nRemicade to:\n\uf0b7 Reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease\n\uf0b7 Improve your physical function.\n\nPsoriasis\nPsoriasis is an inflammatory disease of the skin. If you have moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, you \nwill first be given other medicines or treatments, such as phototherapy. If these medicines or \ntreatments do not work well enough, you will be given Remicade to reduce the signs and symptoms of \nyour disease.\n\nUlcerative colitis\nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first \nbe given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Remicade to \ntreat your disease.\n\nCrohn\u2019s disease\nCrohn\u2019s disease is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. If you have Crohn\u2019s disease you will first be \ngiven other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Remicade to:\n\uf0b7 Treat active Crohn\u2019s disease\n\uf0b7 Reduce the number of abnormal openings (fistulae) between your bowel and your skin that \n\nhave not been controlled by other medicines or surgery.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Remicade\n\nYou should not be given Remicade if:\n\uf0b7 You are allergic to infliximab or to any of the other ingredients in Remicade (listed in \n\nsection 6).\n\uf0b7 You are allergic (hypersensitive) to proteins that come from mice.\n\uf0b7 You have tuberculosis (TB) or another serious infection such as pneumonia or sepsis.\n\uf0b7 You have heart failure that is moderate or severe.\n\nDo not use Remicade if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before \nyou are given Remicade.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor before or during treatment with Remicade if you have:\n\nHad treatment with Remicade before\n\uf0b7 Tell your doctor if you have had treatment with Remicade in the past and are now \n\nstarting Remicade treatment again.\nIf you have had a break in your Remicade treatment of more than 16 weeks, there is a higher \nrisk for allergic reactions when you start the treatment again.\n\n\n\n50\n\nInfections\n\uf0b7 Tell your doctor before you are given Remicade if you have an infection even if it is a \n\nvery minor one.\n\uf0b7 Tell your doctor before you are given Remicade if you have ever lived in or travelled to \n\nan area where infections called histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis are \ncommon. These infections are caused by specific types of fungi that can affect the lungs \nor other parts of your body.\n\n\uf0b7 You may get infections more easily when you are being treated with Remicade. If you \nare 65 or older, you have a greater risk.\n\n\uf0b7 These infections may be serious and include tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, \nfungi, bacteria, or other organisms in the environment and sepsis that may be\nlife-threatening.\n\nTell your doctor straight away if you get signs of infection during treatment with Remicade. \nSigns include fever, cough, flu-like signs, feeling unwell, red or hot skin, wounds or dental \nproblems. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Remicade.\n\nTuberculosis (TB)\n\uf0b7 It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had TB or if you have been \n\nin close contact with someone who has had or has TB.\n\uf0b7 Your doctor will test you to see if you have TB. Cases of TB have been reported in \n\npatients treated with Remicade, even in patients who have already been treated with \nmedicines for TB. Your doctor will record these tests on your patient reminder card.\n\n\uf0b7 If your doctor feels that you are at risk for TB, you may be treated with medicines for TB \nbefore you are given Remicade.\n\nTell your doctor straight away if you get signs of TB during treatment with Remicade. Signs \ninclude persistent cough, weight loss, feeling tired, fever, night sweats.\n\nHepatitis B virus\n\uf0b7 Tell your doctor before you are given Remicade if you are a carrier of hepatitis B or have \n\never had it.\n\uf0b7 Tell your doctor if you think you might be at risk of contracting hepatitis B.\n\uf0b7 Your doctor should test you for hepatitis B virus.\n\uf0b7 Treatment with TNF blockers such as Remicade may result in reactivation of hepatitis B \n\nvirus in patients who carry this virus, which can be life-threatening in some cases.\n\nHeart problems\n\uf0b7 Tell your doctor if you have any heart problems, such as mild heart failure.\n\uf0b7 Your doctor will want to closely monitor your heart.\nTell your doctor straight away if you get new or worsening signs of heart failure during \ntreatment with Remicade. Signs include shortness of breath or swelling of your feet.\n\nCancer and lymphoma\n\uf0b7 Tell your doctor before you are given Remicade if you have or have ever had lymphoma \n\n(a type of blood cancer) or any other cancer.\n\uf0b7 Patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who have had the disease for a long time, may \n\nbe at higher risk of developing lymphoma.\n\uf0b7 Children and adults taking Remicade may have an increased risk of developing \n\nlymphoma or another cancer.\n\uf0b7 Some patients who have received TNF-blockers, including Remicade have developed a \n\nrare type of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. Of these patients, most were \nteenage boys or young men and most had either Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis. \nThis type of cancer has usually resulted in death. Almost all patients had also received \nmedicines containing azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine in addition to TNF-blockers.\n\n\n\n51\n\n\uf0b7 Some patients treated with infliximab have developed certain kinds of skin cancer. If \nthere are any changes in your skin or growths on the skin during or after therapy, tell \nyour doctor.\n\n\uf0b7 Some women being treated for rheumatoid arthritis with Remicade have developed \ncervical cancer. For women taking Remicade including those over 60 years of age, your \ndoctor may recommend regular screening for cervical cancer.\n\nLung disease or heavy smoking\n\uf0b7 Tell your doctor before you are given Remicade if you have a lung disease called \n\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or if you are a heavy smoker.\n\uf0b7 Patients with COPD and patients who are heavy smokers may have a higher risk of \n\ndeveloping cancer with Remicade treatment.\n\nNervous system disease\n\uf0b7 Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a problem that affects your nervous system \n\nbefore you are given Remicade. This includes multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barre \nsyndrome, if you have fits or have been diagnosed with \u2018optic neuritis\u2019.\n\nTell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of a nerve disease during treatment with \nRemicade. Signs include changes in your vision, weakness in your arms or legs, numbness or \ntingling in any part of your body.\n\nAbnormal skin openings\n\uf0b7 Tell your doctor if you have any abnormal skin openings (fistulae) before you are given \n\nRemicade.\n\nVaccinations\n\uf0b7 Talk to your doctor if you recently have had or are due to have a vaccine.\n\uf0b7 You should receive recommended vaccinations before starting Remicade treatment. You \n\nmay receive some vaccines during treatment with Remicade but you should not receive \nlive vaccines (vaccines that contain a living but weakened infectious agent) while using \nRemicade because they may cause infections.\n\n\uf0b7 If you received Remicade while you were pregnant, your baby may also be at higher risk\nfor getting an infection with live vaccines for up to six months after birth. It is important \nthat you tell your baby's doctors and other healthcare professionals about your Remicade \nuse so they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine, including live \nvaccines such as BCG (used to prevent tuberculosis). For more information see section \non Pregnancy and breast-feeding.\n\nTherapeutic infectious agents\n\uf0b7 Talk to you doctor if you have recently received or are scheduled to receive treatment \n\nwith a therapeutic infectious agent (such as BCG instillation used for the treatment of \ncancer).\n\nOperations or dental procedures\n\uf0b7 Tell your doctor if you are going to have any operations or dental procedures.\n\uf0b7 Tell your surgeon or dentist that you are having treatment with Remicade by showing \n\nthem your patient reminder card.\n\nLiver problems\n\uf0b7 Some patients receiving Remicade have developed serious liver problems.\nTell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of liver problems during treatment with \nRemicade. Signs include yellowing of the skin and eyes, dark-brown coloured urine, pain or \nswelling in the upper right side of the stomach area, joint pain, skin rashes, or fever.\n\n\n\n52\n\nLow blood counts\n\uf0b7 In some patients receiving Remicade, the body may not make enough of the blood cells \n\nthat help fight infections or help stop bleeding.\nTell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of low blood counts during treatment with \nRemicade. Signs include persistent fever, bleeding or bruising more easily, small red or purple spots \ncaused by bleeding under the skin, or looking pale.\n\nImmune system disorder\n\uf0b7 Some patients receiving Remicade have developed symptoms of an immune system \n\ndisorder called lupus.\nTell your doctor straight away if you develop symptoms of lupus during treatment with \nRemicade. Signs include joint pain or a rash on cheeks or arms that is sensitive to the sun.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThe information above also applies to children and adolescents. In addition:\n\uf0b7 Some children and teenage patients who have received TNF-blockers such as Remicade \n\nhave developed cancers, including unusual types, which sometimes resulted in death.\n\uf0b7 More children taking Remicade developed infections as compared to adults.\n\uf0b7 Children should receive recommended vaccinations before starting Remicade treatment. \n\nChildren may receive some vaccines during treatment with Remicade but should not \nreceive live vaccines while using Remicade.\n\nIf you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor before you are given \nRemicade.\n\nOther medicines and Remicade\nPatients who have inflammatory diseases already take medicines to treat their problem. These \nmedicines may cause side effects. Your doctor will advise you what other medicines you must keep \nusing while you are having Remicade.\n\nTell your doctor if you are using or have recently used any other medicines, including any other \nmedicines to treat Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, \npsoriatic arthritis or psoriasis or medicines obtained without a prescription, such as vitamins and \nherbal medicines.\n\nIn particular, tell your doctor if you are using any of the following medicines:\n\uf0b7 Medicines that affect your immune system.\n\uf0b7 Kineret (anakinra). Remicade and Kineret should not be used together.\n\uf0b7 Orencia (abatacept). Remicade and Orencia should not be used together.\n\nWhile using Remicade you should not receive live vaccines. If you were using Remicade during \npregnancy, tell your baby\u2019s doctor and other healthcare professionals caring for your baby about your \nRemicade use before the baby receives any vaccines.\n\nIf you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using \nRemicade.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility\n\uf0b7 If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \n\nask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Remicade should only be used during \npregnancy if your doctor feels it is necessary for you.\n\n\uf0b7 You should avoid getting pregnant when you are being treated with Remicade and for 6 months \nafter you stop being treated with it. Discuss the use of contraception during this time with your \ndoctor.\n\n\n\n53\n\n\uf0b7 Do not breast-feed when you are being treated with Remicade or for 6 months after your last \ntreatment with Remicade.\n\n\uf0b7 If you received Remicade during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting \nan infection.\n\n\uf0b7 It is important that you tell your baby\u2019s doctors and other healthcare professionals about your \nRemicade use before your baby is given any vaccine. If you received Remicade while pregnant, \ngiving BCG vaccine (used to prevent tuberculosis) to your baby within 6 months after birth may\nresult in infection with serious complications, including death. Live vaccines such as BCG \nshould not be given to your baby within 6 months after birth. For more information see section\non vaccination.\n\n\uf0b7 Severely decreased numbers of white blood cells have been reported in infants born to women \ntreated with Remicade during pregnancy. If your baby has continual fevers or infections, \ncontact your baby\u2019s doctor immediately.\n\nDriving and using machines\nRemicade is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use tools or machines. If you feel tired, dizzy,\nor unwell after having Remicade, do not drive or use any tools or machines.\n\nRemicade contains sodium\nRemicade contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \nHowever, before Remicade is given to you, it is mixed with a solution that contains sodium. Talk to \nyour doctor if you are on a low salt diet.\n\n3. How Remicade will be given\n\nRheumatoid arthritis\nThe usual dose is 3 mg for every kg of body weight.\n\nPsoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis (Bechterew\u2019s disease), psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and \nCrohn's disease\nThe usual dose is 5 mg for every kg of body weight.\n\nHow Remicade is given\n\uf0b7 Remicade will be given to you by your doctor or nurse.\n\uf0b7 Your doctor or nurse will prepare the medicine for infusion.\n\uf0b7 The medicine will be given as an infusion (drip) (over 2 hours) into one of your veins, usually \n\nin your arm. After the third treatment, your doctor may decide to give your dose of Remicade \nover 1 hour.\n\n\uf0b7 You will be monitored while you are given Remicade and also for 1 to 2 hours afterwards.\n\nHow much Remicade is given\n\uf0b7 The doctor will decide your dose and how often you will be given Remicade. This will depend \n\non your disease, weight and how well you respond to Remicade.\n\uf0b7 The table below shows how often you will usually have this medicine after your first dose.\n\n2nd dose 2 weeks after your 1st dose\n3rd dose 6 weeks after your 1st dose\nFurther doses Every 6 to 8 weeks depending on your disease \n\nUse in children and adolescents\nRemicade should only be used in children if they are being treated for Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative \ncolitis. These children must be 6 years of age or older.\n\n\n\n54\n\nIf you are given too much Remicade\nAs this medicine is being given by your doctor or nurse, it is unlikely that you will be given too much. \nThere are no known side effects of having too much of Remicade.\n\nIf you forget or miss your Remicade infusion\nIf you forget or miss an appointment to receive Remicade, make another appointment as soon as \npossible.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.\n\n4.

The new expiry date must be written on the \ncarton. Upon removal from refrigerated storage, Remicade must not be returned to refrigerated \nstorage.\n\nInstructions for use and handling \u2013 reconstitution, dilution and administration\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and batch number \nof the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded.\n\n1. Calculate the dose and the number of Remicade vials needed. Each Remicade vial contains \n100 mg infliximab. Calculate the total volume of reconstituted Remicade solution required.\n\n2. Under aseptic conditions, reconstitute each Remicade vial with 10 ml of water for injections, \nusing a syringe equipped with a 21-gauge (0.8 mm) or smaller needle. Remove flip-top from the \nvial and wipe the top with a 70% alcohol swab. Insert the syringe needle into the vial through \nthe centre of the rubber stopper and direct the stream of water for injections to the glass wall of \nthe vial. Gently swirl the solution by rotating the vial to dissolve the lyophilised powder. Avoid \nprolonged or vigorous agitation. DO NOT SHAKE. Foaming of the solution on reconstitution is \nnot unusual. Allow the reconstituted solution to stand for 5 minutes. Check that the solution is \ncolourless to light yellow and opalescent. The solution may develop a few fine translucent \nparticles, as infliximab is a protein. Do not use if opaque particles, discolouration, or other \nforeign particles are present.\n\n3. Dilute the total volume of the reconstituted Remicade solution dose to 250 ml with sodium \nchloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. Do not dilute the reconstituted Remicade \nsolution with any other diluent. The dilution can be accomplished by withdrawing a volume of \nthe sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion from the 250-ml glass bottle or \ninfusion bag equal to the volume of reconstituted Remicade. Slowly add the total volume of \nreconstituted Remicade solution to the 250-ml infusion bottle or bag. Gently mix. For volumes \ngreater than 250 ml, either use a larger infusion bag (e.g. 500 ml, 1000 ml) or use multiple \n250 ml infusion bags to ensure that the concentration of the infusion solution does not exceed \n4 mg/ml. If stored refrigerated after reconstitution and dilution, the infusion solution must be \nallowed to equilibrate at room temperature to 25 \u00b0C for 3 hours prior to Step 4 (infusion). \nStorage beyond 24 hours at 2 \u00b0C - 8 \u00b0C applies to preparation of Remicade in the infusion bag \nonly.\n\n4. Administer the infusion solution over a period of not less than the infusion time recommended. \nUse only an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding filter (pore \nsize 1.2 micrometre or less). Since no preservative is present, it is recommended that the \nadministration of the solution for infusion is to be started as soon as possible and within 3 hours \nof reconstitution and dilution. If not used immediately, in use storage times and conditions prior \nto use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at \n2 \u00b0C - 8 \u00b0C, unless reconstitution/dilution has been taken place in controlled and validated \naseptic conditions. Do not store any unused portion of the infusion solution for reuse.\n\n\n\n61\n\n5.

type of protein that attaches to a specific target in the body called tnf (tumour necrosis factor) alpha. remicade belongs to a group of medicines called 'tnf blockers'. it is used in adults for the following inflammatory diseases: rheumatoid arthritis psoriatic arthritis ankylosing spondylitis (bechterew's disease) psoriasis. remicade is also used in adults and children 6 years of age or older for: crohn's disease ulcerative colitis. remicade works by selectively attaching to tnf alpha and blocking its action. tnf alpha is involved in inflammatory processes of the body so blocking it can reduce the inflammation in your body. rheumatoid arthritis rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. if you have active rheumatoid arthritis you will first be given other

should not be given remicade if: you are allergic to infliximab or to any of the other ingredients in remicade (listed in section 6). you are allergic (hypersensitive) to proteins that come from mice. you have tuberculosis (tb) or another serious infection such as pneumonia or sepsis. you have heart failure that is moderate or severe. do not use remicade if any of the above applies to you. if you are not sure, talk to your doctor before you are given remicade. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before or during treatment with remicade if you have: had treatment with remicade before tell your doctor if you have had treatment with remicade in the past and are now starting remicade treatment again. if you have had a break in your remicade treatment of more than 16 weeks, there is a higher risk for allergic reactions when you start the treatment again. infections tell your doctor before you are given remicade if you have an infection even if it is a very minor one. tell your doctor before you are given remicade if you have ever lived in or travelled to an area where infections called histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis are common. these infections are caused by specific types of fungi that can affect the lungs or other parts of your body. you may get infections more easily when you are being treated with remicade. if you are 65 or older, you have a greater risk. these infections may be serious and include tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, bacteria, or other organisms in the environment and sepsis that may be life-threatening. tell your doctor straight away if you get signs of infection during treatment with remicade. signs include fever, cough, flu-like signs, feeling unwell, red or hot skin, wounds or dental problems. your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping remicade. tuberculosis (tb) it is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tb or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had or has tb. your doctor will test you to see if you have tb. cases of tb have been reported in patients treated with remicade, even in patients who have already been treated with medicines for tb. your doctor will record these tests on your patient reminder card. if your doctor feels that you are at risk for tb, you may be treated with medicines for tb before you are given remicade. tell your doctor straight away if you get signs of tb during treatment with remicade. signs include persistent cough, weight loss, feeling tired, fever, night sweats. hepatitis b virus tell your doctor before you are given remicade if you are a carrier of hepatitis b or have ever had it. tell your doctor if you think you might be at risk of contracting hepatitis b. your doctor should test you for hepatitis b virus. treatment with tnf blockers such as remicade may result in reactivation of hepatitis b virus in patients who carry this virus, which can be life-threatening in some cases. heart problems tell your doctor if you have any heart problems, such as mild heart failure. your doctor will want to closely monitor your heart. tell your doctor straight away if you get new or worsening signs of heart failure during treatment with remicade. signs include shortness of breath or swelling of your feet. cancer and lymphoma tell your doctor before you are given remicade if you have or have ever had lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) or any other cancer. patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who have had the disease for a long time, may be at higher risk of developing lymphoma. children and adults taking remicade may have an increased risk of developing lymphoma or another cancer. some patients who have received tnf-blockers, including remicade have developed a rare type of cancer called hepatosplenic t-cell lymphoma. of these patients, most were teenage boys or young men and most had either crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. this type of cancer has usually resulted in death. almost all patients had also received medicines containing azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine in addition to tnf-blockers. some patients treated with infliximab have developed certain kinds of skin cancer. if there are any changes in your skin or growths on the skin during or after therapy, tell your doctor. some women being treated for rheumatoid arthritis with remicade have developed cervical cancer. for women taking remicade including those over 60 years of age, your doctor may recommend regular screening for cervical cancer. lung disease or heavy smoking tell your doctor before you are given remicade if you have a lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) or if you are a heavy smoker. patients with copd and patients who are heavy smokers may have a higher risk of developing cancer with remicade treatment. nervous system disease tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a problem that affects your nervous system before you are given remicade. this includes multiple sclerosis, guillain-barre syndrome, if you have fits or have been diagnosed with 'optic neuritis'. tell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of a nerve disease during treatment with remicade. signs include changes in your vision, weakness in your arms or legs, numbness or tingling in any part of your body. abnormal skin openings tell your doctor if you have any abnormal skin openings (fistulae) before you are given remicade. vaccinations talk to your doctor if you recently have had or are due to have a vaccine. you should receive recommended vaccinations before starting remicade treatment. you may receive some vaccines during treatment with remicade but you should not receive live vaccines (vaccines that contain a living but weakened infectious agent) while using remicade because they may cause infections. if you received remicade while you were pregnant, your baby may also be at higher risk for getting an infection with live vaccines for up to six months after birth. it is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other healthcare professionals about your remicade use so they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine, including live vaccines such as bcg (used to prevent tuberculosis). for more information see section on pregnancy and breast-feeding. therapeutic infectious agents talk to you doctor if you have recently received or are scheduled to receive treatment with a therapeutic infectious agent (such as bcg instillation used for the treatment of cancer). operations or dental procedures tell your doctor if you are going to have any operations or dental procedures. tell your surgeon or dentist that you are having treatment with remicade by showing them your patient reminder card. liver problems some patients receiving remicade have developed serious liver problems. tell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of liver problems during treatment with remicade. signs include yellowing of the skin and
