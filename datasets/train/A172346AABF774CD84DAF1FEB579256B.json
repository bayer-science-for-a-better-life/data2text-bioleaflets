NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nSprimeo 150 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 150 mg aliskiren (as hemifumarate). \n\n \n\nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet \n\n \n\nLight-pink, biconvex, round tablet, imprinted \u201cIL\u201d on one side and \u201cNVR\u201d on the other side. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of essential hypertension. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Sprimeo is 150 mg once daily. In patients whose blood pressure is not \n\nadequately controlled, the dose may be increased to 300 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nThe antihypertensive effect is substantially present within two weeks (85-90%) after initiating therapy \n\nwith 150 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nSprimeo may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents with the exception \n\nof use in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blockers (ARB) in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration \n\nrate (GFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nSprimeo should be taken with a light meal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. \n\nGrapefruit juice should not be taken together with Sprimeo. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 5.2). Sprimeo is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR \n\n< 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Concomitant use of Sprimeo with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in \n\npatients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\nElderly patients (over 65 years) \n\nThe recommended starting dose of aliskiren in elderly patients is 150 mg. No clinically meaningful \n\nadditional blood pressure reduction is observed by increasing the dose to 300 mg in the majority of \n\nelderly patients. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric patients (below 18 years) \n\nSprimeo is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below age 18 due to a lack of data on \n\nsafety and efficacy (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n\n \n\nHistory of angioedema with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nHereditary or idiopathic angioedema. \n\n \n\nSecond and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\nThe concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin and itraconazole, two highly potent P-gp inhibitors, \n\nand other potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. quinidine), is contraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nThe concomitant use of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nAliskiren should be used with caution in patients with serious congestive heart failure (New York \n\nHeart Association [NYHA] functional class III-IV). \n\n \n\nIn the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea, Sprimeo therapy should be stopped. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nHypotension, syncope, stroke, hyperkalaemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal \n\nfailure) have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that \n\naffect this system (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by \n\ncombining aliskiren with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blocker (ARB) is therefore not recommended. \n\n \n\nThe use of aliskiren in combination with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nAngioedema \n\nAs with other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, angioedema or symptoms suggestive of \n\nangioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or tongue) have been reported in patients treated \n\nwith aliskiren. \n\n \n\nA number of these patients had a history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema, \n\nwhich in some cases followed use of other medicines that can cause angioedema, including RAAS \n\nblockers (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nPatients with a history of angioedema may be at increased risk of experiencing angioedema during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Caution should therefore be exercised when \n\nprescribing aliskiren to patients with a history of angioedema, and such patients should be closely \n\nmonitored during treatment (see section 4.8) especially at the beginning of the treatment. \n\n \n\nIf angioedema occurs, Sprimeo should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and \n\nmonitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. \n\nWhere there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx adrenaline should be administered. In \n\naddition, measures necessary to maintain patent airways should be provided. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nSodium and/or volume depleted patients \n\nIn patients with marked volume- and/or salt-depletion (e.g. those receiving high doses of diuretics) \n\nsymptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Sprimeo. This condition \n\nshould be corrected prior to administration of Sprimeo, or the treatment should start under close \n\nmedical supervision. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn clinical studies Sprimeo has not been investigated in hypertensive patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (serum creatinine \u2265 150 \u03bcmol/l or 1.70 mg/dl in women and \u2265 177 \u03bcmol/l or 2.00 mg/dl in \n\nmen and/or estimated GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n), history of dialysis, nephrotic syndrome or \n\nrenovascular hypertension. Sprimeo is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment \n\n(GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). \n\n \n\nAs for other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, caution should be exercised when aliskiren \n\nis given in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction such as hypovolaemia (eg. \n\ndue to blood loss, severe prolonged diarrhoea, prolonged vomiting, etc.), heart disease, liver disease, \n\ndiabetes mellitus or kidney disease. The concomitant use of aliskiren and ACEIs or ARBs is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Acute renal failure, \n\nreversible upon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients receiving aliskiren \n\nin post-marketing experience. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, aliskiren should be \n\npromptly discontinued. \n\n \n\nIncreases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in post-marketing experience and \n\nthese may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by non-steroidal \n\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Consistent with standard medical practice, periodic determination \n\nof renal function including serum electrolytes is advised if co-administration is considered necessary. \n\n \n\nRenal artery stenosis \n\nNo controlled clinical data are available on the use of Sprimeo in patients with unilateral or bilateral \n\nrenal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, as with other agents acting on the \n\nrenin-angiotensin system, there is an increased risk of renal insufficiency, including acute renal \n\nfailure, when patients with renal artery stenosis are treated with aliskiren. Therefore, caution should \n\nbe exercised in these patients. If renal failure occurs, treatment should be discontinued. \n\n \n\nModerate P-gp inhibitors \n\nCo-administration of aliskiren 300 mg with ketoconazole 200 mg or verapamil 240 mg resulted in a \n\n76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. Therefore caution should be exercised when \n\naliskiren is administered with moderate P-gp inhibitors such as ketoconazole or verapamil (see section \n\n4.5). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nThe combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients \n\n(see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nCompounds that have been investigated in clinical pharmacokinetic studies include acenocoumarol, \n\natenolol, celecoxib, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate and hydrochlorothiazide. No \n\ninteractions have been identified. \n\n \n\nCo-administration of aliskiren with either metformin (\u219328%), amlodipine (\u219129%) or cimetidine \n\n(\u219119%) resulted in between 20% and 30% change in Cmax or AUC of Sprimeo. When administered \n\nwith atorvastatin, steady-state Sprimeo AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. Co-administration of \n\nSprimeo had no significant impact on atorvastatin, metformin or amlodipine pharmacokinetics. As a \n\nresult no dose adjustment for Sprimeo or these co-administered medicinal products is necessary. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nDigoxin and verapamil bioavailability may be slightly decreased by Sprimeo. \n\n \n\nIn experimental animals, it has been shown that P-gp is a major determinant of Sprimeo \n\nbioavailability. Inducers of P-gp (St. John\u2019s wort, rifampicin) might therefore decrease the \n\nbioavailability of Sprimeo. \n\n \n\nCYP450 interactions \n\nAliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A). \n\nAliskiren does not induce CYP3A4. Therefore aliskiren is not expected to affect the systemic \n\nexposure of substances that inhibit, induce or are metabolised by these enzymes. Aliskiren is \n\nmetabolised minimally by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Hence, interactions due to inhibition or \n\ninduction of CYP450 isoenzymes are not expected. However, CYP3A4 inhibitors often also affect P-\n\ngp. Increased aliskiren exposure during co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors that also inhibit P-gp \n\ncan therefore be expected (see P-glycoprotein interactions below). \n\n \n\nP-glycoprotein interactions \n\nMDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption and \n\nbiliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies. Rifampicin, which is an inducer of P-gp, reduced \n\naliskiren bioavailability by approximately 50% in a clinical study. Other inducers of P-gp (St. John\u2019s \n\nwort) might decrease the bioavailability of Sprimeo. Although this has not been investigated for \n\naliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake of a variety of substrates and P-gp \n\ninhibitors can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. Therefore, P-gp inhibitors may \n\nincrease tissue levels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug interactions at the P-gp site will \n\nlikely depend on the degree of inhibition of this transporter. \n\n \n\nP-gp potent inhibitors \n\nA single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) \n\nincreases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold. The increase \n\nmay be higher with higher aliskiren doses. In healthy subjects, itraconazole (100 mg) increases AUC \n\nand Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, respectively. Therefore, concomitant use of \n\naliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nModerate P-gp inhibitors \n\nCo-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) or verapamil (240 mg) with aliskiren (300 mg) resulted \n\nin a 76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in \n\nthe presence of ketoconazole or verapamil is expected to be within the range that would be achieved if \n\nthe dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice the highest \n\nrecommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical trials. \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances aliskiren \n\ngastrointestinal absorption and decreases biliary excretion. Therefore, caution should be exercised \n\nwhen aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole, verapamil or other moderate P-gp inhibitors \n\n(clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). \n\n \n\nP-gp substrates or weak inhibitors \n\nNo relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or cimetidine have been observed. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren (300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by \n\n50%. \n\n \n\nOrganic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren might be a substrate of organic anion transporting \n\npolypeptides. Therefore, the potential exists for interactions between OATP inhibitors and aliskiren \n\nwhen administered concomitantly (see interaction with Grapefruit juice). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nFurosemide \n\nWhen aliskiren was co-administered with furosemide, the AUC and Cmax of furosemide were reduced \n\nby 28% and 49% respectively. It is therefore recommended that the effects be monitored when \n\ninitiating and adjusting furosemide therapy to avoid possible underutilisation in clinical situations of \n\nvolume overload. \n\n \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \n\nAs with other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, NSAIDs may reduce the anti-\n\nhypertensive effect of aliskiren. In some patients with compromised renal function (dehydrated \n\npatients or elderly patients) aliskiren given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in further \n\ndeterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. \n\nTherefore the combination of aliskiren with an NSAID requires caution, especially in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affecting serum potassium levels \n\nConcomitant use of other agents affecting the RAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum \n\npotassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium. If co-medication with an agent \n\naffecting the level of serum potassium is considered necessary, caution is advisable. The combination \n\nof aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal \n\nimpairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, \n\n4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nGrapefruit juice \n\nAdministration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of aliskiren. \n\nCo-administration with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren AUC and co-\n\nadministration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. This decrease is \n\nlikely due to an inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren by \n\ngrapefruit juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic failure, \n\ngrapefruit juice should not be taken together with Sprimeo. \n\n \n\nWarfarin \n\nThe effects of Sprimeo on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. \n\n \n\nFood intake \n\nMeals with a high fat content have been shown to reduce the absorption of Sprimeo substantially. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women. Sprimeo was not teratogenic in rats or \n\nrabbits (see section 5.3). Other substances that act directly on the RAAS have been associated with \n\nserious foetal malformations and neonatal death. As for any medicine that acts directly on the RAAS, \n\nSprimeo should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy or in women planning to become \n\npregnant and is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). Healthcare \n\nprofessionals prescribing any agents acting on the RAAS should counsel women of childbearing \n\npotential about the potential risk of these agents during pregnancy. If pregnancy is detected during \n\ntherapy, Sprimeo should be discontinued accordingly. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether aliskiren is excreted in human milk. Sprimeo was secreted in the milk of \n\nlactating rats. Its use is therefore not recommended in women who are breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \n\nwhen driving vehicles or operating machinery it must be borne in mind that dizziness or weariness \n\nmay occasionally occur when taking any antihypertensive therapy. Sprimeo has negligible influence \n\non the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSprimeo has been evaluated for safety in more than 7,800 patients, including over 2,300 treated for \n\nover 6 months, and more than 1,200 for over 1 year. The incidence of adverse reactions showed no \n\nassociation with gender, age, body mass index, race or ethnicity. Treatment with Sprimeo resulted in \n\nan overall incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo up to 300 mg. Adverse reactions have \n\ngenerally been mild and transient in nature and have only infrequently required discontinuation of \n\ntherapy. The most common adverse drug reaction is diarrhoea. \n\n \n\nThe adverse drug reactions (Table 1) are ranked under heading of frequency, the most frequent first, \n\nusing the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100, <1/10); uncommon \n\n(\u22651/1,000, <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000, <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be \n\nestimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented \n\nin order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nTable 1 \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common: Dizziness \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Uncommon: Hypotension \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Common: Diarrhoea \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n Rare: Hypersensitivity reactions \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Uncommon: Rash, severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including toxic \n\nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) and oral mucosal reactions \n\n Rare: Angioedema \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\n Common: Arthralgia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\n Uncommon: Acute renal failure, renal impairment \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n Uncommon: Oedema peripheral \n\nInvestigations \n\n Common: Hyperkalaemia \n\n Rare: Haemoglobin decreased, haematocrit decreased \n\n Rare: Blood creatinine increased \n\n \n\nAngioedema and hypersensitivity reactions have occurred during treatment with aliskiren. In \n\ncontrolled clinical trials, angioedema and hypersensitivity reactions occurred rarely during treatment \n\nwith aliskiren with rates comparable to treatment with placebo or comparators. \n\n \n\nCases of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or \n\ntongue) have also been reported in post-marketing experience. A number of these patients had a \n\nhistory of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema which in some cases was associated \n\nwith the administration of other medicines known to cause angioedema, including RAAS blockers \n\n(ACE inhibitors or ARBs). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions have also been reported in post-marketing experience. \n\n \n\nIn the event of any signs suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction/angioedema (in particular difficulties \n\nin breathing or swallowing, rash, itching, hives or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/or \n\ntongue, dizziness) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nArthralgia has been reported in post-marketing experience. In some cases this occurred as part of a \n\nhypersensitivity reaction. \n\n \n\nLaboratory findings \n\nIn controlled clinical trials, clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory parameters were \n\nuncommonly associated with the administration of Sprimeo. In clinical studies in hypertensive \n\npatients, Sprimeo had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein \n\ncholesterol (HDL-C), fasting triglycerides, fasting glucose or uric acid. \n\n \n\nHaemoglobin and haematocrit: Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of \n\napproximately 0.05 mmol/l and 0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed. No patients \n\ndiscontinued therapy due to anaemia. This effect is also seen with other agents acting on the renin-\n\nangiotensin system, such as ACEI and ARBs. \n\n \n\nSerum potassium: Increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren and these may be \n\nexacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by NSAIDs. Consistent with \n\nstandard medical practice, periodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is \n\nadvised if co-administration is considered necessary. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or \n\nACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR \n\n< 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, renal dysfunction and cases of acute renal failure have been reported in \n\npatients at risk (see section 4.4). There have also been reports of peripheral oedema, increase in blood \n\ncreatinine and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including toxic epidermal necrolysis \n\n(TEN) and oral mucosal reactions. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nLimited data are available related to overdose in humans. The most likely manifestations of \n\noverdosage would be hypotension, related to the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren. If symptomatic \n\nhypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be initiated. \n\n \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis, \n\ndialysis clearance of aliskiren was low (< 2% of oral clearance). Therefore dialysis is not adequate to \n\ntreat aliskiren over-exposure. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Renin inhibitor, ATC code: C09XA02 \n\n \n\nAliskiren is an orally active, non-peptide, potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin. \n\n \n\nBy inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAAS at the point of activation, blocking the \n\nconversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and angiotensin \n\nII. Whereas other agents that inhibit the RAAS (ACEI and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB)) \n\ncause a compensatory rise in plasma renin activity (PRA), treatment with aliskiren decreases PRA in \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\nhypertensive patients by approximately 50 to 80%. Similar reductions were found when aliskiren was \n\ncombined with other antihypertensive agents. The clinical implications of the differences in effect on \n\nPRA are not known at the present time. \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of Sprimeo at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg \n\nprovided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained \n\nover the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a mean peak to \n\ntrough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose. 85 to 90% of the maximal blood-\n\npressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering effect was \n\nsustained during long-term treatment, and was independent of age, gender, body mass index and \n\nethnicity. Sprimeo has been studied in 1,864 patients aged 65 years or older, and in 426 patients aged \n\n75 years or older. \n\n \n\nSprimeo monotherapy studies have shown blood pressure lowering effects comparable to other classes \n\nof antihypertensive agents including ACEI and ARB. Compared to a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide - \n\nHCTZ), Sprimeo 300 mg lowered systolic/diastolic blood pressure by 17.0/12.3 mmHg, compared to \n\n14.4/10.5 mmHg for HCTZ 25 mg after 12 weeks of treatment. \n\n \n\nCombination therapy studies are available for Sprimeo added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the \n\ncalcium channel blocker amlodipine and the beta blocker atenolol. These combinations were well \n\ntolerated. Sprimeo induced an additive blood-pressure-lowering effect when added to \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. In patients who did not adequately respond to 5 mg of the calcium channel \n\nblocker amlodipine, the addition of Sprimeo 150 mg had a blood-pressure-lowering effect similar to \n\nthat obtained by increasing amlodipine dose to 10 mg, but had a lower incidence of oedema (aliskiren \n\n150 mg/amlodipine 5 mg 2.1% vs. amlodipine 10 mg 11.2%). \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of aliskiren-based therapy were compared to ramipril-based therapy in a 9-\n\nmonth non-inferiority study in 901 elderly patients (\u2265 65 years) with essential systolic hypertension. \n\nAliskiren 150 mg or 300 mg per day or ramipril 5 mg or 10 mg per day were administered for \n\n36 weeks with optional add-on therapy of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) at week 12, and \n\namlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) at week 22. Over the 12 week period, aliskiren monotherapy lowered \n\nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure by 14.0/5.1 mmHg, compared to 11.6/3.6 mmHg for ramipril, \n\nconsistent with aliskiren being non-inferior to ramipril at the dosages chosen and the differences in \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significant. Tolerability was comparable in \n\nboth treatment arms, however cough was more often reported with the ramipril regimen than the \n\naliskiren regimen (14.2% vs. 4.4%), whilst diarrhoea was more common with the aliskiren regimen \n\nthan for the ramipril regimen (6.6% vs. 5.0%). \n\n \n\nIn a 8-week study in 754 hypertensive elderly (\u2265 65 years) and very elderly patients (30% \u2265 75 years) \n\naliskiren at doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg provided statistically significant superior reduction in \n\nblood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) when compared to placebo. No additional blood pressure \n\nlowering effect was detected with 300 mg aliskiren compared to 150 mg aliskiren. All three doses \n\nwere well tolerated in both elderly and very elderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn obese hypertensive patients who did not adequately respond to HCTZ 25 mg, add-on treatment with \n\nSprimeo 300 mg provided additional blood pressure reduction that was comparable to add-on \n\ntreatment with irbesartan 300 mg or amlodipine 10 mg. \n\n \n\nThere has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in \n\ncontrolled clinical studies. Excessive hypotension was uncommonly (0.1%) seen in patients with \n\nuncomplicated hypertension treated with Sprimeo alone. Hypotension was also uncommon (<1%) \n\nduring combination therapy with other antihypertensive agents. With cessation of treatment, blood \n\npressure gradually returned towards baseline levels over a period of several weeks, with no evidence \n\nof a rebound effect for blood pressure or PRA. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\nIn a 36-week study involving 820 patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, no changes in \n\nventricular remodelling as assessed by left ventricular end systolic volume were detected with \n\naliskiren compared to placebo on top of background therapy. \n\n \n\nThe combined rates of cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, recurrent heart attack, \n\nstroke and resuscitated sudden death were similar in the aliskiren group and the placebo group. \n\nHowever, in patients receiving aliskiren there was a significantly higher rate of hyperkalaemia, \n\nhypotension and kidney dysfunction when compared to the placebo group. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was evaluated for cardiovascular and/or renal benefit in a double-blind placebo controlled \n\nrandomised trial in 8,606 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (evidenced by \n\nproteinuria and/or GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) with or without cardiovascular disease. In most patients \n\narterial blood pressure was well controlled at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of \n\ncardiovascular and renal complications. \n\n \n\nIn this study, aliskiren 300 mg was compared to placebo when added to standard of care which \n\nincluded either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. The \n\nstudy was discontinued prematurely because the participants were unlikely to benefit from aliskiren. \n\nPreliminary study results indicated a hazard ratio for the primary endpoint of 1.09 in favour of \n\nplacebo (95% Confidence Interval: 0.97, 1.22, 2-sided p=0.17). In addition, an increased incidence of \n\nserious adverse outcomes was observed with aliskiren compared to placebo for renal complications \n\n(4.7% versus 3.3%), hyperkalaemia (36.9% versus 27.1%), hypotension (18.4% versus 14.6%) and \n\nstroke (2.7% versus 2.0%). The increased incidence of non-fatal stroke was greater in patients with \n\nrenal insufficiency. \n\n \n\nBeneficial effects of Sprimeo on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and target organ damage are \n\ncurrently unknown. \n\n \n\nCardiac electrophysiology \n\nNo effect on QT interval was reported in a randomised, double-blind, placebo, and active-controlled \n\nstudy using standard and Holter electrocardiography. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral absorption, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours. The \n\nabsolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3%. Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax \n\nby 85% and AUC by 70%. Steady-state-plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days following \n\nonce-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than with the initial \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is \n\napproximately 135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space. \n\nAliskiren plasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. \n\n \n\nMetabolism and elimination \n\nThe mean half-life is about 40 hours (range 34-41 hours). Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as unchanged \n\ncompound in the faeces (78%). Approximately 1.4% of the total oral dose is metabolised. The enzyme \n\nresponsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4. Approximately 0.6% of the dose is recovered in urine \n\nfollowing oral administration. Following intravenous administration, the mean plasma clearance is \n\napproximately 9 l/h. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\nExposure to aliskiren increased more than in proportion to the increase in dose. After single dose \n\nadministration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and 2.6-\n\nfold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively. At steady state the non-linearity may be more \n\npronounced. Mechanisms responsible for deviation from linearity have not been identified. A possible \n\nmechanism is saturation of transporters at the absorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in patients \n\nAliskiren is an effective once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult patients, regardless of gender, \n\nage, body mass index and ethnicity. \n\n \n\nThe AUC is 50% higher in elderly (>65 years) than in young subjects. Gender, weight and ethnicity \n\nhave no clinically relevant influence on aliskiren pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal \n\ninsufficiency. Relative AUC and Cmax of aliskiren in subjects with renal impairment ranged between \n\n0.8 to 2 times the levels in healthy subjects following single dose administration and at steady state. \n\nThese observed changes, however, did not correlate with the severity of renal impairment. No \n\nadjustment of the initial dosage of Sprimeo is required in patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Sprimeo is not recommended in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Concomitant use of Sprimeo with \n\nARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease receiving \n\nhaemodialysis. Administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg aliskiren was associated with very \n\nminor changes in the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren (change in Cmax of less than 1.2 fold; increase in \n\nAUC of up to 1.6 fold) compared to matched healthy subjects. Timing of haemodialysis did not \n\nsignificantly alter the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren in ESRD patients. Therefore, if administration of \n\naliskiren in ESRD patients receiving haemodialysis is considered necessary, no dose adjustment is \n\nwarranted in these patients. However, the use of aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were not significantly affected in patients with mild to severe liver \n\ndisease. Consequently, no adjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild \n\nto severe hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nCarcinogenic potential was assessed in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month transgenic mouse study. No \n\ncarcinogenic potential was detected. One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded \n\nin rats at the dose of 1,500 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. Although aliskiren has known \n\nirritation potential, safety margins obtained in humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy \n\nvolunteers were considered to be appropriate at 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold \n\nbased on mucosa concentrations in comparison with 250 mg/kg/day in the rat carcinogenicity study. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic potential in the in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies. The \n\nassays included in vitro assays in bacterial and mammalian cells and in vivo assessments in rats. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicity studies with aliskiren did not reveal any evidence of embryofoetal toxicity or \n\nteratogenicity at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in rats or 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits. Fertility, pre-natal \n\ndevelopment and post-natal development were unaffected in rats at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day. The \n\ndoses in rats and rabbits provided systemic exposures of 1 to 4 and 5 times higher, respectively, than \n\nthe maximum recommended human dose (300 mg). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n12 \n\nSafety pharmacology studies did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous, respiratory or \n\ncardiovascular function. Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were consistent with \n\nthe known local irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of aliskiren. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet \n\n \n\nLight-red, biconvex, ovaloid tablet, imprinted \u201cIU\u201d on one side and \u201cNVR\u201d on the other side. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of essential hypertension. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Sprimeo is 150 mg once daily. In patients whose blood pressure is not \n\nadequately controlled, the dose may be increased to 300 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nThe antihypertensive effect is substantially present within two weeks (85-90%) after initiating therapy \n\nwith 150 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nSprimeo may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents with the exception \n\nof use in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blockers (ARB) in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration \n\nrate (GFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nSprimeo should be taken with a light meal once a day, preferably at the same time each day. \n\nGrapefruit juice should not be taken together with Sprimeo. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 5.2). Sprimeo is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR \n\n< 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Concomitant use of Sprimeo with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in \n\npatients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\nElderly patients (over 65 years) \n\nThe recommended starting dose of aliskiren in elderly patients is 150 mg. No clinically meaningful \n\nadditional blood pressure reduction is observed by increasing the dose to 300 mg in the majority of \n\nelderly patients. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n15 \n\nPaediatric patients (below 18 years) \n\nSprimeo is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below age 18 due to a lack of data on \n\nsafety and efficacy (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n\n \n\nHistory of angioedema with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nHereditary or idiopathic angioedema. \n\n \n\nSecond and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\nThe concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin and itraconazole, two highly potent P-gp inhibitors, \n\nand other potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. quinidine), is contraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nThe concomitant use of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nAliskiren should be used with caution in patients with serious congestive heart failure (New York \n\nHeart Association [NYHA] functional class III-IV). \n\n \n\nIn the event of severe and persistent diarrhoea, Sprimeo therapy should be stopped. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n\nHypotension, syncope, stroke, hyperkalaemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal \n\nfailure) have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that \n\naffect this system (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by \n\ncombining aliskiren with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin II \n\nreceptor blocker (ARB) is therefore not recommended. \n\n \n\nThe use of aliskiren in combination with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nAngioedema \n\nAs with other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, angioedema or symptoms suggestive of \n\nangioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or tongue) have been reported in patients treated \n\nwith aliskiren. \n\n \n\nA number of these patients had a history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema, \n\nwhich in some cases followed use of other medicines that can cause angioedema, including RAAS \n\nblockers (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nPatients with a history of angioedema may be at increased risk of experiencing angioedema during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Caution should therefore be exercised when \n\nprescribing aliskiren to patients with a history of angioedema, and such patients should be closely \n\nmonitored during treatment (see section 4.8) especially at the beginning of the treatment. \n\n \n\nIf angioedema occurs, Sprimeo should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and \n\nmonitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. \n\nWhere there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx adrenaline should be administered. In \n\naddition, measures necessary to maintain patent airways should be provided. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n16 \n\nSodium and/or volume depleted patients \n\nIn patients with marked volume- and/or salt-depletion (e.g. those receiving high doses of diuretics) \n\nsymptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Sprimeo. This condition \n\nshould be corrected prior to administration of Sprimeo, or the treatment should start under close \n\nmedical supervision. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn clinical studies Sprimeo has not been investigated in hypertensive patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (serum creatinine \u2265 150 \u03bcmol/l or 1.70 mg/dl in women and \u2265 177 \u03bcmol/l or 2.00 mg/dl in \n\nmen and/or estimated GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n), history of dialysis, nephrotic syndrome or \n\nrenovascular hypertension. Sprimeo is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment \n\n(GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). \n\n \n\nAs for other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, caution should be exercised when aliskiren \n\nis given in the presence of conditions pre-disposing to kidney dysfunction such as hypovolaemia (eg. \n\ndue to blood loss, severe prolonged diarrhoea, prolonged vomiting, etc.), heart disease, liver disease, \n\ndiabetes mellitus or kidney disease. The concomitant use of aliskiren and ACEIs or ARBs is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Acute renal failure, \n\nreversible upon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients receiving aliskiren \n\nin post-marketing experience. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, aliskiren should be \n\npromptly discontinued. \n\n \n\nIncreases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in post-marketing experience and \n\nthese may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by non-steroidal \n\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Consistent with standard medical practice, periodic determination \n\nof renal function including serum electrolytes is advised if co-administration is considered necessary. \n\n \n\nRenal artery stenosis \n\nNo controlled clinical data are available on the use of Sprimeo in patients with unilateral or bilateral \n\nrenal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, as with other agents acting on the \n\nrenin-angiotensin system, there is an increased risk of renal insufficiency, including acute renal \n\nfailure, when patients with renal artery stenosis are treated with aliskiren. Therefore, caution should \n\nbe exercised in these patients. If renal failure occurs, treatment should be discontinued. \n\n \n\nModerate P-gp inhibitors \n\nCo-administration of aliskiren 300 mg with ketoconazole 200 mg or verapamil 240 mg resulted in a \n\n76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. Therefore caution should be exercised when \n\naliskiren is administered with moderate P-gp inhibitors such as ketoconazole or verapamil (see section \n\n4.5). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nThe combination of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients \n\n(see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nCompounds that have been investigated in clinical pharmacokinetic studies include acenocoumarol, \n\natenolol, celecoxib, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate and hydrochlorothiazide. No \n\ninteractions have been identified. \n\n \n\nCo-administration of aliskiren with either metformin (\u219328%), amlodipine (\u219129%) or cimetidine \n\n(\u219119%) resulted in between 20% and 30% change in Cmax or AUC of Sprimeo. When administered \n\nwith atorvastatin, steady-state Sprimeo AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. Co-administration of \n\nSprimeo had no significant impact on atorvastatin, metformin or amlodipine pharmacokinetics. As a \n\nresult no dose adjustment for Sprimeo or these co-administered medicinal products is necessary. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n17 \n\nDigoxin and verapamil bioavailability may be slightly decreased by Sprimeo. \n\n \n\nIn experimental animals, it has been shown that P-gp is a major determinant of Sprimeo \n\nbioavailability. Inducers of P-gp (St. John\u2019s wort, rifampicin) might therefore decrease the \n\nbioavailability of Sprimeo. \n\n \n\nCYP450 interactions \n\nAliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A). \n\nAliskiren does not induce CYP3A4. Therefore aliskiren is not expected to affect the systemic \n\nexposure of substances that inhibit, induce or are metabolised by these enzymes. Aliskiren is \n\nmetabolised minimally by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Hence, interactions due to inhibition or \n\ninduction of CYP450 isoenzymes are not expected. However, CYP3A4 inhibitors often also affect P-\n\ngp. Increased aliskiren exposure during co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors that also inhibit P-gp \n\ncan therefore be expected (see P-glycoprotein interactions below). \n\n \n\nP-glycoprotein interactions \n\nMDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption and \n\nbiliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies. Rifampicin, which is an inducer of P-gp, reduced \n\naliskiren bioavailability by approximately 50% in a clinical study. Other inducers of P-gp (St. John\u2019s \n\nwort) might decrease the bioavailability of Sprimeo. Although this has not been investigated for \n\naliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake of a variety of substrates and P-gp \n\ninhibitors can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. Therefore, P-gp inhibitors may \n\nincrease tissue levels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug interactions at the P-gp site will \n\nlikely depend on the degree of inhibition of this transporter. \n\n \n\nP-gp potent inhibitors \n\nA single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) \n\nincreases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold. The increase \n\nmay be higher with higher aliskiren doses. In healthy subjects, itraconazole (100 mg) increases AUC \n\nand Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, respectively. Therefore, concomitant use of \n\naliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nModerate P-gp inhibitors \n\nCo-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) or verapamil (240 mg) with aliskiren (300 mg) resulted \n\nin a 76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in \n\nthe presence of ketoconazole or verapamil is expected to be within the range that would be achieved if \n\nthe dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice the highest \n\nrecommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical trials. \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances aliskiren \n\ngastrointestinal absorption and decreases biliary excretion. Therefore, caution should be exercised \n\nwhen aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole, verapamil or other moderate P-gp inhibitors \n\n(clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). \n\n \n\nP-gp substrates or weak inhibitors \n\nNo relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or cimetidine have been observed. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren (300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by \n\n50%. \n\n \n\nOrganic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren might be a substrate of organic anion transporting \n\npolypeptides. Therefore, the potential exists for interactions between OATP inhibitors and aliskiren \n\nwhen administered concomitantly (see interaction with Grapefruit juice). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n18 \n\nFurosemide \n\nWhen aliskiren was co-administered with furosemide, the AUC and Cmax of furosemide were reduced \n\nby 28% and 49% respectively. It is therefore recommended that the effects be monitored when \n\ninitiating and adjusting furosemide therapy to avoid possible underutilisation in clinical situations of \n\nvolume overload. \n\n \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \n\nAs with other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, NSAIDs may reduce the anti-\n\nhypertensive effect of aliskiren. In some patients with compromised renal function (dehydrated \n\npatients or elderly patients) aliskiren given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in further \n\ndeterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. \n\nTherefore the combination of aliskiren with an NSAID requires caution, especially in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affecting serum potassium levels \n\nConcomitant use of other agents affecting the RAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum \n\npotassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium. If co-medication with an agent \n\naffecting the level of serum potassium is considered necessary, caution is advisable. The combination \n\nof aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal \n\nimpairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, \n\n4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nGrapefruit juice \n\nAdministration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of aliskiren. \n\nCo-administration with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren AUC and co-\n\nadministration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. This decrease is \n\nlikely due to an inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren by \n\ngrapefruit juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic failure, \n\ngrapefruit juice should not be taken together with Sprimeo. \n\n \n\nWarfarin \n\nThe effects of Sprimeo on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. \n\n \n\nFood intake \n\nMeals with a high fat content have been shown to reduce the absorption of Sprimeo substantially. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women. Sprimeo was not teratogenic in rats or \n\nrabbits (see section 5.3). Other substances that act directly on the RAAS have been associated with \n\nserious foetal malformations and neonatal death. As for any medicine that acts directly on the RAAS, \n\nSprimeo should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy or in women planning to become \n\npregnant and is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). Healthcare \n\nprofessionals prescribing any agents acting on the RAAS should counsel women of childbearing \n\npotential about the potential risk of these agents during pregnancy. If pregnancy is detected during \n\ntherapy, Sprimeo should be discontinued accordingly. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether aliskiren is excreted in human milk. Sprimeo was secreted in the milk of \n\nlactating rats. Its use is therefore not recommended in women who are breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n19 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, \n\nwhen driving vehicles or operating machinery it must be borne in mind that dizziness or weariness \n\nmay occasionally occur when taking any antihypertensive therapy. Sprimeo has negligible influence \n\non the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSprimeo has been evaluated for safety in more than 7,800 patients, including over 2,300 treated for \n\nover 6 months, and more than 1,200 for over 1 year. The incidence of adverse reactions showed no \n\nassociation with gender, age, body mass index, race or ethnicity. Treatment with Sprimeo resulted in \n\nan overall incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo up to 300 mg. Adverse reactions have \n\ngenerally been mild and transient in nature and have only infrequently required discontinuation of \n\ntherapy. The most common adverse drug reaction is diarrhoea. \n\n \n\nThe adverse drug reactions (Table 1) are ranked under heading of frequency, the most frequent first, \n\nusing the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100, <1/10); uncommon \n\n(\u22651/1,000, <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000, <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be \n\nestimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented \n\nin order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nTable 1 \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\n Common: Dizziness \n\nVascular disorders \n\n Uncommon: Hypotension \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n Common: Diarrhoea \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n Rare: Hypersensitivity reactions \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\n Uncommon: Rash, severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including toxic \n\nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) and oral mucosal reactions \n\n Rare: Angioedema \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\n Common: Arthralgia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\n Uncommon: Acute renal failure, renal impairment \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\n Uncommon: Oedema peripheral \n\nInvestigations \n\n Common: Hyperkalaemia \n\n Rare: Haemoglobin decreased, haematocrit decreased \n\n Rare: Blood creatinine increased \n\n \n\nAngioedema and hypersensitivity reactions have occurred during treatment with aliskiren. In \n\ncontrolled clinical trials, angioedema and hypersensitivity reactions occurred rarely during treatment \n\nwith aliskiren with rates comparable to treatment with placebo or comparators. \n\n \n\nCases of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or \n\ntongue) have also been reported in post-marketing experience. A number of these patients had a \n\nhistory of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema which in some cases was associated \n\nwith the administration of other medicines known to cause angioedema, including RAAS blockers \n\n(ACE inhibitors or ARBs). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions have also been reported in post-marketing experience. \n\n \n\nIn the event of any signs suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction/angioedema (in particular difficulties \n\nin breathing or swallowing, rash, itching, hives or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/or \n\ntongue, dizziness) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nArthralgia has been reported in post-marketing experience. In some cases this occurred as part of a \n\nhypersensitivity reaction. \n\n \n\nLaboratory findings \n\nIn controlled clinical trials, clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory parameters were \n\nuncommonly associated with the administration of Sprimeo. In clinical studies in hypertensive \n\npatients, Sprimeo had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein \n\ncholesterol (HDL-C), fasting triglycerides, fasting glucose or uric acid. \n\n \n\nHaemoglobin and haematocrit: Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of \n\napproximately 0.05 mmol/l and 0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed. No patients \n\ndiscontinued therapy due to anaemia. This effect is also seen with other agents acting on the renin-\n\nangiotensin system, such as ACEI and ARBs. \n\n \n\nSerum potassium: Increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren and these may be \n\nexacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by NSAIDs. Consistent with \n\nstandard medical practice, periodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is \n\nadvised if co-administration is considered necessary. The combination of aliskiren with ARBs or \n\nACEIs is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR \n\n< 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, renal dysfunction and cases of acute renal failure have been reported in \n\npatients at risk (see section 4.4). There have also been reports of peripheral oedema, increase in blood \n\ncreatinine and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including toxic epidermal necrolysis \n\n(TEN) and oral mucosal reactions. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nLimited data are available related to overdose in humans. The most likely manifestations of \n\noverdosage would be hypotension, related to the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren. If symptomatic \n\nhypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be initiated. \n\n \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis, \n\ndialysis clearance of aliskiren was low (< 2% of oral clearance). Therefore dialysis is not adequate to \n\ntreat aliskiren over-exposure. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Renin inhibitor, ATC code: C09XA02 \n\n \n\nAliskiren is an orally active, non-peptide, potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin. \n\n \n\nBy inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAAS at the point of activation, blocking the \n\nconversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and angiotensin \n\nII. Whereas other agents that inhibit the RAAS (ACEI and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB)) \n\ncause a compensatory rise in plasma renin activity (PRA), treatment with aliskiren decreases PRA in \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n21 \n\nhypertensive patients by approximately 50 to 80%. Similar reductions were found when aliskiren was \n\ncombined with other antihypertensive agents. The clinical implications of the differences in effect on \n\nPRA are not known at the present time. \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of Sprimeo at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg \n\nprovided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained \n\nover the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a mean peak to \n\ntrough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose. 85 to 90% of the maximal blood-\n\npressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering effect was \n\nsustained during long-term treatment, and was independent of age, gender, body mass index and \n\nethnicity. Sprimeo has been studied in 1,864 patients aged 65 years or older, and in 426 patients aged \n\n75 years or older. \n\n \n\nSprimeo monotherapy studies have shown blood pressure lowering effects comparable to other classes \n\nof antihypertensive agents including ACEI and ARB. Compared to a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide - \n\nHCTZ), Sprimeo 300 mg lowered systolic/diastolic blood pressure by 17.0/12.3 mmHg, compared to \n\n14.4/10.5 mmHg for HCTZ 25 mg after 12 weeks of treatment. \n\n \n\nCombination therapy studies are available for Sprimeo added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the \n\ncalcium channel blocker amlodipine and the beta blocker atenolol. These combinations were well \n\ntolerated. Sprimeo induced an additive blood-pressure-lowering effect when added to \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. In patients who did not adequately respond to 5 mg of the calcium channel \n\nblocker amlodipine, the addition of Sprimeo 150 mg had a blood-pressure-lowering effect similar to \n\nthat obtained by increasing amlodipine dose to 10 mg, but had a lower incidence of oedema (aliskiren \n\n150 mg/amlodipine 5 mg 2.1% vs. amlodipine 10 mg 11.2%). \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of aliskiren-based therapy were compared to ramipril-based therapy in a 9-\n\nmonth non-inferiority study in 901 elderly patients (\u2265 65 years) with essential systolic hypertension. \n\nAliskiren 150 mg or 300 mg per day or ramipril 5 mg or 10 mg per day were administered for \n\n36 weeks with optional add-on therapy of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) at week 12, and \n\namlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) at week 22. Over the 12 week period, aliskiren monotherapy lowered \n\nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure by 14.0/5.1 mmHg, compared to 11.6/3.6 mmHg for ramipril, \n\nconsistent with aliskiren being non-inferior to ramipril at the dosages chosen and the differences in \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significant. Tolerability was comparable in \n\nboth treatment arms, however cough was more often reported with the ramipril regimen than the \n\naliskiren regimen (14.2% vs. 4.4%), whilst diarrhoea was more common with the aliskiren regimen \n\nthan for the ramipril regimen (6.6% vs. 5.0%). \n\n \n\nIn a 8-week study in 754 hypertensive elderly (\u2265 65 years) and very elderly patients (30% \u2265 75 years) \n\naliskiren at doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg provided statistically significant superior reduction in \n\nblood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) when compared to placebo. No additional blood pressure \n\nlowering effect was detected with 300 mg aliskiren compared to 150 mg aliskiren. All three doses \n\nwere well tolerated in both elderly and very elderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn obese hypertensive patients who did not adequately respond to HCTZ 25 mg, add-on treatment with \n\nSprimeo 300 mg provided additional blood pressure reduction that was comparable to add-on \n\ntreatment with irbesartan 300 mg or amlodipine 10 mg. \n\n \n\nThere has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in \n\ncontrolled clinical studies. Excessive hypotension was uncommonly (0.1%) seen in patients with \n\nuncomplicated hypertension treated with Sprimeo alone. Hypotension was also uncommon (<1%) \n\nduring combination therapy with other antihypertensive agents. With cessation of treatment, blood \n\npressure gradually returned towards baseline levels over a period of several weeks, with no evidence \n\nof a rebound effect for blood pressure or PRA. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n22 \n\nIn a 36-week study involving 820 patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, no changes in \n\nventricular remodelling as assessed by left ventricular end systolic volume were detected with \n\naliskiren compared to placebo on top of background therapy. \n\n \n\nThe combined rates of cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, recurrent heart attack, \n\nstroke and resuscitated sudden death were similar in the aliskiren group and the placebo group. \n\nHowever, in patients receiving aliskiren there was a significantly higher rate of hyperkalaemia, \n\nhypotension and kidney dysfunction when compared to the placebo group. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was evaluated for cardiovascular and/or renal benefit in a double-blind placebo controlled \n\nrandomised trial in 8,606 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (evidenced by \n\nproteinuria and/or GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) with or without cardiovascular disease. In most patients \n\narterial blood pressure was well controlled at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of \n\ncardiovascular and renal complications. \n\n \n\nIn this study, aliskiren 300 mg was compared to placebo when added to standard of care which \n\nincluded either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. The \n\nstudy was discontinued prematurely because the participants were unlikely to benefit from aliskiren. \n\nPreliminary study results indicated a hazard ratio for the primary endpoint of 1.09 in favour of \n\nplacebo (95% Confidence Interval: 0.97, 1.22, 2-sided p=0.17). In addition, an increased incidence of \n\nserious adverse outcomes was observed with aliskiren compared to placebo for renal complications \n\n(4.7% versus 3.3%), hyperkalaemia (36.9% versus 27.1%), hypotension (18.4% versus 14.6%) and \n\nstroke (2.7% versus 2.0%). The increased incidence of non-fatal stroke was greater in patients with \n\nrenal insufficiency. \n\n \n\nBeneficial effects of Sprimeo on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and target organ damage are \n\ncurrently unknown. \n\n \n\nCardiac electrophysiology \n\nNo effect on QT interval was reported in a randomised, double-blind, placebo, and active-controlled \n\nstudy using standard and Holter electrocardiography. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral absorption, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours. The \n\nabsolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3%. Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax \n\nby 85% and AUC by 70%. Steady-state-plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days following \n\nonce-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than with the initial \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is \n\napproximately 135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space. \n\nAliskiren plasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. \n\n \n\nMetabolism and elimination \n\nThe mean half-life is about 40 hours (range 34-41 hours). Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as unchanged \n\ncompound in the faeces (78%). Approximately 1.4% of the total oral dose is metabolised. The enzyme \n\nresponsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4. Approximately 0.6% of the dose is recovered in urine \n\nfollowing oral administration. Following intravenous administration, the mean plasma clearance is \n\napproximately 9 l/h. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n23 \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\nExposure to aliskiren increased more than in proportion to the increase in dose. After single dose \n\nadministration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and 2.6-\n\nfold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively. At steady state the non-linearity may be more \n\npronounced. Mechanisms responsible for deviation from linearity have not been identified. A possible \n\nmechanism is saturation of transporters at the absorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in patients \n\nAliskiren is an effective once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult patients, regardless of gender, \n\nage, body mass index and ethnicity. \n\n \n\nThe AUC is 50% higher in elderly (>65 years) than in young subjects. Gender, weight and ethnicity \n\nhave no clinically relevant influence on aliskiren pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal \n\ninsufficiency. Relative AUC and Cmax of aliskiren in subjects with renal impairment ranged between \n\n0.8 to 2 times the levels in healthy subjects following single dose administration and at steady state. \n\nThese observed changes, however, did not correlate with the severity of renal impairment. No \n\nadjustment of the initial dosage of Sprimeo is required in patients with mild to moderate renal \n\nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Sprimeo is not recommended in patients with severe renal \n\nimpairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n). Concomitant use of Sprimeo with \n\nARBs or ACEIs is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease receiving \n\nhaemodialysis. Administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg aliskiren was associated with very \n\nminor changes in the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren (change in Cmax of less than 1.2 fold; increase in \n\nAUC of up to 1.6 fold) compared to matched healthy subjects. Timing of haemodialysis did not \n\nsignificantly alter the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren in ESRD patients. Therefore, if administration of \n\naliskiren in ESRD patients receiving haemodialysis is considered necessary, no dose adjustment is \n\nwarranted in these patients. However, the use of aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were not significantly affected in patients with mild to severe liver \n\ndisease. Consequently, no adjustment of the initial dose of aliskiren is required in patients with mild \n\nto severe hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nCarcinogenic potential was assessed in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month transgenic mouse study. No \n\ncarcinogenic potential was detected. One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded \n\nin rats at the dose of 1,500 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. Although aliskiren has known \n\nirritation potential, safety margins obtained in humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy \n\nvolunteers were considered to be appropriate at 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold \n\nbased on mucosa concentrations in comparison with 250 mg/kg/day in the rat carcinogenicity study. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic potential in the in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies. The \n\nassays included in vitro assays in bacterial and mammalian cells and in vivo assessments in rats. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicity studies with aliskiren did not reveal any evidence of embryofoetal toxicity or \n\nteratogenicity at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in rats or 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits. Fertility, pre-natal \n\ndevelopment and post-natal development were unaffected in rats at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day. The \n\ndoses in rats and rabbits provided systemic exposures of 1 to 4 and 5 times higher, respectively, than \n\nthe maximum recommended human dose (300 mg). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n24 \n\nSafety pharmacology studies did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous, respiratory or \n\ncardiovascular function. Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were consistent with \n\nthe known local irritation potential or the expected pharmacological effects of aliskiren. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

It may harm them, even \n\nif their symptoms are the same as yours. \n\n- If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\nIn this leaflet: \n\n1. What Sprimeo is and what it is used for \n\n2. Before you take Sprimeo \n\n3. How to take Sprimeo \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Sprimeo \n\n6. Further information \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1. WHAT SPRIMEO IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n\n \n\nSprimeo belongs to a new class of medicines called renin inhibitors. Sprimeo helps to lower high \n\nblood pressure. Renin inhibitors reduce the amount of angiotensin II the body can produce. \n\nAngiotensin II causes blood vessels to tighten, which increases the blood pressure. Reducing the \n\namount of angiotensin II allows the blood vessels to relax, which lowers blood pressure. \n\n \n\nHigh blood pressure increases the workload of the heart and arteries. If this continues for a long time, \n\nit can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart and kidneys, and may result in a stroke, heart \n\nfailure, heart attack or kidney failure. Lowering the blood pressure to a normal level reduces the risk \n\nof developing these disorders. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE SPRIMEO \n\n \n\nDo not take Sprimeo \n\n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to aliskiren or any of the other ingredients of Sprimeo. If you \n\nthink you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. \n\n- if you have experienced the following forms of angioedema (difficulties in breathing or \n\nswallowing, or swelling of the face, hands and feet, eyes, lips and/or tongue): \n\n- angioedema when taking aliskiren. \n\n- hereditary angioedema. \n\n- angioedema without any known cause. \n\n- during the last 6 months of pregnancy or if you are breast-feeding, see section Pregnancy and \n\nbreastfeeding. \n\n- if you are taking ciclosporin (a medicine used in transplantation to prevent organ rejection or \n\nfor other conditions, e.g. rheumathoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis), itraconazole (a medicine \n\nused to treat fungal infections) or quinidine (a medicine used to correct heart rhythm). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n58 \n\n- if you have diabetes mellitus or impaired kidney function and you are treated with either of the \n\nfollowing classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an \u201cangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor\u201d such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril etc. \n\nor \n\n- an \u201cangiotensin 2 receptor blocker\u201d such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan etc. \n\n \n\nTake special care with Sprimeo \n\n- if you are taking a diuretic (a type of medicine also known as \u201cwater\u201d tablets which increases \n\nthe amount of urine you produce). \n\n- if you are taking either of the following classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an \u201cangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor\u201d such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril etc. \n\nor \n\n- an \u201cangiotensin 2 receptor blocker\u201d such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan etc. \n\n- if you have impaired kidney function, your doctor will carefully consider whether Sprimeo is \n\nsuitable for you and may wish to monitor you carefully. \n\n- if you experience angioedema (difficulties in breathing, or swallowing, or swelling of the face, \n\nhands and feet, eyes, lips and/or tongue). If this happens, stop taking Sprimeo and contact your \n\ndoctor. \n\n \n\nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before you take Sprimeo. \n\n \n\nThe use of Sprimeo in children and adolescents is not recommended. \n\nThe usual dose of Sprimeo for patients aged 65 years or older is 150 mg. \n\n \n\nUsing other medicines \n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \n\nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions if you are taking one of \n\nthe following medicines: \n\n- medicines that increase the amount of potassium in your blood.

Further information \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1. WHAT SPRIMEO IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n\n \n\nSprimeo belongs to a new class of medicines called renin inhibitors. Sprimeo helps to lower high \n\nblood pressure. Renin inhibitors reduce the amount of angiotensin II the body can produce. \n\nAngiotensin II causes blood vessels to tighten, which increases the blood pressure. Reducing the \n\namount of angiotensin II allows the blood vessels to relax, which lowers blood pressure. \n\n \n\nHigh blood pressure increases the workload of the heart and arteries. If this continues for a long time, \n\nit can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart and kidneys, and may result in a stroke, heart \n\nfailure, heart attack or kidney failure. Lowering the blood pressure to a normal level reduces the risk \n\nof developing these disorders. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE SPRIMEO \n\n \n\nDo not take Sprimeo \n\n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to aliskiren or any of the other ingredients of Sprimeo. If you \n\nthink you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. \n\n- if you have experienced the following forms of angioedema (difficulties in breathing or \n\nswallowing, or swelling of the face, hands and feet, eyes, lips and/or tongue): \n\n- angioedema when taking aliskiren. \n\n- hereditary angioedema. \n\n- angioedema without any known cause. \n\n- during the last 6 months of pregnancy or if you are breast-feeding, see section Pregnancy and \n\nbreastfeeding. \n\n- if you are taking ciclosporin (a medicine used in transplantation to prevent organ rejection or \n\nfor other conditions, e.g. rheumathoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis), itraconazole (a medicine \n\nused to treat fungal infections) or quinidine (a medicine used to correct heart rhythm). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n63 \n\n- if you have diabetes mellitus or impaired kidney function and you are treated with either of the \n\nfollowing classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an \u201cangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor\u201d such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril etc. \n\nor \n\n- an \u201cangiotensin 2 receptor blocker\u201d such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan etc. \n\n \n\nTake special care with Sprimeo \n\n- if you are taking a diuretic (a type of medicine also known as \u201cwater\u201d tablets which increases \n\nthe amount of urine you produce). \n\n- if you are taking either of the following classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an \u201cangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor\u201d such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril etc. \n\nor \n\n- an \u201cangiotensin 2 receptor blocker\u201d such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan etc. \n\n- if you have impaired kidney function, your doctor will carefully consider whether Sprimeo is \n\nsuitable for you and may wish to monitor you carefully. \n\n- if you experience angioedema (difficulties in breathing, or swallowing, or swelling of the face, \n\nhands and feet, eyes, lips and/or tongue). If this happens, stop taking Sprimeo and contact your \n\ndoctor. \n\n \n\nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before you take Sprimeo. \n\n \n\nThe use of Sprimeo in children and adolescents is not recommended. \n\nThe usual dose of Sprimeo for patients aged 65 years or older is 150 mg. \n\n \n\nUsing other medicines \n\nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \n\nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions if you are taking one of \n\nthe following medicines: \n\n- medicines that increase the amount of potassium in your blood.

high blood pressure. renin inhibitors reduce the amount of angiotensin ii the body can produce. angiotensin ii causes blood vessels to tighten, which increases the blood pressure. reducing the amount of angiotensin ii allows the blood vessels to relax, which lowers blood pressure. high blood pressure increases the workload of the heart and arteries. if this continues for a long time, it can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart and kidneys, and may result in a stroke, heart failure, heart attack or kidney failure. lowering the blood pressure to a normal level reduces the risk of developing these disorders.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "sprimeo", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 19, "BeginOffset": 51, "EndOffset": 67, "Score":
