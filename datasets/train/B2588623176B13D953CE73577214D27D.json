NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nPHEBURANE 483 mg/g granules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach gram of granules contains 483 mg of sodium phenylbutyrate. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect:  \n \nEach gram of sodium phenylbutyrate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) of sodium and 768 mg of sucrose. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nGranules. \nWhite to off-white granules. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPHEBURANE is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the chronic management of urea cycle disorders, \ninvolving deficiencies of carbamylphosphate synthetase, ornithine transcarbamylase or \nargininosuccinate synthetase. \n \nIt is indicated in all patients with neonatal-onset disease (complete enzyme deficiencies, presenting \nwithin the first 28 days of life). It is also indicated in patients with late-onset disease (partial enzyme \ndeficiencies, presenting after the first month of life) who have a history of hyperammonaemic \nencephalopathy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPHEBURANE treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the treatment of urea \ncycle disorders. \n \nPosology \nThe daily dose should be individually adjusted according to the patient\u2019s protein tolerance and the \ndaily dietary protein intake needed to promote growth and development. \n \nThe usual total daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate in clinical experience is: \n\u2022 450 - 600 mg/kg/day in neonates, infants and children weighing less than 20 kg \n\u2022 9.9 - 13.0 g/m2/day in children weighing more than 20 kg, adolescents and adults. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of doses in excess of 20 g/day have not been established. \n \nTherapeutic monitoring  \nPlasma levels of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), \ncarnitine and serum proteins should be maintained within normal limits. Plasma glutamine should be \nmaintained at levels less than 1,000 \u03bcmol/L. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nNutritional management  \nPHEBURANE must be combined with dietary protein restriction and, in some cases, essential amino \nacid and carnitine supplementation. \nCitrulline or arginine supplementation is required for patients diagnosed with neonatal-onset form of \ncarbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency at a dose of 0.17 g/kg/day \nor 3.8 g/m2/day. \n \nArginine supplementation is required for patients diagnosed with deficiency of argininosuccinate \nsynthetase at a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g/kg/day or 8.8 - 15.4 g/m2/day. \n \nIf caloric supplementation is indicated, a protein-free product is recommended. \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nSince the metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate involves the liver and kidneys, \nPHEBURANE should be used with caution in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency. \n \nMethod of administration \nPHEBURANE should be administered orally. Because of its slow dissolution, PHEBURANE should \nnot be administered by nasogastric or gastrostomy tubes. \n \nThe total daily dose should be divided into equal amounts and given with each meal or feeding (e.g. \n4-6 times per day in small children). The granules can be directly swallowed with a drink (water, \nfruit juices, protein-free infant formulas) or sprinkled on to a spoonful of solid foods (mashed \npotatoes or apple sauce); in this case, it is important that it is taken immediately in order to preserve \nthe taste-masking. \n \nA calibrated dosing spoon is provided which dispenses up to 3g of sodium phenylbutyrate by \ngraduation of 250 mg. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\u2022 Pregnancy. \n\u2022 Breast-feeding. \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nContent of clinically important electrolytes \n\n\u2022 PHEBURANE contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) of sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, \ncorresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) of sodium per 20 g of sodium phenylbutyrate, which is \nthe maximum daily dose. PHEBURANE should therefore be used with caution in patients \nwith congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency, and in clinical conditions where \nthere is sodium retention with oedema. \n\n\u2022 Serum potassium should be monitored during therapy since renal excretion of \nphenylacetylglutamine may induce a urinary loss of potassium. \n\n \nGeneral considerations \n\n\u2022 Even on therapy, acute hyperammonaemic encephalopathy may occur in a number of \npatients. \n\n\u2022 PHEBURANE is not recommended for the management of acute hyperammonaemia, which \nis a medical emergency. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nExcipients with known effect \n\u2022 This medicinal product contains 124 mg sodium per gram, equivalent to 6.2% of the WHO \n\nrecommended maximum daily intake for sodium. \nThe maximum daily dose of this medicinal product is equivalent to 125% of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake for sodium. \n\n\u2022 PHEBURANE is considered high in sodium. This should be particularly taken into account \nfor those on a low salt diet.  \n\n \n\u2022 This medicinal product contains 768 mg sucrose per gram. This should be taken into account \n\nin patients with diabetes mellitus. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \nintolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not \ntake this medicinal product. \n\n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcurrent administration of probenecid may affect renal excretion of the conjugation product of \nsodium phenylbutyrate. There have been published reports of hyperammonaemia being induced by \nhaloperidol and by valproate. Corticosteroids may cause the breakdown of body protein and thus \nincrease plasma ammonia levels. More frequent monitoring of plasma ammonia levels is advised \nwhen these medicinal products have to be used. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \nEffective contraceptive measures must be taken by women of child-bearing potential. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of sodium phenylbutyrate in pregnant women. \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \nPheburane is contra-indicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). Women of childbearing potential \nmust use effective contraception during treatment. \n \nBreast-feeding \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of sodium \nphenylbutyrate/metabolites in milk (see section 5.3). It is unknown whether sodium \nphenylbutyrate/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be \nexcluded. Pheburane is contra-indicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). \n \nFertility \nThere is no evidence available on the effect of sodium phenylbutyrate on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPHEBURANE has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \nIn clinical trials with sodium phenylbutyrate, 56 % of the patients experienced at least one adverse \nevent and 78 % of these adverse events were considered as not related to sodium phenylbutyrate. \nAdverse reactions mainly involved the reproductive and gastrointestinal system. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nIn the table below all adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency. \nFrequency is defined as very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to \n\n\n\n5 \n\n<1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from \nthe available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reaction \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nCommon anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis \nUncommon aplastic anaemia, ecchymosis \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders Common metabolic acidosis, alkalosis, decreased appetite \n\nPsychiatric disorders Common depression, irritability \nNervous system disorders Common syncope, headache \n\nCardiac disorders Common oedema Uncommon arrhythmia \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, dysgeusia \n\nUncommon pancreatitis, peptic ulcer, rectal haemorrhage, gastritis \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders Common rash, abnormal skin odor \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Common renal tubular acidosis \nReproductive system and \n\nbreast disorders Very common amenorrhea, irregular menstruation \n\nInvestigations Common \n\nDecreased blood potassium, albumin, total \nprotein and phosphate. Increased blood alkaline \nphosphatase, transaminases, bilirubin, uric acid, \n\nchloride, phosphate and sodium. Increased \nweight \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nA probable case of toxic reaction to sodium phenylbutyrate (450 mg/kg/d) was reported in an 18-\nyear old anorectic female patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactic \nacidosis, severe hypokalaemia, pancytopaenia, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis. She \nrecovered following dose reduction except for recurrent pancreatitis episodes that eventually \nprompted treatment discontinuation. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOne case of overdose occurred in a 5-month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g \n(1370 mg/kg). The patient developed diarrhea, irritability and metabolic acidosis with hypokalaemia. \nThe patient recovered within 48 hours after symptomatic treatment. \nThese symptoms are consistent with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed dose-limiting \nneurotoxicity when administered intravenously at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. Manifestations of \nneurotoxicity were predominantly somnolence, fatigue and light-headedness. Less frequent \nmanifestations were confusion, headache, dysgeusia, hypoacusis, disorientation, impaired memory \nand exacerbation of a pre-existing neuropathy. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nIn the event of an overdose, the treatment should be discontinued and supportive measures be \ninstituted. Haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis may be beneficial.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, various alimentary \ntract and metabolism products, ATC code: A16AX03. \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \nSodium phenylbutyrate is a pro-drug and is rapidly metabolised to phenylacetate. Phenylacetate is a \nmetabolically active compound that conjugates with glutamine via acetylation to form \nphenylacetylglutamine which is then excreted by the kidneys. On a molar basis, \nphenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (each containing 2 moles of nitrogen) and therefore \nprovides an alternate vehicle for waste nitrogen excretion.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nBased on studies of phenylacetylglutamine excretion in patients with urea cycle disorders it is \npossible to estimate that, for each gram of sodium phenylbutyrate administered, between 0.12 and \n0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen are produced. As a consequence, sodium phenylbutyrate \nreduces elevated plasma ammonia and glutamine levels in patients with urea cycle disorders. It is \nimportant that the diagnosis is made early and treatment is initiated immediately to improve the \nsurvival and the clinical outcome. \n \nIn late-onset deficiency patients, including females heterozygous for ornithine transcarbamylase \ndeficiency, who recovered from hyperammonaemic encephalopathy and were then treated \nchronically with dietary protein restriction and sodium phenylbutyrate, the survival rate was 98 %. \nThe majority of the patients who were tested had an IQ in the average to low average/borderline \nmentally retarded range. Their cognitive performance remained relatively stable during \nphenylbutyrate therapy. Reversal of pre-existing neurologic impairment is not likely to occur with \ntreatment, and neurologic deterioration may continue in some patients. \n \nPHEBURANE may be required life-long unless orthotropic liver transplantation is elected. \n \nPaediatric population \nPreviously, neonatal-onset presentation of urea cycle disorders was almost universally fatal within \nthe first year of life, even when treated with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or their \nnitrogen-free analogues. With haemodialysis, use of alternative waste nitrogen excretion pathways \n(sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), dietary protein restriction, \nand, in some cases, essential amino acid supplementation, the survival rate in newborns diagnosed \nafter birth (but within the first month of life) increased to almost 80 % with most deaths occurring \nduring an episode of acute hyperammonaemic encephalopathy. Patients with neonatal-onset disease \nhad a high incidence of mental retardation. \n \nIn patients diagnosed during gestation and treated prior to any episode of hyperammonaemic \nencephalopathy, survival was 100 %, but even in these patients, many subsequently demonstrated \ncognitive impairment or other neurologic deficits. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPhenylbutyrate is known to be oxidised to phenylacetate which is enzymatically conjugated with \nglutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine in the liver and kidney. Phenylacetate is also hydrolysed \nby esterases in liver and blood. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nPlasma and urine concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites have been obtained from \nfasting normal adults who received a single dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrate and from patients \nwith urea cycle disorders, haemoglobinopathies and cirrhosis receiving single and repeated oral \ndoses up to 20 g/day (uncontrolled studies). The disposition of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites has \nalso been studied in cancer patients following intravenous infusion of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to \n2 g/m\u00b2) or phenylacetate. \n \nAbsorption \nPhenylbutyrate is rapidly absorbed under fasting conditions. After a single oral dose of 5 g of sodium \nphenylbutyrate, in the form of granules, measurable plasma levels of phenylbutyrate were detected \n15 minutes after dosing. The mean time to peak concentration was 1 hour and the mean peak \nconcentration 195 \u03bcg/ml. The elimination half-life was estimated to be 0.8 hours. \nThe effect of food on absorption is unknown. \n \nDistribution \nThe volume of distribution of phenylbutyrate is 0.2 l/kg. \n \nBiotransformation \nAfter a single dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrate, in the form of granules, measurable plasma \nlevels of phenylacetate and phenylacetylglutamine were detected 30 and 60 minutes respectively \nafter dosing. The mean time to peak concentration was 3.55 and 3.23 hours, respectively, and the \nmean peak concentration was 45.3 and 62.8 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. The elimination half-life was \nestimated to be 1.3 and 2.4 hours, respectively. \n \nStudies with high intravenous doses of phenylacetate showed non-linear pharmacokinetics \ncharacterised by saturable metabolism to phenylacetylglutamine. Repeated dosing with \nphenylacetate showed evidence of an induction of clearance. \n \nIn the majority of patients with urea cycle disorders or haemoglobinopathies receiving various doses \nof phenylbutyrate (300 - 650 mg/kg/day up to 20 g/day) no plasma level of phenylacetate could be \ndetected after overnight fasting. In patients with impaired hepatic function the conversion of \nphenylacetate to phenylacetylglutamine may be relatively slower. Three cirrhotic patients (out of 6) \nwho received repeated oral administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g/day in three doses) \nshowed sustained plasma levels of phenylacetate on the third day that were five times higher than \nthose achieved after the first dose. \n \nIn normal volunteers gender differences were found in the pharmacokinetic parameters of \nphenylbutyrate and phenylacetate (AUC and Cmax about 30 - 50 % greater in females), but not \nphenylacetylglutamine. This may be due to the lipophilicity of sodium phenylbutyrate and \nconsequent differences in volume of distribution. \n \nExcretion \nApproximately 80 - 100 % of the medicinal product is excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours as the \nconjugated product, phenylacetylglutamine. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPrenatal exposure of rat pups to phenylacetate (the active metabolite of phenylbutyrate) produced \nlesions in cortical pyramidal cells; dendritic spines were longer and thinner than normal and reduced \nin number (see section 4.6).  \n \nWhen high doses of phenylacetate (190 - 474 mg/kg) were given subcutaneously to rat pups, \ndecreased proliferation and increased loss of neurons were observed, as well as a reduction in CNS \n\n\n\n8 \n\nmyelin. Cerebral synapse maturation was retarded and the number of functioning nerve terminals in \nthe cerebrum was reduced, which resulted in impaired brain growth. (see section 4.6). \n \nSodium phenylbutyrate was negative in 2 mutagenicity tests, i.e. the Ames test and the micronucleus \ntest. Results indicate that sodium phenylbutyrate did not induce any mutagenic effects in the Ames \ntest with or without metabolic activation. Micronucleus test results indicate that sodium \nphenylbutyrate was considered not to have produced any clastogenic effect in rats treated at toxic or \nnon-toxic dose levels (examined 24 and 48 hours after a single oral administration of 878 to \n2800 mg/kg). \n \nCarcinogenicity and fertility studies have not been conducted with sodium phenylbutyrate. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n\u2022 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\u2022 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm \n\nthem, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\u2022 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet: \n \n1. What PHEBURANE is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take PHEBURANE \n3. How to take PHEBURANE \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store PHEBURANE \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What PHEBURANE is and what it is used for \n \nPHEBURANE contains the active substance sodium phenylbutyrate which is used to treat patients of \nall ages with urea cycle disorders. These rare disorders are due to a deficiency of certain liver \nenzymes which are necessary to eliminate waste nitrogen in the form of ammonia. \n \nNitrogen is a building block of proteins, which are an essential part of the food we eat. As the body \nbreaks down protein after eating, waste nitrogen, in the form of ammonia, accumulates because the \nbody cannot eliminate it. Ammonia is especially toxic for the brain and leads, in severe cases, to \nreduced levels of consciousness and to coma. \n \nPHEBURANE helps the body to eliminate waste nitrogen, reducing the amount of ammonia in your \nbody. However PHEBURANE must be used along with a diet reduced in proteins, designed \nespecially for you by the doctor and the dietician. You must follow this diet carefully. \n \n2. What you need to know before you take PHEBURANE \n \nDo not take PHEBURANE if you: \n\u2022 are allergic to sodium phenylbutyrate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \n\nin section 6). \n\u2022 are pregnant. \n\u2022 are breast-feeding. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking PHEBURANE if you: \n\u2022 suffer from congestive heart failure (a type of heart disease where the heart cannot pump \n\nenough blood around the body) or a decrease in your kidney function. \n\u2022 have decreased kidney or liver function, since PHEBURANE is eliminated from the body \n\nthrough the kidney and liver. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \nPHEBURANE will not prevent the occurrence of an acute excess of ammonia in the blood, a \ncondition which usually constitutes a medical emergency. If this happens you will develop \nsymptoms such as feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), confusion and will need to get urgent \nmedical help. \n \nIf you need laboratory tests, it is important to remind your doctor that you are taking PHEBURANE, \nsince sodium phenylbutyrate may interfere with certain laboratory test results (such as blood \nelectrolytes or protein, or liver function tests) \n \nIn case of any doubt, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nOther medicines and PHEBURANE \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nIt is especially important to tell your doctor if you are taking medicines containing: \n\u2022 valproate (an antiepileptic medicine), \n\u2022 haloperidol (used in certain psychotic disorders), \n\u2022 corticosteroids (medicines that are used to provide relief for inflamed areas of the body), \n\u2022 probenecid (for treatment of hyperuricaemia, high levels of uric acid in the blood, associated \n\nwith gout) \n \nThese medicines may change the effect of PHEBURANE and you will need more frequent blood \ntests. If you are uncertain if your medicines contain these substances, you should check with your \ndoctor or pharmacist. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not use PHEBURANE if you are pregnant, because this medicine can harm your unborn baby.  \n \nIf you are a woman who could get pregnant, you must use reliable contraception, during \ntreatment with PHEBURANE. Talk to your doctor for the details. \n \nDo not use PHEBURANE if you are breast-feeding, because this medicine can pass into the breast \nmilk and may harm your baby. \n \nDriving and using machines \nPHEBURANE is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nPHEBURANE contains sodium and sucrose \nThis medicine contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) of sodium per 1 g of sodium phenylbutyrate. Talk to your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you need 3 or more grams daily for a prolonged period, especially if you have \nbeen advised to follow a low salt (sodium) diet.  \n \nThis medicine contains 768 mg of sucrose per 1 g of sodium phenylbutyrate. This should be taken \ninto account if you have diabetes mellitus. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.  \n \n \n3. How to take PHEBURANE \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nDosage \n\n\n\n20 \n\nThe daily dose of PHEBURANE will be based on your body weight or body surface and adjusted \naccording to your protein tolerance and diet. You will need regular blood tests to determine the \ncorrect daily dose. Your doctor will tell you the amount of granules you should take. \n \nMethod of administration \nYou should take PHEBURANE by mouth. Because it dissolves slowly, PHEBURANE should not be \nadministered through a gastrostomy (tube that goes through the abdomen to the stomach) or through \na nasogastric tube (tube that goes through the nose to the stomach). \n \nPHEBURANE must be taken with a special diet reduced in protein. \n \nYou should take PHEBURANE with each meal or feeding. In small children this can be 4 to 6 times \nper day. \n \nA calibrating measuring spoon which dispenses up to 3 g of sodium phenylbutyrate is provided with \nthe medicine. Only use this measuring spoon to measure out the dose. \n \nTo measure the dose: \n\u2022 Lines on the spoon indicate the amount (in gram of sodium phenylbutyrate). Take the correct \n\namount as prescribed by your doctor. \n\u2022 Pour granules directly into the spoon as shown by the picture (on the outer carton and at the \n\nend of/page 2 of this leaflet) \n\u2022 Tap the spoon once on a table to give a horizontal level of granules and continue filling if \n\nnecessary \n \n \nThe granules can be directly swallowed with a drink (water, fruit juices, protein-free infant formulas) \nor sprinkled on to a spoonful of solid foods (mashed potatoes or apple sauce). If you mix them with \nfood, it is important that you take it immediately. This will keep the granules from producing any \ntaste. \n \nYou will need to take this medicine and to follow a diet throughout your life. \n \nIf you take more PHEBURANE than you should \nPatients who have taken very high doses of sodium phenylbutyrate experienced: \n\u2022 sleepiness, tiredness, light-headedness and less frequently confusion, \n\u2022 headache, \n\u2022 changes in taste (taste disturbances), \n\u2022 decrease in hearing, \n\u2022 disorientation, \n\u2022 impaired memory, \n\u2022 worsening of existing neurological conditions. \n \nIf you experience any of these symptoms, you should immediately contact your doctor or the nearest \nhospital emergency department for supportive treatment. \n \nIf you forget to take PHEBURANE \nYou should take a dose as soon as possible with your next meal. Make sure that there are at least \n3 hours between two doses. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIf persistent vomiting occurs, you should contact your doctor immediately. \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): irregular menstrual periods and \nstopping of menstrual periods in fertile women. \nIf you are sexually active and your period stops altogether, do not assume that this is caused by \nPHEBURANE. If this occurs, please discuss it with your doctor, because the absence of your period \nmay be caused by pregnancy (see \u2018Pregnancy and breast-feeding\u2019 section above) or by menopause.  \n \nCommon side effects (may affect more than 1 in 100 people): changes in number of blood cells (red \ncells, white cells and platelets), changes in the amount of bicarbonate in the blood, reduced appetite, \ndepression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention (swelling), changes in taste (taste \ndisturbances), stomach ache, vomiting, nausea, constipation, abnormal skin odor, rash, abnormal \nkidney function, weight gain, altered laboratory test values. \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect more than 1 in 1,000 people): deficiency in red blood cells due \nto failure of the bone marrow, bruising, altered heart rhythm, rectal bleeding, inflammation of the \nstomach, stomach ulcer, inflammation of the pancreas. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety \nof this medicine. \n\n \n \n5. How to store PHEBURANE \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use PHEBURANE after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and the bottle label after \nEXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nAfter the first opening, PHEBURANE can be used within 45 days. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n \n6.

patients of all ages with urea cycle disorders. these rare disorders are due to a deficiency of certain liver enzymes which are necessary to eliminate waste nitrogen in the form of ammonia. nitrogen is a building block of proteins, which are an essential part of the food we eat. as the body breaks down protein after eating, waste nitrogen, in the form of ammonia, accumulates because the body cannot eliminate it. ammonia is especially toxic for the brain and leads, in severe cases, to reduced levels of consciousness and to coma. pheburane helps the body to eliminate waste nitrogen, reducing the amount of ammonia in your body. however pheburane must be used along with a diet reduced in proteins, designed especially for you by the doctor and the dietician. you must follow this

20 the daily dose of pheburane will be based on your body weight or body surface and adjusted according to your protein tolerance and diet. you will need regular blood tests to determine the correct daily dose. your doctor will tell you the amount of granules you should take. method of administration you should take pheburane by mouth. because it dissolves slowly, pheburane should not be administered through a gastrostomy (tube that goes through the abdomen to the stomach) or through a nasogastric tube (tube that goes through the nose to the stomach). pheburane must be taken with a special diet reduced in protein. you should take pheburane with each meal or feeding. in small children this can be 4 to 6 times per day. a calibrating measuring spoon which dispenses up to 3 g of sodium phenylbutyrate is provided with the medicine. only use this measuring spoon to measure out the dose. to measure the dose: lines on the spoon indicate the amount (in gram of sodium phenylbutyrate). take the correct amount as prescribed by your doctor. pour granules directly into the spoon as shown by the picture (on the outer carton and at the end of/page 2 of this leaflet) tap the spoon once on a table to give a horizontal level of granules and continue filling if necessary the granules can be directly swallowed with a drink (water, fruit juices, protein-free infant formulas) or sprinkled on to a spoonful of solid foods (mashed potatoes or apple sauce). if you mix them with food, it is important that you take it immediately. this will keep the granules from producing any taste. you will need to take this medicine and to follow a diet throughout your life. if you take more pheburane than you should patients who have taken very high doses of sodium phenylbutyrate experienced: sleepiness, tiredness, light-headedness and less frequently confusion, headache, changes in taste (taste disturbances), decrease in hearing, disorientation, impaired memory, worsening of existing neurological conditions. if you experience any of these symptoms, you should immediately contact your doctor or the nearest hospital emergency department for supportive treatment. if you forget to take pheburane you should take a dose as soon as possible with your next meal. make sure that there are at least 3 hours between two doses. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "pheburane", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME",
