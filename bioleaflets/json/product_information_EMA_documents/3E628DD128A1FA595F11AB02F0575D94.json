NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nClopidogrel Teva Generics B.V. 75 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 75 mg of clopidogrel (as hydrochloride). \n \nExcipient: \nEach film-coated tablet contains 13 mg hydrogenated castor oil.  \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \nPink, round and slightly convex film-coated tablets. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nClopidogrel is indicated in adults for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in: \n• Patients suffering from myocardial infarction (from a few days until less than 35 days), \n\nischaemic stroke (from 7 days until less than 6 months) or established peripheral arterial \ndisease. \n\n• Patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome: \n- Non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave \n\nmyocardial infarction), including patients undergoing a stent placement following \npercutaneous coronary intervention, in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). \n\n- ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction, in combination with ASA in medically \ntreated patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy. \n\n \nFor further information please refer to section 5.1. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n• Adults and elderly \n\nClopidogrel should be given as a single daily dose of 75 mg with or without food. \nIn patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome: \n− Non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave \n\nmyocardial infarction): clopidogrel treatment should be initiated with a single 300 mg \nloading dose and then continued at 75 mg once a day (with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) \n75 mg-325 mg daily). Since higher doses of ASA were associated with higher bleeding \nrisk it is recommended that the dose of ASA should not be higher than 100 mg. The \noptimal duration of treatment has not been formally established. Clinical trial data support \nuse up to 12 months, and the maximum benefit was seen at 3 months (see section 5.1). \n\n− ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction: clopidogrel should be given as a single \ndaily dose of 75 mg initiated with a 300 mg loading dose in combination with ASA and \nwith or without thrombolytics. For patients over 75 years of age clopidogrel should be \ninitiated without a loading dose. Combined therapy should be started as early as possible \nafter symptoms start and continued for at least four weeks. The benefit of the combination \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nof clopidogrel with ASA beyond four weeks has not been studied in this setting (see \nsection 5.1). \n\n \n• Pharmacogenetics \n\nCYP2C19 poor metaboliser status is associated with diminished response to clopidogrel. The \noptimal dose regimen for poor metabolisers has yet to be determined (see section 5.2). \n\n \n• Paediatric patients \n\nThe safety and efficacy of clopidogrel in children and adolescents have not yet been established. \n \n• Renal impairment \n\nTherapeutic experience is limited in patients with renal impairment (see section 4.4). \n \n• Hepatic impairment \n\nTherapeutic experience is limited in patients with moderate hepatic disease who may have \nbleeding diatheses (see section 4.4). \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n• Severe liver impairment. \n• Active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial haemorrhage. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nBleeding and haematological disorders \nDue to the risk of bleeding and haematological adverse reactions, blood cell count determination \nand/or other appropriate testing should be promptly considered whenever clinical symptoms \nsuggestive of bleeding arise during the course of treatment (see section 4.8). As with other antiplatelet \nagents, clopidogrel should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding \nfrom trauma, surgery or other pathological conditions and in patients receiving treatment with ASA, \nheparin, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including \nCox-2 inhibitors. Patients should be followed carefully for any signs of bleeding including occult \nbleeding, especially during the first weeks of treatment and/or after invasive cardiac procedures or \nsurgery. The concomitant administration of clopidogrel with oral anticoagulants is not recommended \nsince it may increase the intensity of bleedings (see section 4.5). \n \nIf a patient is to undergo elective surgery and antiplatelet effect is temporarily not desirable, \nclopidogrel should be discontinued 7 days prior to surgery. Patients should inform physicians and \ndentists that they are taking clopidogrel before any surgery is scheduled and before any new medicinal \nproduct is taken. Clopidogrel prolongs bleeding time and should be used with caution in patients who \nhave lesions with a propensity to bleed (particularly gastrointestinal and intraocular). \n \nPatients should be told that it might take longer than usual to stop bleeding when they take clopidogrel \n(alone or in combination with ASA), and that they should report any unusual bleeding (site or \nduration) to their physician. \n \nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) \nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been reported very rarely following the use of \nclopidogrel, sometimes after a short exposure. It is characterised by thrombocytopenia and \nmicroangiopathic haemolytic anaemia associated with either neurological findings, renal dysfunction \nor fever. TTP is a potentially fatal condition requiring prompt treatment including plasmapheresis. \n \nRecent ischaemic stroke \nIn view of the lack of data, clopidogrel cannot be recommended during the first 7 days after acute \nischaemic stroke. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nCytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) \nPharmacogenetics: Based on literature data, patients with genetically reduced CYP2C19 function have \nlower systemic exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel and diminished antiplatelet responses, \nand generally exhibit higher cardiovascular event rates following myocardial infarction than do \npatients with normal CYP2C19 function (see section 5.2). \n \nSince clopidogrel is metabolised to its active metabolite partly by CYP2C19, use of medicinal products \nthat inhibit the activity of this enzyme would be expected to result in reduced drug levels of the active \nmetabolite of clopidogrel. The clinical relevance of this interaction is uncertain. As a precaution \nconcomitant use of medicinal products that inhibit CYP2C19 should be discouraged (see section 4.5 \nfor a list of CYP2C19 inhibitors, see also section 5.2).  \n \nRenal impairment \nTherapeutic experience with clopidogrel is limited in patients with renal impairment. Therefore \nclopidogrel should be used with caution in these patients (see section 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nExperience is limited in patients with moderate hepatic disease who may have bleeding diatheses. \nClopidogrel should therefore be used with caution in this population (see section 4.2). \n \nExcipients \nThis medicinal product contains hydrogenated castor oil which may cause stomach upset and \ndiarrhoea. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nOral anticoagulants: the concomitant administration of clopidogrel with oral anticoagulants is not \nrecommended since it may increase the intensity of bleedings (see section 4.4). \n \nGlycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors: clopidogrel should be used with caution in patients who receive \nconcomitant glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (see section 4.4). \n \nAcetylsalicylic acid (ASA): ASA did not modify the clopidogrel-mediated inhibition of ADP-induced \nplatelet aggregation, but clopidogrel potentiated the effect of ASA on collagen-induced platelet \naggregation. However, concomitant administration of 500 mg of ASA twice a day for one day did not \nsignificantly increase the prolongation of bleeding time induced by clopidogrel intake. A \npharmacodynamic interaction between clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid is possible, leading to \nincreased risk of bleeding. Therefore, concomitant use should be undertaken with caution (see \nsection 4.4). However, clopidogrel and ASA have been administered together for up to one year (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nHeparin: in a clinical study conducted in healthy subjects, clopidogrel did not necessitate modification \nof the heparin dose or alter the effect of heparin on coagulation. Co-administration of heparin had no \neffect on the inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by clopidogrel. A pharmacodynamic \ninteraction between clopidogrel and heparin is possible, leading to increased risk of bleeding. \nTherefore, concomitant use should be undertaken with caution (see section 4.4). \n \nThrombolytics: the safety of the concomitant administration of clopidogrel, fibrin or non-fibrin \nspecific thrombolytic agents and heparins was assessed in patients with acute myocardial infarction. \nThe incidence of clinically significant bleeding was similar to that observed when thrombolytic agents \nand heparin are co-administered with ASA (see section 4.8). \n \nNSAIDs: in a clinical study conducted in healthy volunteers, the concomitant administration of \nclopidogrel and naproxen increased occult gastrointestinal blood loss. However, due to the lack of \ninteraction studies with other NSAIDs it is presently unclear whether there is an increased risk of \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\ngastrointestinal bleeding with all NSAIDs. Consequently, NSAIDs including Cox-2 inhibitors and \nclopidogrel should be co-administered with caution (see section 4.4). \n \nOther concomitant therapy:  \nSince clopidogrel is metabolised to its active metabolite partly by CYP2C19, use of medicinal products \nthat inhibit the activity of this enzyme would be expected to result in reduced drug levels of the active \nmetabolite of clopidogrel. The clinical relevance of this interaction is uncertain. As a precaution \nconcomitant use of medicinal products that inhibit CYP2C19 should be discouraged (see sections 4.4 \nand 5.2). \n \nMedicinal products that inhibit CYP2C19 include omeprazole and esomeprazole, fluvoxamine, \nfluoxetine, moclobemide, voriconazole, fluconazole, ticlopidine, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine, \ncarbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and chloramphenicol. \n \nProton Pump Inhibitors (PPI):  \nIn a crossover clinical study, clopidogrel (300-mg loading dose followed by 75 mg/day) alone and with \nomeprazole (80 mg at the same time as clopidogrel) were administered for 5 days. The exposure to the \nactive metabolite of clopidogrel was decreased by 45% (Day 1) and 40% (Day 5) when clopidogrel \nand omeprazole were administered together. Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) with \n5 μM ADP was diminished by 39% (24 hours) and 21% (Day 5) when clopidogrel and omeprazole \nwere administered together. In another study it was shown that administering clopidogrel and \nomeprazole 12 hours apart did not prevent their interaction that is likely to be driven by the inhibitory \neffect of omeprazole on CYP2C19. Esomeprazole is expected to give a similar interaction with \nclopidogrel. \n \nInconsistent data on the clinical implications of this pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD)  \ninteraction in terms of major cardiovascular events have been reported from both observational and \nclinical studies. As a precaution, concomitant use of omeprazole or esomeprozole should be \ndiscouraged (see section 4.4). No conclusive data on the pharmacodynamic interaction of clopidogrel \nand other PPIs are available. \n \nThere is no evidence that other medicinal products that reduce stomach acid such as H2 blockers \n(except cimetidine which is a CYP2C19 inhibitor) or antacids interfere with antiplatelet activity of \nclopidogrel. \n  \nOther medicinal products:  \nA number of other clinical studies have been conducted with clopidogrel and other concomitant \nmedicinal products to investigate the potential for pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic \ninteractions. No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidogrel \nwas co-administered with atenolol, nifedipine, or both atenolol and nifedipine. Furthermore, the \npharmacodynamic activity of clopidogrel was not significantly influenced by the coadministration of \nphenobarbital, or oestrogen. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of digoxin or theophylline were not modified by the co-administration of \nclopidogrel. Antacids did not modify the extent of clopidogrel absorption. \n \nData from studies with human liver microsomes indicated that the carboxylic acid metabolite of \nclopidogrel could inhibit the activity of Cytochrome P450 2C9. This could potentially lead to \nincreased plasma levels of medicinal products such as phenytoin and tolbutamide and the NSAIDs, \nwhich are metabolised by Cytochrome P450 2C9. Data from the CAPRIE study indicate that phenytoin \nand tolbutamide can be safely co-administered with clopidogrel. \n \nApart from the specific medicinal product interaction information described above, interaction studies \nwith clopidogrel and some medicinal products commonly administered in patients with \natherothrombotic disease have not been performed. However, patients entered into clinical trials with \nclopidogrel received a variety of concomitant medicinal products including diuretics, beta blockers, \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nACEI, calcium antagonists, cholesterol lowering agents, coronary vasodilators, antidiabetic agents \n(including insulin), antiepileptic agents, and GPIIb/IIIa antagonists without evidence of clinically \nsignificant adverse interactions. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nAs no clinical data on exposure to clopidogrel during pregnancy are available, it is preferable not to \nuse clopidogrel during pregnancy as a precautionary measure.  \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, \nembryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). \n \nIt is unknown whether clopidogrel is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of clopidogrel in breast milk. As a precautionary measure, breast-feeding should not be \ncontinued during treatment with Clopidogrel Teva Generics B.V.. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nClopidogrel has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nClopidogrel has been evaluated for safety in more than 42,000 patients who have participated in \nclinical studies, including over 9,000 patients treated for 1 year or more. The clinically relevant \nadverse reactions observed in the CAPRIE, CURE, CLARITY and COMMIT studies are discussed \nbelow. Overall, clopidogrel 75 mg/day was comparable to ASA 325 mg/day in CAPRIE regardless of \nage, gender and race. In addition to clinical studies experience, adverse reactions have been \nspontaneously reported. \n \nBleeding is the most common reaction reported both in clinical studies as well as in post-marketing \nexperience where it was mostly reported during the first month of treatment. \n \nIn CAPRIE, in patients treated with either clopidogrel or ASA, the overall incidence of any bleeding \nwas 9.3%. The incidence of severe cases was 1.4% for clopidogrel and 1.6% for ASA.  \n \nIn CURE, the major bleeding event rate for clopidogrel + ASA was dose-dependent on ASA \n(<100 mg: 2.6%; 100-200 mg: 3.5%; >200 mg: 4.9%) as was the major bleeding event rate for \nplacebo + ASA (<100 mg: 2.0%; 100-200 mg: 2.3%; >200 mg: 4.0%).The risk of bleeding \n(life-threatening, major, minor, other) decreased during the course of the trial: 0-1 months \n(clopidogrel: 9.6%; placebo: 6.6%), 1-3 months (clopidogrel: 4.5%; placebo: 2.3%), 3-6 months \n(clopidogrel: 3.8%; placebo: 1.6%), 6-9 months (clopidogrel: 3.2%; placebo: 1.5%), 9-12 months \n(clopidogrel: 1.9%; placebo: 1.0%). There was no excess in major bleeds with clopidogrel + ASA \nwithin 7 days after coronary bypass graft surgery in patients who stopped therapy more than five days \nprior to surgery (4.4% clopidogrel + ASA vs. 5.3% placebo + ASA). In patients who remained on \ntherapy within five days of bypass graft surgery, the event rate was 9.6% for clopidogrel+ASA, and \n6.3% for placebo + ASA. \n \nIn CLARITY, there was an overall increase in bleeding in the clopidogrel + ASA group (17.4%) vs. \nthe placebo + ASA group (12.9%). The incidence of major bleeding was similar between groups \n(1.3% versus 1.1% for the clopidogrel + ASA and the placebo + ASA groups, respectively). This was \nconsistent across subgroups of patients defined by baseline characteristics, and type of fibrinolytic or \nheparin therapy.  \n \nIn COMMIT, the overall rate of noncerebral major bleeding or cerebral bleeding was low and similar \nin both groups (0.6% versus 0.5% in the clopidogrel + ASA and the placebo + ASA groups, \nrespectively). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nAdverse reactions that occurred either during clinical studies or that were spontaneously reported are \npresented in the table below.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: platelet aggregation inhibitors excl. heparin, ATC code: B01AC-04.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\nClopidogrel is a prodrug, one of whose metabolites is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel \nmust be metabolised by CYP450 enzymes to produce the active metabolite that inhibits platelet \naggregation. The active metabolite of clopidogrel selectively inhibits the binding of adenosine \ndiphosphate (ADP) to its platelet P2Y12 receptor and the subsequent ADP-mediated activation of the \nglycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation. Due to the irreversible \nbinding, platelets exposed are affected for the remainder of their lifespan (approximately 7-10 days) \nand recovery of normal platelet function occurs at a rate consistent with platelet turnover. Platelet \naggregation induced by agonists other than ADP is also inhibited by blocking the amplification of \nplatelet activation by released ADP. \n \nBecause the active metabolite is formed by CYP450 enzymes, some of which are polymorphic or \nsubject to inhibition by other drugs, not all patients will have adequate platelet inhibition. \n \nRepeated doses of 75 mg per day produced substantial inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation \nfrom the first day; this increased progressively and reached steady state between Day 3 and Day 7. At \nsteady state, the average inhibition level observed with a dose of 75 mg per day was between 40% and \n60%. Platelet aggregation and bleeding time gradually returned to baseline values, generally within \n5 days after treatment was discontinued. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of clopidogrel have been evaluated in 4 double-blind studies involving over \n80,000 patients: the CAPRIE study, a comparison of clopidogrel to ASA, and the CURE, CLARITY \nand COMMIT studies comparing clopidogrel to placebo, both medicinal products given in \ncombination with ASA and other standard therapy. \n \nRecent myocardial infarction (MI), recent stroke or established peripheral arterial disease \n \nThe CAPRIE study included 19,185 patients with atherothrombosis as manifested by recent \nmyocardial infarction (<35 days), recent ischaemic stroke (between 7 days and 6 months) or \nestablished peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Patients were randomized to clopidogrel 75 mg/day or \nASA 325 mg/day, and were followed for 1 to 3 years. In the myocardial infarction subgroup, most of \nthe patients received ASA for the first few days following the acute myocardial infarction. \n \nClopidogrel significantly reduced the incidence of new ischaemic events (combined end point of \nmyocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and vascular death) when compared to ASA. In the intention \nto treat analysis, 939 events were observed in the clopidogrel group and 1,020 events with ASA \n(relative risk reduction (RRR) 8.7%, [95% CI: 0.2 to 16.4]; p = 0.045), which corresponds, for every \n1,000 patients treated for 2 years, to 10 [CI: 0 to 20] additional patients being prevented from \nexperiencing a new ischaemic event. Analysis of total mortality as a secondary endpoint did not show \nany significant difference between clopidogrel (5.8%) and ASA (6.0%). \n \nIn a subgroup analysis by qualifying condition (myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, and PAD) the \nbenefit appeared to be strongest (achieving statistical significance at p = 0.003) in patients enrolled \ndue to PAD (especially those who also had a history of myocardial infarction) (RRR = 23.7%; CI: 8.9 \nto 36.2) and weaker (not significantly different from ASA) in stroke patients (RRR = 7.3%; CI: -5.7 to \n18.7 [p=0.258]). In patients who were enrolled in the trial on the sole basis of a recent myocardial \ninfarction, clopidogrel was numerically inferior, but not statistically different from ASA (RRR = -\n4.0%; CI: -22.5 to 11.7 [p=0.639]). In addition, a subgroup analysis by age suggested that the benefit \nof clopidogrel in patients over 75 years was less than that observed in patients ≤75 years. \n \nSince the CAPRIE trial was not powered to evaluate efficacy of individual subgroups, it is not clear \nwhether the differences in relative risk reduction across qualifying conditions are real, or a result of \nchance. \n \nAcute coronary syndrome \n \nThe CURE study included 12,562 patients with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome \n(unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction), and presenting within 24 hours of onset of the \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\nmost recent episode of chest pain or symptoms consistent with ischaemia. Patients were required to \nhave either ECG changes compatible with new ischaemia or elevated cardiac enzymes or troponin I or \nT to at least twice the upper limit of normal. Patients were randomised to clopidogrel (300 mg loading \ndose followed by 75 mg/day, N=6,259) or placebo (N=6,303), both given in combination with ASA \n(75-325 mg once daily) and other standard therapies. Patients were treated for up to one year. In \nCURE, 823 (6.6%) patients received concomitant GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist therapy. Heparins \nwere administered in more than 90% of the patients and the relative rate of bleeding between \nclopidogrel and placebo was not significantly affected by the concomitant heparin therapy. \n \nThe number of patients experiencing the primary endpoint [cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial \ninfarction (MI), or stroke] was 582 (9.3%) in the clopidogrel-treated group and 719 (11.4%) in the \nplacebo-treated group, a 20% relative risk reduction (95% CI of 10%-28%; p=0.00009) for the \nclopidogrel-treated group (17% relative risk reduction when patients were treated conservatively, 29% \nwhen they underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with or without stent \nand 10% when they underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)). New cardiovascular events \n(primary endpoint) were prevented, with relative risk reductions of 22% (CI: 8.6, 33.4), 32% (CI: 12.8, \n46.4), 4% (CI: -26.9, 26.7), 6% (CI: -33.5, 34.3) and 14% (CI: -31.6, 44.2), during the 0-1, 1-3, 3-6, \n6-9 and 9-12 month study intervals, respectively. Thus, beyond 3 months of treatment, the benefit \nobserved in the clopidogrel + ASA group was not further increased, whereas the risk of haemorrhage \npersisted (see section 4.4). \n \nThe use of clopidogrel in CURE was associated with a decrease in the need of thrombolytic therapy \n(RRR=43.3%; CI: 24.3%, 57.5%) and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (RRR=18.2%; CI: 6.5%, 28.3%). \n \nThe number of patients experiencing the co-primary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke or refractory \nischaemia) was 1,035 (16.5%) in the clopidogrel-treated group and 1,187 (18.8%) in the placebo-\ntreated group, a 14% relative risk reduction (95% CI of 6%-21%, p=0.0005) for the clopidogrel-\ntreated group. This benefit was mostly driven by the statistically significant reduction in the incidence \nof MI [287 (4.6%) in the clopidogrel treated group and 363 (5.8%) in the placebo treated group]. \nThere was no observed effect on the rate of rehospitalisation for unstable angina. \n \nThe results obtained in populations with different characteristics (e.g. unstable angina or non-Q-wave \nMI, low to high risk levels, diabetes, need for revascularisation, age, gender, etc.) were consistent with \nthe results of the primary analysis. In particular, in a post-hoc analysis in 2,172 patients (17% of the \ntotal CURE population) who underwent stent placement (Stent-CURE), the data showed that \nclopidogrel compared to placebo, demonstrated a significant RRR of 26.2% favouring clopidogrel for \nthe co-primary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke) and also a significant RRR of 23.9% for the second \nco-primary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke or refractory ischaemia). Moreover, the safety profile of \nclopidogrel in this subgroup of patients did not raise any particular concern. Thus, the results from this \nsubset are in line with the overall trial results. \n \nThe benefits observed with clopidogrel were independent of other acute and long-term cardiovascular \ntherapies (such as heparin/LMWH, GPIIb/IIIa antagonists, lipid lowering medicinal products, beta \nblockers, and ACE-inhibitors). The efficacy of clopidogrel was observed independently of the dose of \nASA (75-325 mg once daily). \n \nIn patients with acute ST-segment elevation MI, safety and efficacy of clopidogrel have been \nevaluated in 2 randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, CLARITY and COMMIT. \n \nThe CLARITY trial included 3,491 patients presenting within 12 hours of the onset of a ST elevation \nMI and planned for thrombolytic therapy. Patients received clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose, \nfollowed by 75 mg/day, n=1,752) or placebo (n=1,739), both in combination with ASA (150 to \n325 mg as a loading dose, followed by 75 to 162 mg/day), a fibrinolytic agent and, when appropriate, \nheparin. The patients were followed for 30 days. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of the \ncomposite of an occluded infarct-related artery on the predischarge angiogram, or death or recurrent \nMI before coronary angiography. For patients who did not undergo angiography, the primary endpoint \nwas death or recurrent myocardial infarction by Day 8 or by hospital discharge. The patient population \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n\nincluded 19.7% women and 29.2% patients ≥65 years. A total of 99.7% of patients received \nfibrinolytics (fibrin specific: 68.7%, non- fibrin specific: 31.1%), 89.5% heparin, 78.7% beta blockers, \n54.7% ACE inhibitors and 63% statins. \n\n \nFifteen percent (15.0%) of patients in the clopidogrel group and 21.7% in the placebo group reached \nthe primary endpoint, representing an absolute reduction of 6.7% and a 36% odds reduction in favor of \nclopidogrel (95% CI: 24, 47%; p<0.001), mainly related to a reduction in occluded infarct-related \narteries. This benefit was consistent across all prespecified subgroups including patients’ age and \ngender, infarct location, and type of fibrinolytic or heparin used. \n\n \nThe 2x2 factorial design COMMIT trial included 45,852 patients presenting within 24 hours of the \nonset of the symptoms of suspected MI with supporting ECG abnormalities (i.e. ST elevation, ST \ndepression or left bundle-branch block). Patients received clopidogrel (75 mg/day, n=22,961) or \nplacebo (n=22,891), in combination with ASA (162 mg/day), for 28 days or until hospital discharge. \nThe co-primary endpoints were death from any cause and the first occurrence of re-infarction, stroke \nor death. The population included 27.8% women, 58.4% patients ≥60 years (26% ≥70 years) and \n54.5% patients who received fibrinolytics. \n\n \nClopidogrel significantly reduced the relative risk of death from any cause by 7% (p=0.029), and the \nrelative risk of the combination of re-infarction, stroke or death by 9% (p=0.002), representing an \nabsolute reduction of 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively. This benefit was consistent across age, gender and \nwith or without fibrinolytics, and was observed as early as 24 hours. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nAfter single and repeated oral doses of 75 mg per day, clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed. Mean peak \nplasma levels of unchanged clopidogrel (approximately 2.2-2.5 ng/ml after a single 75 mg oral dose) \noccurred approximately 45 minutes after dosing. Absorption is at least 50%, based on urinary \nexcretion of clopidogrel metabolites.  \n \nDistribution \nClopidogrel and the main circulating (inactive) metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma \nproteins (98% and 94% respectively). The binding is non-saturable in vitro over a wide concentration \nrange.  \n \nMetabolism \nClopidogrel is extensively metabolised by the liver. In vitro and in vivo, clopidogrel is metabolised \naccording to two main metabolic pathways: one mediated by esterases and leading to hydrolysis into \nits inactive carboxylic acid derivative (85% of circulating metabolites), and one mediated by multiple \ncytochromes P450. Clopidogrel is first metabolised to a 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite. \nSubsequent metabolism of the 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite results in formation of the \nactive metabolite, a thiol derivative of clopidogrel. In vitro, this metabolic pathway is mediated by \nCYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 and CYP2B6. The active thiol metabolite which has been isolated \nin vitro, binds rapidly and irreversibly to platelet receptors, thus inhibiting platelet aggregation. \n \nElimination \nFollowing an oral dose of 14C-labelled clopidogrel in man, approximately 50% was excreted in the \nurine and approximately 46% in the faeces in the 120-hour interval after dosing. After a single oral \ndose of 75 mg, clopidogrel has a half-life of approximately 6 hours. The elimination half-life of the \nmain circulating (inactive) metabolite was 8 hours after single and repeated administration. \n \nPharmacogenetics \nSeveral polymorphic CYP450 enzymes activate clopidogrel. CYP2C19 is involved in the formation of \nboth the active metabolite and the 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite. Clopidogrel active \nmetabolite pharmacokinetics and antiplatelet effects, as measured by ex vivo platelet aggregation \nassays, differ according to CYP2C19 genotype. The CYP2C19*1 allele corresponds to fully functional \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n12 \n\nmetabolism while the CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 alleles correspond to reduced metabolism. The \nCYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 alleles account for 85% of reduced function alleles in whites and 99% \nin Asians. Other alleles associated with reduced metabolism include CYP2C19*4, *5, *6, *7, and *8, \nbut these are less frequent in the general population. Published frequencies for the common CYP2C19 \nphenotypes and genotypes are listed in the table below.  \n \n\nCYP2C19 Phenotype and Genotype Frequency \n    Frequency (%) \n\n White (n=1356) Black (n=966) Chinese (n=573) \n\nExtensive metabolism: CYP2C19*1/*1  74  66  38  \n\nIntermediate metabolism: CYP2C19*1/*2 or *1/*3  26  29  50  \n\nPoor metabolism: CYP2C19*2/*2, *2/*3 or *3/*3  2  4  14  \n\n \nTo date, the impact of CYP2C19 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite of \nclopidogrel has been evaluated in 227 subjects from 7 reported studies. Reduced CYP2C19 \nmetabolism in intermediate and poor metabolisers decreased the Cmax and AUC of the active \nmetabolite by 30-50% following 300- or 600-mg loading doses and 75-mg maintenance doses. Lower \nactive metabolite exposure results in less platelet inhibition or higher residual platelet reactivity. To \ndate, diminished antiplatelet responses to clopidogrel have been described for intermediate and poor \nmetabolisers in 21 reported studies involving 4,520 subjects. The relative difference in antiplatelet \nresponse between genotype groups varies across studies depending on the method used to evaluate \nresponse, but is typically greater than 30%. \n \nThe association between CYP2C19 genotype and clopidogrel treatment outcome was evaluated in 2 \npost hoc clinical trial analyses (substudies of CLARITY [n=465] and TRITON-TIMI 38 [n=1,477]) \nand 5 cohort studies (total n=6,489). In CLARITY and one of the cohort studies (n=765; Trenk), \ncardiovascular event rates did not differ significantly by genotype. In TRITON-TIMI 38 and 3 of the \ncohort studies (n= 3,516; Collet, Sibbing, Giusti), patients with an impaired metaboliser status \n(intermediate and poor combined) had a higher rate of cardiovascular events (death, myocardial \ninfarction, and stroke) or stent thrombosis compared to extensive metabolisers. In the fifth cohort study \n(n=2,208; Simon), the increased event rate was observed only in poor metabolisers. \n \nPharmacogenetic testing can identify genotypes associated with variability in CYP2C19 activity. \n \nThere may be genetic variants of other CYP450 enzymes with effects on the ability to form the active \nmetabolite of clopidogrel. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite of clopidogrel is not known in these special \npopulations. \n \nRenal impairment  \nAfter repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day in subjects with severe renal disease (creatinine \nclearance from 5 to 15 ml/min) inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was lower (25%) than \nthat observed in healthy subjects, however, the prolongation of bleeding time was similar to that seen \nin healthy subjects receiving 75 mg of clopidogrel per day. In addition, clinical tolerance was good in \nall patients. \n \nHepatic impairment \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n13 \n\nAfter repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day for 10 days in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment, inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was similar to that observed in healthy \nsubjects. The mean bleeding time prolongation was also similar in the two groups. \n \nRace \nThe prevalence of CYP2C19 alleles that result in intermediate and poor CYP2C19 metabolism differs \naccording to race/ethnicity (see Pharmacogenetics). From literature, limited data in Asian populations \nare available to assess the clinical implication of genotyping of this CYP on clinical outcome events. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nDuring non clinical studies in rat and baboon, the most frequently observed effects were liver changes. \nThese occurred at doses representing at least 25 times the exposure seen in humans receiving the \nclinical dose of 75 mg/day and were a consequence of an effect on hepatic metabolising enzymes. No \neffect on hepatic metabolising enzymes was observed in humans receiving clopidogrel at the \ntherapeutic dose. \n \nAt very high doses, a poor gastric tolerability (gastritis, gastric erosions and/or vomiting) of \nclopidogrel was also reported in rat and baboon.  \n \nThere was no evidence of carcinogenic effect when clopidogrel was administered for 78 weeks to \nmice and 104 weeks to rats when given at doses up to 77 mg/kg per day (representing at least 25 times \nthe exposure seen in humans receiving the clinical dose of 75 mg/day). \n \nClopidogrel has been tested in a range of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies, and showed no \ngenotoxic activity.  \n \nClopidogrel was found to have no effect on the fertility of male and female rats and was not \nteratogenic in either rats or rabbits. When given to lactating rats, clopidogrel caused a slight delay in \nthe development of the offspring. Specific pharmacokinetic studies performed with radiolabelled \nclopidogrel have shown that the parent compound or its metabolites are excreted in the milk. \nConsequently, a direct effect (slight toxicity), or an indirect effect (low palatability) cannot be \nexcluded. \n \n \n6.

IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nClopidogrel Teva Generics B.V. belongs to a group of medicines called antiplatelet medicinal \nproducts. Platelets are very small structures in the blood, which clump together during blood clotting. \nBy preventing this clumping, antiplatelet medicinal products reduce the chances of blood clots \nforming (a process called thrombosis). \n \nClopidogrel Teva Generics B.V. is taken to prevent blood clots (thrombi) forming in hardened blood \nvessels (arteries), a process known as atherothrombosis, which can lead to atherothrombotic events \n(such as stroke, heart attack, or death). \n \nYou have been prescribed Clopidogrel Teva Generics B.V. to help prevent blood clots and reduce the \nrisk of these severe events because: \n- You have a condition of hardening of arteries (also known as atherosclerosis), and \n- You have previously experienced a heart attack, stroke or have a condition known as peripheral \n\narterial disease, or \n- You have experienced a severe type of chest pain known as ‘unstable angina’ or ‘myocardial \n\ninfarction’ (heart attack). For the treatment of this condition your doctor may have placed a stent \nin the blocked or narrowed artery to restore effective blood flow. You should also be given \nacetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain and lower fever \nas well as to prevent blood clotting) by your doctor. \n\n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE CLOPIDOGREL TEVA GENERICS B.V.  \n \nDo not take Clopidogrel Teva Generics B.V.  \n• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to clopidogrel or any of the other ingredients of Clopidogrel \n\nTeva Generics B.V. \n• if you have a medical condition that is currently causing bleeding such as a stomach ulcer or \n\nbleeding within the brain \n• if you suffer from severe liver disease. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n25 \n\nIf you think any of these apply to you, or if you are in any doubt at all, consult your doctor before \ntaking Clopidogrel Teva Generics B.V.. \n \nTake special care with Clopidogrel Teva Generics B.V.  \nIf any of the situations mentioned below apply to you, you should tell your doctor before taking \nClopidogrel Teva Generics B.V.: \n• if you have a risk of bleeding such as \n\n- a medical condition that puts you at risk of internal bleeding (such as a stomach ulcer) \n- a blood disorder that makes you prone to internal bleeding (bleeding inside any tissues, organs \n\nor joints of your body) \n- a recent serious injury \n- a recent surgery (including dental) \n- a planned surgery (including dental) in the next seven days \n\n• if you have had a clot in an artery of your brain (ischaemic stroke) which occurred within the \nlast seven days \n\n• if you have kidney or liver disease. \n \nWhile you are taking Clopidogrel Teva Generics B.V.: \n• You should tell your doctor if a surgery (including dental) is planned \n• You should also tell your doctor immediately if you develop a medical condition (also known as \n\nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura or TTP) that includes fever and bruising under the skin \nthat may appear as red pinpoint dots, with or without unexplained extreme tiredness, confusion, \nyellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice) (see section 4 ‘Possible side effects’) \n\n• If you cut or injure yourself, it may take longer than usual for bleeding to stop. This is linked to \nthe way your medicine works as it prevents the ability of blood clots to form. For minor cuts \nand injuries e.g., cutting yourself, shaving, this is usually of no concern. However, if you are \nconcerned by your bleeding, you should contact your doctor straightaway (see section 4 \n‘Possible side effects’) \n\n• Your doctor may order blood tests \n \nClopidogrel Teva Generics B.V. is not intended for use in children or adolescents. \n \nTaking other medicines \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \nSome other medicines may influence the use of Clopidogrel Teva Generics B.V. or vice versa. \n \nYou should specifically tell your doctor if you take \n- oral anticoagulants, medicines used to reduce blood clotting, \n- a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicine, usually used to treat painful and/or inflammatory \n\nconditions of muscle or joints, \n- heparin, or any other medicine used to reduce blood clotting. \n- a proton pump inhibitor (e.g, omeprazole) for upset stomach, \n- fluconazole, voriconazole, ciprofloxacin, or chloramphenicol, medicines to treat bacterial and \n\nfungal infections, \n- cimetidine, medicine to treat upset stomach, \n- fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, or moclobemide, medicines to treat depression, \n- carbamazepine, or oxcarbazepine, medicines to treat some forms of epilepsy, \n- ticlopidine, other antiplatelet agent. \n \nIf you have experienced severe chest pain (unstable angina or heart attack), you may be prescribed \nclopidogrel in combination with acetylsalicylic acid, a substance present in many medicines used to \nrelieve pain and lower fever. An occasional use of acetylsalicylic acid (no more than 1,000 mg in any \n24 hour period) should generally not cause a problem, but prolonged use in other circumstances should \nbe discussed with your doctor. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n26 \n\nTaking Clopidogrel Teva Generics B.V. with food and drink \nClopidogrel Teva Generics B.V. may be taken with or without food. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIt is preferable not to use this product during pregnancy and breast-feeding. \n \nIf you are pregnant or suspect that you are pregnant, you should tell your doctor or your pharmacist \nbefore taking Clopidogrel Teva Generics B.V..
