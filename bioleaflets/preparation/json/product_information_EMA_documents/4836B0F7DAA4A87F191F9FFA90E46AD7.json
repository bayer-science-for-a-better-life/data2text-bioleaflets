When considering OLYSIO combination treatment with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin \nin HCV genotype 1a patients, patients should be tested for the presence of virus with the NS3 Q80K \npolymorphism before starting treatment (see section 4.4).\nRefer also to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal products that are used in \ncombination with OLYSIO.\n\nThe recommended co-administered medicinal product(s) and treatment duration for OLYSIO\ncombination therapy are provided in tables 1 and 2.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3\n\nTable 1: Recommended treatment duration for OLYSIO combination therapy with \nsofosbuvir with or without ribavirin in patients with HCV genotype 1 or 4\n\nPatient population Treatment duration\nPatients without cirrhosis 12 weeks OLYSIO + sofosbuvir\nPatients with cirrhosis1 24 weeks OLYSIO + sofosbuvir\n\nor\n12 weeks OLYSIO + sofosbuvir + ribavirin2\n\n12 weeks OLYSIO + sofosbuvir (without ribavirin) may be considered \nfor patients deemed at low risk for clinical disease progression and \nwho have subsequent retreatment options (see sections 4.4 and 5.1)\n\n1\nIn HCV genotype 1a infected patients with cirrhosis, testing for the presence of the Q80K polymorphism may be \nconsidered prior to initiation of therapy with OLYSIO in combination with sofosbuvir (see section 4.4).\n\n2\nThe daily dose of ribavirin is weight based (< 75 kg = 1,000 mg and ≥ 75 kg = 1,200 mg) and administered orally in \ntwo divided doses with food; also refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of ribavirin.\n\nTable 2: Recommended treatment duration for OLYSIO combination therapy with \npeginterferon alfa and ribavirin1 in HCV genotype 1 or 4\n\nPatient population Treatment duration\nTreatment-naïve and prior relapse patients2\n\nwith or without cirrhosis, who are \nnot co-infected with HIV\n\n24 weeks3\n\nTreatment with OLYSIO must be initiated in combination \nwith peginterferon alfa + ribavirin and administered for \n12 weeks and then followed by an additional 12 weeks of \npeginterferon alfa + ribavirin.\n\nwithout cirrhosis, who are \nco-infected with HIV\n\nwith cirrhosis, who are \nco-infected with HIV\n\n48 weeks3\n\nTreatment with OLYSIO must be initiated in combination \nwith peginterferon alfa + ribavirin and administered for \n12 weeks and then followed by an additional 36 weeks of \npeginterferon alfa and + ribavirin.\n\nPrior non-responder patients (including partial and null responders)2\n\nwith or without cirrhosis, with or \nwithout HIV co-infection\n\n48 weeks3\n\nTreatment with OLYSIO must be initiated in combination \nwith peginterferon alfa + ribavirin and administered for \n12 weeks and then followed by an additional 36 weeks of \npeginterferon alfa + ribavirin.\n\n1\nWhen considering OLYSIO combination treatment with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin in HCV genotype 1a patients, \ntesting for NS3 Q80K polymorphism should be performed before starting treatment (see section 4.4).\n\n2\nFollowing prior treatment with interferon (pegylated or non-pegylated), with or without ribavirin (see section 5.1).\n\n3\nRecommended duration of treatment provided that patient does not meet a stopping rule (see table 3).\n\nRefer to table 3 for treatment stopping rules based on HCV RNA levels at weeks 4, 12 and 24 for\npatients receiving treatment with OLYSIO, peginterferon alfa and ribavirin.\n\nTreatment discontinuation in patients with inadequate on-treatment virologic response\nOLYSIO in combination with sofosbuvir\nThere are no virologic treatment stopping rules that apply to the combination of OLYSIO with \nsofosbuvir.\n\nOLYSIO in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavrin\nIt is unlikely that patients with inadequate on-treatment virologic response will achieve a sustained \nvirologic response (SVR), therefore discontinuation of treatment is recommended in these patients. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4\n\nThe HCV RNA thresholds that trigger discontinuation of treatment (i.e., treatment stopping rules) are \npresented in table 3.\n\nTable 3: Treatment stopping rules in patients receiving OLYSIO in combination with \npeginterferon alfa and ribavirin with inadequate on-treatment virologic response\n\nHCV RNA Action\nTreatment week 4: ≥ 25 IU/ml Discontinue OLYSIO, peginterferon alfa and ribavirin\nTreatment week 12: ≥ 25 IU/ml1 Discontinue peginterferon alfa and ribavirin (treatment with \n\nOLYSIO is complete at week 12)\nTreatment week 24: ≥ 25 IU/ml1 Discontinue peginterferon alfa and ribavirin\n1\n\nRe-evaluation of HCV RNA is recommended in case of HCV RNA ≥ 25 IU/ml after previous undetectable HCV RNA \nto confirm HCV RNA levels prior to discontinuing HCV treatment.\n\nDosage adjustment or interruption of OLYSIO treatment\nTo prevent treatment failure, the dose of OLYSIO must not be reduced or interrupted. If treatment \nwith OLYSIO is discontinued because of adverse reactions or inadequate on-treatment virologic\nresponse, OLYSIO treatment must not be reinitiated.\n\nDosage adjustment or interruption of medicinal products used in combination with OLYSIO for the \ntreatment of CHC\nIf adverse reactions, potentially related to the medicinal products that are used in combination with \nOLYSIO for the treatment of CHC, require dosage adjustment or interruption of the medicinal \nproduct(s), refer to the instructions outlined in the respective Summary of Product Characteristics for \nthese medicinal products.\nIf other medicinal products used in combination with OLYSIO for the treatment of CHC are \npermanently discontinued for any reason, OLYSIO must also be discontinued. When ribavirin is\nadded to the combination of OLYSIO and sofosbuvir, and ribavirin needs to be discontinued, \ntreatment of OLYSIO with sofosbuvir without ribavirin can be continued (see section 5.1).\n\nMissed dose\nIf a dose of OLYSIO is missed, and the patient notices within 12 hours of the usual dosing time, the \npatient should take the missed dose of OLYSIO with food as soon as possible and then take the next \ndose of OLYSIO at the regularly scheduled time.\n\nIf a dose of OLYSIO is missed by more than 12 hours after the usual dosing time, the patient should \nnot take the missed dose of OLYSIO and should resume dosing of OLYSIO with food at the regularly \nscheduled time.\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly (over 65 years of age)\nThere are limited data on the safety and efficacy of OLYSIO in patients older than 65 years. There are\nno safety and efficacy data of OLYSIO in patients over the age of 75 years. No dose adjustment of \nOLYSIO is required in elderly patients (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment of OLYSIO is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. \nIncreased simeprevir exposures have been observed in individuals with severe renal impairment.\nOLYSIO has not been studied in HCV infected patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance below 30 ml/min) or end stage renal disease, including patients requiring haemodialysis. As \nexposure may be increased in HCV infected patients with severe renal impairment, caution is \nrecommended when prescribing OLYSIO to these patients (see section 5.2).\nRefer to the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal products used in \ncombination with OLYSIO regarding their use in patients with renal impairment.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment of OLYSIO is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A).\nOLYSIO is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B \nor C) (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nRace\nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on race (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of OLYSIO in children aged below 18 years have not yet been established. No \ndata are available.\n\nHCV/Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) co-infection\nNo dose adjustment of OLYSIO is required in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients (see sections 4.8, 5.1 \nand 5.2).\n\nOLYSIO in combination with sofosbuvir: HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients should be treated for the \nsame duration as HCV mono-infected patients.\n\nOLYSIO in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin: HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients \nshould be treated for the same duration as HCV mono-infected patients, except for co-infected patients \nwith cirrhosis who should receive 36 weeks of treatment with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin after \ncompleting 12 weeks of treatment with OLYSIO, peginterferon alfa and ribavirin (total treatment \nduration of 48 weeks).\n\nPlease refer to sections 4.4 and 4.5 for relevant interactions with antiretroviral agents.\n\nMethod of administration\nOLYSIO must be taken orally once a day with food (see section 5.2). The capsule should be \nswallowed as a whole.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nGeneral\nThe efficacy of OLYSIO has not been studied in patients with HCV genotypes 2, 3, 5 or 6; therefore \nOLYSIO should not be used in these patients (see section 5.1).\n\nOLYSIO must not be administered as monotherapy and must be prescribed in combination with other \nmedicinal products for the treatment of CHC.\n\nConsult the Summary of Product Characteristics of the co-prescribed medicinal products before \nstarting therapy with OLYSIO. Warnings and precautions related to these medicinal products also \napply to their use in OLYSIO combination treatment.\n\nThere are no clinical data on the use of OLYSIO in re-treating patients who have failed an HCV \nNS3-4A protease inhibitor-based therapy (see sections 5.1 and 5.3).\n\nHepatic decompensation and hepatic failure\nHepatic decompensation and hepatic failure, including fatal cases, have been reported post-marketing \nin patients treated with OLYSIO in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin and in \ncombination with sofosbuvir. Although causality is difficult to establish due to background advanced \nliver disease, a potential risk cannot be excluded.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6\n\nTherefore, in patients who are at high risk for hepatic decompensation or hepatic failure, liver function \ntests should be monitored before and as clinically indicated during OLYSIO combination therapy.\n\nHepatic impairment\nOLYSIO is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B \nor C) (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2).\n\nSevere bradycardia and heart block\nCases of bradycardia have been observed when OLYSIO is used in combination with sofosbuvir and \nconcomitant amiodarone. The mechanism is not established.\nCases are potentially life threatening, therefore amiodarone should only be used in patients on \nOLYSIO combination treatment with sofosbuvir when other alternative antiarrhythmic treatments are \nnot tolerated or are contraindicated.\nShould concomitant use of amiodarone be considered necessary, it is recommended that patients are \nclosely monitored when initiating OLYSIO combination treatment with sofosbuvir. Patients who are \nidentified as being at high risk of bradyarrhythmia should be continuously monitored for 48 hours in \nan appropriate clinical setting.\nDue to the long elimination half-life of amiodarone, appropriate monitoring should also be carried out \nfor patients who have discontinued amiodarone within the past few months and are to be initiated on \nOLYSIO combination treatment with sofosbuvir.\nAll patients receiving OLYSIO combination treatment with sofosbuvir in combination with \namiodarone with or without other drugs that lower heart rate should also be warned of the symptoms \nof bradycardia and heart block and should be advised to seek medical advice urgently should they \nexperience them.\n\nPre-treatment testing for NS3 Q80K polymorphism in patients infected with HCV genotype 1a\nOLYSIO in combination with sofosbuvir\nIn HCV genotype 1a infected patients with cirrhosis, testing for the presence of the NS3 Q80K \npolymorphism may be considered prior to initiation of therapy with OLYSIO in combination with \nsofosbuvir (see section 5.1).\nIn HCV genotype 1a infected patients without cirrhosis, simeprevir efficacy in combination with \nsofosbuvir at the recommended 12-week treatment duration was not impacted by the presence of the \nNS3 Q80K polymorphism (see section 5.1).\n\nOLYSIO in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin\nSimeprevir efficacy in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin is substantially reduced in \npatients infected with hepatitis C genotype 1a with the NS3 Q80K polymorphism at baseline \ncompared to patients with hepatitis C genotype 1a without the Q80K polymorphism (see section 5.1). \nTesting for the presence of the Q80K polymorphism in patients with HCV genotype 1a is strongly \nrecommended when considering therapy with OLYSIO in combination with peginterferon alfa and \nribavirin. Alternative therapy should be considered for patients infected with HCV genotype 1a with \nthe Q80K polymorphism or in cases where testing is not accessible.\n\nCo-administration with other direct acting antivirals against HCV\nOLYSIO should only be co-administered with other direct acting antiviral medicinal products if the \nbenefits are considered to outweigh the risks based upon available data. There are no data to support \nthe co-administration of OLYSIO and telaprevir or boceprevir. These HCV protease inhibitors are \nanticipated to be cross-resistant, and co-administration is not recommended (see also section 4.5).\n\nOLYSIO in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b\nIn the clinical studies, patients randomised to simeprevir in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b \nand ribavirin obtained numerically lower SVR12 rates and also experienced viral breakthrough and \nviral relapse more frequently than those treated with simeprevir in combination with peginterferon \nalfa-2a and ribavirin (see section 5.1).\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7\n\nPregnancy and contraception\nOLYSIO should only be used during pregnancy or in women of childbearing potential if the benefit \njustifies the risk. Female patients of childbearing potential must use an effective form of contraception \n(see section 4.6).\n\nThe contraindications and warnings regarding pregnancy and contraception requirements applicable to \nthe co-administered medicinal products also apply to their use in OLYSIO combination treatment.\n\nRibavirin may cause birth defects and/or death of the exposed foetus. Therefore, extreme care must be \ntaken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and in female partners of male patients (see section 4.6).\n\nPhotosensitivity\nPhotosensitivity reactions have been observed with OLYSIO combination treatment (see section 4.8).\nPatients should be informed of the risk of photosensitivity reactions and on the importance of applying \nappropriate sun protective measures during treatment with OLYSIO. Excess exposure to sun and use \nof tanning devices during treatment with OLYSIO should be avoided. If photosensitivity reactions\noccur, discontinuation of OLYSIO should be considered and patients should be monitored until the \nreaction has resolved.\n\nRash\nRash has been observed with OLYSIO combination treatment (see section 4.8). Patients with mild to \nmoderate rashes should be monitored for possible progression of rash, including the development of \nmucosal signs or systemic symptoms. In case of severe rash, OLYSIO and other co-administered \nmedicinal products for the treatment of CHC should be discontinued and the patients should be \nmonitored until the symptoms have resolved.\n\nLaboratory testing during treatment with OLYSIO, peginterferon alfa and ribavirin\nHCV RNA levels should be monitored at weeks 4 and 12 and as clinically indicated (see also \nguidelines for treatment duration and stopping rules; section 4.2). Use of a sensitive quantitative \nHCV RNA assay for monitoring HCV RNA levels during treatment is recommended.\nRefer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for pre-treatment, \non-treatment and post-treatment laboratory testing requirements including haematology, biochemistry \n(including hepatic enzymes and bilirubin), and pregnancy testing requirements.\n\nInteractions with medicinal products\nCo-administration of OLYSIO with substances that moderately or strongly induce or inhibit \ncytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A4) is not recommended as this may lead to significantly lower or higher\nexposure of simeprevir, respectively.\nPlease refer to section 4.5 for information on interactions with medicinal products.\n\nHepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection\nCases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after \ntreatment with direct-acting antiviral agents. HBV screening should be performed in all patients before \ninitiation of treatment. HBV/HCV co-infected patients are at risk of HBV reactivation, and should \ntherefore be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines.\n\nOrgan transplant patients\nCo-administration of OLYSIO with ciclosporin is not recommended as this leads to significantly \nhigher exposure of simeprevir (see section 4.5).\n\nExcipient of OLYSIO capsules\nOLYSIO capsules contain lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicine.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nMedicinal products that affect simeprevir exposure\nThe primary enzyme involved in the biotransformation of simeprevir is CYP3A4 (see section 5.2) and \nclinically relevant effects of other medicinal products on simeprevir pharmacokinetics via CYP3A4\nmay occur. Co-administration of OLYSIO with moderate or strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may \nsignificantly increase the plasma exposure of simeprevir, while co-administration with moderate or \nstrong inducers of CYP3A4 may significantly reduce the plasma exposure of simeprevir and lead to \nloss of efficacy (see table 4). Therefore, co-administration of OLYSIO with substances that \nmoderately or strongly inhibit or induce CYP3A4 is not recommended.\nHepatic uptake of simeprevir is mediated by OATP1B1/3. Inhibitors of OATP1B1/3 such as \neltrombopag or gemfibrozil may result in increases in simeprevir plasma concentrations.\n\nMedicinal products that are affected by the use of simeprevir\nSimeprevir mildly inhibits the CYP1A2 activity and intestinal CYP3A4 activity, while it does not \naffect hepatic CYP3A4 activity. Co-administration of OLYSIO with medicinal products that are \nprimarily metabolised by CYP3A4 may result in increased plasma concentrations of such medicinal \nproducts (see table 4). Simeprevir does not affect CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP2D6 in vivo.\nSimeprevir inhibits OATP1B1/3, P-gp and BCRP transporters. Co-administration of OLYSIO with \nmedicinal products that are substrates for OATP1B1/3, P-gp and BCRP transport may result in \nincreased plasma concentrations of such medicinal products (see table 4).\n\nPatients treated with vitamin K antagonists\nAs liver function may change during treatment with OLYSIO, close monitoring of International \nNormalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended.\n\nInteraction table\nEstablished and theoretical interactions between simeprevir and selected medicinal products are listed \nin table 4 (least square mean ratios with 90% confidence intervals (90% CI) are presented, increase is \nindicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”). Interaction studies have been performed in \nhealthy adults with the recommended dose of 150 mg simeprevir once daily unless otherwise noted.\n\nTable 4: Interactions and dose recommendation with other medicinal products\n\nMedicinal products \nby therapeutic areas\n\nEffect on drug levels\nLeast Squares Mean Ratio (90%CI)\n\nRecommendation for \nco-administration\n\nANALEPTIC\nCaffeine\n150 mg\n\ncaffeine AUC 1.26 (1.21-1.32) ↑\ncaffeine Cmax 1.12 (1.06-1.19) ↔\ncaffeine Cmin not studied\n\nNo dose adjustment is \nrequired.\n\nANTIARRHYTHMICS\nDigoxin\n0.25 mg\n\ndigoxin AUC 1.39 (1.16-1.67) ↑\ndigoxin Cmax 1.31 (1.14-1.51) ↑\ndigoxin Cmin not studied\n\n(inhibition of P-gp transporter)\n\nConcentrations of digoxin \nshould be monitored and \nused for titration of \ndigoxin dose to obtain the \ndesired clinical effect.\n\nAmiodarone Not studied.

Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive effects (see section 5.3). OLYSIO should only be used during\npregnancy or in women of childbearing potential if the benefit justifies the risk. Female patients of \nchildbearing potential must use an effective form of contraception.\n\nBecause OLYSIO must be co-administered with other medicinal products, for the treatment of CHC, \nthe contraindications and warnings applicable to those medicinal products also apply to their use in \ncombination treatment with OLYSIO (see section 4.3).\n\nSignificant teratogenic and/or embryocidal effects have been demonstrated in all animal species \nexposed to ribavirin. Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and in female \npartners of male patients. Female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with female \npartners of childbearing potential must use an effective form of contraception during treatment with \nribavirin and after completion of ribavirin treatment for a duration as specified in the Summary of \nProduct Characteristics for ribavirin.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is not known whether simeprevir or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. When administered \nto lactating rats, simeprevir was detected in plasma of suckling rats likely due to excretion of \nsimeprevir via milk (see section 5.3). A risk to the newborn/infant cannot be excluded. A decision \nmust be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from OLYSIO therapy,\ntaking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the mother.\n\nFertility\nThere are no data on the effect of simeprevir on human fertility. No effects on fertility were observed \nin animal studies (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nOLYSIO has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Combination \ntreatment of OLYSIO with other medicinal products for the treatment of CHC may affect a patient’s \nability to drive and use machines. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for these \nco-administered medicinal products regarding their potential effect on the ability to drive and use \nmachines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe overall safety profile of simeprevir is based on data from 580 HCV genotype 1 infected patients \nwho received simeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin (pooled data from \nthe clinical phase 2 study HPC2002 and the clinical phase 3 studies HPC3017 and HPC3018) and\n1,486 HCV genotype 1 infected patients who received simeprevir (or placebo) in combination with \npeginterferon alfa and ribavirin (pooled data from the clinical phase 2 studies C205 and C206 and the \nclinical phase 3 studies C208, C216 and HPC3007).\n\nThe safety profile of simeprevir is comparable in patients with HCV genotype 4 infection and HCV \ngenotype 1 infection, when given either in combination with sofosbuvir or in combination with \npeginterferon alfa and ribavirin.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n18\n\nSimeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir\nThe safety profile of simeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir in patients with HCV genotype 1 \ninfection with or without cirrhosis is based on pooled data from the phase 2 study HPC2002 and the \nphase 3 studies HPC3017 and HPC3018 which included 472 patients who received simeprevir with \nsofosbuvir without ribavirin (155, 286 and 31 patients received 8, 12 or 24 weeks of treatment, \nrespectively) and 108 patients who received simeprevir with sofosbuvir and ribavirin (54 patients each \nreceived 12 or 24 weeks of treatment).\n\nThe majority of the adverse reactions reported were grade 1 in severity. Grade 2 and 3 adverse \nreactions were reported in 3.5% (n = 10) and 0.3% (n = 1) of patients, respectively, receiving 12 weeks \nsimeprevir with sofosbuvir; no grade 4 adverse reactions were reported. In patients receiving 24 weeks \nsimeprevir with sofosbuvir, no grade 2 or 3 adverse reactions were reported; one patient (3.2%) \nexperienced a grade 4 adverse reaction (‘blood bilirubin increased’). No serious adverse reactions \nwere reported.\n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 5% following 12 or 24 weeks of \ntreatment) were rash, pruritus, constipation and photosensitivity reaction (see section 4.4).\n\nOne patient in the 12-week treatment group (0.3%) and none of the patients in the 24-week treatment \ngroup discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions.\n\nSimeprevir in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin\nThe safety profile of simeprevir in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin in patients with \nHCV genotype 1 infection is based on the pooled data from the phase 2 studies and phase 3 \nstudies C205, C206, C208, C216 and HPC3007 which included 924 patients who received simeprevir \n150 mg once daily for 12 weeks and 540 patients who received placebo with peginterferon alfa and \nribavirin.\n\nIn the pooled phase 3 safety data, the majority of the adverse reactions reported during 12 weeks \ntreatment with simeprevir were grade 1 to 2 in severity. Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were reported \nin 3.1% of patients receiving simeprevir with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin versus 0.5% of patients \nreceiving placebo with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. Serious adverse reactions were reported in \n0.3% of simeprevir-treated patients (2 photosensitivity events requiring hospitalisation) and in none of \nthe patients receiving placebo with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin.\n\nDuring the first 12 weeks of treatment, the most frequently reported adverse reactions (incidence \n≥ 5%) were nausea, rash, pruritus, dyspnoea, blood bilirubin increase and photosensitivity reaction \n(see section 4.4).\n\nDiscontinuation of simeprevir due to adverse reactions occurred in 0.9% of patients receiving \nsimeprevir with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions of simeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir or in combination with peginterferon \nalfa and ribavirin reported in adult patients with HCV genotype 1 infection are listed in table 5. The \nadverse reactions are listed by system organ class (SOC) and frequency: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000).Me\n\ndic\nina\n\nl p\nrod\n\nuc\nt n\n\no l\non\n\nge\nr a\n\nuth\nori\n\nse\nd\n\n\n\n19\n\nTable 5: Adverse reactions identified with simeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir or \nsimeprevir in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin1\n\nSOC\nFrequency \nCategory\n\nsimeprevir + sofosbuvir simeprevir + \npeginterferon alfa + \n\nribavirin\nN = 781\n\n12 weeks\nN = 286\n\n24 weeks\nN = 31\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders:\nvery common dyspnoea*\nGastrointestinal disorders:\nvery common nausea\ncommon constipation constipation constipation\nHepatobiliary disorders:\ncommon blood bilirubin increased* blood bilirubin increased* blood bilirubin increased*\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:\nvery common rash* rash*, pruritus*\ncommon rash*, pruritus*, \n\nphotosensitivity reaction*\npruritus*, photosensitivity \nreaction*\n\nphotosensitivity reaction*\n\n1\nSimeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir: pooled studies HPC2002, HPC3017 and HPC3018 (12 weeks) or\nstudy HPC2002 (24 weeks); simeprevir in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin: pooled phase 3 \nstudies C208, C216 and HPC3007 (first 12 weeks of treatments).\n\n* see section below for further details.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nRash and pruritus\nMost of the rash and pruritus events in simeprevir-treated patients were of mild or moderate severity \n(grade 1 or 2).\n\nSimeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir: Rash and pruritus were reported in 8.0% and 8.4%, \nrespectively, of patients receiving 12 weeks of treatment compared to 12.9% and 3.2%, respectively,\nof patients receiving 24 weeks of treatment (all grades).

A trend for a higher incidence of increased bilirubin levels with increasing simeprevir \nplasma exposure was observed. These increases in bilirubin levels were not associated with any \nadverse liver safety finding. However, reports of hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure during \nOLYSIO combination therapy have been received in the post marketing setting (see section 4.4).\nA higher incidence of anaemia in patients with advanced fibrosis receiving simeprevir in combination \nwith peginterferon alfa and ribavirin has been reported.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nHuman experience of overdose with simeprevir is limited. In healthy adult subjects receiving single \ndoses up to 600 mg or once daily doses up to 400 mg for 5 days, and in HCV infected adult patients \nreceiving 200 mg once daily for 4 weeks, adverse reactions were consistent with those observed in \nclinical studies at the recommended dose (see section 4.8).\n\nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with OLYSIO. In the event of an overdose with OLYSIO, it \nis recommended to employ the usual supportive measures and observe the patient’s clinical status.\n\nSimeprevir is highly protein bound, therefore dialysis is unlikely to result in significant removal of \nsimeprevir (see section 5.2).\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, direct acting antivirals, ATC code: J05AE14.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n23\n\nMechanism of action\nSimeprevir is a specific inhibitor of the HCV NS3/4A serine protease, which is essential for viral \nreplication. In a biochemical assay, simeprevir inhibited the proteolytic activity of recombinant \ngenotype 1a and 1b HCV NS3/4A proteases, with median Ki values of 0.5 nM and 1.4 nM, \nrespectively.\n\nAntiviral activity in vitro\nThe median simeprevir EC50 and EC90 values against a HCV genotype 1b replicon were 9.4 nM \n(7.05 ng/ml) and 19 nM (14.25 ng/ml), respectively. Chimeric replicons carrying NS3 sequences \nderived from HCV PI treatment-naïve genotype 1a and genotype 1b patients displayed median fold \nchange (FC) in simeprevir EC50 values of 1.4 (N = 78) and 0.4 (N = 59) compared to reference \ngenotype 1b replicon, respectively. Genotype 1a and 1b isolates with a baseline Q80K polymorphism \nresulted in median FC in simeprevir EC50 of 11 (N = 33) and 8.4 (N = 2), respectively. Median \nsimeprevir FC values against genotype 2 and genotype 3 baseline isolates tested were 25 (N = 4) and \n1,014 (N = 2), respectively. Median simeprevir FC values against baseline isolates of genotype 4a, \ngenotype 4d and genotype 4other were 0.5 (N = 38), 0.4 (N = 24), and 0.8 (N = 29), respectively. The \npresence of 50% human serum reduced simeprevir replicon activity by 2.4-fold. In vitro combination \nof simeprevir with interferon, ribavirin, NS5A or NS5B inhibitors resulted in additive or synergistic \neffects.\n\nAntiviral activity in vivo\nShort term monotherapy data of simeprevir from studies C201 (genotype 1) and C202 (genotype 2, 3, \n4, 5 and 6) in patients receiving 200 mg once daily simeprevir for 7 days is presented in table 9.\n\nTable 9: Antiviral activity of simeprevir 200 mg monotherapy (studies C201 and C202)\n\nGenotype Mean (SE) change in HCV RNA at day 7/8\n(log10 IU/mL)\n\nGenotype 1 (N = 9) -4.18 (0.158)\nGenotype 2 (N = 6) -2.73 (0.71)\nGenotype 3 (N = 8) -0.04 (0.23)\nGenotype 4 (N = 8) -3.52 (0.43)\nGenotype 5 (N = 7) -2.19 (0.39)\nGenotype 6 (N = 8) -4.35 (0.29)\n\nResistance\nResistance in cell culture\nResistance to simeprevir was characterised in HCV genotype 1a and 1b replicon-containing cells. \nNinety-six percent of simeprevir-selected genotype 1 replicons carried one or multiple amino acid \nsubstitutions at NS3 protease positions 43, 80, 155, 156, and/or 168, with substitutions at NS3 position \nD168 being most frequently observed (78%). Additionally, resistance to simeprevir was evaluated in \nHCV genotype 1a and 1b replicon assays using site-directed mutants and chimeric replicons carrying \nNS3 sequences derived from clinical isolates. Amino acid substitutions at NS3 positions 43, 80, 122, \n155, 156, and 168 reduced in vitro simeprevir activity. Substitutions such as D168V or A, and R155K \nwere usually associated with large reductions in susceptibility to simeprevir in vitro (FC in EC50 > 50), \nwhereas other substitutions such as Q80K or R, S122R, and D168E displayed in vitro low level \nresistance (FC in EC50 between 2 and 50). Other substitutions such as Q80G or L, S122G, N or T did \nnot reduce simeprevir activity (FC in EC50 ≤ 2). Amino acid substitutions at NS3 positions 80, 122, \n155, and/or 168, associated with in vitro low level resistance to simeprevir when occurring alone, \nreduced simeprevir activity by more than 50-fold when present in combination.\n\nResistance in clinical studies\nIn a pooled analysis of patients treated with 150 mg simeprevir in combination with peginterferon alfa \nand ribavirin who did not achieve SVR in the controlled phase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies (studies \nC205, C206, C208, C216, HPC3007), emerging amino acid substitutions at NS3 positions 80, 122, \n155 and/or 168 were observed in 180 out of 197 (91%) patients. Substitutions D168V and R155K \nalone or in combinations with other mutations at these positions emerged most frequently (table 10). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n24\n\nMost of these emerging substitutions have been shown to reduce simeprevir anti-HCV activity in cell \nculture replicon assays.\n\nHCV genotype 1 subtype-specific patterns of simeprevir treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions \nwere observed in patients not achieving SVR. Patients with HCV genotype 1a predominantly had \nemerging R155K alone or in combination with amino acid substitutions at NS3 positions 80, 122 \nand/or 168, while patients with HCV genotype 1b had most often an emerging D168V substitution \n(table 10). In patients with HCV genotype 1a with a baseline Q80K amino acid substitution an \nemerging R155K substitution was observed most frequently at failure.\n\nTable 10: Treatment-emergent amino-acid substitutions in pooled phase 2 and phase 3 \nstudies: patients who did not achieve SVR with 150 mg simeprevir in combination \nwith peginterferon alfa and ribavirin\n\nEmerging amino-acid\nsubstitutions in NS3\n\nAll HCV genotypes\nN = 197\n% (n)\n\nGenotype 1a1\n\nN = 116\n% (n)\n\nGenotype 1b\nN = 81\n% (n)\n\nAny substitution at NS3 position \n43, 80, 122, 155, 156, or 1682\n\n91.4% (180) 94.8% (110) 86.4% (70)\n\nD168E 15.7% (31) 14.7% (17) 17.3% (14)\nD168V 31.0% (61) 10.3% (12) 60.5% (49)\nQ80R3 7.6% (15) 4.3% (5) 12.3% (10)\nR155K 45.2% (89) 76.7% (89) 0% (0)\nQ80X+D168X4 8.1% (16) 4.3% (5) 13.6% (11)\nR155X+ D168X4 9.1% (18) 12.9% (15) 3.7% (3)\nQ80K3, S122A/G/I/T3, S122R, \nR155Q3, D168A, D168F3, D168H, \nD168T, I170T5\n\nLess than 10% Less than 10% Less than 10%\n\n1\nMay include few patients with HCV non-genotype 1a/1b.\n\n2\nAlone or in combination with other substitutions (includes mixtures).\n\n3\nSubstitutions only observed in combinations with other emerging substitutions at one or more of the NS3 positions 80, \n122, 155 and/or 168.\n\n4\nPatients with these combinations are also included in other rows describing the individual substitutions.

The emerging NS3 amino acid substitutions were similar \nto those observed in patients who did not achieve SVR following treatment with simeprevir in \ncombination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. No emerging NS5B amino acid substitutions\nassociated with sofosbuvir resistance were observed in patients who did not achieve SVR following \ntreatment of simeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir (with or without ribavirin) for 12 or 24 weeks.\n\nPersistence of resistance–associated substitutions\nThe persistence of simeprevir-resistant NS3 amino acid substitutions was assessed following treatment \nfailure.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n25\n\nIn the pooled analysis of patients receiving 150 mg simeprevir in combination with peginterferon alfa \nand ribavirin in the controlled phase 2 and phase 3 studies, treatment-emergent simeprevir-resistance \nvariants were no longer detectable in 90 out of 180 patients (50%) at the end of the studies after a \nmedian follow-up of 28 weeks (range 0-70 weeks). In 32 out of 48 patients (67%) with emerging \nsingle D168V and in 34 out of 66 (52%) patients with emerging single R155K, the respective \nemerging variants were no longer detected at end of the studies.\n\nData from a 3-year follow-up study in patients who did not achieve SVR with simeprevir in \ncombination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin in a previous phase 2 or phase 3 study showed that \nin 86% (37/43) of these patients the emerging mutations at time of failure in the previous study were \nno longer detected after a median follow-up of 180 weeks (range 47-230 weeks) (study HPC3002).\n\nThe long-term clinical impact of the emergence or persistence of simeprevir-resistance-associated \nsubstitutions is unknown.\n\nEffect of baseline HCV polymorphisms on treatment response\nAnalyses were conducted to explore the association between naturally-occurring baseline NS3/4A \namino acid substitutions (polymorphisms) and treatment outcome.\n\nBaseline polymorphisms at NS3 positions 43, 80, 122, 155, 156, and/or 168, associated with reduced \nsimeprevir activity in vitro were generally uncommon (1.3%) in patients with HCV genotype 1\ninfection (n = 2,007; pooled phase 2 and phase 3 studies with simeprevir in combination with \npeginterferon alfa and ribavirin), with exception of the substitution Q80K in HCV genotype 1a \npatients which was seen in 30% of patients with HCV genotype 1a and in 0.5% of patients with HCV \ngenotype 1b. In Europe, the prevalence was lower, 19% (73/377) in patients with HCV genotype 1a \nand 0.3% (3/877) in genotype 1b.\n\nThe Q80K polymorphism was not observed in patients with genotype 4 infection.\n\nThe presence of Q80K at baseline was associated with lower SVR rates in HCV genotype 1a patients \ntreated with simeprevir in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin (tables 19, 21, 22).\n\nCross-resistance\nSome of the treatment-emergent NS3 amino acid substitutions detected in simeprevir-treated patients \nwho did not achieve SVR in clinical studies (e.g., R155K) have been shown to reduce anti-HCV \nactivity of telaprevir, boceprevir, and other NS3/4A PIs. The impact of prior exposure to simeprevir in \npatients not achieving SVR on the efficacy of subsequent HCV NS3/4A PI-based treatment regimens \nhas not been established. There are no clinical data on the efficacy of simeprevir in patients with a \nhistory of exposure to the NS3/4A PIs telaprevir or boceprevir.\n\nCross-resistance is not expected between direct-acting antiviral agents with different mechanisms of \naction. Simeprevir-resistant variants studied remained susceptible to representative HCV nucleoside \nand non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors, and NS5A inhibitors.

No meaningful changes in QTc interval were \nobserved with either the recommended dose of 150 mg once daily or the supratherapeutic dose of \n350 mg once daily.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nsimeprevir in one or more subsets of the paediatric population from 3 years to less than 18 years of age \nin the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis C (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n35\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of simeprevir have been evaluated in healthy adult subjects and in \nadult HCV infected patients. Plasma exposure of simeprevir (AUC) in HCV infected patients was \nabout 2- to 3-fold higher compared to that observed in healthy subjects. Plasma Cmax and AUC of \nsimeprevir were similar during co-administration of simeprevir with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin \ncompared with administration of simeprevir alone.\n\nAbsorption\nThe mean absolute bioavailability of simeprevir following a single oral 150 mg dose of simeprevir in \nfed conditions is 62%. Maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) are typically achieved between 4 to \n6 hours post dose.\n\nIn vitro experiments with human Caco-2 cells indicated that simeprevir is a substrate of P-gp.\n\nEffect of food on absorption\nCompared to intake without food, administration of simeprevir with food to healthy subjects increased \nthe AUC by 61% after a high-fat, high-caloric (928 kcal) and 69% after a normal caloric (533 kcal) \nbreakfast, and delayed the absorption by 1 hour and 1.5 hours, respectively.\n\nSimeprevir must be taken with food (see section 4.2). The type of food does not affect exposure to \nsimeprevir.\n\nDistribution\nSimeprevir is extensively bound to plasma proteins ( 99.9%), primarily to albumin and, to a lesser \nextent, alfa-1-acid glycoprotein. Plasma protein binding is not meaningfully altered in patients with \nrenal or hepatic impairment.\n\nBiotransformation\nSimeprevir is metabolised in the liver. In vitro experiments with human liver microsomes indicated \nthat simeprevir primarily undergoes oxidative metabolism by the hepatic CYP3A4 system.\nInvolvement of CYP2C8 and CYP2C19 cannot be excluded. Moderate or strong inhibitors of \nCYP3A4 significantly increase the plasma exposure of simeprevir, and moderate or strong inducers of \nCYP3A4 significantly reduce plasma exposure of simeprevir. Simeprevir does not induce CYP1A2 or\nCYP3A4 in vitro. Simeprevir is not a clinically relevant inhibitor of cathepsin A enzyme activity.\n\nIn vitro experiments show that simeprevir is a substrate for the drug transporters P-glycoprotein \n(P-gp), MRP2, OATP1B1/3 and OATP2B1. Simeprevir inhibits the uptake transporters OATP1B1/3\nand NTCP and the efflux transporters P-gp/MDR1, MRP2, BCRP and BSEP. OATP1B1/3 and MRP2 \nare involved in the transport of bilirubin into and out of hepatocytes. Simeprevir does not inhibit \nOCT2 in vitro.\n\nFollowing a single oral administration of 200 mg 14C-simeprevir to healthy subjects, the majority of \nthe radioactivity in plasma (up to 98%) was accounted for by unchanged drug and a small part of the \nradioactivity in plasma was related to metabolites (none being major metabolites). Metabolites \nidentified in faeces were formed via oxidation at the macrocyclic moiety or aromatic moiety or both \nand by O-demethylation followed by oxidation.\n\nElimination\nElimination of simeprevir occurs via biliary excretion. Renal clearance plays an insignificant role in its \nelimination. Following a single oral administration of 200 mg 14C-simeprevir to healthy subjects, on \naverage 91% of the total radioactivity was recovered in faeces. Less than 1% of the administered dose \nwas recovered in urine. Unchanged simeprevir in faeces accounted for on average 31% of the \nadministered dose.\n\nThe terminal elimination half-life of simeprevir was 10 to 13 hours in healthy subjects and 41 hours in \nHCV infected patients receiving 200 mg simeprevir.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n36\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\nPlasma Cmax and the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) increased more than dose \nproportional after multiple doses between 75 mg and 200 mg once daily, with accumulation occurring \nfollowing repeated dosing. Steady-state was reached after 7 days of once daily dosing.\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly (above 65 years of age)\nThere is limited data on the use of simeprevir in patients older than 65 years. Age (18-73 years) had no \nclinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of simeprevir based on a population \npharmacokinetic analysis (n = 21, age above 65 years) of HCV infected patients treated with \nsimeprevir. No dose adjustment of simeprevir is required in elderly patients (see section 4.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nRenal elimination of simeprevir is negligible. Therefore, it is not expected that renal impairment will \nhave a clinically relevant effect on the exposure to simeprevir.\n\nCompared to healthy subjects with normal renal function (classified using the Modification of Diet in \nRenal Disease [MDRD] eGFR formula; eGFR ≥ 80 ml/min), the mean steady-state AUC of simeprevir \nwas 1.62-fold higher (90% confidence interval: 0.73-3.6) in subjects with severe renal impairment \n(eGFR below 30 ml/min). As exposure may be increased in HCV infected patients with severe renal \nimpairment, caution is recommended when prescribing simeprevir to these patients (see section 4.2).\n\nAs simeprevir is highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by \ndialysis.\n\nRefer to the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal products used in \ncombination with simeprevir regarding their use in patients with renal impairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\nSimeprevir is primarily metabolised by the liver.\nPlasma exposure of simeprevir in HCV infected patients was about 2- to 3-fold higher compared to \nthat observed in healthy subjects.\n\nCompared to healthy subjects with normal hepatic function, the mean steady-state AUC of simeprevir \nwas 2.4-fold higher in non-HCV infected subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) \nand 5.2-fold higher in non-HCV infected subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).\n\nNo dose adjustment of simeprevir is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment. The safety \nand efficacy of simeprevir have not been established in HCV infected patients with moderate or severe \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C). OLYSIO is not recommended in patients with moderate or \nsevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nRefer to the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal products used in \ncombination with simeprevir regarding their use in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\nGender\nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Gender had no clinically relevant effect on the \npharmacokinetics of simeprevir based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of HCV infected \npatients treated with simeprevir in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin.\n\nBody weight\nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on body weight or body mass index. These characteristics have \nno clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of simeprevir based on a population \npharmacokinetic analysis of HCV infected patients treated with simeprevir in combination with \npeginterferon alfa and ribavirin.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n37\n\nRace\nPopulation pharmacokinetic estimates of exposure of simeprevir were comparable between Caucasian \nand Black/African American HCV infected patients treated with simeprevir in combination with \npeginterferon alfa and ribavirin.\n\nIn a phase 3 study conducted in China and South-Korea, the mean plasma exposure of simeprevir in \nAsian HCV infected patients was 2.1-fold higher compared to non-Asian HCV infected patients in a \npooled phase 3 population from global studies.\n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on race.\n\nPatients co-infected with HIV-1\nPharmacokinetic parameters of simeprevir were comparable between patients with HCV genotype 1\ninfection with or without HIV-1 co-infection.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe pharmacokinetics of simeprevir in children aged below 18 years have not been investigated.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nIn rodents, simeprevir elicited toxic effects in the liver, pancreas and gastrointestinal systems. Dosing \nof animals resulted in similar (dogs) or lower (rats) exposures than those observed in humans at the \nrecommended dose of 150 mg once daily. In dogs, simeprevir was associated with a reversible \nmultifocal hepatocellular necrosis with associated increases in ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase and/or \nbilirubin. This effect was observed at higher systemic exposures (11-fold) than those in humans at the \nrecommended dose of 150 mg once daily.\n\nSimeprevir in vitro was very mildly irritating to the eyes. In vitro, simeprevir induced a phototoxic \nresponse on BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts after UVA exposure, in the absence and presence of protein \nsupplements. Simeprevir was not irritating to rabbit skin, and is not likely to cause skin sensitisation.\n\nThere were no adverse effects of simeprevir on vital functions (cardiac, respiratory and central \nnervous system) in animal studies.\n\nCarcinogenicity and mutagenicity\nSimeprevir was not genotoxic in a series of in vitro and in vivo tests. Carcinogenicity studies with \nsimeprevir have not been conducted.\n\nReproductive toxicology\nStudies carried out in rats did not reveal significant findings on fertility, embryo-fetal development or \npre- and post-natal development at any of the tested doses (corresponding to a systemic exposure in \nrats similar or lower than that observed in humans at the recommended dose of 150 mg once daily). \nSupernumerary ribs and delayed ossification were reported in mice at 4-fold higher exposures than \nthose observed in humans at the recommended dose of 150 mg once daily.\n\nIn pregnant rats, simeprevir concentrations in placenta, fetal liver and foetus were lower compared to \nthose observed in blood. When administered to lactating rats, simeprevir was detected in plasma of \nsuckling rats likely due to excretion of simeprevir via milk.\n\nEnvironmental Risk Assessment (ERA)\nSimeprevir is classified as a PBT (persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic) substance (see section 6.6).\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n38\n\n6.
