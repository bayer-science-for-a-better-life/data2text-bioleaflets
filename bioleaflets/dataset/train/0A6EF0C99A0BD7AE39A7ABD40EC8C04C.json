CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBevacizumab in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is indicated for treatment of \nadult patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum. \n \nBevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients with \nmetastatic breast cancer. For further information as to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 \n(HER2) status, please refer to section 5.1. \n \nBevacizumab in combination with capecitabine is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients \nwith metastatic breast cancer in whom treatment with other chemotherapy options including taxanes or \nanthracyclines is not considered appropriate. Patients who have received taxane and anthracycline-\ncontaining regimens in the adjuvant setting within the last 12 months should be excluded from \ntreatment with Avastin in combination with capecitabine. For further information as to HER2 status, \nplease refer to section 5.1.  \n \nBevacizumab, in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy, is indicated for first-line treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer other than \npredominantly squamous cell histology. \n \nBevacizumab, in combination with erlotinib, is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with \nEpidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) activating mutations (see Section 5.1).  \n \nBevacizumab in combination with interferon alfa-2a is indicated for first line treatment of adult \npatients with advanced and/or metastatic renal cell cancer. \n \nBevacizumab, in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel is indicated for the front-line treatment \nof adult patients with advanced (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages \nIII B, III C and IV) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. (See section 5.1). \n\n\n\n3 \n\nBevacizumab, in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine or in combination with carboplatin \nand paclitaxel, is indicated for treatment of adult patients with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive \nepithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have not received prior therapy \nwith bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor\u2013targeted agents. \n \nBevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel, topotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is \nindicated for the treatment of adult patients with platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian, \nfallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who received no more than two prior chemotherapy \nregimens and who have not received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or \nVEGF receptor\u2013targeted agents (see Section 5.1). \n \nBevacizumab, in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or, alternatively, paclitaxel and topotecan \nin patients who cannot receive platinum therapy, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with \npersistent, recurrent, or metastatic carcinoma of the cervix (see Section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nAvastin must be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of \nantineoplastic medicinal products. \n \nPosology  \n \nMetastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum (mCRC) \n \nThe recommended dose of Avastin, administered as an intravenous infusion, is either 5 mg/kg or \n10 mg/kg of body weight given once every 2 weeks or 7.5 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg of body weight given \nonce every 3 weeks. \nIt is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the underlying disease or until \nunacceptable toxicity. \n \nMetastatic breast cancer (mBC) \n \nThe recommended dose of Avastin is 10 mg/kg of body weight given once every 2 weeks or 15 mg/kg \nof body weight given once every 3 weeks as an intravenous infusion. \nIt is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the underlying disease or until \nunacceptable toxicity. \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) \n \nFirst-line treatment of non-squamous NSCLC in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy \n \nAvastin is administered in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy for up to 6 cycles of treatment \nfollowed by Avastin as a single agent until disease progression. \nThe recommended dose of Avastin is 7.5 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg of body weight given once every 3 \nweeks as an intravenous infusion. \nClinical benefit in NSCLC patients has been demonstrated with both 7.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg doses \n(see section 5.1).  \nIt is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the underlying disease or until \nunacceptable toxicity. \n \nFirst-line treatment of non-squamous NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations in combination with \nerlotinib \n \nEGFR mutation testing should be performed prior to initiation of treatment with the combination of \nAvastin and erlotinib. It is important that a well-validated and robust methodology is chosen to avoid \nfalse negative or false positive determinations. \n\n\n\n4 \n\nThe recommended dose of Avastin when used in addition to erlotinib is 15 mg/kg of body weight \ngiven once every 3 weeks as an intravenous infusion. \n \nIt is recommended that the treatment with Avastin in addition to erlotinib is continued until disease \nprogression. \n \nFor the posology and method of administration of erlotinib, please refer to the full erlotinib prescribing \ninformation.  \n \nAdvanced and/or metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC)  \n \nThe recommended dose of Avastin is 10 mg/kg of body weight given once every 2 weeks as an \nintravenous infusion.  \nIt is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the underlying disease or until \nunacceptable toxicity. \n \nEpithelial ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer \n \nFront-line treatment: Avastin is administered in addition to carboplatin and paclitaxel for up to 6 \ncycles of treatment followed by continued use of Avastin as single agent until disease progression or \nfor a maximum of 15 months or until unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs earlier. \nThe recommended dose of Avastin is 15 mg/kg of body weight given once every 3 weeks as an \nintravenous infusion. \n \nTreatment of platinum-sensitive recurrent disease: Avastin is administered in combination with either \ncarboplatin and gemcitabine for 6 cycles and up to 10 cycles or in combination with carboplatin and \npaclitaxel for 6 cycles and up to 8 cycles, followed by continued use of Avastin as single agent until \ndisease progression.The recommended dose of Avastin is 15 mg/kg of body weight given once every 3 \nweeks as an intravenous infusion. \n \nTreatment of platinum-resistant recurrent disease: Avastin is administered in combination with one of \nthe following agents \u2013 paclitaxel, topotecan (given weekly) or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. The \nrecommended dose of Avastin is 10 mg/kg of body weight given once every 2 weeks as an \nintravenous infusion. When Avastin is administered in combination with topotecan (given on days 1-5, \nevery 3 weeks), the recommended dose of Avastin is 15 mg/kg of body weight given once every 3 \nweeks as an intravenous infusion. It is recommended that treatment be continued until disease \nprogression or unacceptable toxicity (see section 5.1, study MO22224). \n \nCervical Cancer \n \nAvastin is administered in combination with one of the following chemotherapy regimens: paclitaxel \nand cisplatin or paclitaxel and topotecan.  \n \nThe recommended dose of Avastin is 15 mg/kg of body weight given once every 3 weeks as an \nintravenous infusion. \n \nIt is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the underlying disease or until \nunacceptable toxicity (see section 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients: No dose adjustment is required in the patients \u2265 65 years of age. \n \nPatients with renal impairment: The safety and efficacy have not been studied in patients with renal \nimpairment (see section 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment: The safety and efficacy have not been studied in patients with \nhepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in children aged less than 18 years old have not been \nestablished. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation \non a posology can be made. \n \nThere is no relevant use of bevacizumab in the paediatric population in the indications for treatment of \ncancers of the colon, rectum, breast, lung, ovarian, fallopian tube, peritoneum, cervix and kidney. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe initial dose should be delivered over 90 minutes as an intravenous infusion. If the first infusion is \nwell tolerated, the second infusion may be administered over 60 minutes. If the 60-minute infusion is \nwell tolerated, all subsequent infusions may be administered over 30 minutes. \n \nIt should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. \n \nDose reduction for adverse reactions is not recommended. If indicated, therapy should either be \npermanently discontinued or temporarily suspended as described in section 4.4.  \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. Avastin \ninfusions should not be administered or mixed with glucose solutions. This medicinal product must \nnot be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell products or other recombinant human \n\nor humanised antibodies. \n\u2022 Pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nGastrointestinal (GI) perforations and Fistulae (see section 4.8) \nPatients may be at an increased risk for the development of gastrointestinal perforation and gall \nbladder perforation when treated with Avastin. Intra-abdominal inflammatory process may be a risk \nfactor for gastrointestinal perforations in patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum, \ntherefore, caution should be exercised when treating these patients. Prior radiation is a risk factor for \nGI perforation in patients treated for persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with Avastin \nand all patients with GI perforation had a history of prior radiation. Therapy should be permanently \ndiscontinued in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation. \n \nGI-vaginal Fistulae in study GOG-0240 \nPatients treated for persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer with Avastin are at increased \nrisk of fistulae between the vagina and any part of the GI tract (Gastrointestinal-vaginal fistulae). Prior \nradiation is a major risk factor for the development of GI-vaginal fistulae and all patients with GI-\nvaginal fistulae had a history of prior radiation. Recurrence of cancer within the field of prior radiation \nis an additional important risk factor for the development of GI-vaginal fistulae. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nNon-GI Fistulae (see section 4.8) \nPatients may be at increased risk for the development of fistulae when treated with Avastin. \nPermanently discontinue Avastin in patients with tracheoesophageal (TE) fistula or any Grade 4 fistula \n[US National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE v.3)]. \nLimited information is available on the continued use of Avastin in patients with other fistulae.  \nIn cases of internal fistula not arising in the gastrointestinal tract, discontinuation of Avastin should be \nconsidered. \n \nWound healing complications (see section 4.8) \nAvastin may adversely affect the wound healing process. Serious wound healing complications, \nincluding anastomotic complications, with a fatal outcome have been reported. Therapy should not be \ninitiated for at least 28 days following major surgery or until the surgical wound is fully healed. In \npatients who experienced wound healing complications during therapy, treatment should be withheld \nuntil the wound is fully healed. Therapy should be withheld for elective surgery.  \n \nNecrotising fasciitis, including fatal cases, has rarely been reported in patients treated with Avastin. \nThis condition is usually secondary to wound healing complications, gastrointestinal perforation or \nfistula formation. Avastin therapy should be discontinued in patients who develop necrotising fasciitis, \nand appropriate treatment should be promptly initiated. \n \nHypertension (see section 4.8) \nAn increased incidence of hypertension was observed in Avastin-treated patients. Clinical safety data \nsuggest that the incidence of hypertension is likely to be dose-dependent. Pre-existing hypertension \nshould be adequately controlled before starting Avastin treatment. There is no information on the \neffect of Avastin in patients with uncontrolled hypertension at the time of initiating therapy. \nMonitoring of blood pressure is generally recommended during therapy. \n \nIn most cases hypertension was controlled adequately using standard antihypertensive treatment \nappropriate for the individual situation of the affected patient. The use of diuretics to manage \nhypertension is not advised in patients who receive a cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimen. Avastin \nshould be permanently discontinued if medically significant hypertension cannot be adequately \ncontrolled with antihypertensive therapy, or if the patient develops hypertensive crisis or hypertensive \nencephalopathy. \n \nPosterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) (see section 4.8) \nThere have been rare reports of Avastin-treated patients developing signs and symptoms that are \nconsistent with PRES, a rare neurologic disorder, which can present with the following signs and \nsymptoms among others: seizures, headache, altered mental status, visual disturbance, or cortical \nblindness, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by \nbrain imaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In patients developing PRES, treatment \nof specific symptoms including control of hypertension is recommended along with discontinuation of \nAvastin. The safety of reinitiating Avastin therapy in patients previously experiencing PRES is not \nknown. \n \nProteinuria (see section 4.8)  \nPatients with a history of hypertension may be at increased risk for the development of proteinuria \nwhen treated with Avastin. There is evidence suggesting that all Grade (US National Cancer Institute-\nCommon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI-CTCAE v.3]) proteinuria may be related to \nthe dose. Monitoring of proteinuria by dipstick urinalysis is recommended prior to starting and during \ntherapy. Grade 4 proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome) was seen in up to 1.4% of patients treated with \nAvastin. Therapy should be permanently discontinued in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome \n(NCI-CTCAE v.3).  \n \nArterial thromboembolism (see section 4.8) \nIn clinical trials, the incidence of arterial thromboembolic reactions including cerebrovascular \naccidents (CVAs), transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) and myocardial infarctions (MIs) was higher in \n\n\n\n7 \n\npatients receiving Avastin in combination with chemotherapy compared to those who received \nchemotherapy alone. \n \nPatients receiving Avastin plus chemotherapy, with a history of arterial thromboembolism, diabetes or \nage greater than 65 years have an increased risk of developing arterial thromboembolic reactions \nduring therapy. Caution should be taken when treating these patients with Avastin.  \n \nTherapy should be permanently discontinued in patients who develop arterial thromboembolic \nreactions. \n \nVenous thromboembolism (see section 4.8) \nPatients may be at risk of developing venous thromboembolic reactions, including pulmonary \nembolism under Avastin treatment.  \nPatients treated for  persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer with Avastin in combination \nwith paclitaxel and cisplatin may be at increased risk of venous thromboembolic events. \nAvastin should be discontinued in patients with life-threatening (Grade 4) thromboembolic reactions, \nincluding pulmonary embolism (NCI-CTCAE v.3). Patients with thromboembolic reactions \u2264 Grade 3 \nneed to be closely monitored (NCI-CTCAE v.3). \n \nHaemorrhage \nPatients treated with Avastin have an increased risk of haemorrhage, especially tumour-associated \nhaemorrhage. Avastin should be discontinued permanently in patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 \nbleeding during Avastin therapy (NCI-CTCAE v.3) (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients with untreated CNS metastases were routinely excluded from clinical trials with Avastin, \nbased on imaging procedures or signs and symptoms. Therefore, the risk of CNS haemorrhage in such \npatients has not been prospectively evaluated in randomised clinical trials (see section 4.8). Patients \nshould be monitored for signs and symptoms of CNS bleeding, and Avastin treatment discontinued in \ncases of intracranial bleeding.  \n \nThere is no information on the safety profile of Avastin in patients with congenital bleeding diathesis, \nacquired coagulopathy or in patients receiving full dose of anticoagulants for the treatment of \nthromboembolism prior to starting Avastin treatment, as such patients were excluded from clinical \ntrials. Therefore, caution should be exercised before initiating therapy in these patients. However, \npatients who developed venous thrombosis while receiving therapy did not appear to have an \nincreased rate of Grade 3 or above bleeding when treated with a full dose of warfarin and Avastin \nconcomitantly (NCI-CTCAE v.3). \n \nPulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis \nPatients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with Avastin may be at risk of serious, and in some \ncases fatal, pulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis. Patients with recent pulmonary haemorrhage/ \nhaemoptysis (> 2.5 ml of red blood) should not be treated with Avastin.  \n \nAneurysms and artery dissections \nThe use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the \nformation of aneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating Avastin, this risk should be carefully \nconsidered in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm. \n \nCongestive heart failure (CHF) (see section 4.8) \nReactions consistent with CHF were reported in clinical trials. The findings ranged from \nasymptomatic declines in left ventricular ejection fraction to symptomatic CHF, requiring treatment or \nhospitalisation. Caution should be exercised when treating patients with clinically significant \ncardiovascular disease such as pre-existing coronary artery disease, or congestive heart failure with \nAvastin. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nMost of the patients who experienced CHF had metastatic breast cancer and had received previous \ntreatment with anthracyclines, prior radiotherapy to the left chest wall or other risk factors for CHF \nwere present. \n \nIn patients in AVF3694g who received treatment with anthracyclines and who had not received \nanthracyclines before, no increased incidence of all Grade CHF was observed in the anthracycline + \nbevacizumab group compared to the treatment with anthracyclines only. CHF Grade 3 or higher \nreactions were somewhat more frequent among patients receiving bevacizumab in combination with \nchemotherapy than in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. This is consistent with results in patients \nin other studies of metastatic breast cancer who did not receive concurrent anthracycline treatment \n(NCI-CTCAE v.3) (see section 4.8). \n \nNeutropenia and infections (see section 4.8) \nIncreased rates of severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection with or without severe \nneutropenia (including some fatalities) have been observed in patients treated with some myelotoxic \nchemotherapy regimens plus Avastin in comparison to chemotherapy alone. This has mainly been seen \nin combination with platinum- or taxane-based therapies in the treatment of NSCLC, mBC, and in \ncombination with paclitaxel and topotecan in persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer.  \n \nHypersensitivity reactions/infusion reactions (see section 4.8) \nPatients may be at risk of developing infusion/hypersensitivity reactions. Close observation of the \npatient during and following the administration of bevacizumab is recommended as expected for any \ninfusion of a therapeutic humanised monoclonal antibody. If a reaction occurs, the infusion should be \ndiscontinued and appropriate medical therapies should be administered. A systematic premedication is \nnot warranted. \n \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (see section 4.8) \nCases of ONJ have been reported in cancer patients treated with Avastin, the majority of whom had \nreceived prior or concomitant treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates, for which ONJ is an \nidentified risk. Caution should be exercised when Avastin and intravenous bisphosphonates are \nadministered simultaneously or sequentially. \nInvasive dental procedures are also an identified risk factor. A dental examination and appropriate \npreventive dentistry should be considered prior to starting the treatment with Avastin. In patients who \nhave previously received or are receiving intravenous bisphosphonates invasive dental procedures \nshould be avoided, if possible. \n \nIntravitreal use \nAvastin is not formulated for intravitreal use. \n \nEye disorders \nIndividual cases and clusters of serious ocular adverse reactions have been reported following \nunapproved intravitreal use of Avastin compounded from vials approved for intravenous \nadministration in cancer patients. These reactions included infectious endophthalmitis, intraocular \ninflammation such as sterile endophthalmitis, uveitis and vitritis, retinal detachment, retinal pigment \nepithelial tear, intraocular pressure increased, intraocular haemorrhage such as vitreous haemorrhage \nor retinal haemorrhage and conjunctival haemorrhage. Some of these reactions have resulted in \nvarious degrees of visual loss, including permanent blindness. \n \nSystemic effects following intravitreal use \nA reduction of circulating VEGF concentration has been demonstrated following intravitreal anti-\nVEGF therapy. Systemic adverse reactions including non-ocular haemorrhages and arterial \nthromboembolic reactions have been reported following intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors. \n \nOvarian failure/fertility \nAvastin may impair female fertility (see sections 4.6 and 4.8). Therefore fertility preservation \nstrategies should be discussed with women of child-bearing potential prior to starting treatment with \nAvastin. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffect of antineoplastic agents on bevacizumab pharmacokinetics \nNo clinically relevant interaction of co-administered chemotherapy on bevacizumab pharmacokinetics  \nwas observed based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. There were neither \nstatistically significant nor clinically relevant differences in bevacizumab clearance in patients \nreceiving Avastin monotherapy compared to patients receiving Avastin in combination with interferon \nalfa-2a, erlotinib or chemotherapies (IFL, 5-FU/LV, carboplatin/paclitaxel, capecitabine, doxorubicin \nor cisplatin/gemcitabine). \n \nEffect of bevacizumab on the pharmacokinetics of other antineoplastic agents \nNo clinically relevant interaction of bevacizumab was observed on the pharmacokinetics of co-\nadministered interferon alfa 2a, erlotinib (and its active metabolite OSI-420), or the chemotherapies \nirinotecan (and its active metabolite SN38), capecitabine, oxaliplatin (as determined by measurement \nof free and total platinum), and cisplatin. Conclusions on the impact of bevacizumab on gemcitabine \npharmacokinetics cannot be drawn. \n \nCombination of bevacizumab and sunitinib malate \nIn two clinical trials of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia \n(MAHA) was reported in 7 of 19 patients treated with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every two weeks) and \nsunitinib malate (50 mg daily) combination. \n \nMAHA is a haemolytic disorder which can present with red cell fragmentation, anaemia, and \nthrombocytopenia. In addition, hypertension (including hypertensive crisis), elevated creatinine, and \nneurological symptoms were observed in some of these patients. All of these findings were reversible \nupon discontinuation of bevacizumab and sunitinib malate (see Hypertension, Proteinuria, PRES in \nsection 4.4). \n \nCombination with platinum- or taxane-based therapies (see sections 4.4 and 4.8) \nIncreased rates of severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection with or without severe \nneutropenia (including some fatalities) have been observed mainly in patients treated with platinum- \nor taxane-based therapies in the treatment of NSCLC and mBC. \n \nRadiotherapy \nThe safety and efficacy of concomitant administration of radiotherapy and Avastin has not been \nestablished. \n \nEGFR monoclonal antibodies in combination with bevacizumab chemotherapy regimens \nNo interaction studies have been performed. EGFR monoclonal antibodies should not be administered \nfor the treatment of mCRC in combination with bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy. Results from \nthe randomised phase III studies, PACCE and CAIRO-2, in patients with mCRC suggest that the use \nof anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies panitumumab and cetuximab, respectively, in combination with \nbevacizumab plus chemotherapy, is associated with decreased PFS and/or OS, and with increased \ntoxicity compared with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy alone. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during (and up to 6 months after) \ntreatment. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no clinical trial data on the use of Avastin in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity including malformations (see section 5.3). IgGs are known to cross the \nplacenta, and Avastin is anticipated to inhibit angiogenesis in the foetus, and thus is suspected to cause \nserious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. In the post-marketing setting, cases of \n\n\n\n10 \n\nfoetal abnormalities in women treated with bevacizumab alone or in combination with known \nembryotoxic chemotherapeutics have been observed (see section 4.8). Avastin is contraindicated in \npregnancy (see section 4.3).  \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether bevacizumab is excreted in human milk. As maternal IgG is excreted in milk \nand bevacizumab could harm infant growth and development (see section 5.3), women must \ndiscontinue breast-feeding during therapy and not breast-feed for at least six months following the last \ndose of Avastin. \n \nFertility \nRepeat dose toxicity studies in animals have shown that bevacizumab may have an adverse effect on \nfemale fertility (see section 5.3). In a phase III trial in the adjuvant treatment of patients with colon \ncancer, a substudy with premenopausal women has shown a higher incidence of new cases of ovarian \nfailure in the bevacizumab group compared to the control group. After discontinuation of bevacizumab \ntreatment, ovarian function recovered in the majority of patients. Long term effects of the treatment \nwith bevacizumab on fertility are unknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAvastin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, somnolence \nand syncope have been reported with Avastin use (see table 1 in section 4.8). If patients are \nexperiencing symptoms that affect their vision or concentration, or their ability to react, they should be \nadvised not to drive and use machines until symptoms abate. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe overall safety profile of Avastin is based on data from over 5,700 patients with various \nmalignancies, predominantly treated with Avastin in combination with chemotherapy in clinical trials. \n \nThe most serious adverse reactions were: \n \n\u2022 Gastrointestinal perforations (see section 4.4). \n\u2022 Haemorrhage, including pulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis, which is more common in non-\n small cell lung cancer patients (see section 4.4). \n\u2022 Arterial thromboembolism (see section 4.4). \n \nThe most frequently observed adverse reactions across clinical trials in patients receiving Avastin \nwere hypertension, fatigue or asthenia, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. \n \nAnalyses of the clinical safety data suggest that the occurrence of hypertension and proteinuria with \nAvastin therapy are likely to be dose-dependent. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions listed in this section fall into the following frequency categories: Very common \n(\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); \nvery rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).   \n \nTables 1 and 2 list adverse reactions associated with the use of Avastin in combination with different \nchemotherapy regimens in multiple indications, by MedDRA system organ class.  \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nTable 1 provides all adverse reactions by frequency that were determined to have a causal relationship \nwith Avastin through: \n\u2022 comparative incidences noted between clinical trial treatment arms (with at least a 10% \n difference compared to the control arm for NCI-CTCAE Grade 1-5 reactions or at least a 2% \n difference compared to the control arm for NCI-CTCAE Grade 3-5 reactions, \n\u2022 post-authorisation safety studies, \n\u2022 spontaneous reporting,  \n\u2022 epidemiological studies\\non-interventional or observational studies,  \n\u2022 or through an evaluation of individual case reports.  \n \nTable 2 provides the frequency of severe adverse reactions. Severe reactions are defined as adverse \nevents with at least a 2% difference compared to the control arm in clinical studies for NCI-CTCAE \nGrade 3-5 reactions. Table 2 also includes adverse reactions which are considered by the MAH to be \nclinically significant or severe.   \n \nPost-marketing adverse reactions are included in both Tables 1 and 2, where applicable. Detailed \ninformation about these post-marketing reactions are provided in Table 3. \n \nAdverse reactions are added to the appropriate frequency category in the tables below according to the \nhighest incidence seen in any indication.  \nWithin each frequency category, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing \nseriousness.  \n \nSome of the adverse reactions are reactions commonly seen with chemotherapy; however, Avastin \nmay exacerbate these reactions when combined with chemotherapeutic agents. Examples include \npalmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or capecitabine, \nperipheral sensory neuropathy with paclitaxel or oxaliplatin, nail disorders or alopecia with paclitaxel, \nand paronychia with erlotinib. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nTable 1: Adverse Reactions by Frequency  \n \n\nSystem organ \nclass  \n\nVery Common Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Frequency Not \nKnown \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n Sepsis, \nAbscessb,d, \nCellulitis, \nInfection, \n\nUrinary tract \ninfection \n\n Necrotising \nfasciitis a \n\n  \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \n\nsystem \ndisorders \n\nFebrile \nneutropenia, \nLeucopenia, \n\nNeutropeniab, \nThrombo-cytopenia \n\nAnaemia, \nLymphopenia \n\n    \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Hypersensitivity, \ninfusion \n\nreactionsa,b,d \n\n    \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\nAnorexia \nHypomagnesaemia \n\nHyponatraemia \n \n\nDehydration     \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nPeripheral sensory  \nneuropathyb, \nDysarthria, \nHeadache, \nDysguesia \n\nCerebrovascular \naccident, \nSyncope, \n\nSomnolence \n \n\n Posterior \nreversible \nencephalo- \n\npathy \nsyndrome \n\na,b,d \n\nHypertensive \nencephalo- \n\npathya \n\n \n\nEye disorders \n \n \n\nEye disorder, \nLacrimation \n\nincreased \n\n     \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n Congestive heart \nfailureb,d, \n\nSupraventricular  \n tachycardia \n\n    \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\nHypertensionb,d, \nThrombo-embolism \n\n(venous)b,d \n\nThrombo-\nembolism  \n\n(arterial)b,d, \nHaemorrhageb,d, \n\nDeep vein  \nthrombosis \n\n   Renal \nthrombotic \n\nmicroangiopathya,b, \nAneurysms and \n\nartery dissections \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\nDyspnoea, \nRhinitis \n\nEpistaxis \nCough \n\nPulmonary \nhaemorrhage/ \n\nHaemoptysisb,d, \nPulmonary \nembolism, \nHypoxia, \n\nDysphoniaa \n\n   Pulmonary \nhypertensiona, \nNasal septum \nperforationa \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nRectal \nhaemorrhage, \n\nStomatitis, \nConstipation, \n\nDiarrhoea, \nNausea, \n\nVomiting, \nAbdominal pain \n\nGastrointestinal  \nperforationb,d, \n\nIntestinal \nperforation, \n\nIleus, \nIntestinal \n\nobstruction,  \nRecto-vaginal \n\nfistulaed,e,  \nGastrointestinal \n\nDisorder, \nProctalgia \n\n   Gastrointestinal \nulcera \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n     Gallbladder \nperforationa,b \n\n\n\n13 \n\nSystem organ \nclass  \n\nVery Common Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Frequency Not \nKnown \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders \n\nWound healing \ncomplicationsb,d, \n\nExfoliative \ndermatitis, \nDry skin, \n\nSkin discoloration \n\nPalmar-plantar  \nerythro-\n\ndysaesthesia \nsyndrome \n\n \n\n    \n\nMusculoskeletal  \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\nArthralgia \nMyalgia \n\n \n\nFistulab,d, \n\nMuscular \nweakness,  \nBack pain \n\n   Osteonecrosis of \nthe jawa,b \n\nNon-mandibular \nosteonecrosisa,f \n\nRenal and \nurinary \n\ndisorders \n\nProteinuriab,d      \n\nReproductive \nsystem and \n\nbreast disorders \n\nOvarian \nfailureb,c,d \n\n \n\nPelvic Pain     \n\nCongenital, \nfamilial, and \n\ngenetic disorder \n\n     Foetal \nabnormalitiesa,b \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nAsthenia, \nFatigue, \nPyrexia, \n\nPain, \nMucosal \n\ninflammation \n\nLethargy \n \n\n    \n\nInvestigations Weight decreased      \n\n \n When events were noted as both all grade and grade 3-5 adverse drug reactions in clinical trials, the highest \nfrequency observed in patients has been reported.

Table 2 also includes clinically \nsignificant adverse reactions that were observed only in the postmarketing setting, therefore, the frequency and \nNCI-CTCAE grade  is not known.These clinically significant reactions have therefore been included in Table 2 \nwithin the column entitled \u201cFrequency Not Known.\u201d \na Terms represent a group of events that describe a medical concept rather than a single condition or MedDRA \n\n(Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) preferred term. This group of medical terms may involve the \nsame underlying pathophysiology (e.g. arterial thromboembolic reactions include cerebrovascular accident, \nmyocardial infarction, transient ischaemic attack and other arterial thromboembolic reactions). \n\nb For additional information refer below within section \"Further information on selected serious adverse \nreactions\" \n\nc For further information please refer to Table 3 'Adverse reactions reported in post-marketing setting.' \nd Recto-vaginal fistulae are the most common fistulae in the GI-vaginal fistula category. \n \nDescription of selected serious adverse reactions \n \nGastrointestinal (GI) perforations and Fistulae (see section 4.4) \nAvastin has been associated with serious cases of gastrointestinal perforation.  \n \nGastrointestinal perforations have been reported in clinical trials with an incidence of less than 1% in \npatients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, up to 1.3% in patients with metastatic breast \ncancer, up to 2.0% in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer or in patients with ovarian cancer, and \nup to 2.7% (including gastrointestinal fistula and abscess) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. \nFrom a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (study GOG-\n0240), GI perforations (all grade) were reported in 3.2% of patients, all of whom had a history of prior \npelvic radiation.  \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nThe occurrence of those events varied in type and severity, ranging from free air seen on the plain \nabdominal X-ray, which resolved without treatment, to intestinal perforation with abdominal abscess \nand fatal outcome. In some cases underlying intra-abdominal inflammation was present, either from \ngastric ulcer disease, tumour necrosis, diverticulitis, or chemotherapy-associated colitis.  \n \nFatal outcome was reported in approximately a third of serious cases of gastrointestinal perforations, \nwhich represents between 0.2%-1% of all Avastin treated patients. \n \nIn Avastin clinical trials, gastrointestinal fistulae (all grade) have been reported with an incidence of \nup to 2% in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer, but were also reported less \ncommonly in patients with other types of cancer.  \n \nGI-vaginal Fistulae in study GOG-0240 \nIn a trial of patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, the incidence of GI-vaginal \nfistulae was 8.3% in Avastin-treated patients and 0.9% in control patients, all of whom had a history of \nprior pelvic radiation. The frequency of GI-vaginal fistulae in the group treated with Avastin + \nchemotherapy was higher in patients with recurrence within the field of prior radiation (16.7%) \ncompared with patients with no prior radiation and/ or no recurrence inside the field of prior radiation \n(3.6%).  The corresponding frequencies in the control group receiving chemotherapy alone were 1.1% \nvs. 0.8%, respectively. Patients who develop GI-vaginal fistulae may also have bowel obstructions and \nrequire surgical intervention as well as diverting ostomies. \n \nNon-GI Fistulae (see section 4.4) \nAvastin use has been associated with serious cases of fistulae including reactions resulting in death.  \n \nFrom a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (GOG-240), \n1.8% of Avastin-treated patients and 1.4% of control patients were reported to have had non-\ngastrointestinal vaginal, vesical, or female genital tract fistulae. \n \nUncommon (\u2265 0.1% to < 1%) reports of fistulae that involve areas of the body other than the \ngastrointestinal tract (e.g. bronchopleural and biliary fistulae) were observed across various \nindications. Fistulae have also been reported in post-marketing experience. \n \nReactions were reported at various time points during treatment ranging from one week to greater than  \n1 year from initiation of Avastin, with most reactions occurring within the first 6 months of therapy. \n \nWound healing (see section 4.4) \nAs Avastin may adversely impact wound healing, patients who had major surgery within the last \n28 days were excluded from participation in phase III clinical trials.  \n \nIn clinical trials of metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum, there was no increased risk of post-\noperative bleeding or wound healing complications observed in patients who underwent major surgery \n28-60 days prior to starting Avastin. An increased incidence of post-operative bleeding or wound \nhealing complication occurring within 60 days of major surgery was observed if the patient was being \ntreated with Avastin at the time of surgery. The incidence varied between 10% (4/40) and 20% (3/15). \n \nSerious wound healing complications, including anastomotic complications, have been reported, some \nof which had a fatal outcome. \n \nIn locally recurrent and metastatic breast cancer trials, Grade 3-5 wound healing complications were \nobserved in up to 1.1% of patients receiving Avastin compared with up to 0.9% of patients in the \ncontrol arms (NCI-CTCAE v.3).  \n \nIn clinical trials of ovarian cancer, Grade 3-5 wound healing complications were observed in up to \n1.8% of patients in the bevacizumab arm versus 0.1% in the control arm (NCI-CTCAE v.3). \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nHypertension (see section 4.4) \nIn clinical trials, with the exception of study JO25567, the overall incidence of hypertension (all \ngrades) ranged up to 42.1% in the Avastin containing arms compared with up to 14% in the control \narms. The overall incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3 and 4 hypertension  in patients receiving Avastin \nranged from 0.4% to 17.9%. Grade 4 hypertension (hypertensive crisis) occurred in up to 1.0% of \npatients treated with Avastin and chemotherapy compared to up to 0.2% of patients treated with the \nsame chemotherapy alone.  \n \nIn study JO25567, all grade hypertension was observed in 77.3% of the patients who received Avastin \nin combination with erlotinib as first-line treatment for non-squamous NSCLC with EGFR activating \nmutations, compared to 14.3% of patients treated with erlotinib alone. Grade 3 hypertension was \n60.0% in patients treated with Avastin in combination with erlotinib compared to 11.7% in patients \ntreated with erlotinib alone. There were no grade 4 or 5 hypertension events.  \n \nHypertension was generally adequately controlled with oral anti-hypertensives such as \nangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics and calcium-channel blockers. It rarely resulted in \ndiscontinuation of Avastin treatment or hospitalisation.  \n \nVery rare cases of hypertensive encephalopathy have been reported, some of which were fatal. \n \nThe risk of Avastin-associated hypertension did not correlate with the patients\u2019 baseline \ncharacteristics, underlying disease or concomitant therapy.  \n \nPosterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (see section 4.4) \nThere have been rare reports of Avastin-treated patients developing signs and symptoms that are \nconsistent with PRES, a rare neurological disorder. Presentation may include seizures, headache, \naltered mental status, visual disturbance, or cortical blindness, with or without associated \nhypertension. The clinical presentation of PRES is often nonspecific, and therefore the diagnosis of \nPRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, preferably MRI. \n \nIn patients developing PRES, early recognition of symptoms with prompt treatment of specific \nsymptoms including control of hypertension (if associated with severe uncontrolled hypertension) is \nrecommended in addition to discontinuation of bevacizumab therapy. Symptoms usually resolve or \nimprove within days after treatment discontinuation, although some patients have experienced some \nneurologic sequelae. The safety of reinitiating Avastin therapy in patients previously experiencing \nPRES is not known.  \n \nAcross clinical trials, 8 cases of PRES have been reported. Two of the eight cases did not have \nradiological confirmation via MRI. \n \nProteinuria (see section 4.4) \nIn clinical trials, proteinuria has been reported within the range of 0.7% to 54.7% of patients receiving \nAvastin.  \n \nProteinuria ranged in severity from clinically asymptomatic, transient, trace proteinuria to nephrotic \nsyndrome, with the great majority as Grade 1 proteinuria (NCI-CTCAE v.3). Grade 3 proteinuria was \nreported in up to 10.9% of treated patients. Grade 4 proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome) was seen in up \nto 1.4% of treated patients. Testing for proteinuria is recommended prior to start of Avastin therapy. In \nmost clinical trials urine protein levels of \u2265 2g/24 hrs led to the holding of Avastin until recovery to \n< 2g/24 hrs. \n \nHaemorrhage (see section 4.4) \nIn clinical trials across all indications the overall incidence of NCI-CTCAE v.3 Grade 3-5 bleeding \nreactions ranged from 0.4% to 6.9% in Avastin treated patients, compared with up to 4.5% of patients \nin the chemotherapy control group. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nFrom a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (study GOG-\n0240), grade 3-5 bleeding reactions have been reported in up to 8.3% of patients treated with Avastin \nin combination with paclitaxel and topotecan compared with up to 4.6% of patients treated with \npaclitaxel and topotecan. \n \nThe haemorrhagic reactions that have been observed in clinical trials were predominantly tumour-\nassociated haemorrhage (see below) and minor mucocutaneous haemorrhage (e.g. epistaxis).  \n \nTumour-associated haemorrhage (see section 4.4) \nMajor or massive pulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis has been observed primarily in trials in \npatients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Possible risk factors include squamous cell \nhistology, treatment with antirheumatic/anti-inflammatory substances, treatment with anticoagulants, \nprior radiotherapy, Avastin therapy, previous medical history of atherosclerosis, central tumour \nlocation and cavitation of tumours prior to or during therapy. The only variables that showed \nstatistically significant correlations with bleeding were Avastin therapy and squamous cell histology. \nPatients with NSCLC of known squamous cell histology or mixed cell type with predominant \nsquamous cell histology were excluded from subsequent phase III trials, while patients with unknown \ntumour histology were included. \n \nIn patients with NSCLC excluding predominant squamous histology, all Grade reactions were seen \nwith a frequency of up to 9.3% when treated with Avastin plus chemotherapy compared with up to 5% \nin the patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Grade 3-5 reactions have been observed in up to 2.3% \nof patients treated with Avastin plus chemotherapy as compared with < 1% with chemotherapy alone \n(NCI-CTCAE v.3). Major or massive pulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis can occur suddenly and \nup to two thirds of the serious pulmonary haemorrhages resulted in a fatal outcome. \n \nGastrointestinal haemorrhages, including rectal bleeding and melaena have been reported in colorectal \ncancer patients, and have been assessed as tumour-associated haemorrhages.  \n \nTumour-associated haemorrhage was also seen rarely in other tumour types and locations, including \ncases of central nervous system (CNS) bleeding in patients with CNS metastases (see section 4.4). \n \nThe incidence of CNS bleeding in patients with untreated CNS metastases receiving bevacizumab has \nnot been prospectively evaluated in randomised clinical trials. In an exploratory retrospective analysis \nof data from 13 completed randomised trials in patients with various tumour types, 3 patients out of 91 \n(3.3%) with brain metastases experienced CNS bleeding (all Grade 4) when treated with bevacizumab, \ncompared to 1 case (Grade 5) out of 96 patients (1%) that were not exposed to bevacizumab. In two \nsubsequent studies in patients with treated brain metastases (which included around 800 patients), one \ncase of Grade 2 CNS haemorrhage was reported in 83 subjects treated with bevacizumab (1.2%) at the \ntime of interim safety analysis (NCI-CTCAE v.3). \n \nAcross all clinical trials, mucocutaneous haemorrhage has been seen in up to 50% of Avastin-treated \npatients. These were most commonly NCI-CTCAE v.3 Grade 1 epistaxis that lasted less than \n5 minutes, resolved without medical intervention and did not require any changes in the Avastin \ntreatment regimen. Clinical safety data suggest that the incidence of minor mucocutaneous \nhaemorrhage (e.g. epistaxis) may be dose-dependent.  \n \nThere have also been less common reactions of minor mucocutaneous haemorrhage in other locations, \nsuch as gingival bleeding or vaginal bleeding. \n \nThromboembolism (see section 4.4) \n \nArterial thromboembolism: An increased incidence of arterial thromboembolic reactions was observed \nin patients treated with Avastin across indications, including cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial \ninfarction, transient ischaemic attacks, and other arterial thromboembolic reactions.  \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nIn clinical trials, the overall incidence of arterial thromboembolic reactions ranged up to 3.8% in the \nAvastin containing arms compared with up to 2.1% in the chemotherapy control arms. Fatal outcome \nwas reported in 0.8% of patients receiving Avastin compared to 0.5% in patients receiving \nchemotherapy alone. Cerebrovascular accidents (including transient ischaemic attacks) were reported \nin up to 2.7% of patients treated with Avastin in combination with chemotherapy compared to up to \n0.5% of patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Myocardial infarction was reported in up to 1.4% of \npatients treated with Avastin in combination with chemotherapy compared to up to 0.7% of patients \ntreated with chemotherapy alone. \n \nIn one clinical trial evaluating Avastin in combination with 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid, AVF2192g, \npatients with metastatic colorectal cancer who were not candidates for treatment with irinotecan were \nincluded. In this trial arterial thromboembolic reactions were observed in 11% (11/100) of patients \ncompared to 5.8% (6/104) in the chemotherapy control group. \n \nVenous thromboembolism: The incidence of venous thromboembolic reactions in clinical trials was \nsimilar in patients receiving Avastin in combination with chemotherapy compared to those receiving \nthe control chemotherapy alone. Venous thromboembolic reactions include deep venous thrombosis, \npulmonary embolism and thrombophlebitis. \n \nIn clinical trials across indications, the overall incidence of venous thromboembolic reactions ranged \nfrom 2.8% to 17.3% of Avastin-treated patients compared with 3.2% to 15.6% in the control arms. \n \nGrade 3-5 (NCI-CTCAE v.3) venous thromboembolic reactions have been reported in up to 7.8% of \npatients treated with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab compared with up to 4.9% in patients treated \nwith chemotherapy alone (across indications, excluding persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical \ncancer).  \n \nFrom a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (study GOG-\n0240), grade 3-5 venous thromboembolic events have been reported in up to 15.6% of patients treated \nwith Avastin in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin compared with up to 7.0% of patients treated \nwith paclitaxel and cisplatin.  \n \nPatients who have experienced a venous thromboembolic reaction may be at higher risk for a \nrecurrence if they receive Avastin in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. \n \nCongestive heart failure (CHF) \nIn clinical trials with Avastin, congestive heart failure (CHF) was observed in all cancer indications \nstudied to date, but occurred predominantly in patients with metastatic breast cancer. In four phase III \ntrials (AVF2119g, E2100, BO17708 and AVF3694g) in patients with metastatic breast cancer CHF \nGrade 3 (NCI-CTCAE v.3) or higher was reported in up to 3.5% of patients treated with Avastin in \ncombination with chemotherapy compared with up to 0.9% in the control arms. For patients in study \nAVF3694g who received anthracyclines concomitantly with bevacizumab, the incidences of Grade 3 \nor higher CHF for the respective bevacizumab and control arms were similar to those in the other \nstudies in metastatic breast cancer: 2.9% in the anthracycline + bevacizumab arm and 0% in the \nanthracycline + placebo arm. In addition, in study AVF3694g the incidences of all Grade CHF were \nsimilar between the anthracycline + Avastin (6.2%) and the anthracycline + placebo arms (6.0%). \n \nMost patients who developed CHF during mBC trials showed improved symptoms and/or left \nventricular function following appropriate medical therapy. \n \nIn most clinical trials of Avastin, patients with pre-existing CHF of NYHA (New York Heart \nAssociation) II-IV were excluded, therefore, no information is available on the risk of CHF in this \npopulation.  \n \nPrior anthracyclines exposure and/or prior radiation to the chest wall may be possible risk factors for \nthe development of CHF. \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nAn increased incidence of CHF has been observed in a clinical trial of patients with diffuse large B-\ncell lymphoma when receiving bevacizumab with a cumulative doxorubicin dose greater than \n300 mg/m2. This phase III clinical trial compared \nrituximab/cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone (R-CHOP) plus bevacizumab to R-\nCHOP without bevacizumab. While the incidence of CHF was, in both arms, above that previously \nobserved for doxorubicin therapy, the rate was higher in the R-CHOP plus bevacizumab arm. These \nresults suggest that close clinical observation with appropriate cardiac assessments should be \nconsidered for patients exposed to cumulative doxorubicin doses greater than 300 mg/m2 when \ncombined with bevacizumab. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions/infusion reactions (see section 4.4 and Post-marketing experience below) \nIn some clinical trials anaphylactic and anaphylactoid-type reactions were reported more frequently in \npatients receiving Avastin in combination with chemotherapy than with chemotherapy alone. The \nincidence of these reactions in some clinical trials of Avastin is common (up to 5% in bevacizumab-\ntreated patients). \n \nInfections \nFrom a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (study GOG-\n0240), grade 3-5 infections have been reported in up to 24% of patients treated with Avastin in \ncombination with paclitaxel and topotecan compared with up to 13% of patients treated with paclitaxel \nand topotecan. \n \nOvarian failure/fertility (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \nIn NSABP C-08, a phase III trial of Avastin in adjuvant treatment of patients with colon cancer, the \nincidence of new cases of ovarian failure, defined as amenorrhoea lasting 3 or more months, FSH level \n\u2265 30 mIU/mL and a negative serum \u03b2-HCG pregnancy test, has been evaluated in 295 premenopausal \nwomen. New cases of ovarian failure were reported in 2.6% patients in the mFOLFOX-6 group \ncompared to 39% in the mFOLFOX-6 + bevacizumab group. After discontinuation of bevacizumab \ntreatment, ovarian function recovered in 86.2% of these evaluable women. Long term effects of the \ntreatment with bevacizumab on fertility are unknown. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \nDecreased neutrophil count, decreased white blood cell count and presence of urine protein may be \nassociated with Avastin treatment. \n \nAcross clinical trials, the following Grade 3 and 4 (NCI-CTCAE v.3) laboratory abnormalities \noccurred in patients treated with Avastin with at least a 2% difference compared to the corresponding \ncontrol groups: hyperglycaemia, decreased haemoglobin, hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, decreased \nwhite blood cell count, increased international normalised ratio (INR).  \n \nClinical trials have shown that transient increases in serum creatinine (ranging between 1.5-1.9 times \nbaseline level), both with and without proteinuria, are associated with the use of Avastin. The \nobserved increase in serum creatinine was not associated with a higher incidence of clinical \nmanifestations of renal impairment in patients treated with Avastin. \n \nOther special populations \n \nElderly patients \nIn randomised clinical trials, age > 65 years was associated with an increased risk of developing \narterial thromboembolic reactions, including cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), transient ischaemic \nattacks (TIAs) and myocardial infarctions (MIs). Other reactions with a higher frequency seen in \npatients over 65 were Grade 3-4 leucopenia and thrombocytopenia (NCI-CTCAE v.3); and all Grade \nneutropenia, diarrhoea, nausea, headache and fatigue as compared to those aged \u2264 65 years when \ntreated with Avastin (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 under Thromboembolism). In one clinical trial, the \nincidence of hypertension of grade \u2265 3 was two fold higher in patients aged > 65 years than in the \nyounger age group (<65 years). In a study of platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer patients, \nalopecia, mucosal inflammation, peripheral sensory neuropathy, proteinuria and hypertension were \n\n\n\n21 \n\nalso reported and occurred at a rate at least 5% higher in the CT + BV arm for bevacizumab-treated \npatients \u2265 65 years of age compared with bevacizumab-treated patients aged < 65 years. \nNo increase in the incidence of other reactions, including gastrointestinal perforation, wound healing \ncomplications, congestive heart failure, and haemorrhage was observed in elderly patients (> 65 years) \nreceiving Avastin as compared to those aged \u2264 65 years treated with Avastin.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Avastin in children less than 18 years old have not been established.  \n \nIn study BO25041 of Avastin added to postoperative radiation therapy (RT) with concomitant and \nadjuvant temozolomide in paediatric patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial, infratentorial, \ncerebellar, or peduncular high-grade glioma, the safety profile was comparable with that observed in \nother tumour types in adults treated with Avastin.   \n \nIn study BO20924 of Avastin with current standard of care in rhabdomyosarcoma and non-\nrhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma, the safety profile of Avastin treated children was comparable \nwith that observed in adults treated with Avastin. \n \nAvastin is not approved for use in patients under the age of 18 years. In published literature reports, \ncases of non-mandibular osteonecrosis have been observed in patients under the age of 18 years \ntreated with Avastin. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nPost-marketing experience  \n \nTable 3 Adverse reactions reported in post-marketing setting \n \n\nSystem organ class \n(SOC) \n\nReactions (frequency*) \n\nInfections and \nInfestations \n\nNecrotising fasciitis, usually secondary to wound healing \ncomplications, gastrointestinal perforation or fistula formation (rare) \n(see also section 4.4) \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\nHypersensitivity reactions and infusion reactions (not known); with \nthe following possible co-manifestations: dyspnoea/difficulty \nbreathing, flushing/redness/rash, hypotension or hypertension, oxygen \ndesaturation, chest pain, rigors and nausea/vomiting (see also section \n4.4 and Hypersensitivity reactions/infusion reactions above) \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHypertensive encephalopathy (very rare) (see also section 4.4 and \nHypertension in section 4.8) \nPosterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES), (rare) (see \nalso section 4.4) \n\nVascular disorders Renal thrombotic microangiopathy, which may be clinically \nmanifested as proteinuria (not known) with or without concomitant \nsunitinib use.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents, antineoplastic agents, other \nantineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01X C07 \n \nMechanism of action \nBevacizumab binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the key driver of vasculogenesis \nand angiogenesis, and thereby inhibits the binding of VEGF to its receptors, Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and \nKDR (VEGFR-2), on the surface of endothelial cells. Neutralising the biological activity of VEGF \nregresses the vascularisation of tumours, normalises remaining tumour vasculature, and inhibits the \nformation of new tumour vasculature, thereby inhibiting tumour growth. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nAdministration of bevacizumab or its parental murine antibody to xenotransplant models of cancer in \nnude mice resulted in extensive anti-tumour activity in human cancers, including colon, breast, \npancreas and prostate. Metastatic disease progression was inhibited and microvascular permeability \nwas reduced. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nMetastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum (mCRC) \n \nThe safety and efficacy of the recommended dose (5 mg/kg of body weight every two weeks) in \nmetastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum were studied in three randomised, active-controlled \nclinical trials in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based first-line chemotherapy. Avastin was \ncombined with two chemotherapy regimens: \n \n\u2022 AVF2107g: A weekly schedule of irinotecan/bolus 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (IFL) for a total \n\nof 4 weeks of each 6 week-cycle (Saltz regimen).  \n\u2022 AVF0780g: In combination with bolus 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (5-FU/FA) for a total of 6 \n\nweeks of each 8 week-cycle (Roswell Park regimen). \n\u2022 AVF2192g: In combination with bolus 5-FU/FA for a total of 6 weeks of each 8 week-cycle \n\n(Roswell Park regimen) in patients who were not optimal candidates for first-line irinotecan \ntreatment. \n\n \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n24 \n\nThree additional studies with bevacizumab have been conducted in mCRC patients: first-line \n(NO16966), second-line with no previous bevacizumab treatment (E3200), and second-line with \nprevious bevacizumab treatment following disease progression in first-line (ML18147). In these \nstudies, bevacizumab was administered at the following dosing regimens in combination with \nFOLFOX-4 (5-FU/LV/oxaliplatin), XELOX (capecitabine/oxaliplatin), and \nfluoropyrimidine/irinotecan and fluoropyrimidine/oxaliplatin:  \n \n\u2022 NO16966: Avastin 7.5 mg/kg of body weight every 3 weeks in combination with oral \n\ncapecitabine and intravenous oxaliplatin (XELOX) or Avastin 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks in \ncombination with leucovorin plus 5-fluorouracil bolus, followed by 5-fluorouracil infusion, with \nintravenous oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4).  \n\n \n\u2022 E3200: Avastin 10 mg/kg of body weight every 2 weeks in combination with leucovorin and \n\n5-fluorouracil bolus, followed by 5-fluorouracil infusion, with intravenous oxaliplatin \n(FOLFOX-4) in bevacizumab-na\u00efve patients.  \n\n \n\u2022 ML18147: Avastin 5.0 mg/kg of body weight every 2 weeks or Avastin 7.5 mg/kg of body \n\nweight every 3 weeks in combination with fluoropyrimidine/irinotecan or \nfluoropyrimidine/oxaliplatin in patients with disease progression following first-line treatment \nwith bevacizumab. Use of irinotecan- or oxaliplatin-containing regimen was switched depending \non first-line usage of either oxaliplatin or irinotecan. \n\n \nAVF2107g \nThis was a phase III randomised, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial evaluating Avastin in \ncombination with IFL as first-line treatment for metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum. \nEight hundred and thirteen patients were randomised to receive IFL + placebo (Arm 1) or \nIFL + Avastin (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks, Arm 2). A third group of 110 patients received bolus 5-FU/FA \n+ Avastin (Arm 3). Enrolment in Arm 3 was discontinued, as pre-specified, once safety of Avastin \nwith the IFL regimen was established and considered acceptable. All treatments were continued until \ndisease progression. The overall mean age was 59.4 years; 56.6% of patients had an ECOG \nperformance status of 0, 43% had a value of 1 and 0.4% had a value of 2. 15.5% had received prior \nradiotherapy and 28.4% prior chemotherapy. \n \nThe primary efficacy variable of the trial was overall survival. The addition of Avastin to IFL resulted \nin statistically significant increases in overall survival, progression-free survival and overall response \nrate (see Table 4). The clinical benefit, as measured by overall survival, was seen in all pre-specified \npatient subgroups, including those defined by age, sex, performance status, location of primary \ntumour, number of organs involved and duration of metastatic disease. \n \nThe efficacy results of Avastin in combination with IFL-chemotherapy are displayed in Table 4. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nTable 4 Efficacy results for trial AVF2107g \n \n\n AVF2107g \nArm 1 \n\nIFL + placebo \nArm 2 \n\nIFL + Avastina \nNumber of patients 411 402 \n\nOverall survival \nMedian time (months) 15.6 20.3 \n\n95% CI 14.29 \u2013 16.99 18.46 \u2013 24.18 \nHazard ratiob \n\n \n0.660 \n\n(p-value = 0.00004) \nProgression-free survival \n\nMedian time (months) 6.2 10.6 \nHazard ratio \n \n\n0.54 \n(p-value < 0.0001) \n\nOverall response rate \n\nRate (%) 34.8 44.8 \n\n (p-value = 0.0036) \na  5 mg/kg every 2 weeks. \n\nb Relative to control arm. \n  \n\n \nAmong the 110 patients randomised to Arm 3 (5-FU/FA + Avastin) prior to discontinuation of this \narm, the median overall survival was 18.3 months and the median progression free survival was \n8.8 months.  \n \nAVF2192g \nThis was a phase II randomised, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy \nand safety of Avastin in combination with 5-FU/FA as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal \ncancer in patients who were not optimal candidates for first-line irinotecan treatment. One hundred \nand five patients were randomised to 5-FU/FA + placebo arm and 104 patients to 5-FU/FA + Avastin \n(5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) arm. All treatments were continued until disease progression. The addition of \nAvastin 5 mg/kg every two weeks to 5-FU/FA resulted in higher objective response rates, significantly \nlonger progression-free survival, and a trend in longer survival as compared to 5-FU/FA chemotherapy \nalone. \n \nAVF0780g \nThis was a phase II randomised, active-controlled, open-labelled clinical trial investigating Avastin in \ncombination with 5-FU/FA as first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. The median age was \n64 years. 19% of the patients had received prior chemotherapy and 14% prior radiotherapy. \nSeventy-one patients were randomised to receive bolus 5-FU/FA or 5-FU/FA + Avastin (5 mg/kg \nevery 2 weeks). A third group of 33 patients received bolus 5-FU/FA + Avastin (10 mg/kg every \n2 weeks). Patients were treated until disease progression. The primary endpoints of the trial were \nobjective response rate and progression-free survival. The addition of Avastin 5 mg/kg every two \nweeks to 5-FU/FA resulted in higher objective response rates, longer progression-free survival, and a \ntrend in longer survival, compared with 5-FU/FA chemotherapy alone (see Table 5). These efficacy \ndata are consistent with the results from trial AVF2107g. \n \nThe efficacy data from trials AVF0780g and AVF2192g investigating Avastin in combination with \n5-FU/FA-chemotherapy are summarised in Table 5. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nTable 5 Efficacy results for trials AVF0780g and AVF2192g \n \n AVF0780g AVF2192g \n\n 5-FU/FA 5-FU/FA + \nAvastina \n\n5-FU/FA + \nAvastinb \n\n5-FU/FA + \nplacebo \n\n5-FU/FA + \nAvastin \n\nNumber of patients 36 35 33 105 104 \nOverall survival \n\nMedian time (months) 13.6 17.7 15.2 12.9 16.6 \n\n95% CI    10.35 - \n16.95 \n\n13.63 - \n19.32 \n\nHazard ratioc - 0.52 1.01  0.79 \np-value  0.073 0.978  0.16 \n\nProgression-free survival \nMedian time (months) 5.2 9.0 7.2 5.5 9.2 \nHazard ratio  0.44 0.69  0.5 \np-value - 0.0049 0.217  0.0002 \n\nOverall response rate \nRate (percent) 16.7 40.0 24.2 15.2 26 \n95% CI 7.0 \u2212 33.5 24.4 \u2212 57.8 11.7 \u2013 42.6 9.2 - 23.9 18.1 - 35.6 \np-value  0.029 0.43  0.055 \n\nDuration of response \nMedian time (months) NR 9.3 5.0 6.8 9.2 \n25\u201375 percentile (months) 5.5 \u2212 NR 6.1 \u2212 NR 3.8 \u2013 7.8 5.59 - 9.17 5.88 - 13.01 \n\na 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks. \nb 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks.  \nc Relative to control arm. \nNR = not reached. \n\n \nNO16966 \n  \nThis was a phase III randomised, double-blind (for bevacizumab), clinical trial investigating Avastin \n7.5 mg/kg in combination with oral capecitabine and IV oxaliplatin (XELOX), administered on a 3-\nweekly schedule; or Avastin 5 mg/kg in combination with leucovorin with 5-fluorouracil bolus, \nfollowed by 5-fluorouracil infusional, with IV oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4), administered on a 2-weekly \nschedule.

Patients were \n\n\n\n31 \n\nrandomised to paclitaxel alone (90 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour once weekly for three out of four weeks) or \nin combination with Avastin (10 mg/kg IV infusion every two weeks). Prior hormonal therapy for the \ntreatment of metastatic disease was allowed. Adjuvant taxane therapy was allowed only if it was \ncompleted at least 12 months prior to trial entry. Of the 722 patients in the trial, the majority of \npatients had HER2-negative disease (90%), with a small number of patients with unknown (8%) or \nconfirmed HER2-positive status (2%), who had previously been treated with or were considered \nunsuitable for trastuzumab therapy. Furthermore, 65% of patients had received adjuvant chemotherapy \nincluding 19% prior taxanes and 49% prior anthracyclines. Patients with central nervous system \nmetastases, including previously treated or resected brain lesions, were excluded.  \n \nIn trial E2100, patients were treated until disease progression. In situations where early \ndiscontinuation of chemotherapy was required, treatment with Avastin as a single agent continued \nuntil disease progression. The patient characteristics were similar across the trial arms. The primary \nendpoint of this trial was progression free survival (PFS), based on trial investigators\u2019 assessment of \ndisease progression. In addition, an independent review of the primary endpoint was also conducted. \nThe results of this trial are presented in Table 10.  \n \nTable 10 Trial E2100 efficacy results \n \n\nProgression-free survival \n \n\n Investigator assessment*  IRF assessment \n Paclitaxel \n\n \n(n=354) \n\nPaclitaxel/ \nAvastin \n(n=368) \n\nPaclitaxel \n \n\n(n=354) \n\nPaclitaxel/ \nAvastin \n(n=368) \n\nMedian PFS (months) 5.8 11.4 5.8 11.3 \nHR  \n\n(95% CI) \n0.421  \n\n(0.343; 0.516) \n0.483  \n\n(0.385; 0.607) \np-value < 0.0001 < 0.0001 \n\nResponse rates (for patients with measurable disease) \n\n Investigator assessment IRF assessment \n Paclitaxel \n\n \n(n=273) \n\nPaclitaxel/ \nAvastin \n(n=252) \n\nPaclitaxel \n \n\n(n=243) \n\nPaclitaxel/ \nAvastin \n(n=229) \n\n% pts with objective \nresponse \n\n23.4 48.0 22.2 49.8 \n\np-value < 0.0001 < 0.0001 \n   \n\n* primary analysis \n \n\nOverall survival  \n Paclitaxel \n\n \n(n=354) \n\nPaclitaxel/ \nAvastin \n(n=368) \n\nMedian OS (months) 24.8 26.5 \nHR   \n\n(95% CI) \n0.869  \n\n(0.722; 1.046) \np-value 0.1374 \n\n \nThe clinical benefit of Avastin as measured by PFS was seen in all pre-specified subgroups tested \n(including disease-free interval, number of metastatic sites, prior receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy \nand oestrogen receptor (ER) status).  \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nAVF3694g \nStudy AVF3694g was a Phase III, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial designed to \nevaluate the efficacy and safety of Avastin in combination with chemotherapy compared to \nchemotherapy plus placebo as first-line treatment for patients with HER2-negative metastatic or \nlocally recurrent breast cancer.  \n \nChemotherapy was chosen at the investigator's discretion prior to randomisation in a 2:1 ratio to \nreceive either chemotherapy plus Avastin or chemotherapy plus placebo. The choices of chemotherapy \nincluded capecitabine, taxane (protein-bound paclitaxel, docetaxel), and anthracycline-based agents \n(doxorubicin/ cyclophosphamide, epirubicin/ cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil/ doxorubicin/ \ncyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide) given every three weeks (q3w). \nAvastin or placebo was administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg q3w. \n \nThis study included a blinded treatment phase, an optional open-label post-progression phase, and a \nsurvival follow-up phase. During the blinded treatment phase, patients received chemotherapy and \nmedicinal product (Avastin or placebo) every 3 weeks until disease progression, treatment-limiting \ntoxicity, or death. On documented disease progression, patients who entered the optional open-label \nphase could receive open-label Avastin together with a wide-range of second line therapies. \n \nStatistical analyses were performed independently for 1) patients who received capecitabine in \ncombination with Avastin or placebo; 2) patients who received taxane-based or anthracycline-based \nchemotherapy in combination with Avastin or placebo. The primary endpoint of the study was PFS by \ninvestigator assessment. In addition, the primary endpoint was also assessed by an independent review \ncommittee (IRC).  \n \nThe results of this study from the final protocol defined analyses for progression free survival and \nresponse rates for the independently powered capecitabine cohort of Study AVF3694g are presented in \nTable 11 Results from an exploratory overall survival analysis which include an additional 7 months \nof follow-up (approximately 46% of patients had died) are also presented.

The results of these analyses were very similar to the \nprimary PFS results. \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) \n \nFirst-line treatment of non-squamous NSCLC in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Avastin, in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy, in the first-line \ntreatment of patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), was investigated in \ntrials E4599 and BO17704. An overall survival benefit has been demonstrated in trial E4599 with a \n15 mg/kg/q3wk dose of bevacizumab. Trial BO17704 has demonstrated that both 7.5 mg/kg/q3wk and \n15 mg/kg/q3wk bevacizumab doses increase progression free survival and response rate.  \n \nE4599 \nE4599 was an open-label, randomised, active-controlled, multicentre clinical trial evaluating Avastin \nas first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced (stage IIIb with malignant pleural effusion), \nmetastatic or recurrent NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology. \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \nPatients were randomised to platinum-based chemotherapy (paclitaxel 200 mg/m2) and carboplatin \nAUC = 6.0, both by IV infusion (PC) on day 1 of every 3-week cycle for up to 6 cycles or PC in \ncombination with Avastin at a dose of 15 mg/kg IV infusion day 1 of every 3-week cycle. After \ncompletion of six cycles of carboplatin-paclitaxel chemotherapy or upon premature discontinuation of \nchemotherapy, patients on the Avastin + carboplatin\u2013paclitaxel arm continued to receive Avastin as a \nsingle agent every 3 weeks until disease progression. 878 patients were randomised to the two arms. \n \nDuring the trial, of the patients who received trial treatment, 32.2% (136/422) of patients received \n7-12 administrations of Avastin and 21.1% (89/422) of patients received 13 or more administrations of \nAvastin. \n \nThe primary endpoint was duration of survival.

The primary \nendpoint was progression free survival, secondary endpoints for the trial included the duration of \noverall survival. \n \nPatients were randomised to platinum-based chemotherapy, cisplatin 80 mg/m2 intravenous infusion \non day 1 and gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 intravenous infusion on days 1 and 8 of every 3-week cycle for \nup to 6 cycles (CG) with placebo or CG with Avastin at a dose of 7.5 or 15 mg/kg IV infusion day 1 of \nevery 3-week cycle. In the Avastin-containing arms, patients could receive Avastin as a single-agent \nevery 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Trial results show that 94% \n(277 / 296) of eligible patients went on to receive single agent bevacizumab at cycle 7. A high \nproportion of patients (approximately 62%) went on to receive a variety of non-protocol specified anti-\ncancer therapies, which may have impacted the analysis of overall survival. \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nThe efficacy results are presented in Table 13. \n \nTable 13 Efficacy results for trial BO17704  \n \n\n \nCisplatin/Gemcitabine  \n+ placebo \n\nCisplatin/Gemcitabine  \n+ Avastin \n7.5 mg/kg q 3 weeks \n\nCisplatin/Gemcitabine \n+ Avastin \n15 mg/kg q 3 weeks \n\nNumber of patients 347 345 351 \n\nProgression-free \nsurvival \n\n   \n\nMedian (months) 6.1 6.7 \n(p=0.0026) \n\n6.5 \n(p=0.0301) \n\nHazard ratio  0.75 \n[0.62; 0.91] \n\n0.82 \n[0.68; 0.98] \n\nBest overall \nresponse ratea \n\n \n\n20.1% 34.1% \n(p < 0.0001) \n\n30.4% \n (p=0.0023) \n\n a  patients with measurable disease at baseline \n \n\nOverall survival \n\nMedian (months) \n13.1 13.6 \n\n(p=0.4203) \n13.4 \n\n(p=0.7613) \n\nHazard ratio  0.93 \n[0.78; 1.11] \n\n1.03 \n[0.86, 1.23] \n\n \nFirst-line treatment of non-squamous NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations in combination with \nerlotinib \n \nJO25567 \nStudy JO25567 was a randomized, open-label, multi-center Phase II study conducted in Japan to \nevaluate the efficacy and safety of Avastin used in addition to erlotinib in patients with non-squamous \nNSCLC with EGFR activating mutations (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation) who had not \nreceived prior systemic therapy for Stage IIIB/IV or recurrent disease.  \n \nThe primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) based on independent review assessment. \nSecondary endpoints included overall survival, response rate, disease control rate, duration of \nresponse, and safety. \n \nEGFR mutation status was determined for each patient prior to patient screening and 154 patients were \nrandomised to receive either erlotinib + Avastin (erlotinib 150 mg oral daily + Avastin [15 mg/kg IV \nevery 3 weeks]) or erlotinib monotherapy (150 mg oral daily) until disease progression (PD) or \nunacceptable toxicity.

The 649 randomised patients (641 treated) had Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of \n\u2265 70%, no CNS metastases and adequate organ function. Patients were nephrectomised for primary \nrenal cell carcinoma. Avastin 10 mg/kg was given every 2 weeks until disease progression. IFN alfa-\n2a was given up to 52 weeks or until disease progression at a recommended starting dose of 9 MIU \nthree times a week, allowing a dose reduction to 3 MIU three times a week in 2 steps. Patients were \nstratified according to country and Motzer score and the treatment arms were shown to be well \nbalanced for the prognostic factors.  \n \nThe primary endpoint was overall survival, with secondary endpoints for the trial including \nprogression-free survival. The addition of Avastin to IFN-alpha-2a significantly increased PFS and \nobjective tumour response rate. These results have been confirmed through an independent \nradiological review. However, the increase in the primary endpoint of overall survival by 2 months \nwas not significant (HR= 0.91). A high proportion of patients (approximately 63% IFN/placebo; 55% \nAvastin/IFN) received a variety of non-specified post-trial anti-cancer therapies, including \nantineoplastic agents, which may have impacted the analysis of overall survival. \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nThe efficacy results are presented in Table 15 \n \nTable 15 Efficacy results for trial BO17705 \n \n\n BO17705 \n\n Placebo + IFNa Bvb + IFNa  \nNumber of patients 322 327 \n\nProgression-free survival   \nMedian (months) 5.4 10.2 \nHazard ratio \n95% CI \n\n0.63 \n0.52, 0.75 \n\n(p-value < 0.0001) \nObjective response rate (%) in Patients \nwith measurable disease \n N \n\n \n \n\n289 \n\n \n \n\n306 \nResponse rate 12.8% 31.4% \n (p-value < 0.0001) \n\na Interferon alfa-2a 9 MIU 3x/week \nb Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg q 2 wk \n\n \nOverall survival   \n\nMedian (months) 21.3 23.3 \nHazard ratio \n95% CI \n\n0.91 \n0.76, 1.10 \n\n(p-value 0.3360) \n \nAn exploratory multivariate Cox regression model using backward selection indicated that the \nfollowing baseline prognostic factors were strongly associated with survival independent of treatment: \ngender, white blood cell count, platelets, body weight loss in the 6 months prior to trial entry, number \nof metastatic sites, sum of longest diameter of target lesions, Motzer score. Adjustment for these \nbaseline factors resulted in a treatment hazard ratio of 0.78 (95% CI [0.63; 0.96], p=0.0219), \nindicating a 22% reduction in the risk of death for patients in the Avastin + IFN alfa-2a arm compared \nto IFN alfa-2a arm. \n \nNinety seven (97) patients in the IFN alfa-2a arm and 131 patients in the Avastin arm reduced the dose \nof IFN alfa-2a from 9 MIU to either 6 or 3 MIU three times a week as pre-specified in the protocol. \nDose-reduction of IFN alfa-2a did not appear to affect the efficacy of the combination of Avastin and \nIFN alfa-2a based on PFS event free rates over time, as shown by a sub-group analysis. The 131 \npatients in the Avastin + IFN alfa-2a arm who reduced and maintained the IFN alfa-2a dose at 6 or 3 \nMIU during the trial, exhibited at 6, 12 and 18 months PFS event free rates of 73, 52 and 21% \nrespectively, as compared to 61, 43 and 17% in the total population of patients receiving Avastin + \nIFN alfa-2a. \n \nAVF2938 \nThis was a randomised, double-blind, phase II clinical trial investigating Avastin 10 mg/kg in a 2 \nweekly schedule with the same dose of Avastin in combination with 150 mg daily erlotinib, in patients \nwith metastatic clear cell RCC. A total of 104 patients were randomised to treatment in this trial, 53 to \nAvastin 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus placebo and 51 to Avastin 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus \nerlotinib 150 mg daily. The analysis of the primary endpoint showed no difference between the \nAvastin + Placebo arm and the Avastin + Erlotinib arm (median PFS 8.5 versus 9.9 months). Seven \npatients in each arm had an objective response. The addition of erlotinib to bevacizumab did not result \n\n\n\n38 \n\nin an improvement in OS (HR = 1.764; p=0.1789), duration of objective response (6.7 vs 9.1 months) \nor time to symptom progression (HR = 1.172; p=0.5076). \n \nAVF0890 \nThis was a randomised phase II trial conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab \nversus placebo. A total of 116 patients were randomised to receive bevacizumab 3 mg/kg every 2 \nweeks (n=39), 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks; (n=37), or placebo (n=40). An interim analysis showed there \nwas a significant prolongation of the time to progression of disease in the 10 mg/kg group as \ncompared with the placebo group (hazard ratio, 2.55; p < 0.001). There was a small difference, of \nborderline significance, between the time to progression of disease in the 3 mg/kg group and that in \nthe placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.26; p=0.053). Four patients had objective (partial) response, and all \nof these had received the 10 mg/kg dose bevacizumab; the ORR for the 10 mg/kg dose was 10%. \n \nEpithelial ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer \n \nFront-line treatment of ovarian cancer \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Avastin in the front-line treatment of patients with epithelial ovarian, \nfallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer were studied in two phase III trials (GOG-0218 and \nBO17707) that evaluated the effect of the addition of Avastin to carboplatin and paclitaxel compared \nto the chemotherapy regimen alone. \n \nGOG-0218 \nThe GOG-0218 study was a phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three \narm study evaluating the effect of adding Avastin to an approved chemotherapy regimen (carboplatin \nand paclitaxel) in patients with advanced ( Stages IIIB, IIIC and IV according to FIGO staging version \ndated 1988) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. \n \nPatients who had received prior therapy with bevacizumab or prior systemic anticancer therapy for \novarian cancer (e.g. chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, or \nhormonal therapy) or previous radiotherapy to the abdomen or pelvis were excluded from the study. \n \nA total of 1873 patients were randomised in equal proportions to the following three arms: \n \n\n\u2022 CPP arm: Five cycles of placebo (started cycle 2) in combination with carboplatin (AUC 6) \nand paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) for 6 cycles followed by placebo alone, for a total of up to 15 \nmonths of therapy \n\n\u2022 CPB15 arm: Five cycles of Avastin (15 mg/kg q3w started cycle 2) in combination with \ncarboplatin (AUC 6) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) for 6 cycles followed by placebo alone, for a \ntotal of up to 15 months of therapy \n\n\u2022 CPB15+ arm: Five cycles of Avastin (15 mg/kg q3w started cycle 2) in combination with \ncarboplatin (AUC 6) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) for 6 cycles followed by continued use of \nAvastin (15 mg/kg q3w) as single agent for a total of up to 15 months of therapy.  \n\n \nThe majority of patients included in the study were White (87% in all three arms); the median age was \n60 years in CPP and CPB15 arms and 59 years in CPB15+ arm; and 29% of patients in CPP or CPB15 \nand 26% in CPB15+ were over 65 years of age. Overall approximately 50% of patients had a GOG PS \nof 0 at baseline, 43% a GOG PS score of 1, and 7% a GOG PS score of 2. Most patients had EOC \n(82% in CPP and CPB15, 85% in CPB15+) followed by PPC (16% in CPP, 15% in CPB15, 13% in \nCPB15+) and FTC (1% in CPP, 3% in CPB15, 2% in CPB15+). The majority of patients had serous \nadenocarcinoma histologic type (85% in CPP and CPB15, 86% in CPB15+). Overall approximately \n34% of patients were FIGO Stage III optimally debulked with gross residual disease, 40% Stage III \nsub-optimally debulked, and 26% were Stage IV patients. \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\nThe primary endpoint was PFS based on investigator\u2019s assessment of disease progression based on \nradiological scans or CA 125 levels, or symptomatic deterioration per protocol. In addition, a \nprespecified analysis of the data censoring for CA-125 progression events was conducted, as well as \nan independent review of PFS as determined by radiological scans. \n \nThe trial met its primary objective of PFS improvement.

There is insufficient information to determine the safety and efficacy of \nbevacizumab in children with newly-diagnosed high-grade glioma. \n \n\n\u2022 In a single-arm study (PBTC-022), 18 children with recurrent or progressive non-pontine \nhigh-grade glioma (including 8 with glioblastoma [WHO Grade IV], 9 with anaplastic \nastrocytoma [Grade III] and 1 with anaplastic oligodendroglioma [Grade III]) were treated \nwith bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) two weeks apart and then with bevacizumab in combination \nwith CPT-11 (125-350 mg/m\u00b2) once every two weeks until progression. There were no \nobjective (partial or complete) radiological responses (MacDonald criteria). Toxicity and \nadverse reactions included arterial hypertension and fatigue as well as CNS ischaemia with \nacute neurological deficit.  \n\n \n\u2022 In a retrospective single institution series, 12 consecutive (2005 to 2008) children with \n\nrelapsed or progressive high-grade glioma (3 with WHO Grade IV, 9 with Grade III) were \ntreated with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) and irinotecan (125 mg/m\u00b2) every 2 weeks. There were \nno complete responses and 2 partial responses (MacDonald criteria).  \n\n \nIn a randomized phase II study (BO25041) a total of 121 patients aged \u2265 3 years to <18 years with \nnewly diagnosed supratentorial or infratentorial cerebellar or peduncular high-grade glioma (HGG) \nwere treated with post operative radiation therapy (RT) and adjuvant temozolomide (T) with and \nwithout bevacizumab: 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks IV.   \n \n\n\n\n51 \n\nThe study did not meet its primary endpoint of demonstrating a significant improvement of EFS \n(Central Radiology Review Committee (CRRC)-assessed) when bevacizumab was added to the RT/T \narm compared with RT/T alone (HR = 1.44; 95% CI: 0.90, 2.30). These results were consistent with \nthose from various sensitivity analyses and in clinically relevant subgroups. The results for all \nsecondary endpoints (investigator assessed EFS, and ORR and OS) were consistent in showing no \nimprovement associated with the addition of bevacizumab to the RT/T arm compared with the RT/T \narm alone. \n \nAddition of Avastin to RT/T did not demonstrate clinical benefit in study BO25041 in 60 evaluable \nchildren patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial or infratentorial cerebellar or peduncular high-\ngrade glioma (HGG) (See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).  \n \nSoft tissue sarcoma \nIn a randomized phase II study (BO20924) a total of 154 patients aged \u2265 6 months to <18 years with \nnewly diagnosed metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma and non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma were \ntreated with standard of care (Induction IVADO/IVA+/- local therapy followed by Maintenance \nVinorelbine and cyclophosphamide) with or without bevacizumab (2.5 mg/kg/week) for a total \nduration of treatment of approximately 18 months. At the time of the final primary analysis, the \nprimary endpoint of EFS by independent central review did not show a statistically significant \ndifference between the two treatment arms, with HR of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.41; p-value = 0.72).  \nThe difference in ORR per independent central review was 18% (CI: 0.6%, 35.3%) between the two \ntreatment arms in the few patients who had evaluable tumor at baseline and had a confirmed response \nprior to receiving any local therapy : 27/75 patients (36.0%, 95% CI: 25.2%, 47.9%) in the Chemo arm \nand 34/63 patients (54.0%, 95% CI: 40.9%, 66.6%) in the Bv + Chemo arm. The final Overall \nSurvival (OS) analyses showed no significant clinical benefit from addition of bevacizumab to \nchemotherapy in this patient population. \n \nAddition of Avastin to standard of care did not demonstrate clinical benefit in clinical trial BO20924, \nin 71 evaluable children (from age 6 months to less than 18 years old) patients with metastatic \nRhabdomyosarcoma and non-Rhabdomyosarcoma Soft Tissue Sarcoma.  \n(See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).  \n \nThe incidence of AEs, including Grade \u2265 3 AEs and SAEs, was similar between the two treatment \narms.  No AEs leading to death occurred in either treatment arm; all deaths were attributed to disease \nprogression.  Bevacizumab addition to multimodal standard of care treatment seemed to be tolerated in \nthis paediatric population. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic data for bevacizumab are available from ten clinical trials in patients with solid \ntumours. In all clinical trials, bevacizumab was administered as an IV infusion. The rate of infusion \nwas based on tolerability, with an initial infusion duration of 90 minutes. The pharmacokinetics of \nbevacizumab was linear at doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg. \n \nDistribution \nThe typical value for central volume (Vc) was 2.73 L and 3.28 L for female and male patients \nrespectively, which is in the range that has been described for IgGs and other monoclonal antibodies. \nThe typical value for peripheral volume (Vp) was 1.69 L and 2.35 L for female and male patients \nrespectively, when bevacizumab is co-administered with anti-neoplastic agents. After correcting for \nbody weight, male patients had a larger Vc (+ 20%) than female patients. \n \n\n\n\n52 \n\nBiotransformation \nAssessment of bevacizumab metabolism in rabbits following a single IV dose of 125I-bevacizumab \nindicated that its metabolic profile was similar to that expected for a native IgG molecule which does \nnot bind VEGF. The metabolism and elimination of bevacizumab is similar to endogenous IgG i.e. \nprimarily via proteolytic catabolism throughout the body, including endothelial cells, and does not rely \nprimarily on elimination through the kidneys and liver. Binding of the IgG to the FcRn receptor results \nin protection from cellular metabolism and the long terminal half-life. \n \nElimination \nThe value for clearance is, on average, equal to 0.188 and 0.220 L/day for female and male patients, \nrespectively. After correcting for body weight, male patients had a higher bevacizumab clearance \n(+ 17%) than females. According to the two-compartmental model, the elimination half-life is 18 days \nfor a typical female patient and 20 days for a typical male patient. \n \nLow albumin and high tumour burden are generally indicative of disease severity. Bevacizumab \nclearance was approximately 30% faster in patients with low levels of serum albumin and 7% faster in \nsubjects with higher tumour burden when compared with a typical patient with median values of \nalbumin and tumour burden. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \nThe population pharmacokinetics were analysed in adult and pediatric patients to evaluate the effects \nof demographic characteristics. In adults, the results showed no significant difference in the \npharmacokinetics of bevacizumab in relation to age. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo trials have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab in renally impaired \npatients since the kidneys are not a major organ for bevacizumab metabolism or excretion. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo trials have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab in patients with \nhepatic impairment since the liver is not a major organ for bevacizumab metabolism or excretion. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab were evaluated in 152 children, adolescents and young adults \n(7 months to 21 years, 5.9 to 125 kg) across 4 clinical studies using a population pharmacokinetic \nmodel. The pharmacokinetic results show that the clearance and volume of distribution of \nbevacizumab were comparable between paediatric and young adult patients when normalised by body \nweight, with exposure trending lower as body weight decreased. Age was not associated with the \npharmacokinetics of bevacizumab when body weight was taken into account.  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab was well characterized by the paediatric population PK model \nfor 70 patients in Study BO20924 ((1.4 to 17.6 years; 11.6 to 77.5 kg) and 59 patients in Study \nBO25041 (1 to 17 years; 11.2 to 82.3 kg). In Study BO20924, bevacizumab exposure was generally \nlower compared to a typical adult patient at the same dose. In Study BO25041, bevacizumab exposure \nwas similar compared to a typical adult at the same dose. In both studies, bevacizumb exposure \ntrended lower as body weight decreased.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn studies of up to 26 weeks duration in cynomolgus monkeys, physeal dysplasia was observed in \nyoung animals with open growth plates, at bevacizumab average serum concentrations below the \nexpected human therapeutic average serum concentrations. In rabbits, bevacizumab was shown to \ninhibit wound healing at doses below the proposed clinical dose. Effects on wound healing were \nshown to be fully reversible. \n \nStudies to evaluate the mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of bevacizumab have not been \nperformed. \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \nNo specific studies in animals have been conducted to evaluate the effect on fertility. An adverse \neffect on female fertility can however be expected as repeat dose toxicity studies in animals have \nshown inhibition of the maturation of ovarian follicles and a decrease/absence of corpora lutea and \nassociated decrease in ovarian and uterus weight as well as a decrease in the number of menstrual \ncycles.  \n \nBevacizumab has been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic when administered to rabbits. \nObserved effects included decreases in maternal and foetal body weights, an increased number of \nfoetal resorptions and an increased incidence of specific gross and skeletal foetal malformations. \nAdverse foetal outcomes were observed at all tested doses, of which the lowest dose resulted in \naverage serum concentrations approximately 3 times larger than in humans receiving 5 mg/kg every \n2 weeks. Information on foetal malformations observed in the post marketing setting are provided in \nsection 4.6 Fertility, Pregnancy and Lactation and 4.8 Undesirable Effects. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n67 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nAvastin 25 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion  \nbevacizumab \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n\u25cf Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\u25cf If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\u25cf If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See Section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n \n1. What Avastin is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Avastin \n3. How to use Avastin \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Avastin \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Avastin is and what it is used for \n \nAvastin contains the active substance bevacizumab, which is a humanised monoclonal antibody (a \ntype of protein that is normally made by the immune system to help defend the body from infection \nand cancer). Bevacizumab binds selectively to a protein called human vascular endothelial growth \nfactor (VEGF), which is found on the lining of blood and lymph vessels in the body. The VEGF \nprotein causes blood vessels to grow within tumours, these blood vessels provide the tumour with \nnutrients and oxygen. Once bevacizumab is bound to VEGF, tumour growth is prevented by blocking \nthe growth of the blood vessels which provide the nutrients and oxygen to the tumour. \n \nAvastin is a medicine used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced cancer in the large bowel, \ni.e., in the colon or rectum. Avastin will be administered in combination with chemotherapy treatment \ncontaining a fluoropyrimidine medicine. \n \nAvastin is also used for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic breast cancer. When used for \npatients with breast cancer, it will be administered with a chemotherapy medicinal product called \npaclitaxel or capecitabine. \n \nAvastin is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. \nAvastin will be administered together with a chemotherapy regimen containing platinum. \n \nAvastin is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer when \ncancer cells have specific mutations of a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). \nAvastin will be administered in combination with erlotinib. \n \nAvastin is also used for treatment of adult patients with advanced kidney cancer. When used for \npatients with kidney cancer, it will be administered with another type of medicine called interferon. \n \nAvastin is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, \nor primary peritoneal cancer. When used for patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary \nperitoneal cancer, it will be administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. \n \nWhen used for those adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary \nperitoneal cancer whose disease has come back at least 6 months after the last time they were treated \n\n\n\n68 \n\nwith a chemotherapy regimen containing a platinum agent, Avastin will be administered in \ncombination with carboplatin and gemcitabine or with carboplatin and paclitaxel. \n \nWhen used for those adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary \nperitoneal cancer whose disease has come back before 6 months after the last time they were treated \nwith a chemotherapy regimen containing a platinum agent, Avastin will be administered in \ncombination with paclitaxel, or topotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. \n \nAvastin is also used for the treatment of adult patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical \ncancer. Avastin will be administered in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or, alternatively, \npaclitaxel and topotecan in patients who cannot receive platinum therapy. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Avastin \n \nDo not use Avastin if \n\u25cf you are allergic (hypersensitive) to bevacizumab or to any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n\u25cf you are allergic (hypersensitive) to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell products or to other \n\nrecombinant human or humanised antibodies. \n\u25cf you are pregnant. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Avastin \n \n\u25cf It is possible that Avastin may increase the risk of developing holes in the gut wall. If you have \n\nconditions causing inflammation inside the abdomen (e.g. diverticulitis, stomach ulcers, colitis \nassociated with chemotherapy), please discuss this with your doctor. \n\n \n\u25cf Avastin may increase the risk of developing an abnormal connection or passageway between \n\ntwo organs or vessels. The risk of developing connections between the vagina and any parts of \nthe gut can increase if you have persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. \n\n \n\u25cf This medicine can increase the risk of bleeding or increase the risk of problems with wound \n\nhealing after surgery. If you are going to have an operation, if you have had major surgery \nwithin the last 28 days or if you still have an unhealed wound following surgery, you should not \nreceive this medicine.  \n\n \n\u25cf Avastin may increase the risk of developing serious infections of the skin or deeper layers under \n\nthe skin, especially if you had holes in the gut wall or problems with wound healing.  \n \n\u25cf Avastin can increase the incidence of high blood pressure. If you have high blood pressure \n\nwhich is not well controlled with blood pressure medicines, please consult your doctor as it is \nimportant to make sure that your blood pressure is under control before starting Avastin \ntreatment. \n\n \n\u25cf If you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a \n\ntear in a blood vessel wall. \n \n\u25cf This medicine increases the risk of having protein in your urine especially if you already have \n\nhigh blood pressure.  \n \n\u25cf The risk of developing blood clots in your arteries (a type of blood vessel) can increase if you \n\nare over 65 years old, if you have diabetes, or if you have had previous blood clots in your \narteries. Please talk to your doctor since blood clots can lead to heart attack and stroke. \n\n \n\n\n\n69 \n\n\u25cf Avastin can also increase the risk of developing blood clots in your veins (a type of blood \nvessel). \n\n \n\u25cf This medicine may cause bleeding, especially tumour-related bleeding. Please consult your \n\ndoctor if you or your family tend to suffer from bleeding problems or you are taking medicines \nto thin the blood for any reason. \n\n \n\u25cf It is possible that Avastin may cause bleeding in and around your brain. Please discuss this with \n\nyour doctor if you have metastatic cancer affecting your brain. \n \n\u25cf It is possible that Avastin can increase the risk of bleeding in your lungs, including coughing or \n\nspitting blood. Please discuss with your doctor if you noticed this previously. \n \n\u25cf Avastin can increase the risk of developing a weak heart. It is important that your doctor knows \n\nif you have ever received anthracyclines (for example doxorubicin, a specific type of \nchemotherapy used to treat some cancers) or had radiotherapy to your chest, or if you have heart \ndisease. \n\n \n\u25cf This medicine may cause infections and a decreased number of your neutrophils (a type of \n\nblood cell important for your protection against bacteria). \n \n\u25cf It is possible that Avastin can cause hypersensitivity and/or infusion reactions (reactions related \n\nto your injection of the medicine). Please let your doctor, pharmacist or nurse know if you have \npreviously experienced problems after injections, such as dizziness/feeling of fainting, \nbreathlessness, swelling or skin rash. \n\n \n\u25cf A rare neurological side effect named posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) \n\nhas been associated with Avastin treatment. If you have headache, vision changes, confusion or \nseizure with or without high blood pressure, please contact your doctor.  \n\n \nPlease consult your doctor, even if these above statements were only applicable to you in the past. \n \nBefore you are given Avastin or while you are being treated with Avastin: \n\u25cf if you have or have had pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or sores inside the mouth, \n\nnumbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth tell your doctor and \ndentist immediately.  \n\n\u25cf if you need to undergo an invasive dental treatment or dental surgery, tell your dentist that you \nare being treated with Avastin, in particular when you are also receiving or have received an \ninjection of bisphosphonate into your blood. \n\n \nYou may be advised to have a dental check-up before you start treatment with Avastin. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nAvastin use is not recommended in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years because the \nsafety and benefit have not been established in these patient populations.  \n \nDeath of bone tissue (osteonecrosis) in bones other than the jaw have been reported in patients under \n18 years old when treated with Avastin. \n \nOther medicines and Avastin \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nCombinations of Avastin with another medicine called sunitinib malate (prescribed for renal and \ngastrointestinal cancer) may cause severe side effects. Discuss with your doctor to make sure that you \ndo not combine these medicines. \n \n\n\n\n70 \n\nTell your doctor if you are using platinum- or taxane-based therapies for lung or metastatic breast \ncancer. These therapies in combination with Avastin may increase the risk of severe side effects. \n \nPlease tell your doctor if you have recently received, or are receiving, radiotherapy. \n \nPregnancy, breast feeding and fertility \nYou must not use this medicine if you are pregnant. Avastin may cause damage to your unborn baby \nas it may stop the formation of new blood vessels.

Please consult your doctor for more information. \n \nAsk your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nAvastin has not been shown to reduce your ability to drive or to use any tools or machines. However, \nsleepiness and fainting have been reported with Avastin use. If you experience symptoms that affect \nyour vision or concentration, or your ability to react, do not drive and use machines until symptoms \ndisappear. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Avastin \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Avastin \n \nDosage and frequency of administration \nThe dose of Avastin needed depends on your body weight and the kind of cancer to be treated. The \nrecommended dose is 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg per kilogram of your body weight. Your doctor \nwill prescribe a dose of Avastin that is right for you. You will be treated with Avastin once every 2 or \n3 weeks. The number of infusions that you receive will depend on how you are responding to \ntreatment; you should continue to receive this medicine until Avastin fails to stop your tumour \ngrowing. Your doctor will discuss this with you. \n \nMethod and route of administration \nAvastin is a concentrate for solution for infusion. Depending on the dose prescribed for you, some or \nall of the contents of the Avastin vial will be diluted with sodium chloride solution before use.

These include a \ndecreased number of white cells in the blood, in particular neutrophils (one type of white blood cell \nwhich helps protect against infections) in the blood; presence of protein in the urine; decreased blood \npotassium, sodium or phosphorous (a mineral); increased blood sugar; increased blood alkaline \nphosphatase (an enzyme); increased serum creatinine (a protein measured by a blood test to see how \nwell your kidneys are working); decreased haemoglobin (found in red blood cells, which carry \noxygen), which may be severe. \n \nPain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or sores inside the mouth, numbness or a feeling of \nheaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth. These could be signs and symptoms of bone damage in \nthe jaw (osteonecrosis). Tell your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any of them. \n \nPre-menopausal women (women who have a menstrual cycle) may notice that their periods become \nirregular or are missed and may experience impaired fertility. If you are considering having children \nyou should discuss this with your doctor before your treatment starts. \n \nAvastin has been developed and made to treat cancer by injecting it into the bloodstream. It has not \nbeen developed or made for injection into the eye. It is therefore not authorised to be used in this way. \nWhen Avastin is injected directly into the eye (unapproved use), the following side effects may occur: \n \n\u2022 Infection or inflammation of the eye globe, \n\u2022 Redness of the eye, small particles or spots in your vision (floaters), eye pain, \n\u2022 Seeing flashes of light with floaters, progressing to a loss of some of your vision, \n\u2022 Increased eye pressure, \n\u2022 Bleeding in the eye. \n \n\n\n\n74 \n\nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem  listed in Appendix V.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what avastin is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "avastin contains the active substance bevacizumab, which is a humanised monoclonal antibody (a type of protein that is normally made by the immune system to help defend the body from infection and cancer). bevacizumab binds selectively to a protein called human vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf), which is found on the lining of blood and lymph vessels in the body. the vegf protein causes blood vessels to grow within tumours, these blood vessels provide the tumour with nutrients and oxygen. once bevacizumab is bound to vegf, tumour growth is prevented by blocking the growth of the blood vessels which provide the nutrients and oxygen to the tumour. avastin is a medicine used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced cancer in the large bowel, i.e., in the colon or rectum. avastin will be administered in combination with chemotherapy treatment containing a fluoropyrimidine medicine. avastin is also used for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic breast cancer. when used for patients with breast cancer, it will be administered with a chemotherapy medicinal product called paclitaxel or capecitabine. avastin is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. avastin will be administered together with a chemotherapy regimen containing platinum. avastin is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer when cancer cells have specific mutations of a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr). avastin will be administered in combination with erlotinib. avastin is also used for treatment of adult patients with advanced kidney cancer. when used for patients with kidney cancer, it will be administered with another type of medicine called interferon. avastin is also used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. when used for patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, it will be administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. when used for those adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer whose disease has come back at least 6 months after the last time they were treated 68 with a chemotherapy regimen containing a platinum agent, avastin will be administered in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine or with carboplatin and paclitaxel. when used for those adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer whose disease has come back before 6 months after the last time they were treated with a chemotherapy regimen containing a platinum agent, avastin will be administered in combination with paclitaxel, or topotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. avastin is also used for the treatment of adult patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. avastin will be administered in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or, alternatively, paclitaxel and topotecan in patients who cannot receive platinum therapy.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "avastin", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 15, "BeginOffset": 0,

fails to stop your tumour growing. your doctor will discuss this with you. method and route of administration avastin is a concentrate for solution for infusion. depending on the dose prescribed for you, some or all of the contents of the avastin vial will be diluted with sodium chloride solution before use. a doctor or nurse will give you this diluted avastin solution by intravenous infusion (a drip into your vein). the first infusion will be given to you over 90 minutes. if this is well-tolerated the second infusion may be given over 60 minutes. later infusions may be given to you over 30 minutes. the administration of avastin should be temporarily discontinued if you develop severe high blood pressure requiring treatment with blood pressure medicines, if you have problems with wound healing following surgery, if you undergo surgery. the administration of avastin should be permanently discontinued if you develop severe high blood pressure which cannot be controlled by blood pressure medicines; or a sudden severe rise in blood pressure, presence of protein in your urine accompanied by swelling of your body, 71 a hole in your gut wall, an abnormal tube-like connection or

includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. the side effects listed below were seen when avastin was given together with chemotherapy. this does not necessarily mean that these side effects were strictly caused by avastin. allergic reactions if you have an allergic reaction, tell your doctor or a member of the medical staff straight away. the signs may include: difficulty in breathing or chest pain. you could also experience redness or flushing of the skin or a rash, chills and shivering, feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting). you should seek help immediately if you suffer from any of the below mentioned side effects. severe side effects, which may be very common (affects more than 1 user in 10), include: high blood pressure, feeling of numbness or tingling in hands or feet, decreased number of cells in the blood, including white cells that help to fight against infections (this may be accompanied by fever), and cells that help the blood to clot, feeling weak and having no energy, tiredness, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. severe side effects, which may be common (affects 1 to 10 users in 100), include: perforation of the gut, bleeding, including bleeding in the lungs in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, blocking of the arteries by a blood clot, blocking of the veins by a blood clot, blocking of the blood vessels of the lungs by a blood clot, blocking of the veins of the legs by a blood clot, 72 heart failure, problems with wound healing after surgery, redness, peeling, tenderness, pain, or blistering on the

the blood or bladder, reduced blood supply to the brain or stroke, sleepiness, nose bleed, increase in heart rate (pulse), blockage in the gut or bowel, abnormal urine test (protein in the urine), shortness of breath or low levels of oxygen in the blood, infections of the skin or deeper layers under the skin, fistula: abnormal tube-like connection between internal organs and skin or other tissues that are not normally connected, including connections between vagina and the gut in patients with cervical cancer. severe side effects of unknown frequency (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data), include: serious infections of the skin or deeper layers under the skin, especially if you had holes in the gut wall or problems with wound healing, allergic reactions (the signs may include difficulty breathing, facial redness, rash, low blood pressure or high blood pressure, low oxygen in your blood, chest pain, or nausea/vomiting), a negative effect on a woman's ability to have children (see the paragraphs below the list of side effects for further recommendations), a brain condition with symptoms including seizures (fits), headache, confusion, and changes in vision (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome or pres), symptoms that suggest changes in normal brain function (headaches, vision changes, confusion, or seizures), and high blood pressure, an enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall or a tear in a blood vessel wall (aneurysms and artery dissections), clogging of a very small blood vessel(s) in the kidney, abnormally high blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs which makes the right side of the heart work harder than normal, a hole in the cartilage wall separating the nostrils of the nose, a hole in the stomach or

increased risk of experiencing the following side effects : blood clot in the arteries which can lead to a stroke or a heart attack, reduction in the number of white cells in the blood, and cells that help the blood clot, diarrhoea, sickness, headache, fatigue, high blood pressure. avastin may also cause changes in laboratory tests carried out by your doctor. these include a decreased number of white cells in the blood, in particular neutrophils (one type of white blood cell which helps protect against infections) in the blood; presence of protein in the urine; decreased blood potassium, sodium or phosphorous (a mineral); increased blood sugar; increased blood alkaline phosphatase (an enzyme); increased serum creatinine (a protein measured by a blood test to see how well your kidneys are working); decreased haemoglobin (found in red blood cells, which carry oxygen), which may be severe. pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or sores inside the mouth, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth. these could be signs and symptoms of bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis). tell your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any of them. pre-menopausal women (women who have a menstrual cycle) may notice that their periods become irregular or are missed and may experience impaired fertility. if you are considering having children you should discuss this with your doctor before your treatment starts. avastin has been developed and made to treat cancer by injecting it into the bloodstream. it has not been developed or made for injection into the eye. it is therefore not authorised to be used in this way. when avastin is injected directly into the eye (unapproved use), the following side effects may occur: infection or inflammation of the eye globe, redness of the eye, small particles or spots in your vision (floaters), eye pain, seeing flashes of light with floaters, progressing to a loss of some of your vision, increased eye pressure, bleeding in the eye. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this
