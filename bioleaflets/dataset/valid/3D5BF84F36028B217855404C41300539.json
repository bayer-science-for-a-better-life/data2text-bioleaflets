CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBreast cancer \n \nMetastatic breast cancer \n \nTrazimera is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast \ncancer (MBC): \n \n- as monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two \n\nchemotherapy regimens for their metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy must have included at \nleast an anthracycline and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. \nHormone receptor positive patients must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are \nunsuitable for these treatments. \n\n \n- in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received \n\nchemotherapy for their metastatic disease and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable. \n \n\n\n\n3  \n\n- in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received \nchemotherapy for their metastatic disease. \n\n \n- in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with \n\nhormone-receptor positive MBC, not previously treated with trastuzumab. \n \nEarly breast cancer \n \nTrazimera is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer \n(EBC): \n \n- following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and radiotherapy (if applicable) \n\n(see section 5.1). \n \n- following adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, in combination \n\nwith paclitaxel or docetaxel. \n \n- in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin. \n \n- in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant Trazimera therapy, for \n\nlocally advanced (including inflammatory) disease or tumours > 2 cm in diameter (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \nTrazimera should only be used in patients with metastatic or early breast cancer whose tumours have \neither HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated \nassay (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nMetastatic gastric cancer \n \nTrazimera in combination with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin is indicated for the \ntreatment of adult patients with HER2-positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastro-\noesophageal junction who have not received prior anti-cancer treatment for their metastatic disease. \n \nTrazimera should only be used in patients with metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) whose tumours have \nHER2 overexpression as defined by IHC2+ and a confirmatory SISH or FISH result, or by an IHC3+ \nresult. Accurate and validated assay methods should be used (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nHER2 testing is mandatory prior to initiation of therapy (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). Trazimera \ntreatment should only be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy (see section 4.4), and should be administered by a healthcare professional only. \n \nTrazimera intravenous formulation is not intended for subcutaneous administration and should be \nadministered via an intravenous infusion only. \n \nIn order to prevent medication errors it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the drug \nbeing prepared and administered is Trazimera (trastuzumab) and not Kadcyla (trastuzumab \nemtansine). \n \nPosology \n \nMetastatic breast cancer \n \nThree-weekly schedule \nThe recommended initial loading dose is 8 mg/kg body weight. The recommended maintenance dose \nat three-weekly intervals is 6 mg/kg body weight, beginning three weeks after the loading dose. \n\n\n\n4  \n\n \nWeekly schedule \nThe recommended initial loading dose is 4 mg/kg body weight. The recommended weekly \nmaintenance dose is 2 mg/kg body weight, beginning one week after the loading dose. \n \nAdministration in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel \nIn the pivotal trials (H0648g, M77001), paclitaxel or docetaxel was administered the day following \nthe first dose of trastuzumab (for dose, see the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for \npaclitaxel or docetaxel) and immediately after the subsequent doses of trastuzumab if the preceding \ndose of trastuzumab was well tolerated. \n \nAdministration in combination with an aromatase inhibitor \nIn the pivotal trial (BO16216) trastuzumab and anastrozole were administered from day 1. There \nwere no restrictions on the relative timing of trastuzumab and anastrozole at administration (for dose, \nsee the SmPC for anastrozole or other aromatase inhibitors). \n \nEarly breast cancer \n \nThree-weekly and weekly schedule \nAs a three-weekly regimen the recommended initial loading dose of Trazimera is 8 mg/kg body \nweight. The recommended maintenance dose of Trazimera at three-weekly intervals is 6 mg/kg body \nweight, beginning three weeks after the loading dose. \n \nAs a weekly regimen (initial loading dose of 4 mg/kg followed by 2 mg/kg every week) \nconcomitantly with paclitaxel following chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. \n \nSee section 5.1 for chemotherapy combination dosing. \n \nMetastatic gastric cancer \n \nThree-weekly schedule \nThe recommended initial loading dose is 8 mg/kg body weight. The recommended maintenance dose \nat three-weekly intervals is 6 mg/kg body weight, beginning three weeks after the loading dose. \n \nBreast cancer and gastric cancer \n \nDuration of treatment \nPatients with MBC or MGC should be treated with Trazimera until progression of disease. Patients \nwith EBC should be treated with Trazimera for 1 year or until disease recurrence, whichever occurs \nfirst; extending treatment in EBC beyond one year is not recommended (see section 5.1). \n \nDose reduction \nNo reductions in the dose of trastuzumab were made during clinical trials. Patients may continue \ntherapy during periods of reversible, chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression but they should be \nmonitored carefully for complications of neutropenia during this time. Refer to the SmPC for \npaclitaxel, docetaxel or aromatase inhibitor for information on dose reduction or delays. \n \nIf left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) percentage drops \u226510 points from baseline AND to below \n50%, treatment should be suspended and a repeat LVEF assessment performed within approximately \n3 weeks. If LVEF has not improved, or has declined further, or if symptomatic congestive heart \nfailure (CHF) has developed, discontinuation of Trazimera should be strongly considered, unless the \nbenefits for the individual patient are deemed to outweigh the risks. All such patients should be \nreferred for assessment by a cardiologist and followed up. \n \nMissed doses \nIf the patient has missed a dose of Trazimera by one week or less, then the usual maintenance dose \n(weekly regimen: 2 mg/kg; three-weekly regimen: 6 mg/kg) should be administered as soon as \n\n\n\n5  \n\npossible. Do not wait until the next planned cycle. Subsequent maintenance doses should be \nadministered 7 days or 21 days later according to the weekly or three-weekly schedules, respectively. \n \nIf the patient has missed a dose of Trazimera by more than one week, a re-loading dose of Trazimera \nshould be administered over approximately 90 minutes (weekly regimen: 4 mg/kg; three-weekly \nregimen: 8 mg/kg) as soon as possible. Subsequent Trazimera maintenance doses (weekly \nregimen:2 mg/kg; three-weekly regimen 6 mg/kg respectively) should be administered 7 days or \n21 days later according to the weekly or three-weekly schedules respectively. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nDedicated pharmacokinetic studies in the elderly and those with renal or hepatic impairment have \nnot been carried out. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age and renal impairment were not \nshown to affect trastuzumab disposition. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is no relevant use of Trazimera in the paediatric population. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTrazimera is for intravenous use. The loading dose should be administered as a 90-minute \nintravenous infusion. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. Trazimera intravenous \ninfusion should be administered by a healthcare provider prepared to manage anaphylaxis and an \nemergency kit should be available. Patients should be observed for at least six hours after the start of \nthe first infusion and for two hours after the start of the subsequent infusions for symptoms like fever \nand chills or other infusion-related symptoms (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Interruption or slowing the \nrate of the infusion may help control such symptoms. The infusion may be resumed when symptoms \nabate. \n \nIf the initial loading dose was well tolerated, the subsequent doses can be administered as a \n30-minute infusion. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of Trazimera intravenous formulation before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to trastuzumab, murine proteins, or to any of the excipients listed in section \n\n6.1 \n\u2022 Severe dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy or requiring \n\nsupplementary oxygen therapy. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trade name and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nHER2 testing must be performed in a specialised laboratory which can ensure adequate validation of \nthe testing procedures (see section 5.1). \n \nCurrently no data from clinical trials are available on re-treatment of patients with previous exposure \nto trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting. \n \n\n\n\n6  \n\nCardiac dysfunction \n \nGeneral considerations \n \nPatients treated with Trazimera are at increased risk for developing CHF (New York Heart \nAssociation [NYHA] Class II-IV) or asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction. These events have been \nobserved in patients receiving trastuzumab therapy alone or in combination with paclitaxel or \ndocetaxel, particularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin) containing chemotherapy. \nThese may be moderate to severe and have been associated with death (see section 4.8). In addition, \ncaution should be exercised in treating patients with increased cardiac risk, e.g. hypertension, \ndocumented coronary artery disease, CHF, LVEF of <55%, older age. \n \nAll candidates for treatment with Trazimera, but especially those with prior anthracycline and \ncyclophosphamide (AC) exposure, should undergo baseline cardiac assessment including history and \nphysical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, and/or multigated acquisition \n(MUGA) scan or magnetic resonance imaging. Monitoring may help to identify patients who \ndevelop cardiac dysfunction. Cardiac assessments, as performed at baseline, should be repeated \nevery 3 months during treatment and every 6 months following discontinuation of treatment until 24 \nmonths from the last administration of Trazimera. A careful risk-benefit assessment should be made \nbefore deciding to treat with Trazimera. \n \nTrastuzumab may persist in the circulation for up to 7 months after stopping treatment based on \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of all available data (see section 5.2). Patients who receive \nanthracyclines after stopping trastuzumab may possibly be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction. If \npossible, physicians should avoid anthracycline-based therapy for up to 7 months after stopping \ntrastuzumab. If anthracyclines are used, the patient\u2019s cardiac function should be monitored carefully. \n \nFormal cardiological assessment should be considered in patients in whom there are cardiovascular \nconcerns following baseline screening. In all patients cardiac function should be monitored during \ntreatment (e.g. every 12 weeks). Monitoring may help to identify patients who develop cardiac \ndysfunction. Patients who develop asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction may benefit from more \nfrequent monitoring (e.g. every 6 - 8 weeks). If patients have a continued decrease in left ventricular \nfunction, but remain asymptomatic, the physician should consider discontinuing therapy if no \nclinical benefit of trastuzumab therapy has been seen. \n \nThe safety of continuation or resumption of trastuzumab in patients who experience cardiac \ndysfunction has not been prospectively studied. If LVEF percentage drops \u226510 points from baseline \nAND to below 50%, treatment should be suspended and a repeat LVEF assessment performed within \napproximately 3 weeks. If LVEF has not improved, or declined further, or symptomatic CHF has \ndeveloped, discontinuation of trastuzumab should be strongly considered, unless the benefits for the \nindividual patient are deemed to outweigh the risks. All such patients should be referred for \nassessment by a cardiologist and followed up. \n \nIf symptomatic cardiac failure develops during Trazimera therapy, it should be treated with standard \nmedicinal products for CHF. Most patients who developed CHF or asymptomatic cardiac \ndysfunction in pivotal trials improved with standard CHF treatment consisting of an angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and a beta-blocker. The \nmajority of patients with cardiac symptoms and evidence of a clinical benefit of trastuzumab \ntreatment continued on therapy without additional clinical cardiac events. \n \nMetastatic breast cancer \n \nTrazimera and anthracyclines should not be given concurrently in combination in the MBC setting. \n \nPatients with MBC who have previously received anthracyclines are also at risk of cardiac \ndysfunction with Trazimera treatment, although the risk is lower than with concurrent use of \nTrazimera and anthracyclines. \n\n\n\n7  \n\n \nEarly breast cancer \n \nFor patients with EBC, cardiac assessments, as performed at baseline, should be repeated every \n3 months during treatment and every 6 months following discontinuation of treatment until 24 \nmonths from the last administration of Trazimera. In patients who receive anthracycline-containing \nchemotherapy further monitoring is recommended, and should occur yearly up to 5 years from the \nlast administration of Trazimera, or longer if a continuous decrease of LVEF is observed. \n \nPatients with history of myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris requiring medical treatment, \nhistory of or existing CHF (NYHA Class II\u2013IV), LVEF of < 55%, other cardiomyopathy, cardiac \narrhythmia requiring medical treatment, clinically significant cardiac valvular disease, poorly \ncontrolled hypertension (hypertension controlled by standard medical treatment eligible), and \nhemodynamic effective pericardial effusion were excluded from adjuvant and neoadjuvant EBC \npivotal trials with trastuzumab and therefore treatment cannot be recommended in such patients. \n \nAdjuvant treatment \nTrazimera and anthracyclines should not be given concurrently in combination in the adjuvant \ntreatment setting. \n \nIn patients with EBC an increase in the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic cardiac events \nwas observed when trastuzumab was administered after anthracycline-containing chemotherapy \ncompared to administration with a non-anthracycline regimen of docetaxel and carboplatin and was \nmore marked when trastuzumab was administered concurrently with taxanes than when administered \nsequentially to taxanes. Regardless of the regimen used, most symptomatic cardiac events occurred \nwithin the first 18 months. In one of the 3 pivotal studies conducted in which a median follow-up of \n5.5 years was available (BCIRG006) a continuous increase in the cumulative rate of symptomatic \ncardiac or LVEF events was observed in patients who were administered trastuzumab concurrently \nwith a taxane following anthracycline therapy up to 2.37% compared to approximately 1% in the two \ncomparator arms (anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide followed by taxane and taxane, carboplatin \nand trastuzumab). \n \nRisk factors for a cardiac event identified in four large adjuvant studies included advanced age \n(>50 years), low LVEF (<55%) at baseline, prior to or following the initiation of paclitaxel \ntreatment, decline in LVEF by 10-15 points, and prior or concurrent use of anti-hypertensive \nmedicinal products. In patients receiving trastuzumab after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, \nthe risk of cardiac dysfunction was associated with a higher cumulative dose of anthracycline given \nprior to initiation of trastuzumab and a body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m2. \n \nNeoadjuvant-adjuvant treatment \nIn patients with EBC eligible for neoadjuvant-adjuvant treatment, Trazimera should be used \nconcurrently with anthracyclines only in chemotherapy-naive patients and only with low-dose \nanthracycline regimens i.e. maximum cumulative doses of doxorubicin 180 mg/m2 or epirubicin \n360 mg/m2. \n \nIf patients have been treated concurrently with a full course of low-dose anthracyclines and \nTrazimera in the neoadjuvant setting, no additional cytotoxic chemotherapy should be given after \nsurgery. In other situations, the decision on the need for additional cytotoxic chemotherapy is \ndetermined based on individual factors. \n \nExperience of concurrent administration of trastuzumab with low dose anthracycline regimens is \ncurrently limited to two trials (MO16432 and BO22227).  \n \nIn the pivotal trial MO16432, trastuzumab was administered concurrently with neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy containing three cycles of doxorubicin (cumulative dose 180 mg/m2). \n \nThe incidence of symptomatic cardiac dysfunction was 1.7% in the trastuzumab arm. \n\n\n\n8  \n\n \nIn the pivotal trial BO22227, trastuzumab was administered concurrently with neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy that contained four cycles of epirubicin (cumulative dose 300 mg/m2); at a median \nfollow-up exceeding 70 months, the incidence of cardiac failure/congestive cardiac failure was 0.3% \nin the trastuzumab intravenous arm. \n \nClinical experience is limited in patients above 65 years of age. \n \nInfusion-related reactions (IRRs) and hypersensitivity \n \nSerious IRRs to trastuzumab infusion including dyspnoea, hypotension, wheezing, hypertension, \nbronchospasm, supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, reduced oxygen saturation, anaphylaxis, \nrespiratory distress, urticaria and angioedema have been reported (see section 4.8). Pre-medication \nmay be used to reduce risk of occurrence of these events. The majority of these events occur during \nor within 2.5 hours of the start of the first infusion. Should an infusion reaction occur the infusion \nshould be discontinued or the rate of infusion slowed and the patient should be monitored until \nresolution of all observed symptoms (see section 4.2). These symptoms can be treated with an \nanalgesic/antipyretic such as meperidine or paracetamol, or an antihistamine such as \ndiphenhydramine. The majority of patients experienced resolution of symptoms and subsequently \nreceived further infusions of trastuzumab. Serious reactions have been treated successfully with \nsupportive therapy such as oxygen, beta-agonists, and corticosteroids. In rare cases, these reactions \nare associated with a clinical course culminating in a fatal outcome. Patients experiencing dyspnoea \nat rest due to complications of advanced malignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of a \nfatal infusion reaction. Therefore, these patients should not be treated with trastuzumab (see section \n4.3). \n \nInitial improvement followed by clinical deterioration and delayed reactions with rapid clinical \ndeterioration have also been reported. Fatalities have occurred within hours and up to one week \nfollowing infusion. On very rare occasions, patients have experienced the onset of infusion \nsymptoms and pulmonary symptoms more than six hours after the start of the trastuzumab infusion. \nPatients should be warned of the possibility of such a late onset and should be instructed to contact \ntheir physician if these symptoms occur. \n \nPulmonary events \n \nSevere pulmonary events have been reported with the use of trastuzumab in the post-marketing \nsetting (see section 4.8). These events have occasionally been fatal. In addition, cases of interstitial \nlung disease including lung infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonitis, \npleural effusion, respiratory distress, acute pulmonary oedema and respiratory insufficiency have \nbeen reported. Risk factors associated with interstitial lung disease include prior or concomitant \ntherapy with other anti-neoplastic therapies known to be associated with it such as taxanes, \ngemcitabine, vinorelbine and radiation therapy. These events may occur as part of an infusion-related \nreaction or with a delayed onset. Patients experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications of \nadvanced malignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of pulmonary events. Therefore, \nthese patients should not be treated with trastuzumab (see section 4.3). Caution should be exercised \nfor pneumonitis, especially in patients being treated concomitantly with taxanes. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal drug interaction studies have been performed. Clinically significant interactions between \ntrastuzumab and the concomitant medicinal products used in clinical trials have not been observed. \n \nEffect of trastuzumab on the pharmacokinetics of other antineoplastic agents \n \nPharmacokinetic data from studies BO15935 and M77004 in women with HER2-positive MBC \nsuggested that exposure to paclitaxel and doxorubicin (and their major metabolites 6-\u03b1 hydroxyl- \npaclitaxel, POH, and doxorubicinol, DOL) was not altered in the presence of trastuzumab (8 mg/kg \n\n\n\n9  \n\nor 4 mg/kg intravenous loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg q3w or 2 mg/kg q1w intravenous dose, \nrespectively). However, trastuzumab may elevate the overall exposure of one doxorubicin \nmetabolite, (7-deoxy-13 dihydro-doxorubicinone, D7D). The bioactivity of D7D and the clinical \nimpact of the elevation of this metabolite was unclear. \n \nData from study JP16003, a single-arm study of trastuzumab (4 mg/kg intravenous loading dose and \n2 mg/kg intravenous dose weekly) and docetaxel (60 mg/m2 intravenous dose) in Japanese women \nwith HER2-positive MBC, suggested that concomitant administration of trastuzumab had no effect \non the single-dose pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. Study JP19959 was a substudy of BO18255 \n(ToGA) performed in male and female Japanese patients with advanced gastric cancer to study the \npharmacokinetics of capecitabine and cisplatin when used with or without trastuzumab. The results \nof this substudy suggested that the exposure to the bioactive metabolites (e.g. 5-FU) of capecitabine \nwas not affected by concurrent use of cisplatin or by concurrent use of cisplatin plus trastuzumab. \nHowever, capecitabine itself showed higher concentrations and a longer half-life when combined \nwith trastuzumab. The data also suggested that the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin were not affected \nby concurrent use of capecitabine or by concurrent use of capecitabine plus trastuzumab. \n \nPharmacokinetic data from study H4613g/GO01305 in patients with metastatic or locally advanced \ninoperable HER2-positive cancer suggested that trastuzumab had no impact on the PK of \ncarboplatin. \n \nEffect of antineoplastic agents on trastuzumab pharmacokinetics \n \nBy comparison of simulated serum trastuzumab concentrations after trastuzumab monotherapy \n(4 mg/kg loading/2 mg/kg q1w intravenous) and observed serum concentrations in Japanese women \nwith HER2-positive MBC (study JP16003) no evidence of a PK effect of concurrent administration \nof docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab was found. \n \nComparison of PK results from two Phase II studies (BO15935 and M77004) and one Phase III \nstudy (H0648g) in which patients were treated concomitantly with trastuzumab and paclitaxel and \ntwo Phase II studies in which trastuzumab was administered as monotherapy (W016229 and \nMO16982), in women with HER2-positive MBC indicates that individual and mean trastuzumab \ntrough serum concentrations varied within and across studies but there was no clear effect of the \nconcomitant administration of paclitaxel on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab. Comparison of \ntrastuzumab PK data from study M77004 in which women with HER2-positive MBC were treated \nconcomitantly with trastuzumab, paclitaxel and doxorubicin to trastuzumab PK data in studies where \ntrastuzumab was administered as monotherapy (H0649g) or in combination with anthracycline plus \ncyclophosphamide or paclitaxel (study H0648g), suggested no effect of doxorubicin and paclitaxel \non the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab. \n \nPharmacokinetic data from study H4613g/GO01305 suggested that carboplatin had no impact on the \nPK of trastuzumab. \n \nThe administration of concomitant anastrozole did not appear to influence the pharmacokinetics of \ntrastuzumab. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment \nwith Trazimera and for 7 months after treatment has concluded (see section 5.2). \n \nPregnancy \n \nReproduction studies have been conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 25 times that of \nthe weekly human maintenance dose of 2 mg/kg trastuzumab intravenous formulation and have \n\n\n\n10  \n\nrevealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the foetus. Placental transfer of trastuzumab \nduring the early (days 20\u201350 of gestation) and late (days 120\u2013150 of gestation) foetal development \nperiod was observed. It is not known whether trastuzumab can affect reproductive capacity. As \nanimal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, trastuzumab should be \navoided during pregnancy unless the potential benefit for the mother outweighs the potential risk to \nthe foetus. \n \nIn the post-marketing setting, cases of foetal renal growth and/or function impairment in association \nwith oligohydramnios, some associated with fatal pulmonary hypoplasia of the foetus, have been \nreported in pregnant women receiving trastuzumab. Women who become pregnant should be \nadvised of the possibility of harm to the foetus. If a pregnant woman is treated with trastuzumab, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant while receiving trastuzumab or within 7 months following the last dose \nof trastuzumab, close monitoring by a multidisciplinary team is desirable. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nA study conducted in lactating Cynomolgus monkeys at doses 25 times that of the weekly human \nmaintenance dose of 2 mg/kg trastuzumab intravenous formulation demonstrated that trastuzumab is \nsecreted in the milk. The presence of trastuzumab in the serum of infant monkeys was not associated \nwith any adverse effects on their growth or development from birth to 1 month of age. It is not \nknown whether trastuzumab is secreted in human milk. As human IgG1 is secreted into human milk, \nand the potential for harm to the infant is unknown, women should not breast-feed during Trazimera \ntherapy and for 7 months after the last dose. \n \nFertility \n \nThere is no fertility data available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTrazimera may have a minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). \nPatients experiencing infusion-related symptoms (see section 4.4) should be advised not to drive and \nuse machines until symptoms abate. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAmongst the most serious and/or common adverse reactions reported in trastuzumab usage \n(intravenous and subcutaneous formulations) to date are cardiac dysfunction, infusion-related \nreactions, haematotoxicity (in particular neutropenia), infections and pulmonary adverse reactions. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn this section, the following categories of frequency have been used: very common (\u22651/10), \ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare \n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Specific \npercentages for these are not available. \n* Observed with combination therapy following anthracyclines and combined with taxanes \n\n \n\n\n\n14  \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nCardiac dysfunction \n \nCongestive heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV) is a common adverse reaction associated with the use \nof trastuzumab and has been associated with a fatal outcome (see section 4.4). Signs and symptoms \nof cardiac dysfunction such as dyspnoea, orthopnoea, increased cough, pulmonary oedema, S3 \ngallop, or reduced ventricular ejection fraction, have been observed in patients treated with \ntrastuzumab (see section 4.4). \n \nIn 3 pivotal clinical trials of adjuvant trastuzumab given in combination with chemotherapy, the \nincidence of grade 3/4 cardiac dysfunction (specifically symptomatic Congestive Heart Failure) was \nsimilar in patients who were administered chemotherapy alone (i.e. did not receive trastuzumab) and \nin patients who were administered trastuzumab sequentially after a taxane (0.3-0.4%). The rate was \nhighest in patients who were administered trastuzumab concurrently with a taxane (2.0%). In the \nneoadjuvant setting, the experience of concurrent administration of trastuzumab and low dose \nanthracycline regimen is limited (see section 4.4). \n \nWhen trastuzumab was administered after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy NYHA Class III-IV \nheart failure was observed in 0.6% of patients in the one-year arm after a median follow-up of \n12 months. In study BO16348, after a median follow-up of 8 years the incidence of severe CHF \n(NYHA Class III & IV) in the trastuzumab 1 year treatment arm was 0.8%, and the rate of mild \nsymptomatic and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction was 4.6%. \n \nReversibility of severe CHF (defined as a sequence of at least two consecutive LVEF values \u226550% \nafter the event) was evident for 71.4% of trastuzumab-treated patients. Reversibility of mild \nsymptomatic and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction was demonstrated for 79.5% of patients. \nApproximately 17% of cardiac dysfunction related events occurred after completion of trastuzumab. \n \nIn the pivotal metastatic trials of intravenous trastuzumab, the incidence of cardiac dysfunction \nvaried between 9% and 12% when it was combined with paclitaxel compared with 1% \u2013 4% for \npaclitaxel alone. For monotherapy, the rate was 6% \u2013 9%. The highest rate of cardiac dysfunction \nwas seen in patients receiving trastuzumab concurrently with anthracycline/cyclophosphamide \n(27%), and was significantly higher than for anthracycline/cyclophosphamide alone (7% \u2013 10%). In \na subsequent trial with prospective monitoring of cardiac function, the incidence of symptomatic \nCHF was 2.2% in patients receiving trastuzumab and docetaxel, compared with 0% in patients \nreceiving docetaxel alone. Most of the patients (79%) who developed cardiac dysfunction in these \ntrials experienced an improvement after receiving standard treatment for CHF. \n \nInfusion reactions, allergic-like reactions and hypersensitivity \nIt is estimated that approximately 40% of patients who are treated with trastuzumab will experience \nsome form of infusion-related reaction. However, the majority of infusion-related reactions are mild \nto moderate in intensity (NCI-CTC grading system) and tend to occur earlier in treatment, i.e. during \ninfusions one, two and three and lessen in frequency in subsequent infusions. Reactions include \nchills, fever, dyspnoea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen \nsaturation, respiratory distress, rash, nausea, vomiting and headache (see section 4.4). The rate of \ninfusion-related reactions of all grades varied between studies depending on the indication, the data \ncollection methodology, and whether trastuzumab was given concurrently with chemotherapy or as \nmonotherapy. \n \nSevere anaphylactic reactions requiring immediate additional intervention can occur usually during \neither the first or second infusion of trastuzumab (see section 4.4) and have been associated with a \nfatal outcome. \n \nAnaphylactoid reactions have been observed in isolated cases. \n \n\n\n\n15  \n\nHaematotoxicity \nFebrile neutropenia, leukopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred very \ncommonly. The frequency of occurrence of hypoprothrombinaemia is not known. The risk of \nneutropenia may be slightly increased when trastuzumab is administered with docetaxel following \nanthracycline therapy. \n \nPulmonary events \nSevere pulmonary adverse reactions occur in association with the use of trastuzumab and have been \nassociated with a fatal outcome. These include, but are not limited to, pulmonary infiltrates, acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonitis, pleural effusion, respiratory distress, acute \npulmonary oedema and respiratory insufficiency (see section 4.4). \n \nDetails of risk minimisation measures that are consistent with the EU Risk Management Plan are \npresented in (section 4.4) Warnings and Precautions. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nIn the neoadjuvant-adjuvant EBC study (BO22227), at a median follow-up exceeding 70 months, \n10.1% (30/296) of patients treated with trastuzumab intravenous developed antibodies against \ntrastuzumab. Neutralizing anti-trastuzumab antibodies were detected in post-baseline samples in 2 of \n30 patients in the trastuzumab intravenous arm. \n \nThe clinical relevance of these antibodies is not known. The presence of anti-trastuzumab antibodies \nhad no impact on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy (determined by pathological Complete Response \n[pCR] and event free survival [EFS]) and safety determined by occurrence of administration related \nreactions (ARRs) of trastuzumab intravenous. \n \nThere are no immunogenicity data available for trastuzumab in gastric cancer. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no experience with overdose in human clinical trials. Single doses of trastuzumab alone \ngreater than 10 mg/kg have not been administered in the clinical trials; a maintenance dose of 10 \nmg/kg q3w following a loading dose of 8 mg/kg has been studied in a clinical trial with metastatic \ngastric cancer patients. Doses up to this level were well tolerated. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC03  \n \nTrazimera is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nTrastuzumab is a recombinant humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal \ngrowth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Overexpression of HER2 is observed in 20%-30% of primary \nbreast cancers. Studies of HER2-positivity rates in gastric cancer (GC) using immunohistochemistry \n(IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) \nhave shown that there is a broad variation of HER2-positivity ranging from 6.8% to 34.0% for IHC \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n16  \n\nand 7.1% to 42.6% for FISH. Studies indicate that breast cancer patients whose tumours overexpress \nHER2 have a shortened disease-free survival compared to patients whose tumours do not \noverexpress HER2. The extracellular domain of the receptor (ECD, p105) can be shed into the blood \nstream and measured in serum samples. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTrastuzumab binds with high affinity and specificity to sub-domain IV, a juxta-membrane region of \nHER2\u2019s extracellular domain. Binding of trastuzumab to HER2 inhibits ligand-independent HER2 \nsignalling and prevents the proteolytic cleavage of its extracellular domain, an activation mechanism \nof HER2. As a result, trastuzumab has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit \nthe proliferation of human tumour cells that overexpress HER2. Additionally, trastuzumab is a \npotent mediator of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro, trastuzumab-\nmediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells \ncompared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. \n \nDetection of HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification \n \nDetection of HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification in breast cancer \nTrastuzumab should only be used in patients whose tumours have HER2 overexpression or HER2 \ngene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated assay. HER2 overexpression should \nbe detected using an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based assessment of fixed tumour blocks (see \nsection 4.4). HER2 gene amplification should be detected using fluorescence in situ hybridisation \n(FISH) or chromogenic in situ hybridisation (CISH) of fixed tumour blocks. Patients are eligible for \nTrazimera treatment if they show strong HER2 overexpression as described by a 3+ score by IHC or \na positive FISH or CISH result. \n \nTo ensure accurate and reproducible results, the testing must be performed in a specialised \nlaboratory, which can ensure validation of the testing procedures. \n \nThe recommended scoring system to evaluate the IHC staining patterns is as stated in Table 2:  \n \nTable 2 Recommended Scoring System to Evaluate the IHC Staining Patterns in Breast Cancer \n\nScore Staining pattern HER2 overexpression \nassessment \n\n0 No staining is observed or membrane staining is observed \nin <10% of the tumour cells \n\nNegative \n\n1+ A faint/barely perceptible membrane staining is detected \nin >10% of the tumour cells. The cells are only stained in \npart of their membrane. \n\nNegative \n\n2+ A weak to moderate complete membrane staining is \ndetected in >10% of the tumour cells. \n\nEquivocal \n\n3+ Strong complete membrane staining is detected in >10% \nof the tumour cells. \n\nPositive \n\n \nIn general, FISH is considered positive if the ratio of the HER2 gene copy number per tumour cell to \nthe chromosome 17 copy number is greater than or equal to 2, or if there are more than 4 copies of \nthe HER2 gene per tumour cell if no chromosome 17 control is used. \n \nIn general, CISH is considered positive if there are more than 5 copies of the HER2 gene per nucleus \nin greater than 50% of tumour cells. \n \nFor full instructions on assay performance and interpretation please refer to the package inserts of \nvalidated FISH and CISH assays. Official recommendations on HER2 testing may also apply. \n \nFor any other method that may be used for the assessment of HER2 protein or gene expression, the \nanalyses should only be performed by laboratories that provide adequate state-of-the-art performance \n\n\n\n17  \n\nof validated methods. Such methods must clearly be precise and accurate enough to demonstrate \noverexpression of HER2 and must be able to distinguish between moderate (congruent with 2+) and \nstrong (congruent with 3+) overexpression of HER2. \n \nDetection of HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification in gastric cancer \nOnly an accurate and validated assay should be used to detect HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene \namplification. IHC is recommended as the first testing modality and in cases where HER2 gene \namplification status is also required, either a silver-enhanced in situ hybridization (SISH) or a FISH \ntechnique must be applied. SISH technology is however, recommended to allow for the parallel \nevaluation of tumour histology and morphology. To ensure validation of testing procedures and the \ngeneration of accurate and reproducible results, HER2 testing must be performed in a laboratory \nstaffed by trained personnel. Full instructions on assay performance and results interpretation should \nbe taken from the product information leaflet provided with the HER2 testing assays used. \n \nIn the ToGA (BO18255) trial, patients whose tumours were either IHC3+ or FISH positive were \ndefined as HER2-positive and thus included in the trial. Based on the clinical trial results, the \nbeneficial effects were limited to patients with the highest level of HER2 protein overexpression, \ndefined by a 3+ score by IHC, or a 2+ score by IHC and a positive FISH result. \n \nIn a method comparison study (study D008548) a high degree of concordance (>95%) was observed \nfor SISH and FISH techniques for the detection of HER2 gene amplification in gastric cancer \npatients. \n \nHER2 overexpression should be detected using an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based assessment \nof fixed tumour blocks; HER2 gene amplification should be detected using in situ hybridisation \nusing either SISH or FISH on fixed tumour blocks. \n \nThe recommended scoring system to evaluate the IHC staining patterns is as stated in Table 3:  \n \nTable 3 Recommended Scoring System to Evaluate the IHC Staining Patterns in Gastric Cancer \n\nScore Surgical specimen - staining \npattern \n\nBiopsy specimen \u2013 staining \npattern \n\nHER2 \noverexpression \nassessment \n\n0 \nNo reactivity or membranous \nreactivity in <10% of tumour \ncells \n\nNo reactivity or membranous \nreactivity in any tumour cell Negative \n\n1+ \n\nFaint \u2044 barely perceptible \nmembranous reactivity in \u226510% \nof tumour cells; cells are \nreactive only in part of their \nmembrane \n\nTumour cell cluster with a faint \u2044 \nbarely perceptible membranous \nreactivity irrespective of \npercentage of tumour cells stained \n\nNegative \n\n2+ \n\nWeak to moderate complete, \nbasolateral or lateral \nmembranous reactivity in \u226510% \nof tumour cells \n\nTumour cell cluster with a weak to \nmoderate complete, basolateral or \nlateral membranous reactivity \nirrespective of percentage of \ntumour cells stained \n\nEquivocal \n\n3+ \n\nStrong complete, basolateral or \nlateral membranous reactivity in \n\u226510% of tumour cells \n\nTumour cell cluster with a strong \ncomplete, basolateral or lateral \nmembranous reactivity irrespective \nof percentage of tumour cells \nstained \n\nPositive \n\n \nIn general, SISH or FISH is considered positive if the ratio of the HER2 gene copy number per \ntumour cell to the chromosome 17 copy number is greater than or equal to 2. \n \n\n\n\n18  \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nMetastatic breast cancer \n \nTrastuzumab has been used in clinical trials as monotherapy for patients with MBC who have \ntumours that overexpress HER2 and who have failed one or more chemotherapy regimens for their \nmetastatic disease (trastuzumab alone). \n \nTrastuzumab has also been used in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel for the treatment of \npatients who have not received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. Patients who had \npreviously received anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy were treated with paclitaxel \n(175 mg/m2 infused over 3 hours) with or without trastuzumab. In the pivotal trial of docetaxel \n(100 mg/m2 infused over 1 hour) with or without trastuzumab, 60% of the patients had received prior \nanthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were treated with trastuzumab until \nprogression of disease. \n \nThe efficacy of trastuzumab in combination with paclitaxel in patients who did not receive prior \nadjuvant anthracyclines has not been studied. However, trastuzumab plus docetaxel was efficacious \nin patients whether or not they had received prior adjuvant anthracyclines. \n \nThe test method for HER2 overexpression used to determine eligibility of patients in the pivotal \ntrastuzumab monotherapy and trastuzumab plus paclitaxel clinical trials employed \nimmunohistochemical staining for HER2 of fixed material from breast tumours using the murine \nmonoclonal antibodies CB11 and 4D5. These tissues were fixed in formalin or Bouin\u2019s fixative. This \ninvestigative clinical trial assay performed in a central laboratory utilised a 0 to 3+ scale. Patients \nclassified as staining 2+ or 3+ were included, while those staining 0 or 1+ were excluded. Greater \nthan 70% of patients enrolled exhibited 3+ overexpression. The data suggest that beneficial effects \nwere greater among those patients with higher levels of overexpression of HER2 (3+). \n \nThe main test method used to determine HER2 positivity in the pivotal trial of docetaxel, with or \nwithout trastuzumab, was immunohistochemistry. A minority of patients was tested using \nfluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH). In this trial, 87% of patients entered had disease that was \nIHC3+, and 95% of patients entered had disease that was IHC3+ and/or FISH-positive. \n \nWeekly dosing in metastatic breast cancer \nThe efficacy results from the monotherapy and combination therapy studies are summarised in Table \n4: \n \nTable 4 Efficacy Results from the Monotherapy and Combination Therapy Studies \n\nParameter Monotherapy Combination Therapy \n Trastuzumab1 \n\n \nN=172 \n\nTrastuzumab \nplus \n\npaclitaxel2  \nN=68 \n\nPaclitaxel2 \n \n\nN=77 \n\nTrastuzumab \nplus docetaxel3  \n\nN=92 \n\nDocetaxel3 \n \n\nN=94 \n\nResponse \nrate (95% \nCI) \n\n18% 49% 17% 61% 34% \n(13-25) (36-61) (9-27) (50-71) (25-45) \n\nMedian \nduration of \nresponse \n(months) \n(95% CI) \n\n9.1 8.3 4.6 11.7 5.7 \n(5.6-10.3) (7.3-8.8) (3.7-7.4) (9.3-15.0) (4.6-7.6) \n\nMedian TTP \n(months) \n(95% CI) \n\n3.2 7.1 3.0 11.7 6.1 \n(2.6-3.5) (6.2-12.0) (2.0-4.4) (9.2-13.5) (5.4-7.2) \n\n\n\n19  \n\nParameter Monotherapy Combination Therapy \n Trastuzumab1 \n\n \nN=172 \n\nTrastuzumab \nplus \n\npaclitaxel2  \nN=68 \n\nPaclitaxel2 \n \n\nN=77 \n\nTrastuzumab \nplus docetaxel3  \n\nN=92 \n\nDocetaxel3 \n \n\nN=94 \n\nMedian \nSurvival \n(months) \n(95% CI) \n\n16.4 24.8 17.9 31.2 22.74 \n(12.3-ne) (18.6-33.7) (11.2-23.8) (27.3-40.8) (19.1-30.8) \n\nTTP = time to progression; \"ne\" indicates that it could not be estimated or it was not yet reached. \n1.

In addition, comparison of two \nyears of trastuzumab treatment versus one year of trastuzumab treatment was performed. \nPatients assigned to receive trastuzumab were given an initial loading dose of 8 mg/kg, \nfollowed by 6 mg/kg every three weeks for either one or two years. \n\n- The NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 studies that comprise the joint analysis were designed \nto investigate the clinical utility of combining trastuzumab treatment with paclitaxel following \nAC chemotherapy, additionally the NCCTG N9831 study also investigated adding \ntrastuzumab sequentially to AC\u2192P chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive EBC \nfollowing surgery. \n\n- The BCIRG 006 study was designed to investigate combining trastuzumab treatment with \ndocetaxel either following AC chemotherapy or in combination with docetaxel and carboplatin \nin patients with HER2-positive EBC following surgery. \n\n \nEarly breast cancer in the HERA trial was limited to operable, primary, invasive adenocarcinoma of \nthe breast, with axillary nodes positive or axillary nodes negative if tumours at least 1 cm in \ndiameter. \n \nIn the joint analysis of the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 studies, EBC was limited to women \nwith operable breast cancer at high risk, defined as HER2-positive and axillary lymph node positive \nor HER2-positive and lymph node negative with high risk features (tumour size > 1 cm and ER \nnegative or tumour size >2 cm, regardless of hormonal status). \n \nIn the BCIRG 006 study HER2-positive EBC was defined as either lymph node positive or high risk \nnode negative patients with no (pN0) lymph node involvement, and at least 1 of the following \nfactors: tumour size greater than 2 cm, oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor negative, \nhistological and/or nuclear grade 2-3, or age <35 years. \n \nThe efficacy results from the BO16348 trial following 12 months* and 8 years** median follow-up \nare summarized in Table 6: \n \nTable 6 Efficacy Results from Study BO16348 \n\n Median follow-up 12 months* Median follow-up 8 years** \nParameter Observation \n\nN=1693 \nTrastuzumab \n\n1 Year \nN=1693 \n\nObservation \nN=1697*** \n\nTrastuzumab \n1 Year \n\nN=1702*** \nDisease-free survival   \n- No. patients with event 219 (12.9%) 127 (7.5%) 570 (33.6%) 471 (27.7%) \n- No. patients without event 1474 (87.1%) 1566 \n\n(92.5%) \n1127 (66.4%) 1231 (72.3%) \n\nP-value versus Observation < 0.0001 < 0.0001 \nHazard Ratio versus \nObservation \n\n0.54 0.76 \n\nRecurrence-free survival   \n- No. patients with event 208 (12.3%) 113 (6.7%) 506 (29.8%) 399 (23.4%) \n- No. patients without event 1485 (87.7%) 1580 \n\n(93.3%) \n1191 (70.2%) 1303 (76.6%) \n\nP-value versus Observation < 0.0001 < 0.0001 \n\n\n\n21  \n\n Median follow-up 12 months* Median follow-up 8 years** \nParameter Observation \n\nN=1693 \nTrastuzumab \n\n1 Year \nN=1693 \n\nObservation \nN=1697*** \n\nTrastuzumab \n1 Year \n\nN=1702*** \nHazard Ratio versus \nObservation \n\n0.51 0.73 \n\nDistant disease-free survival   \n- No. patients with event 184 (10.9%) 99 (5.8%) 488 (28.8%) 399 (23.4%) \n- No. patients without event 1508 (89.1%) 1594 \n\n(94.6%) \n1209 (71.2%) 1303 (76.6%) \n\nP-value versus Observation < 0.0001 < 0.0001 \nHazard Ratio versus \nObservation \n\n0.50 0.76 \n\nOverall survival (death)   \n- No. patients with event 40 (2.4%) 31 (1.8%) 350 (20.6%) 278 (16.3%) \n- No. patients without event 1653 (97.6%) 1662 \n\n(98.2%) \n1347 (79.4%) 1424 (83.7%) \n\nP-value versus Observation 0.24 0.0005 \nHazard Ratio versus \nObservation \n\n0.75 0.76 \n\n*Co-primary endpoint of DFS of 1 year versus observation met the pre-defined statistical boundary \n**Final analysis (including crossover of 52% of patients from the observation arm to trastuzumab) \n***There is a discrepancy in the overall sample size due to a small number of patients who were randomized \nafter the cut-off date for the 12-month median follow-up analysis \n \nThe efficacy results from the interim efficacy analysis crossed the protocol pre-specified statistical \nboundary for the comparison of 1-year of trastuzumab versus observation. After a median follow-up \nof 12 months, the hazard ratio (HR) for disease free survival (DFS) was 0.54 (95% CI 0.44, 0.67) \nwhich translates into an absolute benefit, in terms of a 2-year disease-free survival rate, of 7.6 \npercentage points (85.8% versus 78.2%) in favour of the trastuzumab arm. \n \nA final analysis was performed after a median follow-up of 8 years, which showed that 1 year \ntrastuzumab treatment is associated with a 24% risk reduction compared to observation only \n(HR=0.76, 95% CI 0.67, 0.86). This translates into an absolute benefit in terms of an 8 year disease \nfree survival rate of 6.4 percentage points in favour of 1 year trastuzumab treatment. \n \nIn this final analysis, extending trastuzumab treatment for a duration of two years did not show \nadditional benefit over treatment for 1 year [DFS HR in the intent to treat (ITT) population of 2 years \nversus 1 year=0.99 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.13), p-value=0.90 and OS HR=0.98 (0.83, 1.15); p-value=0.78]. \nThe rate of asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction was increased in the 2-year treatment arm (8.1% \nversus 4.6% in the 1-year treatment arm). More patients experienced at least one grade 3 or 4 adverse \nevent in the 2-year treatment arm (20.4%) compared with the 1-year treatment arm (16.3%). \n \nIn the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 studies trastuzumab was administered in combination with \npaclitaxel, following AC chemotherapy. \n \nDoxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were administered concurrently as follows: \n \n- intravenous push doxorubicin, at 60 mg/m2, given every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. \n \n- intravenous cyclophosphamide, at 600 mg/m2 over 30 minutes, given every 3 weeks for \n\n4 cycles. \n \nPaclitaxel, in combination with trastuzumab, was administered as follows: \n \n- intravenous paclitaxel - 80 mg/m2 as a continuous intravenous infusion, given every week for \n\n12 weeks. \n\n\n\n22  \n\nor \n- intravenous paclitaxel - 175 mg/m2 as a continuous intravenous infusion, given every 3 weeks \n\nfor 4 cycles (day 1 of each cycle). \n \nThe efficacy results from the joint analysis of the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG 9831 trials at the time \nof the definitive analysis of DFS* are summarized in Table 7.

For overall survival, the HR was 0.75 (95% CI 0.51-1.11) \nin the IHC2+/FISH+ group and the HR was 0.58 (95% CI 0.41-0.81) in the IHC3+/FISH+ group. \n \nIn an exploratory subgroup analysis performed in the TOGA (BO18255) trial there was no apparent \nbenefit on overall survival with the addition of trastuzumab in patients with ECOG PS 2 at baseline \n[HR 0.96 (95% CI 0.51-1.79)], non measurable [HR 1.78 (95% CI 0.87-3.66)] and locally advanced \ndisease [HR 1.20 (95% CI 0.29-4.97)]. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \ntrastuzumab in all subsets of the paediatric population for breast and gastric cancer (see section 4.2 \nfor information on paediatric use). \n \n\n\n\n27  \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab were evaluated in a population pharmacokinetic model \nanalysis using pooled data from 1,582 subjects, including patients with HER2-positive MBC, EBC, \nAGC or other tumour types, and healthy volunteers, in 18 Phase I, II and III trials receiving \nintravenous trastuzumab. A two-compartment model with parallel linear and non-linear elimination \nfrom the central compartment described the trastuzumab concentration-time profile. Due to non-\nlinear elimination, total clearance increased with decreasing concentration. Therefore, no constant \nvalue for half-life of trastuzumab can be deduced. The t1/2 decreases with decreasing concentrations \nwithin a dosing interval (see Table 16). MBC and EBC patients had similar PK parameters (e.g. \nclearance (CL), the central compartment volume (Vc)) and population-predicted steady-state \nexposures (Cmin, Cmax and AUC). Linear clearance was 0.136 L/day for MBC, 0.112 L/day for EBC \nand 0.176 L/day for AGC. The non-linear elimination parameter values were 8.81 mg/day for the \nmaximum elimination rate (Vmax) and 8.92 \u00b5g/mL for the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) for the \nMBC, EBC, and AGC patients. The central compartment volume was 2.62 L for patients with MBC \nand EBC and 3.63 L for patients with AGC. \n \nIn the final population PK model, in addition to primary tumour type, body-weight, serum aspartate \naminotransferase and albumin were identified as a statistically significant covariates affecting the \nexposure of trastuzumab. However, the magnitude of effect of these covariates on trastuzumab \nexposure suggests that these covariates are unlikely to have a clinically meaningful effect on \ntrastuzumab concentrations. \n \nThe population predicted PK exposure values (median with 5th - 95th Percentiles) and PK parameter \nvalues at clinically relevant concentrations (Cmax and Cmin) for MBC, EBC and AGC patients treated \nwith the approved q1w and q3w dosing regimens are shown in Table 14 (Cycle 1), Table 15 \n(steady-state), and Table 16 (PK parameters). \n \nTable 14 Population Predicted Cycle 1 PK Exposure Values (Median with 5th - 95th Percentiles) for \nTrastuzumab Intravenous Dosing Regimens in MBC, EBC and AGC Patients \n\nRegimen Primary tumour type N \nCmin \n\n(\u00b5g/mL) Cmax (\u00b5g/mL) \nAUC0-21days \n\n(\u00b5g.day/mL) \n\n8 mg/kg + \n6 mg/kg \n\nq3w \n\nMBC 805 28.7 (2.9 - 46.3) \n182 \n\n(134 - 280) \n1376 \n\n(728 - 1998) \n\nEBC 390 30.9 (18.7 - 45.5) \n176 \n\n(127 - 227) \n1390 \n\n(1039 - 1895) \n\nAGC 274 23.1 (6.1 - 50.3) \n132 \n\n(84.2 - 225) \n1109 \n\n(588 - 1938) \n\n4 mg/kg + \n2 mg/kg qw \n\nMBC 805 37.4 (8.7 - 58.9) \n76.5 \n\n(49.4 - 114) \n1073 \n\n(597 - 1584) \n\nEBC 390 38.9 (25.3 - 58.8) \n76.0 \n\n(54.7 - 104) \n1074 \n\n(783 - 1502) \n \nTable 15 Population Predicted Steady State PK Exposure Values (Median with 5th - 95th \nPercentiles) for Trastuzumab Intravenous Dosing Regimens in MBC, EBC and AGC Patients \n\nRegimen \nPrimary \ntumour \n\ntype \nN Cmin,ss* (\u00b5g/mL) \n\nCmax,ss** \n(\u00b5g/mL) \n\nAUCss, 0-21days \n(\u00b5g.day/mL) \n\nTime to \nsteady-\nstate*** \n(week) \n\n8 mg/kg + \n6 mg/kg \n\nq3w \n\nMBC 805 44.2 (1.8 - 85.4) \n179 \n\n(123 - 266) \n1736 \n\n(618 - 2756) 12 \n\nEBC 390 53.8 (28.7 - 85.8) \n184 \n\n(134 - 247) \n\n1927 \n(1332 - \n2771) \n\n15 \n\nAGC 274 32.9 (6.1 - 88.9) \n131 \n\n(72.5 - 251) \n1338 \n\n(557 - 2875) 9 \n\n\n\n28  \n\nRegimen \nPrimary \ntumour \n\ntype \nN Cmin,ss* (\u00b5g/mL) \n\nCmax,ss** \n(\u00b5g/mL) \n\nAUCss, 0-21days \n(\u00b5g.day/mL) \n\nTime to \nsteady-\nstate*** \n(week) \n\n4 mg/kg + \n2 mg/kg \n\nqw \n\nMBC 805 63.1 (11.7 - 107) \n107 \n\n(54.2 - 164) \n1710 \n\n(581 - 2715) 12 \n\nEBC 390 72.6 (46 - 109) \n115 \n\n(82.6 - 160) \n\n1893 \n(1309 - \n2734) \n\n14 \n\n*Cmin,ss = Cmin at steady state \n**Cmax,ss = Cmax at steady state \n***time to 90% of steady-state \n \nTable 16 Population Predicted PK Parameter Values at Steady State for Trastuzumab Intravenous \nDosing Regimens in MBC, EBC and AGC Patients \n\nRegimen Primary tumour type N \n\nTotal CL range \nfrom Cmax,ss to \n\nCmin,ss \n(L/day) \n\nt1/2 range from Cmax,ss to \nCmin,ss \n(day) \n\n8 mg/kg + 6 mg/kg \nq3w \n\nMBC 805 0.183 - 0.302 15.1 - 23.3 \nEBC 390 0.158 - 0.253 17.5 - 26.6 \nAGC 274 0.189 - 0.337 12.6 - 20.6 \n\n4 mg/kg + 2 mg/kg \nqw \n\nMBC 805 0.213 - 0.259 17.2 - 20.4 \nEBC 390 0.184 - 0.221 19.7 - 23.2 \n\n \nTrastuzumab washout \n \nTrastuzumab washout period was assessed following q1w or q3w intravenous administration using \nthe population PK model.

Trastuzumab is not genotoxic.  \n \nNo long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of \ntrastuzumab, or to determine its effects on fertility in males. \n \n \n6.

Any remaining reconstituted solution should be \ndiscarded. \n \nAfter aseptic dilution in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, solutions of \nTrazimera for intravenous infusion are physically and chemically stable in polyvinylchloride, \npolyethylene, polypropylene or ethylene vinyl acetate bags, or glass intravenous bottles for up to \n30 days at 2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C, and 24 hours at temperatures not exceeding 30\u00b0C. \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the reconstituted solution and Trazimera infusion solution \nshould be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the \nresponsibility of the user and would not normally be longer than 24 hours at 2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C, unless \nreconstitution and dilution have taken place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C). \n \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \n \nUnopened vials of Trazimera may be stored up to 30\u00b0C for a single period of up to 3 months. Upon \nremoval from refrigerated storage, Trazimera must not be returned to refrigerated storage. Discard at \nthe end of this 3-month period or by the expiry date on the vial, whichever occurs first. Record the \n\u201cdiscard by\u201d date in the date field provided on the carton. \n \nFor storage conditions of the reconstituted medicinal product, see sections 6.3 and 6.6. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nTrazimera 150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n15 mL clear glass type I vial with butyl rubber stopper laminated with a fluoro-resin film containing \n150 mg of trastuzumab. \n \nEach carton contains one vial. \n \n\n\n\n30  \n\nTrazimera 420 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n30 mL clear glass type I vial with butyl rubber stopper laminated with a fluoro-resin film containing \n420 mg of trastuzumab. \n \nEach carton contains one vial. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nTrazimera is provided in sterile, preservative-free, non-pyrogenic, single use vials.  \n \nAppropriate aseptic technique should be used for reconstitution and dilution procedures. Care must \nbe taken to ensure the sterility of prepared solutions. Since the medicinal product does not contain \nany anti-microbial preservative or bacteriostatic agents, aseptic technique must be observed.  \n \nAseptic preparation, handling and storage \n \nAseptic handling must be ensured when preparing the infusion. Preparation should be:  \n\u2022 performed under aseptic conditions by trained personnel in accordance with good practice \n\nrules especially with respect to the aseptic preparation of parenteral products.  \n\u2022 prepared in a laminar flow hood or biological safety cabinet using standard precautions for the \n\nsafe handling of intravenous agents.  \n\u2022 followed by adequate storage of the prepared solution for intravenous infusion to ensure \n\nmaintenance of the aseptic conditions. \n \nTrazimera should be carefully handled during reconstitution. Causing excessive foaming during \nreconstitution or shaking the reconstituted solution may result in problems with the amount of \nTrazimera that can be withdrawn from the vial. \n \nThe reconstituted solution should not be frozen. \n \nTrazimera 150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \nAppropriate aseptic technique should be used. Each 150 mg vial of Trazimera is reconstituted with \n7.2 mL of sterile water for injections (not supplied). Use of other reconstitution solvents should be \navoided. \n \nThis yields a 7.4 mL solution for single-dose use, containing approximately 21 mg/mL trastuzumab, \nat a pH of approximately 6.0. An overfill of 4% ensures that the labelled dose of 150 mg can be \nwithdrawn from each vial. \n \nTrazimera 420 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \nAppropriate aseptic technique should be used. Each 420 mg vial of Trazimera is reconstituted with \n20 mL of sterile water for injections (not supplied). Use of other reconstitution solvents should be \navoided. \n \nThis yields a 20.6 mL solution for single-dose use, containing approximately 21 mg/mL \ntrastuzumab, at a pH of approximately 6.0. An overfill of 5% ensures that the labelled dose of \n420 mg can be withdrawn from each vial. \n \n\nTrazimera vial  \nVolume of sterile water \n\nfor injections  Final concentration \n150 mg vial + 7.2 mL = 21 mg/mL \n420 mg vial + 20 mL = 21 mg/mL \n\n \n\n\n\n31  \n\nInstructions for aseptic reconstitution \n \n1) Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject the appropriate volume (as noted above) of sterile water \n\nfor injections in the vial containing the lyophilised Trazimera, directing the stream into the \nlyophilised cake. \n\n2) Swirl the vial gently to aid reconstitution. DO NOT SHAKE! \n \nSlight foaming of the product upon reconstitution is not unusual. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed \nfor approximately 5 minutes. The reconstituted Trazimera results in a colourless to pale \nbrownish-yellow transparent solution and should be essentially free of visible particulates. \n \nDetermine the volume of the solution required: \n\n\u2022 based on a loading dose of 4 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent weekly \ndose of 2 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight: \n\n \nVolume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (4 mg/kg for loading or 2 mg/kg for maintenance)  \n\n21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution) \n \n\n\u2022 based on a loading dose of 8 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent 3-weekly \ndose of 6 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight: \n\n \nVolume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (8 mg/kg for loading or 6 mg/kg for maintenance)  \n\n21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution) \n \nThe appropriate amount of solution should be withdrawn from the vial and added to an infusion bag \nor bottle containing 250 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution. Do not use with \nglucose-containing solutions (see section 6.2). The bag or bottle should be gently inverted to mix the \nsolution in order to avoid foaming.  \n \nParenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration \nprior to administration. \n \nNo incompatibilities between Trazimera and polyvinylchloride, polyethylene, polypropylene or \nethylene vinyl acetate bags or with glass intravenous bottles have been observed. \n \nTrazimera is for single-use only, as the product contains no preservatives. Any unused medicinal \nproduct or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \n \n7.

What Trazimera is and what it is used for \n \nTrazimera contains the active substance trastuzumab, which is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal \nantibodies attach to specific proteins or antigens. Trastuzumab is designed to bind selectively to an \nantigen called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). HER2 is found in large amounts \non the surface of some cancer cells where it stimulates their growth. When Trazimera binds to HER2 \nit stops the growth of such cells and causes them to die. \n \nYour doctor may prescribe Trazimera for the treatment of breast and gastric cancer when: \n\u2022 You have early breast cancer, with high levels of a protein called HER2.  \n\n \n\u2022 You have metastatic breast cancer (breast cancer that has spread beyond the original tumour) \n\nwith high levels of HER2. Trazimera may be prescribed in combination with the \nchemotherapy medicine paclitaxel or docetaxel as first treatment for metastatic breast cancer \nor it may be prescribed alone if other treatments have proved unsuccessful. It is also used in \ncombination with medicines called aromatase inhibitors with patients with high levels of \nHER2 and hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (cancer that is sensitive to the \npresence of female sex hormones).  \n \n\n\u2022 You have metastatic gastric cancer with high levels of HER2, when it is in combination with \nthe other cancer medicines capecitabine or 5-flououracil and cisplatin. \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Trazimera \n \nDo not use Trazimera if \n\u2022 you are allergic to trastuzumab, to murine (mouse) proteins, or to any of the other ingredients \n\nof this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \n\n\u2022 you have severe breathing problems at rest due to your cancer or if you need oxygen \ntreatment. \n\n\n\n47  \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nYour doctor will closely supervise your therapy. \n \nHeart checks \nTreatment with Trazimera alone or with a taxane may affect the heart, especially if you have ever \nused an anthracycline (taxanes and anthracyclines are two other kinds of medicine used to treat \ncancer). The effects may be moderate to severe and could cause death. Therefore, your heart function \nwill be checked before, during (every three months) and after (up to two to five years) treatment with \nTrazimera. If you develop any signs of heart failure (inadequate pumping of blood by the heart), \nyour heart function may be checked more frequently (every six to eight weeks), you may receive \ntreatment for heart failure or you may have to stop Trazimera treatment. \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Trazimera if: \n \n\u2022 you have had heart failure, coronary artery disease, heart valve disease (heart murmurs), high \n\nblood pressure, taken any high blood pressure medicine or are currently taking any high blood \npressure medicine. \n\n \n\u2022 you have ever had or are currently using a medicine called doxorubicin or epirubicin \n\n(medicines used to treat cancer). These medicines (or any other anthracyclines) can damage \nheart muscle and increase the risk of heart problems with Trazimera. \n\n \n\u2022 you suffer from breathlessness, especially if you are currently using a taxane. Trazimera can \n\ncause breathing difficulties, especially when it is first given. This could be more serious if you \nare already breathless. Very rarely, patients with severe breathing difficulties before treatment \nhave died when they were given Trazimera. \n\n \n\u2022 you have ever had any other treatment for cancer. \n \nIf you receive Trazimera with any other medicine to treat cancer, such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, an \naromatase inhibitor, capecitabine, 5-fluorouracil, or cisplatin you should also read the patient \ninformation leaflets for these products. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nTrazimera is not recommended for anyone under the age of 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Trazimera \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or may take any other \nmedicines. \n \nIt may take up to 7 months for Trazimera to be removed from the body. Therefore you should tell \nyour doctor, pharmacist or nurse that you have had Trazimera if you start any new medicine in the \n7 months after stopping treatment. \n \nPregnancy \n\u2022 If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \n\ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine.  \n \n\n\u2022 You should use effective contraception during treatment with Trazimera and for at least \n7 months after treatment has ended.  \n \n\n\u2022 Your doctor will advise you of the risks and benefits of taking Trazimera during pregnancy. In \nrare cases, a reduction in the amount of (amniotic) fluid that surrounds the developing baby \nwithin the womb has been observed in pregnant women receiving Trazimera. This condition \n\n\n\n48  \n\nmay be harmful to your baby in the womb and has been associated with the lungs not \ndeveloping fully resulting in foetal death. \n\n \nBreast-feeding \nDo not breast-feed your baby during Trazimera therapy and for 7 months after the last dose of \nTrazimera as Trazimera may pass to your baby through your breast milk. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTrazimera may affect your ability to drive a car or operate machines. If during treatment you \nexperience symptoms, such as chills or fever, you should not drive or use machines until these \nsymptoms disappear. \n \n \n3. How Trazimera is given \n \nBefore starting the treatment your doctor will determine the amount of HER2 in your tumour. Only \npatients with a large amount of HER2 will be treated with Trazimera. Trazimera should only be \ngiven by a doctor or nurse. Your doctor will prescribe a dose and treatment regimen that is right for \nyou. The dose of Trazimera depends on your body weight. \n \nTrazimera intravenous formulation is not for subcutaneous use and should be given as an intravenous \ninfusion only. \n \nTrazimera intravenous formulation is given as an intravenous infusion (\u201cdrip\u201d) directly into your \nveins. The first dose of your treatment is given over 90 minutes and you will be observed by a health \nprofessional while it is being given in case you have any side effects. If the first dose is well \ntolerated the next doses may be given over 30 minutes (see section 2 under \u201cWarnings and \nprecautions\u201d). The number of infusions you receive will depend on how you respond to the \ntreatment. Your doctor will discuss this with you. \n \nIn order to prevent medication errors it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the \nmedicine being prepared and given is Trazimera (trastuzumab) and not trastuzumab emtansine. \n \nFor early breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer, Trazimera is given \nevery 3 weeks. Trazimera may also be given once a week for metastatic breast cancer. \n \nIf you stop using Trazimera \nDo not stop using this medicine without talking to your doctor first. All doses should be taken at the \nright time every week or every three weeks (depending on your dosing schedule). This helps your \nmedicine work as well as it can. \n \nIt may take up to 7 months for Trazimera to be removed from your body. Therefore your doctor may \ndecide to continue to check your heart functions, even after you finish treatment. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Trazimera can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Some of \nthese side effects may be serious and may lead to hospitalisation. \n \nDuring a Trazimera infusion, chills, fever and other flu like symptoms may occur. These are very \ncommon (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). Other infusion-related symptoms are: feeling sick \n(nausea), vomiting, pain, increased muscle tension and shaking, headache, dizziness, breathing \n\n\n\n49  \n\ndifficulties, wheezing, high or low blood pressure, heart rhythm disturbances (palpitations, heart \nfluttering or irregular heart beat), swelling of the face and lips, rash and feeling tired. Some of these \nsymptoms can be serious and some patients have died (see section 2 under \u201cWarnings and \nprecautions\u201d). \n \nThese effects mainly occur with the first intravenous infusion (\u201cdrip\u201d into your vein) and during the \nfirst few hours after the start of the infusion. They are usually temporary. You will be observed by a \nhealthcare professional during the infusion and for at least six hours after the start of the first \ninfusion and for two hours after the start of other infusions. If you develop a reaction, they will slow \ndown or stop the infusion and may give you treatment to counteract the side effects. The infusion \nmay be continued after the symptoms improve. \n \nOccasionally, symptoms start later than six hours after the infusion begins. If this happens to you, \ncontact your doctor immediately. Sometimes, symptoms may improve and then get worse later. \n \nSerious side effects \nOther side effects can occur at any time during treatment with Trazimera, not just related to an \ninfusion. Tell a doctor or nurse straight away, if you notice any of the following side effects: \n \n\u2022 Heart problems can sometimes occur during treatment and occasionally after treatment has \n\nstopped and can be serious. They include weakening of the heart muscle possibly leading to \nheart failure, inflammation of the lining around the heart and heart rhythm disturbances. This \ncan lead to symptoms such as breathlessness (including breathlessness at night), cough, fluid \nretention (swelling) in the legs or arms, and palpitations (heart fluttering or irregular heart \nbeat) (see section 2 under \u201cHeart checks\u201d). \n\n \nYour doctor will monitor your heart regularly during and after treatment but you should tell your \ndoctor immediately if you notice any of the above symptoms. \n \n\u2022 Tumour lysis syndrome (a group of metabolic complications occurring after cancer treatment \n\ncharacterised by high blood levels of potassium and phosphate, and low blood levels of \ncalcium). Symptoms may include kidney problems (weakness, shortness of breath, fatigue and \nconfusion), heart problems (fluttering of the heart of a faster or slower heartbeat), seizures, \nvomiting or diarrhoea, and tingling in the mouth, hands or feet. \n\n \nIf you experience any of the above symptoms when your treatment with Trazimera has finished, you \nshould see your doctor and tell them that you have previously been treated with Trazimera. \n \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n \n\u2022 infections \n\u2022 diarrhoea \n\u2022 constipation \n\u2022 heartburn (dyspepsia) \n\u2022 fatigue \n\u2022 skin rashes \n\u2022 chest pain \n\u2022 abdominal pain \n\u2022 joint pain \n\u2022 low counts of red blood cells and white blood cells (which help fight infection) sometimes \n\nwith fever \n\u2022 muscle pain \n\u2022 conjunctivitis \n\u2022 watery eyes \n\u2022 nose bleeds \n\u2022 runny nose \n\u2022 hair loss \n\n\n\n50  \n\n\u2022 tremor \n\u2022 hot flush \n\u2022 dizziness \n\u2022 nail disorders \n\u2022 weight loss \n\u2022 loss of appetite \n\u2022 inability to sleep (insomnia) \n\u2022 altered taste \n\u2022 low platelet count \n\u2022 bruising \n\u2022 numbness or tingling of the fingers and toes \n\u2022 redness, swelling or sores in your mouth and/or throat \n\u2022 pain, swelling, redness or tingling of hands and/or feet \n\u2022 breathlessness \n\u2022 headache \n\u2022 cough \n\u2022 vomiting \n\u2022 nausea \n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n \n\u2022 allergic reactions \u2022 dry eyes  \n\u2022 throat infections \u2022 sweating   \n\u2022 bladder and skin infections \u2022 feeling weak and unwell   \n\u2022 shingles \u2022 anxiety \n\u2022 inflammation of the breast \u2022 depression \n\u2022 inflammation of the liver \u2022 abnormal thinking \n\u2022 kidney disorders \u2022 asthma   \n\u2022 increased muscle tone or tension  \u2022 infection of lungs \n\u2022 (hypertonia) \u2022 lung disorders \n\u2022 pain in the arms and/or legs \u2022 back pain \n\u2022 itchy rash \u2022 neck pain \n\u2022 sleepiness (somnolence) \u2022 bone pain \n\u2022 haemorrhoids \u2022 acne \n\u2022 itchiness \u2022 leg cramps  \n\u2022 dry mouth and skin \n \nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n \n\u2022 deafness \n\u2022 bumpy rash \n\u2022 blood infection \n \nRare: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people \n \n\u2022 muscle weakness \n\u2022 jaundice \n\u2022 inflammation or scarring of the lungs \n \nNot known: frequency cannot be estimated from the available data \n \n\u2022 abnormal or impaired blood clotting \n\u2022 anaphylactic reactions \n\u2022 high potassium levels \n\u2022 swelling of the brain \n\u2022 swelling or bleeding at the back of the eyes \n\u2022 shock \n\n\n\n51  \n\n\u2022 swelling of the lining of the heart \n\u2022 slow heart rate \n\u2022 abnormal heart rhythm \n\u2022 respiratory distress \n\u2022 respiratory failure \n\u2022 acute accumulation of fluid in the lungs \n\u2022 acute narrowing of the airways \n\u2022 abnormally low oxygen levels in the blood \n\u2022 difficulty in breathing when lying flat \n\u2022 liver damage/failure \n\u2022 swelling of the face, lips and throat \n\u2022 kidney failure \n\u2022 abnormally low levels of fluid around baby in womb \n\u2022 failure of the lungs of the baby to develop in the womb \n\u2022 abnormal development of the kidneys of the baby in the womb \n \nSome of the side-effects you experience may be due to your underlying cancer.

Upon \nremoval from refrigerated storage, Trazimera must not be returned to refrigerated storage. Discard at \nthe end of this 3-month period or by the expiry date on the vial, whichever occurs first. Record the \n\u201cdiscard by\u201d date in the date field provided on the carton. \n \nAfter aseptic dilution in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection, solutions of \nTrazimera for intravenous infusion are physically and chemically stable for up to 30 days at \n2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C, and 24 hours at temperatures not exceeding 30\u00b0C. \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the reconstituted solution and Trazimera infusion solution \nshould be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to \nuse are the responsibility of the user and would not normally be longer than 24 hours at 2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C, \nunless reconstitution and dilution have taken place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n \nAppropriate aseptic technique should be used for reconstitution and dilution procedures. Care must \nbe taken to ensure the sterility of prepared solutions. Since the medicinal product does not contain \nany anti-microbial preservative or bacteriostatic agents, aseptic technique must be observed. \n \nAseptic preparation, handling and storage: \n \nAseptic handling must be ensured when preparing the infusion. Preparation should be:  \n\u2022 performed under aseptic conditions by trained personnel in accordance with good practice \n\nrules especially with respect to the aseptic preparation of parenteral products.  \n\u2022 prepared in a laminar flow hood or biological safety cabinet using standard precautions for the \n\nsafe handling of intravenous agents.  \n\u2022 followed by adequate storage of the prepared solution for intravenous infusion to ensure \n\nmaintenance of the aseptic conditions. \n \nA vial of Trazimera aseptically reconstituted with water for injections (not supplied) is chemically \nand physically stable for 48 hours at 2\u00baC \u2013 8\u00baC after reconstitution and must not be frozen. \n \nTrazimera 150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \nAppropriate aseptic technique should be used. Each 150 mg vial of Trazimera is reconstituted with \n7.2 mL of sterile water for injections (not supplied). Use of other reconstitution solvents should be \navoided. This yields a 7.4 mL solution for single-dose use, containing approximately 21 mg/mL \ntrastuzumab. An overfill of 4% ensures that the labelled dose of 150 mg can be withdrawn from each \nvial. \n \nTrazimera 420 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \nAppropriate aseptic technique should be used. Each 420 mg vial of Trazimera is reconstituted with \n20 mL of sterile water for injections (not supplied). Use of other reconstitution solvents should be \navoided. This yields a 20.6 mL solution for single-dose use, containing approximately 21 mg/mL \ntrastuzumab. An overfill of 5% ensures that the labelled dose of 420 mg can be withdrawn from each \nvial. \n \n\nTrazimera vial  \nVolume of sterile water \n\nfor injections  Final concentration \n150 mg vial + 7.2 mL = 21 mg/mL \n420 mg vial + 20 mL = 21 mg/mL \n\n\n\n55  \n\n \nTrazimera should be carefully handled during reconstitution. Causing excessive foaming during \nreconstitution or shaking the reconstituted Trazimera may result in problems with the amount of \nTrazimera that can be withdrawn from the vial. \n \nInstructions for Reconstitution: \n \n1) Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject the appropriate volume (as noted above) of sterile water \n\nfor injections in the vial containing the lyophilised Trazimera. \n2) Swirl vial gently to aid reconstitution. DO NOT SHAKE! \n \nSlight foaming of the product upon reconstitution is not unusual. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed \nfor approximately 5 minutes. The reconstituted Trazimera results in a colourless to pale \nbrownish-yellow transparent solution and should be essentially free of visible particulates. \n \nDetermine the volume of the solution required: \n\n\u2022 based on a loading dose of 4 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent weekly \ndose of 2 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight: \n\n \nVolume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (4 mg/kg for loading or 2 mg/kg for maintenance)  \n\n21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution) \n \n\n\u2022 based on a loading dose of 8 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent 3-weekly \ndose of 6 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight: \n\n \nVolume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (8 mg/kg for loading or 6 mg/kg for maintenance) \n\n21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution) \n \nThe appropriate amount of solution should be withdrawn from the vial and added to a \npolyvinylchloride, polyethylene, polypropylene or ethylene vinyl acetate infusion bag, or a glass \ninfusion bottle containing 250 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution. Do not use with \nglucose-containing solutions. The bag or bottle should be gently inverted to mix the solution in order \nto avoid foaming. Parenteral solutions should be inspected visually for particulates and discoloration \nprior to administration.  \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what trazimera is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "trazimera contains the active substance trastuzumab, which is a monoclonal antibody. monoclonal antibodies attach to specific proteins or antigens. trastuzumab is designed to bind selectively to an antigen called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2). her2 is found in large amounts on the surface of some cancer cells where it stimulates their growth. when trazimera binds to her2 it stops the growth of such cells and causes them to die. your doctor may prescribe trazimera for the treatment of breast and gastric cancer when: you have early breast cancer, with high levels of a protein called her2. you have metastatic breast cancer (breast cancer that has spread beyond the original tumour) with high levels of her2. trazimera may be prescribed in combination with the chemotherapy medicine paclitaxel or docetaxel as first treatment for metastatic breast cancer or it may be prescribed alone if other treatments have proved unsuccessful. it is also used in combination with medicines called aromatase inhibitors with patients with high levels of her2 and hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (cancer that is sensitive to the presence of female sex hormones). you have metastatic gastric cancer with high levels of her2, when it is in combination with the other cancer medicines capecitabine or 5-flououracil and cisplatin.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "trazimera", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text":

your cancer or if you need oxygen treatment. warnings and precautions your doctor will closely supervise your therapy. heart checks treatment with trazimera alone or with a taxane may affect the heart, especially if you have ever used an anthracycline (taxanes and anthracyclines are two other kinds of medicine used to treat cancer). the effects may be moderate to severe and could cause death. therefore, your heart function will be checked before, during (every three months) and after (up to two to five years) treatment with trazimera. if you develop any signs of heart failure (inadequate pumping of blood by the heart), your heart function may be checked more frequently (every six to eight weeks), you may receive treatment for heart failure or you may have to stop trazimera treatment. talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given trazimera if: you have had heart failure, coronary artery disease, heart valve disease (heart murmurs), high blood pressure, taken any high blood pressure medicine or are currently taking any high blood pressure medicine. you have ever had or are currently using a medicine called doxorubicin or epirubicin (medicines used to treat cancer). these medicines (or any other anthracyclines) can damage heart muscle and increase the risk of heart problems with trazimera. you suffer from breathlessness, especially if you are currently using a taxane. trazimera can cause breathing difficulties, especially when it is first given. this could be more serious if you are already breathless. very rarely, patients with severe breathing difficulties before treatment have died when they were given trazimera. you have ever had any other treatment for cancer. if you receive trazimera with any other medicine to treat cancer, such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, an aromatase inhibitor, capecitabine, 5-fluorouracil, or cisplatin you should also read the patient information leaflets for these products. children and adolescents trazimera is not recommended for anyone under the age of 18 years. other medicines and trazimera tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or may take any other medicines. it may take up to 7 months for trazimera to be removed from the body. therefore you should tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse that you have had trazimera if you start any new medicine in the 7 months after stopping treatment. pregnancy if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine. you should use effective contraception during treatment with trazimera and for at least 7 months after treatment has ended. your doctor will advise you of the risks and benefits of taking trazimera during pregnancy. in rare cases, a reduction in the amount of (amniotic) fluid that surrounds the developing baby within the womb has been observed in pregnant women receiving trazimera. this condition 48 may be harmful to your baby in the womb and has been associated with the lungs not developing fully resulting in foetal death. breast-feeding do not breast-feed your baby during trazimera therapy and

formulation is not for subcutaneous use and should be given as an intravenous infusion only. trazimera intravenous formulation is given as an intravenous infusion (\"drip\") directly into your veins. the first dose of your treatment is given over 90 minutes and you will be observed by a health professional while it is being given in case you have any side effects. if the first dose is well tolerated the next doses may be given over 30 minutes (see section 2 under \"warnings and precautions\"). the number of infusions you receive will depend on how you respond to the treatment. your doctor will discuss this with you. in order to prevent medication errors it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the medicine being prepared and given is trazimera (trastuzumab) and not trastuzumab emtansine. for early breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer, trazimera is given every 3 weeks. trazimera may also be given once a week for metastatic breast cancer. if you stop using trazimera do not stop using this medicine without talking to your doctor first. all doses should be taken at the right time every week or every three weeks (depending on your dosing schedule). this helps your medicine work as well as it can. it may take up to 7 months for trazimera to be removed from your body. therefore your doctor may decide to continue to check your heart functions, even after you finish treatment. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text":
