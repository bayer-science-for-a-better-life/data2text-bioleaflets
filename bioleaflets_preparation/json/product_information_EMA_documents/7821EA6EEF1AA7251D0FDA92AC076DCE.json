NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nLatuda 18.5 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains lurasidone hydrochloride equivalent to18.6 mg lurasidone. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n\n \n\nWhite to off-white, film-coated round tablets of 6 mm debossed with ‘LA’ \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nLatuda is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults aged 18 years and over. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 37 mg of lurasidone once daily. No initial dose titration is required. \n\nIt is effective in a dose range of 37 to 148 mg once daily. Dose increase should be based on physician \n\njudgement and observed clinical response. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 148 mg. \n\n \n\nPatients on doses higher than 111 mg once daily who discontinue their treatment for longer than \n\n3 days should be restarted on 111 mg once daily and up-titrated to their optimal dose. For all other \n\ndoses patients can be restarted on their previous dose without need for up-titration. \n\n \n\nDose adjustment due to interactions \n\nA starting dose of 18.5 mg is recommended and the maximum dose of lurasidone should not exceed \n\n74 mg once daily in combination with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Dose adjustment of lurasidone \n\nmay be necessary in combination with mild and moderate CYP3A4 inducers (see section 4.5). For \n\nstrong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers see section 4.3. \n\n \n\nSwitching between antipsychotic medicinal products \n\nDue to different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles among antipsychotic medicinal \n\nproducts, supervision by a clinician is needed when switching to another antipsychotic product is \n\nconsidered medically appropriate. \n\n \n\nElderly people \n\nDosing recommendations for elderly patients with normal renal function (CrCl ≥ 80 ml/min) are the \n\nsame as for adults with normal renal function. However, because elderly patients may have diminished \n\nrenal function, dose adjustments may be required according to their renal function status (see “Renal \n\nimpairment” below). \n\n \n\nLimited data are available in elderly people treated with higher doses of lurasidone. No data are \n\navailable in elderly people treated with 148 mg of lurasidone. Caution should be exercised when \n\ntreating patients ≥65 years of age with higher doses of lurasidone. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment of lurasidone is required in patients with mild renal impairment. \n\nIn patients with moderate (Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 and < 50 ml/min), severe renal \n\nimpairment (CrCL >15 and < 30 ml/min) and End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients \n\n(CrCl < 15 ml/min), the recommended starting dose is 18.5 mg and the maximum dose should not \n\nexceed 74 mg once daily. Lurasidone should not be used in patients with ESRD unless the potential \n\nbenefits outweigh the potential risks. If used in ESRD, clinical monitoring is advised. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment of lurasidone is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment. \n\nDose adjustment is recommended in moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) and severe hepatic impairment \n\n(Child-Pugh Class C) patients. The recommended starting dose is 18.5 mg. The maximum daily dose \n\nin moderate hepatic impairment patients should not exceed 74 mg and in severe hepatic impairment \n\npatients should not exceed 37 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of lurasidone in children aged less than 18 years have not been established. \n\nCurrent available data are described in section 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can \n\nbe made. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nLatuda film-coated tablets are for oral use, to be taken once daily together with a meal. \n\nIf taken without food, it is anticipated that lurasidone exposure will be significantly lower as compared \n\nto when taken with food (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nLatuda tablets should be swallowed whole, in order to mask the bitter taste. Latuda tablets should be \n\ntaken at the same time every day to aid compliance.  \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. boceprevir, clarithromycin, \n\ncobicistat, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, \n\nritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole) and strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. \n\ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) \n\n(see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take a few days to \n\nsome weeks. Patients should be closely monitored during this period.  \n\n \n\nSuicidality  \n\n \n\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and in some cases has been \n\nreported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy. Close supervision of high-risk \n\npatients should accompany antipsychotic therapy. \n\n \n\nParkinson’s disease \n\n \n\nIf prescribed to patients with Parkinson’s disease, antipsychotic medicinal products may exacerbate \n\nthe underlying parkinsonism symptoms. Physicians should therefore weigh the risks versus the \n\nbenefits when prescribing lurasidone to patients with Parkinson’s disease. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nExtrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) \n\n \n\nMedicinal products with dopamine receptor antagonistic properties have been associated with \n\nextrapyramidal adverse reactions including rigidity, tremors, mask-like face, dystonias, drooling of \n\nsaliva, drooped posture and abnormal gait. In placebo controlled clinical studies in adult patients with \n\nschizophrenia there was an increased occurrence of EPS following treatment with lurasidone \n\ncompared to placebo. \n\n \n\nTardive dyskinesia \n\n \n\nMedicinal products with dopamine receptor antagonistic properties have been associated with the \n\ninduction of tardive dyskinesia characterised by rhythmical involuntary movements, predominantly of \n\nthe tongue and/or face. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear, the discontinuation of all \n\nantipsychotics, including lurasidone, should be considered.  \n\n \n\nCardiovascular disorders/QT prolongation \n\n \n\nCaution should be exercised when lurasidone is prescribed in patients with known cardiovascular \n\ndisease or family history of QT prolongation, hypokalaemia, and in concomitant use with other \n\nmedicinal products thought to prolong the QT interval. \n\n \n\nSeizures \n\n \n\nLurasidone should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or other conditions that \n\npotentially lower the seizure threshold.  \n\n \n\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) \n\n \n\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome, characterised by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic \n\ninstability, altered consciousness and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase levels, has been reported \n\nto occur with lurasidone. Additional signs may include myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute \n\nrenal failure. In this event, lurasidone should be discontinued.  \n\n \n\nElderly patients with dementia \n\n \n\nLurasidone has not been studied in elderly patients with dementia. \n\n \n\nOverall mortality  \n\n \n\nIn a meta-analysis of 17 controlled clinical trials, elderly patients with dementia treated with other \n\natypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, and quetiapine had an \n\nincreased risk of mortality compared to placebo. \n\n \n\nCerebrovascular accident \n\n \n\nAn approximately 3-fold increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse reactions has been seen in \n\nrandomised placebo-controlled clinical trials in the dementia population with some atypical \n\nantipsychotics, including risperidone, aripiprazole and olanzapine. The mechanism for this increased \n\nrisk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for other antipsychotics or other patient \n\npopulations. Lurasidone should be used with caution in elderly patients with dementia who have risk \n\nfactors for stroke. \n\n \n\nVenous thromboembolism \n\n \n\nCases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with antipsychotic medicinal products. \n\nSince patients treated with antipsychotics often present with acquired risk factors for VTE, all possible \n\n\n\n5 \n\nrisk factors for VTE should be identified before and during treatment with lurasidone and preventive \n\nmeasures undertaken. \n\n \n\nHyperprolactinaemia \n\n \n\nLurasidone elevates prolactin levels due to antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors.   Patients should \n\nbe counseled on signs and symptoms of elevated prolactin, such as gynecomastia, \n\ngalactorrhea, amenorrhea and erectile dysfunction. Patient should be advised to seek medical \n\nattention if they experience any signs and symptoms \n \n\nWeight gain \n\n \n\nWeight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Clinical monitoring of weight is \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nHyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nRare cases of glucose related adverse reactions, e.g. increase in blood glucose, have been reported in \n\nclinical trials with lurasidone. Appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable in diabetic patients and in \n\npatients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus. \n\n \n\nOrthostatic hypotension/syncope \n\n \n\nLurasidone may cause orthostatic hypotension, perhaps due to its α1-adrenergic receptor antagonism. \n\nMonitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in patients who are vulnerable to \n\nhypotension. \n\n \n\nInteraction with grapefruit juice  \n\n \n\nGrapefruit juice should be avoided during treatment with lurasidone (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic interactions \n\n \n\nGiven the primary central nervous system effects of lurasidone, lurasidone should be used with \n\ncaution in combination with other centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol.  \n\n \n\nCaution is advised when prescribing lurasidone with medicinal products known to prolong the QT \n\ninterval, e.g. class IA antiarrhythmics (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide) and class III antiarrhythmics (e.g. \n\namiodarone, sotalol), some antihistaminics, some other antipsychotics and some antimalarials (e.g. \n\nmefloquine).  \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n\n \n\nThe concomitant administration of lurasidone and grapefruit juice has not been assessed. Grapefruit \n\njuice inhibits CYP3A4 and may increase the serum concentration of lurasidone. Grapefruit juice \n\nshould be avoided during treatment with lurasidone. \n\n \n\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect lurasidone  \n\n \n\nLurasidone and its active metabolite ID-14283 both contribute to the pharmacodynamic effect at the \n\ndopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. Lurasidone and its active metabolite ID-14283 are primarily \n\nmetabolised by CYP3A4.  \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nLurasidone is contraindicated with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. boceprevir, clarithromycin, \n\ncobicistat, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, \n\nsaquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole) (see section 4.3).  \n\n \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole resulted in a 9- and \n\n6-fold increase in exposure of lurasidone and its active metabolite ID-14283 respectively.  \n\n \n\nCo-administration of lurasidone and posaconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) resulted in an \n\napproximate 4-5 fold increase in lurasidone exposure.  A persistent effect of posaconazole on \n\nlurasidone exposure was observed up to 2-3 weeks after stop of posaconazole co-administration. \n\n \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with medicinal products that moderately inhibit CYP3A4 (e.g. \n\ndiltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole verapamil) may increase exposure to lurasidone. Moderate \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors are estimated to result in a 2-5 fold increase in exposure of CYP3A4 substrates. \n\n \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with diltiazem (slow-release formulation), a moderate CYP3A4 \n\ninhibitor, resulted in a 2.2 and 2.4-fold increase in exposure of lurasidone and ID-14283 respectively \n\n(see section 4.2). The use of an immediate release formulation of diltiazem could result in a larger \n\nincrease in lurasidone exposure. \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 inducers \n\nLurasidone is contraindicated with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, \n\nphenytoin, rifampicin, St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin resulted in a 6-fold \n\ndecrease in exposure of lurasidone. \n\n \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with mild (e.g. armodafinil, amprenavir, aprepitant, prednisone, \n\nrufinamide) or moderate (e.g. bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcillin) inducers of \n\nCYP3A4 would be expected to give a <2-fold reduction in lurasidone exposure during \n\nco-administration and for up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of mild or moderate CYP3A4 inducers. \n\n \n\nWhen lurasidone is coadministered with mild or moderate CYP3A4 inducers, the efficacy of \n\nlurasidone needs to be carefully monitored and a dose adjustment may be needed. \n\n \n\nTransporters  \n\nLurasidone is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP in vitro and the in vivo relevance of this is unclear. \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with P-gp and BCRP inhibitors may increase exposure to lurasidone. \n\n \n\nPotential for lurasidone to affect other medicinal products \n\n \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, resulted in a < 1.5-fold \n\nincrease in midazolam exposure. Monitoring is recommended when lurasidone and CYP3A4 \n\nsubstrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, \n\nquinidine, bepridil or ergot alkaloids [ergotamine, dihydroergotamine]) are coadministered.  \n\n \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with digoxin (a P-gp substrate) did not increase the exposure to \n\ndigoxin and only slightly increased Cmax (1.3 –fold) and therefore, it is considered that lurasidone can \n\nbe coadministered with digoxin. Lurasidone is an in vitro inhibitor of the efflux transporter P-gp and \n\nthe clinical relevance of intestinal P-gp inhibition cannot be excluded. Concomitant administration of \n\nthe P-gp substrate dabigatran etexilate may result in increased dabigatran plasma concentrations.  \n\n \n\nLurasidone is an in vitro inhibitor of the efflux transporter BCRP and the clinical relevance of \n\nintestinal BCRP inhibition cannot be excluded. Concomitant administration of BCRP substrates may \n\nresult in increases in the plasma concentrations of these substrates. \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with lithium indicated that lithium had clinically negligible effects on \n\nthe pharmacokinetics of lurasidone, therefore no dose adjustment of lurasidone is required when \n\ncoadministered with lithium. Lurasidone does not impact concentrations of lithium. \n\n \n\nA clinical drug interaction study investigating the effect of coadministration of lurasidone on patients \n\ntaking oral combination contraceptives including norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol, indicated that \n\nlurasidone had no clinically or statistically meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of the \n\ncontraceptive or sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels. Therefore, lurasidone can be \n\ncoadministered with oral contraceptives. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of lurasidone \n\nin pregnant women. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy, \n\nembryonal/foetal development, parturition and postnatal development (see section 5.3). The potential \n\nrisk for humans is unknown. Lurasidone should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly \n\nnecessary.  \n\n \n\nNeonates exposed to antipsychotics (including lurasidone) during the third trimester are at risk of \n\nadverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that may vary in severity and \n\nduration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, \n\nsomnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborns should be monitored \n\ncarefully. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nLurasidone was excreted in milk of rats during lactation (see section 5.3). It is not known whether \n\nlurasidone or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Breast feeding in women receiving \n\nlurasidone should be considered only if the potential benefit of treatment justifies the potential risk to \n\nthe child. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nStudies in animals have shown a number of effects on fertility, mainly related to prolactin increase, \n\nwhich are not considered to be relevant to human reproduction (see section 5.3).  \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nLurasidone has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be cautioned \n\nabout operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that \n\nlurasidone does not affect them adversely (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe safety of lurasidone has been evaluated at doses of 18.5 -148 mg in clinical studies in patients \n\nwith schizophrenia treated for up to 52 weeks and in the post-marketing setting. The most common \n\nadverse drug reactions (ADRs) (≥ 10%) were akathisia and somnolence, which were dose-related up to \n\n111 mg daily. \n\n \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse drug reactions (ADRs) based upon pooled data are shown by system, organ class and by \n\npreferred term are listed below. The incidence of ADRs reported in clinical trials is tabulated by \n\n\n\n8 \n\nfrequency category. The following terms and frequencies are applied: very common (≥ 1/10), common \n\n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare \n\n(<1 /10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

The incidence of akathisia for lurasidone-treated \n\nsubjects was 12.9% versus 3.0% for placebo-treated subjects. \n\n \n\nDystonia: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in \n\nsusceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of \n\nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, difficulty swallowing, difficulty \n\nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur \n\nmore frequently and with greater severity, higher potency and at higher doses of first generation \n\nantipsychotic medicinal products. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger \n\nage groups.  \n\n \n\nVenous thromboembolism: Cases of venous thromboembolism, including cases of pulmonary \n\nembolism and cases of deep vein thrombosis have been reported with antipsychotic drugs -Frequency \n\nunknown. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the following website: \n\nwww.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nManagement of overdose \n\n \n\nThere is no specific antidote to lurasidone, therefore, appropriate supportive measures should be \n\ninstituted and close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. \n\nCardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately, including continuous electrocardiographic \n\nmonitoring for possible arrhythmias. If antiarrhythmic therapy is administered, disopyramide, \n\nprocainamide, and quinidine carry a theoretical hazard of QT-prolonging effects when administered in \n\npatients with an acute overdose of lurasidone. Similarly the alpha-blocking properties of bretylium \n\nmight be additive to those of lurasidone, resulting in problematic hypotension. \n\n \n\nHypotension and circulatory collapse should be treated with appropriate measures. Adrenaline and \n\ndopamine should not be used, or other sympathomimetics with beta agonist activity, since beta \n\nstimulation may worsen hypotension in the setting of lurasidone-induced alpha blockade. In case of \n\nsevere extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic medicinal products should be administered. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard\n\n\n11 \n\nGastric lavage (after intubation if patient is unconscious) and administration of activated charcoal \n\ntogether with a laxative should be considered. \n\n \n\nThe possibility of obtundation, seizures, or dystonic reaction of the head and neck following overdose \n\nmay create a risk of aspiration with induced emesis. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, antipsychotics. ATC code: N05AE05 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nLurasidone is a selective blocking agent of dopamine and monoamine effects. Lurasidone binds \n\nstrongly to dopaminergic D2- and to serotonergic 5-HT2A and 5-HT7- receptors with high binding \n\naffinity of 0.994, 0.47 and 0.495 nM, respectively. It also blocks α2c-adrenergic receptors and \n\nα2a-adrenergic receptors with a binding affinity of 10.8 and 40.7 nM respectively. Lurasidone also \n\nexhibits partial agonism at the 5HT-1A receptor with a binding affinity of 6.38 nM. Lurasidone does \n\nnot bind to histaminergic or muscarinic receptors. \n\n \n\nThe mechanism of action of the minor active metabolite of lurasidone ID-14283 is similar to that of \n\nlurasidone. \n\n \n\nLurasidone doses ranging from 9 to 74 mg administered to healthy subjects produced a \n\ndose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand, in the caudate, \n\nputamen and ventral striatum detected by positron emission tomography. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nIn the main clinical efficacy studies, lurasidone was administered at doses of 37-148 mg lurasidone. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy \n\nThe efficacy of lurasidone in the treatment of schizophrenia was demonstrated in five multi-centre, \n\nplacebo-controlled, double-blind, 6-week trials in subjects who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual \n\nof Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for schizophrenia. Lurasidone doses, which \n\nvaried across the five trials, ranged from 37 to 148 mg lurasidone once daily. In the short-term trials, \n\nthe primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the mean change from baseline to Week 6 in Positive \n\nand Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores, a validated multi-item inventory composed of \n\nfive factors to evaluate positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganised thoughts, uncontrolled \n\nhostility/excitement, and anxiety/depression. Lurasidone demonstrated superior efficacy compared \n\nwith placebo across Phase 3 studies (see Table 2). Lurasidone showed significant separation from \n\nplacebo from as early as Day 4. Additionally, lurasidone was superior to placebo on the predefined \n\nsecondary endpoint Clinical Global Impression – Severity (CGI-S) scale. Efficacy was also confirmed \n\nin a secondary analysis of treatment response (defined as ≥ 30% decrease from Baseline in PANSS \n\ntotal score).  \n\n \n\nTable 2 \n\nSchizophrenia Studies: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) Total \n\nScore - Change From Baseline to Week 6- MMRM for Studies D1050229, D1050231, and D1050233: \n\nIntent-to-Treat Analysis Set \n\n \n\nStudy Statistic Placebo Lurasidone dose (b)  Active \n\nControl \n\n(a) \n37 mg 74 mg 111 mg 148 mg \n\nStudy D1050229 N=124 N=121 N=118 N=123 -- -- \n\n\n\n12 \n\nStudy Statistic Placebo Lurasidone dose (b)  Active \n\nControl \n\n(a) \n37 mg 74 mg 111 mg 148 mg \n\nBaseline Mean \n\n(SD) \n\n96.8 \n\n(11.1) \n\n96.5 \n\n(11.6) \n\n96.0 \n\n(10.8) \n96.0 (9.7) \n\n-- -- \n\nLS Mean Change \n\n(SE) \n-17.0 \n\n(1.8) \n\n-19.2 \n\n(1.7) \n\n-23.4 \n\n(1.8) \n\n-20.5 \n\n(1.8) \n\n-- -- \n\nTreatment Difference \n\nvs. placebo \n\n      \n\nEstimate (SE) -- -2.1 (2.5) -6.4 (2.5) -3.5 (2.5) -- -- \n\np-value -- 0.591 0.034 0.391 -- -- \n\nStudy D1050231 N=114 N=118 -- N=118 -- N=121 \n\nBaseline Mean \n\n(SD) \n\n95.8 \n\n(10.8) \n\n96.6 \n\n(10.7) \n\n-- 97.9 \n\n(11.3) \n\n-- 96.3 (12.2) \n\nLS Mean Change \n\n(SE) \n\n-16.0 \n\n(2.1) \n\n-25.7 \n\n(2.0) \n\n-- -23.6 \n\n(2.1) \n\n-- -28.7 (1.9) \n\nTreatment Difference \n\nvs. placebo \n\n      \n\nEstimate (SE) -- -9.7 (2.9) -- -7.5 (3.0) -- -12.6 (2.8) \n\np-value  -- 0.002 -- 0.022 -- <0.001 \n\nStudy D1050233 N=120 -- N=125 -- N=121 N=116 \n\nBaseline Mean \n\n(SD) \n\n96.6 \n\n(10.2) \n\n-- 97.7 (9.7) -- 97.9 \n\n(11.8) \n\n97.7 (10.2) \n\nLS Mean Change \n\n(SE) \n\n-10.3 \n\n(1.8) \n\n-- -22.2 \n\n(1.8) \n\n-- -26.5 \n\n(1.8) \n\n-27.8 (1.8) \n\nTreatment Difference \n\nvs. placebo \n\n      \n\nEstimate (SE) -- -- -11.9 \n\n(2.6) \n\n-- -16.2 \n\n(2.5) \n\n-17.5 (2.6) \n\np-value  -- -- <0.001 -- <0.001 <0.001 \n\n(a) Olanzapine 15 mg in Study D1050231, quetiapine extended-release (XR) 600 mg in Study \n\nD1050233. \n\nN is number of subjects per model estimate. \n\n(b) p-values for lurasidone vs. placebo were adjusted for multiple comparisons. P-values for \n\nolanzapine and quetiapine XR vs. placebo were unadjusted. \n\n \n\nIn the short-term studies there was no consistent dose-response correlation observed. \n\n \n\nLong-term maintenance efficacy of lurasidone (37 to 148 mg lurasidone once daily ) was \n\ndemonstrated in a 12 month non-inferiority trial with quetiapine extended release (200 to 800 mg once \n\ndaily). Lurasidone was non-inferior to quetiapine  extended release in time to relapse of schizophrenia. \n\nLurasidone had a small increase from baseline to Month 12 in body weight and body mass index \n\n(Mean (SD): 0.73 (3.36) kg and 0.28 (1.17) kg/m2, respectively) compared to quetiapine extended \n\nrelease (1.23 (4.56) kg and 0.45 (1.63) kg/m2, respectively). Overall, lurasidone had a negligible effect \n\non weight and other metabolic parameters including total cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose levels. \n\n \n\nIn a long-term safety study clinically stable patients were treated using 37 – 111 mg lurasidone or \n\nrisperidone 2 – 6 mg. In that study the rate of relapse over a 12-month period was 20% for lurasidone \n\nand 16% for risperidone. This difference neared, but did not reach, statistical significance. \n\n \n\nIn a long-term trial designed to assess the maintenance of effect, lurasidone was more effective than \n\nplacebo in maintaining symptom control and delaying relapse of schizophrenia. After having been \n\ntreated for an acute episode and stabilized for a minimum of 12 weeks with lurasidone, patients were \n\nthen randomised in a double-blind manner to either continue on lurasidone or on placebo until they \n\nexperienced a relapse in schizophrenia symptoms. In the primary analysis of time to relapse in which \n\npatients that withdrew without relapse were censored at the time of withdrawal, patients on lurasidone \n\nshowed a significantly longer time to relapse compared with patients on placebo (p=0.039). The \n\n\n\n13 \n\nKaplan-Meier estimates of the probability of relapse at Week 28 were 42.2% for lurasidone and 51.2% \n\nfor placebo. The probability of all-cause discontinuation at Week 28 were 58.2% for lurasidone and \n\n69.9% for placebo (p=0.072). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nlurasidone in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in schizophrenia (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\nBipolar Depression \n\n \n\nThe short-term efficacy of lurasidone was studied in a 6-week multicentre, randomized, double-blind, \n\nplacebo-controlled, study of children and adolescent patients (10-17 years of age) who met Diagnostic \n\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) criteria for a major depressive \n\nepisode associated with bipolar I disorder, with or without rapid cycling, and without psychotic features \n\n(N=350). Patients were randomized to flexibly dosed lurasidone 18-74 mg once daily or placebo.  \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the mean change from baseline to Week 6 in Children's \n\nDepression Rating Scale, Revised (CDRS-R) Total Score. The key secondary endpoint was Clinical \n\nGlobal Impression – Bipolar Version, Severity of Illness (CGI-BP-S) Depression Score. Statistically \n\nsignificant differences favouring lurasidone over placebo were shown for these endpoints for the total \n\npopulation studied, beginning at Week 2 and were maintained at each study visit through to the end of \n\nthe study. However, the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints were not met in younger \n\npatients (below 15 years of age). Placebo-adjusted LS mean change (95% CI) from Baseline to Week 6 \n\nLOCF in CDRS-R total score for the lurasidone group was -1.8 (-5.6, 2.0) for subjects in the 10- to 14-\n\nyear-old age patients and was -8.6 (-12.4, -4.8) for subjects in the 15- to 17-year-old age patients.  \n\n \n\nThe safety profile of lurasidone in children included in this short-term study is in general consistent \n\nwith that observed when treated within the approved indication in adults, however, differences in \n\nfrequency of the most commonly occurred adverse reactions have been observed in paediatric patients \n\nfor nausea (very common), diarrhea (common) and decreased appetite (common), compared with \n\nadults (common, unknown, and uncommon, respectively). \n\n \n\nTable 2.1 Bipolar Depression Paediatric Study: Children's Depression Rating Scale, Revised (CDRS-R) \n\nTotal Score and Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Version, Severity of Illness (CGI-BP-S) Depression \n\nScore (Depression) - Change From Baseline to Week 6 - MMRM for Study D1050326: Intent-to-Treat \n\nAnalysis Set \n\nParameters Study Statistic Placebo Lurasidone dose 18.5-74 \n\nmg (a) (b) \n\nPrimary Endpoint: \n\nCDRS-R Total Score  \n N=170 N=173 \n\nBaseline Mean (SD) 58.6 (8.26) 59.2 (8.24) \n\nLS Mean Change (SE) -15.3 (1.08) -21.0 (1.06) \n\nTreatment Difference vs. \n\nplacebo \n\n  \n\nEstimate (SE; 95% CI) -- -5.7 (1.39; -8.4 to -3.0) \n\np-value -- <0.0001 \n\n    \n\nKey Secondary \n\nEndpoint: CGI-BP-S \n\nDepression Score \n\n N=170 N=173 \n\nBaseline Mean (SD) 4.5 4.6 \n\nLS Mean Change (SE) -1.05 (0.087) -1.49 (0.085) \n\nTreatment Difference vs. \n\nplacebo \n\n  \n\nEstimate (SE; 95% CI) -- -0.44 (0.112; -0.66 to -0.22) \n\np-value  -- <0.0001 \n\nN is number of subjects. \n\n(a) p-values for lurasidone vs. placebo were adjusted for multiple comparisons.  \n\n(b) Lurasidone doses of 18.5, 37, 55.5, 74 mg are equivalent to 20, 40, 60 and 80 amounts of lurasidone hydrochloride. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nLurasidone reaches peak serum concentrations in approximately 1-3 hours.  \n\n \n\nIn a food effect study, lurasidone mean Cmax and AUC increased approximately by 2-3-times and \n\n1.5-2-times, respectively, when administered with food compared to the levels observed under fasting \n\nconditions.  \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of 37 mg of lurasidone, the mean approximate apparent volume of \n\ndistribution was 6000 L. Lurasidone is highly bound (~99%) to serum proteins. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nLurasidone is metabolised mainly via CYP3A4. The major biotransformation pathways are oxidative \n\nN-dealkylation, hydroxylation of norbornane ring, and S-oxidation. \n\n \n\nLurasidone is metabolised into two active metabolites (ID-14283 and ID-14326) and two non-active \n\nmetabolites (ID-20219 and ID-20220). Lurasidone and its metabolites ID-14283, ID-14326, ID-20219 \n\nand ID-20220 correspond to approximately 11.4, 4.1, 0.4, 24 and 11% respectively, of serum \n\nradioactivity respectively. \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for metabolism of the active metabolite ID-14283. \n\nLurasidone and its active metabolite ID-14283 both contribute to the pharmacodynamic effect at the \n\ndopaminergic and serotonergic receptors.  \n\n \n\nBased on in vitro studies lurasidone is not a substrate of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP4A11, \n\nCYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP2E1 enzymes. \n\n \n\nIn vitro, lurasidone demonstrated no direct, or weak inhibition (direct or time-dependent) (IC50>5.9 \n\nμM) of the enzymes cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, \n\nCYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Based on this data, lurasidone is not expected to affect the \n\npharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, \n\nCYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. For administration of medicinal products that are substrates of \n\nCYP3A4 with a narrow therapeutic range, see section 4.5.  \n\n \n\nLurasidone is an in vitro substrate of the efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP. Lurasidone is not subject \n\nto active uptake transport by OATP1B1 or OATP1B3.  \n\n \n\nLurasidone is an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP and OCT1 in vitro (see section 4.5). Lurasidone is not \n\nexpected to have a clinically relevant inhibitory potential on transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, \n\nOCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, MATE2K or BSEP based on in vitro data. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of lurasidone, the elimination half-life was 20-40 hours. Following oral \n\nadministration of a radiolabelled dose, approximately 67% dose was recovered in faeces and 19% in \n\nurine. Urine comprised mostly of a number of metabolites with minimal renal excretion of parent \n\ncompound.  \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of lurasidone is dose-proportional within a total daily dose range of 18.5 mg to \n\n148 mg. Steady-state concentrations of lurasidone are reached within 7 days of starting lurasidone. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups: \n\n \n\nElderly people \n\nLimited data have been collected in healthy subjects ≥ 65 years. Of the data collected, similar \n\nexposure was obtained compared with subjects < 65 years. However, an increase in exposure in \n\nelderly subjects may be expected for patients if they have impaired renal or hepatic function.  \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe serum concentrations of lurasidone are increased in healthy subjects with Child-Pugh Class A, B \n\nand C hepatic impairment with an increased exposure of 1.5-, 1.7- and 3-fold respectively. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe serum concentrations of lurasidone are increased in healthy subjects with mild, moderate and \n\nsevere renal impairment with an increased exposure of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0-fold respectively. Subjects \n\nwith ESRD (CrCl<15 ml/min) have not been investigated. \n\n \n\nGender \n\nThere were no clinically relevant differences between genders in the pharmacokinetics of lurasidone in \n\na population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with schizophrenia. \n\n \n\nRace \n\nThere were no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of lurasidone in a population \n\npharmacokinetic analysis in patients with schizophrenia. It was noted that Asian subjects had 1.5 fold \n\nincreased exposure to lurasidone compared to Caucasian subjects. \n\n \n\nSmoking \n\nBased on in vitro studies utilising human liver enzymes, lurasidone is not a substrate for CYP1A2; \n\nsmoking should, therefore, not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of lurasidone. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of lurasidone in paediatric patients was investigated in 49 children aged \n\n6-12 years and 56 adolescents aged 13-17 years. Lurasidone was administered as lurasidone \n\nhydrochloride at daily doses of either 20, 40, 80, 120 mg (6-17 years) or 160 mg (10-17 years only) for \n\n7 days. There was no clear correlation between obtained plasma exposure and age or body weight. The \n\npharmacokinetics of lurasidone in paediatric patients aged 6–17 years was generally comparable to \n\nthose observed in adults. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. Major findings in \n\nrepeat-dose toxicity studies of lurasidone were centrally-mediated endocrine changes resulting from \n\nserum prolactin elevations in rats, dogs and monkeys. High serum prolactin levels in long-term \n\nrepeat-dose studies in female rats were associated with effects on bones, adrenal glands, and \n\nreproductive tissues. In a long-term dog repeat-dose study, high serum prolactin levels were associated \n\nwith effects on male and female reproductive tissues. \n\n \n\nIn rats, lurasidone had no effect on male and female reproduction at oral doses of 150 and \n\n0.1 mg/kg/day lurasidone hydrochloride, respectively, or on early embryonic development at an oral \n\ndose of 15 mg/kg/day lurasidone hydrochloride.  \n\n \n\nA fertility study in female rats resulted in prolonged oestrous cycle and delayed copulation at \n\n≥1.5 mg/kg/day lurasidone hydrochloride, whilst the copulation and fertility indices, and the numbers \n\nof corpora lutea, implantations and live foetuses were decreased at 150 mg/kg/day lurasidone \n\n\n\n16 \n\nhydrochloride. These effects were due to the hyperprolactinemia following lurasidone treatment, \n\naffecting the oestrous cycle and copulatory behaviour as well as the maintenance of corpus luteum of \n\nthe female rats, resulting in a decrease in implantation and the number of live foetuses. These \n\nprolactin-related effects are not considered to be relevant to human reproduction. \n\n \n\nA single dose of 10 mg/kg lurasidone hydrochloride to pregnant rats resulted in fetal exposure. In a \n\ndose range finding study in pregnant rats, 150 mg/kg/day lurasidone hydrochloride caused fetal growth \n\nretardation without signs of teratogenicity. Lurasidone was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits at an \n\nexposure similar to or below the maximum recommended human dose (148 mg lurasidone ). \n\n \n\nLurasidone was excreted in milk of rats during lactation. \n\n \n\nLurasidone was not genotoxic in a battery of tests. Mammary gland and/or pituitary gland tumours \n\nwere observed in the mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies and are most likely due to the increased \n\nblood prolactin levels. These findings are common in rodents treated with antipsychotic medicinal \n\nproducts with dopamine D2 blocking activity and are considered to be rodent-specific.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nLatuda 37 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains lurasidone hydrochloride equivalent to 37.2 mg lurasidone. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n\n \n\nWhite to off-white, film-coated round tablets of 8 mm debossed with ‘LB’ \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nLatuda is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults aged 18 years and over. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 37 mg of lurasidone once daily. No initial dose titration is required. \n\nIt is effective in a dose range of 37 to 148 mg once daily. Dose increase should be based on physician \n\njudgement and observed clinical response. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 148 mg. \n\n \n\nPatients on doses higher than 111 mg once daily who discontinue their treatment for longer than \n\n3 days should be restarted on 111 mg once daily and up-titrated to their optimal dose. For all other \n\ndoses patients can be restarted on their previous dose without need for up-titration. \n\n \n\nDose adjustment due to interactions \n\nA starting dose of 18.5 mg is recommended and the maximum dose of lurasidone should not exceed \n\n74 mg once daily in combination with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Dose adjustment of lurasidone \n\nmay be necessary in combination with mild and moderate CYP3A4 inducers (see section 4.5). For \n\nstrong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers see section 4.3. \n\n \n\nSwitching between antipsychotic medicinal products \n\nDue to different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles among antipsychotic medicinal \n\nproducts, supervision by a clinician is needed when switching to another antipsychotic product is \n\nconsidered medically appropriate. \n\n \n\nElderly people \n\nDosing recommendations for elderly patients with normal renal function (CrCl ≥ 80 ml/min) are the \n\nsame as for adults with normal renal function. However, because elderly patients may have diminished \n\nrenal function, dose adjustments may be required according to their renal function status (see “Renal \n\nimpairment” below). \n\n \n\nLimited data are available in elderly people treated with higher doses of lurasidone. No data are \n\navailable in elderly people treated with 148 mg of lurasidone. Caution should be exercised when \n\ntreating patients ≥65 years of age with higher doses of lurasidone. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment of lurasidone is required in patients with mild renal impairment. \n\nIn patients with moderate (Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 and < 50 ml/min), severe renal \n\nimpairment (CrCL >15 and < 30 ml/min) and End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients \n\n(CrCl < 15 ml/min), the recommended starting dose is 18.5 mg and the maximum dose should not \n\nexceed 74 mg once daily. Lurasidone should not be used in patients with ESRD unless the potential \n\nbenefits outweigh the potential risks. If used in ESRD, clinical monitoring is advised. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment of lurasidone is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment. \n\nDose adjustment is recommended in moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) and severe hepatic impairment \n\n(Child-Pugh Class C) patients. The recommended starting dose is 18.5 mg. The maximum daily dose \n\nin moderate hepatic impairment patients should not exceed 74 mg and in severe hepatic impairment \n\npatients should not exceed 37 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of lurasidone in children aged less than 18 years have not been established. \n\nCurrent available data are described in section 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can \n\nbe made. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nLatuda film-coated tablets are for oral use, to be taken once daily together with a meal. \n\nIf taken without food, it is anticipated that lurasidone exposure will be significantly lower as compared \n\nto when taken with food (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nLatuda tablets should be swallowed whole, in order to mask the bitter taste. Latuda tablets should be \n\ntaken at the same time every day to aid compliance.  \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. boceprevir, clarithromycin, \n\ncobicistat, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, \n\nritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole) and strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. \n\ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) \n\n(see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take a few days to \n\nsome weeks. Patients should be closely monitored during this period.  \n\n \n\nSuicidality  \n\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and in some cases has been \n\nreported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy. Close supervision of high-risk \n\npatients should accompany antipsychotic therapy. \n\n \n\nParkinson’s disease \n\nIf prescribed to patients with Parkinson’s disease, antipsychotic medicinal products may exacerbate \n\nthe underlying parkinsonism symptoms. Physicians should therefore weigh the risks versus the \n\nbenefits when prescribing Lurasidone to patients with Parkinson’s disease. \n\n \n\nExtrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) \n\nMedicinal products with dopamine receptor antagonistic properties have been associated with \n\nextrapyramidal adverse reactions including rigidity, tremors, mask-like face, dystonias, drooling of \n\n\n\n20 \n\nsaliva, drooped posture and abnormal gait. In placebo controlled clinical studies in adult patients with \n\nschizophrenia there was an increased occurrence of EPS following treatment with lurasidone \n\ncompared to placebo. \n\n \n\nTardive dyskinesia \n\nMedicinal products with dopamine receptor antagonistic properties have been associated with the \n\ninduction of tardive dyskinesia characterised by rhythmical involuntary movements, predominantly of \n\nthe tongue and/or face. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear, the discontinuation of all \n\nantipsychotics, including lurasidone, should be considered.  \n\n \n\nCardiovascular disorders/QT prolongation \n\nCaution should be exercised when lurasidone is prescribed in patients with known cardiovascular \n\ndisease or family history of QT prolongation, hypokalaemia, and in concomitant use with other \n\nmedicinal products thought to prolong the QT interval. \n\n \n\nSeizures \n\nLurasidone should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or other conditions that \n\npotentially lower the seizure threshold.  \n\n \n\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) \n\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome, characterised by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic \n\ninstability, altered consciousness and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase levels, has been reported \n\nto occur lurasidone. Additional signs may include myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal \n\nfailure. In this event, lurasidone, should be discontinued.  \n\n \n\nElderly patients with dementia \n\nLurasidone has not been studied in elderly patients with dementia. \n\n \n\nOverall mortality  \n\nIn a meta-analysis of 17 controlled clinical trials, elderly patients with dementia treated with other \n\natypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, and quetiapine had an \n\nincreased risk of mortality compared to placebo. \n\n \n\nCerebrovascular accident \n\nAn approximately 3-fold increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse reactions has been seen in \n\nrandomised placebo-controlled clinical trials in the dementia population with some atypical \n\nantipsychotics, including risperidone, aripiprazole and olanzapine. The mechanism for this increased \n\nrisk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for other antipsychotics or other patient \n\npopulations. Lurasidone should be used with caution in elderly patients with dementia who have risk \n\nfactors for stroke. \n\n \n\nVenous thromboembolism \n\nCases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with antipsychotic medicinal products. \n\nSince patients treated with antipsychotics often present with acquired risk factors for VTE, all possible \n\nrisk factors for VTE should be identified before and during treatment with lurasidone and preventive \n\nmeasures undertaken. \n\n \n\nHyperprolactinaemia \n\nLurasidone elevates prolactin levels due to antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors.  Patients should \n\nbe counseled on signs and symptoms of elevated prolactin, such as gynecomastia, \n\ngalactorrhea, amenorrhea and erectile dysfunction. Patient should be advised to seek medical \n\nattention if they experience any signs and symptoms. \nWeight gain \n\nWeight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Clinical monitoring of weight is \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nHyperglycaemia \n\nRare cases of glucose related adverse reactions, e.g. increase in blood glucose, have been reported in \n\nclinical trials with lurasidone. Appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable in diabetic patients and in \n\npatients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus. \n\n \n\nOrthostatic hypotension/syncope \n\nLurasidone may cause orthostatic hypotension, perhaps due to its α1-adrenergic receptor antagonism. \n\nMonitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in patients who are vulnerable to \n\nhypotension. \n\n \n\nInteraction with grapefruit juice  \n\nGrapefruit juice should be avoided during treatment with lurasidone (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic interactions \n\n \n\nGiven the primary central nervous system effects of lurasidone, lurasidone should be used with \n\ncaution in combination with other centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol.  \n\n \n\nCaution is advised when prescribing lurasidone with medicinal products known to prolong the QT \n\ninterval, e.g. class IA antiarrhythmics (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide) and class III antiarrhythmics (e.g. \n\namiodarone, sotalol), some antihistaminics, some other antipsychotics and some antimalarials (e.g. \n\nmefloquine).  \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n\n \n\nThe concomitant administration of lurasidone and grapefruit juice has not been assessed. Grapefruit \n\njuice inhibits CYP 3A4 and may increase the serum concentration of lurasidone. Grapefruit juice \n\nshould be avoided during treatment with lurasidone. \n\n \n\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect lurasidone  \n\n \n\nLurasidone and its active metabolite ID-14283 both contribute to the pharmacodynamic effect at the \n\ndopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. Lurasidone and its active metabolite ID-14283 are primarily \n\nmetabolised by CYP3A4.  \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nLurasidone is contraindicated with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. boceprevir, clarithromycin, \n\ncobicistat, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, \n\nsaquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole) (see section 4.3).  \n\n \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole resulted in a 9- and \n\n6-fold increase in exposure of lurasidone and its active metabolite ID-14283 respectively.  \n\n \n\nCo-administration of lurasidone and posaconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) resulted in an \n\napproximate 4-5 fold increase in lurasidone exposure.  A persistent effect of posaconazole on \n\nlurasidone exposure was observed up to 2-3 weeks after stop of posaconazole co-administration. \n\n \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with medicinal products that moderately inhibit CYP3A4 (e.g. \n\ndiltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole verapamil) may increase exposure to lurasidone. Moderate \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors are estimated to result in a 2-5 fold increase in exposure of CYP3A4 substrates. \n\n \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with diltiazem (slow-release formulation), a moderate CYP3A4 \n\ninhibitor, resulted in a 2.2 and 2.4-fold increase in exposure of lurasidone and ID-14283 respectively \n\n(see section 4.2). The use of an immediate release formulation of diltiazem could result in a larger \n\nincrease in lurasidone exposure. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 inducers \n\nLurasidone is contraindicated with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, \n\nphenytoin, rifampicin, St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin resulted in a 6-fold \n\ndecrease in exposure of lurasidone. \n\n \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with mild (e.g. armodafinil, amprenavir, aprepitant, prednisone, \n\nrufinamide) or moderate (e.g. bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcillin) inducers of \n\nCYP3A4 would be expected to give a <2-fold reduction in lurasidone exposure during \n\nco-administration and for up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of mild or moderate CYP3A4 inducers. \n\n \n\nWhen lurasidone is coadministered with mild or moderate CYP3A4 inducers, the efficacy of \n\nlurasidone needs to be carefully monitored and a dose adjustment may be needed. \n\n \n\nTransporters  \n\nLurasidone is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP in vitro and the in vivo relevance of this is unclear. \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with P-gp and BCRP inhibitors may increase exposure to lurasidone. \n\n \n\nPotential for lurasidone to affect other medicinal products \n\n \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, resulted in a < 1.5-fold \n\nincrease in midazolam exposure. Monitoring is recommended when lurasidone and CYP3A4 \n\nsubstrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, \n\nquinidine, bepridil or ergot alkaloids [ergotamine, dihydroergotamine]) are coadministered.  \n\n \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with digoxin (a P-gp substrate) did not increase the exposure to \n\ndigoxin and only slightly increased Cmax (1.3 –fold) and therefore, it is considered that lurasidone can \n\nbe coadministered with digoxin. Lurasidone is an in vitro inhibitor of the efflux transporter P-gp and \n\nthe clinical relevance of intestinal P-gp inhibition cannot be excluded. Concomitant administration of \n\nthe P-gp substrate dabigatran etexilate may result in increased dabigatran plasma concentrations.  \n\n \n\nLurasidone is an in vitro inhibitor of the efflux transporter BCRP and the clinical relevance of \n\nintestinal BCRP inhibition cannot be excluded. Concomitant administration of BCRP substrates may \n\nresult in increases in the plasma concentrations of these substrates. \n\n \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with lithium indicated that lithium had clinically negligible effects on \n\nthe pharmacokinetics of lurasidone, therefore no dose adjustment of lurasidone is required when \n\ncoadministered with lithium. Lurasidone does not impact concentrations of lithium. \n\n \n\nA clinical drug interaction study investigating the effect of coadministration of lurasidone on patients \n\ntaking oral combination contraceptives including norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol, indicated that \n\nlurasidone had no clinically or statistically meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of the \n\ncontraceptive or sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels. Therefore, lurasidone can be \n\ncoadministered with oral contraceptives. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of lurasidone \n\nin pregnant women. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy, \n\nembryonal/foetal development, parturition and postnatal development (see section 5.3). The potential \n\nrisk for humans is unknown. Lurasidone should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly \n\nnecessary.  \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nNeonates exposed to antipsychotics (including lurasidone) during the third trimester are at risk of \n\nadverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that may vary in severity and \n\nduration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, \n\nsomnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborns should be monitored \n\ncarefully. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nLurasidone was excreted in milk of rats during lactation (see section 5.3). It is not known whether \n\nlurasidone or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Breast feeding in women receiving \n\nlurasidone should be considered only if the potential benefit of treatment justifies the potential risk to \n\nthe child. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nStudies in animals have shown a number of effects on fertility, mainly related to prolactin increase, \n\nwhich are not considered to be relevant to human reproduction (see section 5.3).  \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nLurasidone has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be cautioned \n\nabout operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that \n\nlurasidone does not affect them adversely (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe safety of lurasidone has been evaluated at doses of 18.5 -148 mg in clinical studies in patients \n\nwith schizophrenia treated for up to 52 weeks and in the post-marketing setting. The most common \n\nadverse drug reactions (ADRs) (≥ 10%) were akathisia and somnolence, which were dose-related up to \n\n111 mg daily. \n\n \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse drug reactions (ADRs) based upon pooled data are shown by system, organ class and by \n\npreferred term are listed below. The incidence of ADRs reported in clinical trials is tabulated by \n\nfrequency category. The following terms and frequencies are applied: very common (≥ 1/10), common \n\n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1000), very rare \n\n(<1 /10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

The incidence of akathisia for lurasidone-treated \n\nsubjects was 12.9% versus 3.0% for placebo-treated subjects. \n\n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nDystonia: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in \n\nsusceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of \n\nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, difficulty swallowing, difficulty \n\nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur \n\nmore frequently and with greater severity, higher potency and at higher doses of first generation \n\nantipsychotic medicinal products. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger \n\nage groups.  \n\n \n\nVenous thromboembolism: Cases of venous thromboembolism, including cases of pulmonary \n\nembolism and cases of deep vein thrombosis have been reported with antipsychotic drugs -Frequency \n\nunknown. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the following website: \n\nwww.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nManagement of overdose \n\n \n\nThere is no specific antidote to lurasidone, therefore, appropriate supportive measures should be \n\ninstituted and close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. \n\nCardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately, including continuous electrocardiographic \n\nmonitoring for possible arrhythmias. If antiarrhythmic therapy is administered, disopyramide, \n\nprocainamide, and quinidine carry a theoretical hazard of QT-prolonging effects when administered in \n\npatients with an acute overdose of lurasidone. Similarly the alpha-blocking properties of bretylium \n\nmight be additive to those of lurasidone, resulting in problematic hypotension. \n\n \n\nHypotension and circulatory collapse should be treated with appropriate measures. Adrenaline and \n\ndopamine should not be used, or other sympathomimetics with beta agonist activity, since beta \n\nstimulation may worsen hypotension in the setting of lurasidone-induced alpha blockade. In case of \n\nsevere extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic medicinal products should be administered. \n\n \n\nGastric lavage (after intubation if patient is unconscious) and administration of activated charcoal \n\ntogether with a laxative should be considered. \n\n \n\nThe possibility of obtundation, seizures, or dystonic reaction of the head and neck following overdose \n\nmay create a risk of aspiration with induced emesis. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, antipsychotics. ATC code: N05AE05 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nLurasidone is a selective blocking agent of dopamine and monoamine effects. Lurasidone binds \n\nstrongly to dopaminergic D2- and to serotonergic 5-HT2A and 5-HT7- receptors with high binding \n\naffinity of 0.994, 0.47 and 0.495 nM, respectively. It also blocks α2c-adrenergic receptors and \n\nα2a-adrenergic receptors with a binding affinity of 10.8 and 40.7 nM respectively. Lurasidone also \n\nexhibits partial agonism at the 5HT-1A receptor with a binding affinity of 6.38 nM. Lurasidone does \n\nnot bind to histaminergic or muscarinic receptors. \n\nhttp://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nThe mechanism of action of the minor active metabolite of lurasidone ID-14283 is similar to that of \n\nlurasidone. \n\n \n\nLurasidone doses ranging from 9 to 74 mg administered to healthy subjects produced a \n\ndose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand, in the caudate, \n\nputamen and ventral striatum detected by positron emission tomography. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nIn the main clinical efficacy studies, lurasidone was administered at doses of 37-148 mg lurasidone. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy \n\nThe efficacy of lurasidone in the treatment of schizophrenia was demonstrated in five multi-centre, \n\nplacebo-controlled, double-blind, 6-week trials in subjects who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual \n\nof Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for schizophrenia. Lurasidone doses, which \n\nvaried across the five trials, ranged from 37 to 148 mg lurasidone  once daily. In the short-term trials, \n\nthe primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the mean change from baseline to Week 6 in Positive \n\nand Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores, a validated multi-item inventory composed of \n\nfive factors to evaluate positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganised thoughts, uncontrolled \n\nhostility/excitement, and anxiety/depression. Lurasidone demonstrated superior efficacy compared \n\nwith placebo across Phase 3 studies (see Table 2). Lurasidone showed significant separation from \n\nplacebo from as early as Day 4. Additionally, lurasidone was superior to placebo on the predefined \n\nsecondary endpoint Clinical Global Impression – Severity (CGI-S) scale. Efficacy was also confirmed \n\nin a secondary analysis of treatment response (defined as ≥ 30% decrease from Baseline in PANSS \n\ntotal score).  \n\n \n\nTable 2 \n\nSchizophrenia Studies: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) Total \n\nScore - Change From Baseline to Week 6- MMRM for Studies D1050229, D1050231, and D1050233: \n\nIntent-to-Treat Analysis Set \n\n \n\nStudy Statistic Placebo Lurasidone dose (b)  Active \n\nControl \n\n(a) \n37 mg 74 mg 111 mg 148 mg \n\nStudy D1050229 N=124 N=121 N=118 N=123 -- -- \n\nBaseline Mean \n\n(SD) \n\n96.8 \n\n(11.1) \n\n96.5 \n\n(11.6) \n\n96.0 \n\n(10.8) \n96.0 (9.7) \n\n-- -- \n\nLS Mean Change \n\n(SE) \n-17.0 \n\n(1.8) \n\n-19.2 \n\n(1.7) \n\n-23.4 \n\n(1.8) \n\n-20.5 \n\n(1.8) \n\n-- -- \n\nTreatment Difference \n\nvs. placebo \n\n      \n\nEstimate (SE) -- -2.1 (2.5) -6.4 (2.5) -3.5 (2.5) -- -- \n\np-value -- 0.591 0.034 0.391 -- -- \n\nStudy D1050231 N=114 N=118 -- N=118 -- N=121 \n\nBaseline Mean \n\n(SD) \n\n95.8 \n\n(10.8) \n\n96.6 \n\n(10.7) \n\n-- 97.9 \n\n(11.3) \n\n-- 96.3 (12.2) \n\nLS Mean Change \n\n(SE) \n\n-16.0 \n\n(2.1) \n\n-25.7 \n\n(2.0) \n\n-- -23.6 \n\n(2.1) \n\n-- -28.7 (1.9) \n\nTreatment Difference \n\nvs. placebo \n\n      \n\nEstimate (SE) -- -9.7 (2.9) -- -7.5 (3.0) -- -12.6 (2.8) \n\np-value  -- 0.002 -- 0.022 -- <0.001 \n\nStudy D1050233 N=120 -- N=125 -- N=121 N=116 \n\nBaseline Mean \n\n(SD) \n\n96.6 \n\n(10.2) \n\n-- 97.7 (9.7) -- 97.9 \n\n(11.8) \n\n97.7 (10.2) \n\n\n\n28 \n\nStudy Statistic Placebo Lurasidone dose (b)  Active \n\nControl \n\n(a) \n37 mg 74 mg 111 mg 148 mg \n\nLS Mean Change \n\n(SE) \n\n-10.3 \n\n(1.8) \n\n-- -22.2 \n\n(1.8) \n\n-- -26.5 \n\n(1.8) \n\n-27.8 (1.8) \n\nTreatment Difference \n\nvs. placebo \n\n      \n\nEstimate (SE) -- -- -11.9 \n\n(2.6) \n\n-- -16.2 \n\n(2.5) \n\n-17.5 (2.6) \n\np-value  -- -- <0.001 -- <0.001 <0.001 \n\n(a) Olanzapine 15 mg in Study D1050231, quetiapine extended-release (XR) 600 mg in Study \n\nD1050233. \n\nN is number of subjects per model estimate. \n\n(b) p-values for lurasidone vs. placebo were adjusted for multiple comparisons. P-values for \n\nolanzapine and quetiapine XR vs. placebo were unadjusted. \n\n \n\n \n\nIn the short-term studies there was no consistent dose-response correlation observed. \n\n \n\nLong-term maintenance efficacy of lurasidone (37 to 148 mg lurasidone once daily) was demonstrated \n\nin a 12 month non-inferiority trial with quetiapine extended release  (200 to 800 mg once daily). \n\nLurasidone was non-inferior to quetiapine extended release in time to relapse of schizophrenia. \n\nLurasidone had a small increase from baseline to Month 12 in body weight and body mass index \n\n(Mean (SD): 0.73 (3.36) kg and 0.28 (1.17) kg/m2, respectively) compared to quetiapine extended \n\nrelease (1.23 (4.56) kg and 0.45 (1.63) kg/m2, respectively). Overall, lurasidone had a negligible effect \n\non weight and other metabolic parameters including total cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose levels. \n\n \n\nIn a long-term safety study clinically stable patients were treated using 37 – 111 mg lurasidone or \n\nrisperidone 2 – 6 mg. In that study the rate of relapse over a 12-month period was 20% for lurasidone \n\nand 16% for risperidone. This difference neared, but did not reach, statistical significance. \n\n \n\nIn a long-term trial designed to assess the maintenance of effect, lurasidone was more effective than \n\nplacebo in maintaining symptom control and delaying relapse of schizophrenia. After having been \n\ntreated for an acute episode and stabilized for a minimum of 12 weeks with lurasidone, patients were \n\nthen randomised in a double-blind manner to either continue on lurasidone or on placebo until they \n\nexperienced a relapse in schizophrenia symptoms. In the primary analysis of time to relapse in which \n\npatients that withdrew without relapse were censored at the time of withdrawal, patients on lurasidone \n\nshowed a significantly longer time to relapse compared with patients on placebo (p=0.039). The \n\nKaplan-Meier estimates of the probability of relapse at Week 28 were 42.2% for lurasidone and 51.2% \n\nfor placebo. The probability of all-cause discontinuation at Week 28 were 58.2% for lurasidone and \n\n69.9% for placebo (p=0.072). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nlurasidone in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in schizophrenia (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\nBipolar Depression \n\n \n\nThe short-term efficacy of lurasidone was studied in a 6-week multicentre, randomized, double-blind, \n\nplacebo-controlled, study of children and adolescent patients (10-17 years of age) who met Diagnostic \n\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) criteria for a major depressive \n\nepisode associated with bipolar I disorder, with or without rapid cycling, and without psychotic features \n\n(N=350). Patients were randomized to flexibly dosed lurasidone 18-74 mg once daily or placebo.  \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the mean change from baseline to Week 6 in Children's \n\nDepression Rating Scale, Revised (CDRS-R) Total Score. The key secondary endpoint was Clinical \n\nGlobal Impression – Bipolar Version, Severity of Illness (CGI-BP-S) Depression Score. Statistically \n\nsignificant differences favouring lurasidone over placebo were shown for these endpoints for the total \n\npopulation studied, beginning at Week 2 and were maintained at each study visit through to the end of \n\nthe study. However, the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints were not met in younger \n\npatients (below 15 years of age). Placebo-adjusted LS mean change (95% CI) from Baseline to Week 6 \n\nLOCF in CDRS-R total score for the lurasidone group was -1.8 (-5.6, 2.0) for subjects in the 10- to 14-\n\nyear-old age patients and was -8.6 (-12.4, -4.8) for subjects in the 15- to 17-year-old age patients.  \n\n \n\nThe safety profile of lurasidone in children included in this short-term study is in general consistent \n\nwith that observed when treated within the approved indication in adults, however, differences in \n\nfrequency of the most commonly occurred adverse reactions have been observed in paediatric patients \n\nfor nausea (very common), diarrhea (common) and decreased appetite (common), compared with \n\nadults (common, unknown, and uncommon, respectively). \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2.1 Bipolar Depression Paediatric Study: Children's Depression Rating Scale, Revised (CDRS-R) \n\nTotal Score and Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Version, Severity of Illness (CGI-BP-S) Depression \n\nScore (Depression) - Change From Baseline to Week 6 - MMRM for Study D1050326: Intent-to-Treat \n\nAnalysis Set \n\nParameters Study Statistic Placebo Lurasidone dose 18.5-74 \n\nmg (a) (b) \n\nPrimary Endpoint: \n\nCDRS-R Total Score  \n N=170 N=173 \n\nBaseline Mean (SD) 58.6 (8.26) 59.2 (8.24) \n\nLS Mean Change (SE) -15.3 (1.08) -21.0 (1.06) \n\nTreatment Difference vs. \n\nplacebo \n\n  \n\nEstimate (SE; 95% CI) -- -5.7 (1.39; -8.4 to -3.0) \n\np-value -- <0.0001 \n\n    \n\nKey Secondary \n\nEndpoint: CGI-BP-S \n\nDepression Score \n\n N=170 N=173 \n\nBaseline Mean (SD) 4.5 4.6 \n\nLS Mean Change (SE) -1.05 (0.087) -1.49 (0.085) \n\nTreatment Difference vs. \n\nplacebo \n\n  \n\nEstimate (SE; 95% CI) -- -0.44 (0.112; -0.66 to -0.22) \n\np-value  -- <0.0001 \n\nN is number of subjects. \n\n(a) p-values for lurasidone vs. placebo were adjusted for multiple comparisons.  \n\n(b) Lurasidone doses of 18.5, 37, 55.5, 74 mg are equivalent to 20, 40, 60 and 80 amounts of lurasidone hydrochloride. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nLurasidone reaches peak serum concentrations in approximately 1-3 hours.  \n\n \n\nIn a food effect study, lurasidone mean Cmax and AUC increased approximately by 2-3-times and \n\n1.5-2-times, respectively, when administered with food compared to the levels observed under fasting \n\nconditions.  \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of 37 mg of lurasidone, the mean approximate apparent volume of \n\ndistribution was 6000 L. Lurasidone is highly bound (~99%) to serum proteins. \n\n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nLurasidone is metabolised mainly via CYP3A4. The major biotransformation pathways are oxidative \n\nN-dealkylation, hydroxylation of norbornane ring, and S-oxidation. \n\n \n\nLurasidone is metabolised into two active metabolites (ID-14283 and ID-14326) and two non-active \n\nmetabolites (ID-20219 and ID-20220). Lurasidone and its metabolites ID-14283, ID-14326, ID-20219 \n\nand ID-20220 correspond to approximately 11.4, 4.1, 0.4, 24 and 11% respectively, of serum \n\nradioactivity respectively. \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for metabolism of the active metabolite ID-14283. \n\nLurasidone and its active metabolite ID-14283 both contribute to the pharmacodynamic effect at the \n\ndopaminergic and serotonergic receptors.  \n\n \n\nBased on in vitro studies lurasidone is not a substrate of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP4A11, \n\nCYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP2E1 enzymes. \n\n \n\nIn vitro, lurasidone demonstrated no direct, or weak inhibition (direct or time-dependent) (IC50>5.9 \n\nμM) of the enzymes cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, \n\nCYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Based on this data, lurasidone is not expected to affect the \n\npharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, \n\nCYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. For administration of medicinal products that are substrates of \n\nCYP3A4 with a narrow therapeutic range, see section 4.5.  \n\n \n\nLurasidone is an in vitro substrate of the efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP. Lurasidone is not subject \n\nto active uptake transport by OATP1B1 or OATP1B3.  \n\n \n\nLurasidone is an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP and OCT1 in vitro (see section 4.5). Lurasidone is not \n\nexpected to have a clinically relevant inhibitory potential on transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, \n\nOCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, MATE2K or BSEP based on in vitro data. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of lurasidone, the elimination half-life was 20-40 hours. Following oral \n\nadministration of a radiolabelled dose, approximately 67% dose was recovered in faeces and 19% in \n\nurine. Urine comprised mostly of a number of metabolites with minimal renal excretion of parent \n\ncompound.  \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of lurasidone is dose-proportional within a total daily dose range of 18.5 mg to \n\n148 mg. Steady-state concentrations of lurasidone are reached within 7 days of starting lurasidone. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups: \n\n \n\nElderly people \n\nLimited data have been collected in healthy subjects ≥ 65 years. Of the data collected, similar \n\nexposure was obtained compared with subjects < 65 years. However, an increase in exposure in \n\nelderly subjects may be expected for patients if they have impaired renal or hepatic function.  \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe serum concentrations of lurasidone are increased in healthy subjects with Child-Pugh Class A, B \n\nand C hepatic impairment with an increased exposure of 1.5-, 1.7- and 3-fold respectively. \n\n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe serum concentrations of lurasidone are increased in healthy subjects with mild, moderate and \n\nsevere renal impairment with an increased exposure of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0-fold respectively. Subjects \n\nwith ESRD (CrCl<15 ml/min) have not been investigated. \n\n \n\nGender \n\nThere were no clinically relevant differences between genders in the pharmacokinetics of lurasidone in \n\na population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with schizophrenia. \n\n \n\nRace \n\nThere were no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of lurasidone in a population \n\npharmacokinetic analysis in patients with schizophrenia. It was noted that Asian subjects had 1.5-fold \n\nincreased exposure to lurasidone compared to Caucasian subjects. \n\n \n\nSmoking \n\nBased on in vitro studies utilising human liver enzymes, lurasidone is not a substrate for CYP1A2; \n\nsmoking should, therefore, not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of lurasidone. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of lurasidone in paediatric patients was investigated in 49 children aged \n\n6-12 years and 56 adolescents aged 13-17 years. Lurasidone was administered as lurasidone \n\nhydrochloride at daily doses of either 20, 40, 80, 120 mg (6-17 years) or 160 mg (10-17 years only) for \n\n7 days. There was no clear correlation between obtained plasma exposure and age or body weight. The \n\npharmacokinetics of lurasidone in paediatric patients aged 6–17 years was generally comparable to \n\nthose observed in adults. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. Major findings in \n\nrepeat-dose toxicity studies of lurasidone were centrally-mediated endocrine changes resulting from \n\nserum prolactin elevations in rats, dogs and monkeys. High serum prolactin levels in long-term \n\nrepeat-dose studies in female rats were associated with effects on bones, adrenal glands, and \n\nreproductive tissues. In a long-term dog repeat-dose study, high serum prolactin levels were associated \n\nwith effects on male and female reproductive tissues. \n\n \n\nIn rats, lurasidone had no effect on male and female reproduction at oral doses of 150 and \n\n0.1 mg/kg/day lurasidone hydrochloride, respectively, or on early embryonic development at an oral \n\ndose of 15 mg/kg/day lurasidone hydrochloride.  \n\n \n\nA fertility study in female rats resulted in prolonged oestrous cycle and delayed copulation at \n\n≥1.5 mg/kg/day lurasidone hydrochloride, whilst the copulation and fertility indices, and the numbers \n\nof corpora lutea, implantations and live foetuses were decreased at 150 mg/kg/day lurasidone \n\nhydrochloride. These effects were due to the hyperprolactinemia following lurasidone treatment, \n\naffecting the oestrous cycle and copulatory behaviour as well as the maintenance of corpus luteum of \n\nthe female rats, resulting in a decrease in implantation and the number of live foetuses. These \n\nprolactin-related effects are not considered to be relevant to human reproduction. \n\n \n\nA single dose of 10 mg/kg lurasidone hydrochloride to pregnant rats resulted in fetal exposure. In a \n\ndose range finding study in pregnant rats, 150 mg/kg/day lurasidone hydrochloride caused fetal growth \n\nretardation without signs of teratogenicity. Lurasidone was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits at an \n\nexposure similar to or below the maximum recommended human dose (148 mg lurasidone). \n\n \n\nLurasidone was excreted in milk of rats during lactation. \n\n \n\nLurasidone was not genotoxic in a battery of tests. Mammary gland and/or pituitary gland tumours \n\nwere observed in the mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies and are most likely due to the increased \n\n\n\n32 \n\nblood prolactin levels. These findings are common in rodents treated with antipsychotic medicinal \n\nproducts with dopamine D2 blocking activity and are considered to be rodent-specific.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nLatuda 74 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains lurasidone hydrochloride equivalent to 74.5 mg lurasidone. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n\n \n\nPale green, film-coated oval tablets of 12 mm x 7 mm debossed with ‘LD’ \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nLatuda is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults aged 18 years and over. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 37 mg of lurasidone once daily. No initial dose titration is required. \n\nIt is effective in a dose range of 37 to 148 mg once daily. Dose increase should be based on physician \n\njudgement and observed clinical response. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 148 mg. \n\n \n\nPatients on doses higher than 111 mg once daily who discontinue their treatment for longer than \n\n3 days should be restarted on 111 mg once daily and up-titrated to their optimal dose. For all other \n\ndoses patients can be restarted on their previous dose without need for up-titration. \n\n \n\nDose adjustment due to interactions \n\nA starting dose of 18.5 mg is recommended and the maximum dose of lurasidone should not exceed \n\n74 mg once daily in combination with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Dose adjustment of lurasidone \n\nmay be necessary in combination with mild and moderate CYP3A4 inducers (see section 4.5). For \n\nstrong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers see section 4.3. \n\n \n\nSwitching between antipsychotic medicinal products \n\nDue to different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles among antipsychotic medicinal \n\nproducts, supervision by a clinician is needed when switching to another antipsychotic product is \n\nconsidered medically appropriate. \n\n \n\nElderly people \n\nDosing recommendations for elderly patients with normal renal function (CrCl ≥ 80 ml/min) are the \n\nsame as for adults with normal renal function. However, because elderly patients may have diminished \n\nrenal function, dose adjustments may be required according to their renal function status (see “Renal \n\nimpairment” below). \n\n \n\nLimited data are available in elderly people treated with higher doses of lurasidone. No data are \n\navailable in elderly people treated with 148 mg of lurasidone. Caution should be exercised when \n\ntreating patients ≥65 years of age with higher doses of lurasidone. \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment of lurasidone is required in patients with mild renal impairment. \n\nIn patients with moderate (Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 and < 50 ml/min), severe renal \n\nimpairment (CrCL >15 and < 30 ml/min) and End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients \n\n(CrCl < 15 ml/min), the recommended starting dose is 18.5 mg and the maximum dose should not \n\nexceed 74 mg once daily. Lurasidone should not be used in patients with ESRD unless the potential \n\nbenefits outweigh the potential risks. If used in ESRD, clinical monitoring is advised. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment of lurasidone is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment. \n\nDose adjustment is recommended in moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) and severe hepatic impairment \n\n(Child-Pugh Class C) patients. The recommended starting dose is 18.5 mg. The maximum daily dose \n\nin moderate hepatic impairment patients should not exceed 74 mg and in severe hepatic impairment \n\npatients should not exceed 37 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of lurasidone in children aged less than 18 years have not been established. \n\nCurrent available data are described in section 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can \n\nbe made. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nLatuda film-coated tablets are for oral use, to be taken once daily together with a meal. \n\nIf taken without food, it is anticipated that lurasidone exposure will be significantly lower as compared \n\nto when taken with food (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nLatuda tablets should be swallowed whole, in order to mask the bitter taste. Latuda tablets should be \n\ntaken at the same time every day to aid compliance.  \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. boceprevir, clarithromycin, \n\ncobicistat, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, \n\nritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole) and strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. \n\ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) \n\n(see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take a few days to \n\nsome weeks. Patients should be closely monitored during this period.  \n\n \n\nSuicidality  \n\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and in some cases has been \n\nreported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy. Close supervision of high-risk \n\npatients should accompany antipsychotic therapy. \n\n \n\nParkinson’s disease \n\nIf prescribed to patients with Parkinson’s disease, antipsychotic medicinal products may exacerbate \n\nthe underlying parkinsonism symptoms. Physicians should therefore weigh the risks versus the \n\nbenefits when prescribing lurasidone to patients with Parkinson’s disease. \n\n \n\nExtrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) \n\nMedicinal products with dopamine receptor antagonistic properties have been associated with \n\nextrapyramidal adverse reactions including rigidity, tremors, mask-like face, dystonias, drooling of \n\n\n\n36 \n\nsaliva, drooped posture and abnormal gait. In placebo controlled clinical studies in adult patients with \n\nschizophrenia there was an increased occurrence of EPS following treatment with lurasidone \n\ncompared to placebo. \n\n \n\nTardive dyskinesia \n\nMedicinal products with dopamine receptor antagonistic properties have been associated with the \n\ninduction of tardive dyskinesia characterised by rhythmical involuntary movements, predominantly of \n\nthe tongue and/or face. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear, the discontinuation of all \n\nantipsychotics, including lurasidone, should be considered.  \n\n \n\nCardiovascular disorders/QT prolongation \n\nCaution should be exercised when lurasidone is prescribed in patients with known cardiovascular \n\ndisease or family history of QT prolongation, hypokalaemia, and in concomitant use with other \n\nmedicinal products thought to prolong the QT interval. \n\n \n\nSeizures \n\nLurasidone should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or other conditions that \n\npotentially lower the seizure threshold.  \n\n \n\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) \n\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome, characterised by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic \n\ninstability, altered consciousness and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase levels, has been reported \n\nto occur lurasidone. Additional signs may include myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal \n\nfailure. In this event, lurasidone should be discontinued.  \n\n \n\nElderly patients with dementia \n\nLurasidone has not been studied in elderly patients with dementia. \n\n \n\nOverall mortality  \n\nIn a meta-analysis of 17 controlled clinical trials, elderly patients with dementia treated with other \n\natypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, and quetiapine had an \n\nincreased risk of mortality compared to placebo. \n\n \n\nCerebrovascular accident \n\nAn approximately 3-fold increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse reactions has been seen in \n\nrandomised placebo-controlled clinical trials in the dementia population with some atypical \n\nantipsychotics, including risperidone, aripiprazole and olanzapine. The mechanism for this increased \n\nrisk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for other antipsychotics or other patient \n\npopulations. Lurasidone should be used with caution in elderly patients with dementia who have risk \n\nfactors for stroke. \n\n \n\nVenous thromboembolism \n\nCases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with antipsychotic medicinal products. \n\nSince patients treated with antipsychotics often present with acquired risk factors for VTE, all possible \n\nrisk factors for VTE should be identified before and during treatment with lurasidone and preventive \n\nmeasures undertaken. \n\n \n\nHyperprolactinaemia \n\nLurasidone elevates prolactin levels due to antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors.   Patients should \n\nbe counseled on signs and symptoms of elevated prolactin, such as gynecomastia, \n\ngalactorrhea, amenorrhea and erectile dysfunction. Patient should be advised to seek medical \n\nattention if they experience any signs and symptoms \n \n\nWeight gain \n\nWeight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Clinical monitoring of weight is \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nHyperglycaemia \n\nRare cases of glucose related adverse reactions, e.g. increase in blood glucose, have been reported in \n\nclinical trials with lurasidone. Appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable in diabetic patients and in \n\npatients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus. \n\n \n\nOrthostatic hypotension/syncope \n\nLurasidone may cause orthostatic hypotension, perhaps due to its α1-adrenergic receptor antagonism. \n\nMonitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in patients who are vulnerable to \n\nhypotension. \n\n \n\nInteraction with grapefruit juice  \n\nGrapefruit juice should be avoided during treatment with lurasidone (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic interactions \n\n \n\nGiven the primary central nervous system effects of lurasidone, lurasidone should be used with \n\ncaution in combination with other centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol.  \n\n \n\nCaution is advised when prescribing lurasidone with medicinal products known to prolong the QT \n\ninterval, e.g. class IA antiarrhythmics (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide) and class III antiarrhythmics (e.g. \n\namiodarone, sotalol), some antihistaminics, some other antipsychotics and some antimalarials (e.g. \n\nmefloquine).  \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n\n \n\nThe concomitant administration of lurasidone and grapefruit juice has not been assessed. Grapefruit \n\njuice inhibits CYP 3A4 and may increase the serum concentration of lurasidone. Grapefruit juice \n\nshould be avoided during treatment with lurasidone. \n\n \n\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect lurasidone  \n\n \n\nLurasidone and its active metabolite ID-14283 both contribute to the pharmacodynamic effect at the \n\ndopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. Lurasidone and its active metabolite ID-14283 are primarily \n\nmetabolised by CYP3A4.  \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nLurasidone is contraindicated with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. boceprevir, clarithromycin, \n\ncobicistat, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, \n\nsaquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole) (see section 4.3).  \n\n \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole resulted in a 9- and \n\n6-fold increase in exposure of lurasidone and its active metabolite ID-14283 respectively.  \n\n \n\nCo-administration of lurasidone and posaconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) resulted in an \n\napproximate 4-5 fold increase in lurasidone exposure.  A persistent effect of posaconazole on \n\nlurasidone exposure was observed up to 2-3 weeks after stop of posaconazole co-administration. \n\n \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with medicinal products that moderately inhibit CYP3A4 (e.g. \n\ndiltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole verapamil) may increase exposure to lurasidone. Moderate \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors are estimated to result in a 2-5-fold increase in exposure of CYP3A4 substrates. \n\n \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with diltiazem (slow-release formulation), a moderate CYP3A4 \n\ninhibitor, resulted in a 2.2 and 2.4-fold increase in exposure of lurasidone and ID-14283 respectively \n\n(see section 4.2). The use of an immediate release formulation of diltiazem could result in a larger \n\nincrease in lurasidone exposure. \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 inducers \n\nLurasidone is contraindicated with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, \n\nphenytoin, rifampicin, St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin resulted in a 6-fold \n\ndecrease in exposure of lurasidone. \n\n \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with mild (e.g. armodafinil, amprenavir, aprepitant, prednisone, \n\nrufinamide) or moderate (e.g. bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcillin) inducers of \n\nCYP3A4 would be expected to give a <2-fold reduction in lurasidone exposure during \n\nco-administration and for up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of mild or moderate CYP3A4 inducers. \n\n \n\nWhen lurasidone is coadministered with mild or moderate CYP3A4 inducers, the efficacy of \n\nlurasidone needs to be carefully monitored and a dose adjustment may be needed. \n\n \n\nTransporters  \n\nLurasidone is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP in vitro and the in vivo relevance of this is unclear. \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with P-gp and BCRP inhibitors may increase exposure to lurasidone. \n\n \n\nPotential for lurasidone to affect other medicinal products \n\n \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, resulted in a < 1.5-fold \n\nincrease in midazolam exposure. Monitoring is recommended when lurasidone and CYP3A4 \n\nsubstrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, \n\nquinidine, bepridil or ergot alkaloids [ergotamine, dihydroergotamine]) are coadministered.  \n\n \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with digoxin (a P-gp substrate) did not increase the exposure to \n\ndigoxin and only slightly increased Cmax (1.3 –fold) and therefore, it is considered that lurasidone can \n\nbe coadministered with digoxin. Lurasidone is an in vitro inhibitor of the efflux transporter P-gp and \n\nthe clinical relevance of intestinal P-gp inhibition cannot be excluded. Concomitant administration of \n\nthe P-gp substrate dabigatran etexilate may result in increased dabigatran plasma concentrations.  \n\n \n\nLurasidone is an in vitro inhibitor of the efflux transporter BCRP and the clinical relevance of \n\nintestinal BCRP inhibition cannot be excluded. Concomitant administration of BCRP substrates may \n\nresult in increases in the plasma concentrations of these substrates. \n\n \n\nCoadministration of lurasidone with lithium indicated that lithium had clinically negligible effects on \n\nthe pharmacokinetics of lurasidone, therefore no dose adjustment of lurasidone is required when \n\ncoadministered with lithium. Lurasidone does not impact concentrations of lithium. \n\n \n\nA clinical drug interaction study investigating the effect of coadministration of lurasidone on patients \n\ntaking oral combination contraceptives including norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol, indicated that \n\nlurasidone had no clinically or statistically meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of the \n\ncontraceptive or sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels. Therefore, lurasidone can be \n\ncoadministered with oral contraceptives. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of lurasidone \n\nin pregnant women. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy, \n\nembryonal/foetal development, parturition and postnatal development (see section 5.3). The potential \n\nrisk for humans is unknown. Lurasidone should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly \n\nnecessary.  \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n\nNeonates exposed to antipsychotics (including lurasidone) during the third trimester are at risk of \n\nadverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that may vary in severity and \n\nduration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, \n\nsomnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborns should be monitored \n\ncarefully. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nLurasidone was excreted in milk of rats during lactation (see section 5.3). It is not known whether \n\nlurasidone or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Breast feeding in women receiving \n\nlurasidone should be considered only if the potential benefit of treatment justifies the potential risk to \n\nthe child. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nStudies in animals have shown a number of effects on fertility, mainly related to prolactin increase, \n\nwhich are not considered to be relevant to human reproduction (see section 5.3).  \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nLurasidone has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be cautioned \n\nabout operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that \n\nlurasidone does not affect them adversely (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe safety of lurasidone has been evaluated at doses of 18.5 -148 mg in clinical studies in patients \n\nwith schizophrenia treated for up to 52 weeks and in the post-marketing setting. The most common \n\nadverse drug reactions (ADRs) (≥ 10%) were akathisia and somnolence, which were dose-related up to \n\n111 mg daily. \n\n \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse drug reactions (ADRs) based upon pooled data are shown by system, organ class and by \n\npreferred term are listed below. The incidence of ADRs reported in clinical trials is tabulated by \n\nfrequency category. The following terms and frequencies are applied: very common (≥ 1/10), common \n\n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1000), very rare \n\n(<1 /10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

The incidence of akathisia for lurasidone-treated \n\nsubjects was 12.9% versus 3.0% for placebo-treated subjects. \n\n \n\nDystonia: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in \n\nsusceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of \n\nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, difficulty swallowing, difficulty \n\nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur \n\nmore frequently and with greater severity, higher potency and at higher doses of first generation \n\nantipsychotic medicinal products. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger \n\nage groups.  \n\n \n\nVenous thromboembolism: Cases of venous thromboembolism, including cases of pulmonary \n\nembolism and cases of deep vein thrombosis have been reported with antipsychotic drugs -Frequency \n\nunknown. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the following website: \n\nwww.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nManagement of overdose \n\n \n\nThere is no specific antidote to lurasidone, therefore, appropriate supportive measures should be \n\ninstituted and close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. \n\nCardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately, including continuous electrocardiographic \n\nmonitoring for possible arrhythmias. If antiarrhythmic therapy is administered, disopyramide, \n\nprocainamide, and quinidine carry a theoretical hazard of QT-prolonging effects when administered in \n\npatients with an acute overdose of lurasidone. Similarly the alpha-blocking properties of bretylium \n\nmight be additive to those of lurasidone, resulting in problematic hypotension. \n\n \n\nHypotension and circulatory collapse should be treated with appropriate measures. Adrenaline and \n\ndopamine should not be used, or other sympathomimetics with beta agonist activity, since beta \n\nstimulation may worsen hypotension in the setting of lurasidone-induced alpha blockade. In case of \n\nsevere extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic medicinal products should be administered. \n\n \n\nGastric lavage (after intubation if patient is unconscious) and administration of activated charcoal \n\ntogether with a laxative should be considered. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard\n\n\n43 \n\nThe possibility of obtundation, seizures, or dystonic reaction of the head and neck following overdose \n\nmay create a risk of aspiration with induced emesis. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, antipsychotics. ATC code: N05AE05 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nLurasidone is a selective blocking agent of dopamine and monoamine effects. Lurasidone binds \n\nstrongly to dopaminergic D2- and to serotonergic 5-HT2A and 5-HT7- receptors with high binding \n\naffinity of 0.994, 0.47 and 0.495 nM, respectively. It also blocks α2c-adrenergic receptors and \n\nα2a-adrenergic receptors with a binding affinity of 10.8 and 40.7 nM respectively. Lurasidone also \n\nexhibits partial agonism at the 5HT-1A receptor with a binding affinity of 6.38 nM. Lurasidone does \n\nnot bind to histaminergic or muscarinic receptors. \n\n \n\nThe mechanism of action of the minor active metabolite of lurasidone ID-14283 is similar to that of \n\nlurasidone. \n\n \n\nLurasidone doses ranging from 9 to 74 mg  administered to healthy subjects produced a \n\ndose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand, in the caudate, \n\nputamen and ventral striatum detected by positron emission tomography. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nIn the main clinical efficacy studies, lurasidone was administered at doses of 37-148 mg lurasidone. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy \n\nThe efficacy of lurasidone in the treatment of schizophrenia was demonstrated in five multi-centre, \n\nplacebo-controlled, double-blind, 6-week trials in subjects who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual \n\nof Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for schizophrenia. Lurasidone doses, which \n\nvaried across the five trials, ranged from 37 to 148 mg lurasidone once daily. In the short-term trials, \n\nthe primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the mean change from baseline to Week 6 in Positive \n\nand Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores, a validated multi-item inventory composed of \n\nfive factors to evaluate positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganised thoughts, uncontrolled \n\nhostility/excitement, and anxiety/depression. Lurasidone demonstrated superior efficacy compared \n\nwith placebo across Phase 3 studies (see Table 2). Lurasidone showed significant separation from \n\nplacebo from as early as Day 4. Additionally, lurasidone was superior to placebo on the predefined \n\nsecondary endpoint Clinical Global Impression – Severity (CGI-S) scale. Efficacy was also confirmed \n\nin a secondary analysis of treatment response (defined as ≥ 30% decrease from Baseline in PANSS \n\ntotal score).  \n\n \n\nTable 2 \n\nSchizophrenia Studies: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) Total \n\nScore - Change From Baseline to Week 6- MMRM for Studies D1050229, D1050231, and D1050233: \n\nIntent-to-Treat Analysis Set \n\n \n\nStudy Statistic Placebo Lurasidone dose (b)  Active \n\nControl \n\n(a) \n37 mg 74 mg 111 mg 148 mg \n\nStudy D1050229 N=124 N=121 N=118 N=123 -- -- \n\nBaseline Mean \n\n(SD) \n\n96.8 \n\n(11.1) \n\n96.5 \n\n(11.6) \n\n96.0 \n\n(10.8) \n96.0 (9.7) \n\n-- -- \n\n\n\n44 \n\nStudy Statistic Placebo Lurasidone dose (b)  Active \n\nControl \n\n(a) \n37 mg 74 mg 111 mg 148 mg \n\nLS Mean Change \n\n(SE) \n-17.0 \n\n(1.8) \n\n-19.2 \n\n(1.7) \n\n-23.4 \n\n(1.8) \n\n-20.5 \n\n(1.8) \n\n-- -- \n\nTreatment Difference \n\nvs. placebo \n\n      \n\nEstimate (SE) -- -2.1 (2.5) -6.4 (2.5) -3.5 (2.5) -- -- \n\np-value -- 0.591 0.034 0.391 -- -- \n\nStudy D1050231 N=114 N=118 -- N=118 -- N=121 \n\nBaseline Mean \n\n(SD) \n\n95.8 \n\n(10.8) \n\n96.6 \n\n(10.7) \n\n-- 97.9 \n\n(11.3) \n\n-- 96.3 (12.2) \n\nLS Mean Change \n\n(SE) \n\n-16.0 \n\n(2.1) \n\n-25.7 \n\n(2.0) \n\n-- -23.6 \n\n(2.1) \n\n-- -28.7 (1.9) \n\nTreatment Difference \n\nvs. placebo \n\n      \n\nEstimate (SE) -- -9.7 (2.9) -- -7.5 (3.0) -- -12.6 (2.8) \n\np-value  -- 0.002 -- 0.022 -- <0.001 \n\nStudy D1050233 N=120 -- N=125 -- N=121 N=116 \n\nBaseline Mean \n\n(SD) \n\n96.6 \n\n(10.2) \n\n-- 97.7 (9.7) -- 97.9 \n\n(11.8) \n\n97.7 (10.2) \n\nLS Mean Change \n\n(SE) \n\n-10.3 \n\n(1.8) \n\n-- -22.2 \n\n(1.8) \n\n-- -26.5 \n\n(1.8) \n\n-27.8 (1.8) \n\nTreatment Difference \n\nvs. placebo \n\n      \n\nEstimate (SE) -- -- -11.9 \n\n(2.6) \n\n-- -16.2 \n\n(2.5) \n\n-17.5 (2.6) \n\np-value  -- -- <0.001 -- <0.001 <0.001 \n\n(a) Olanzapine 15 mg in Study D1050231, quetiapine extended-release (XR) 600 mg in Study \n\nD1050233. \n\nN is number of subjects per model estimate. \n\n(b) p-values for lurasidone vs. placebo were adjusted for multiple comparisons. P-values for \n\nolanzapine and quetiapine XR vs. placebo were unadjusted. \n\n \n\nIn the short-term studies there was no consistent dose-response correlation observed. \n\n \n\nLong-term maintenance efficacy of lurasidone (37 to 148 mg lurasidone once) was demonstrated in a \n\n12 month non-inferiority trial with quetiapine extended release (200 to 800 mg once daily). \n\nLurasidone was non-inferior to quetiapine extended release in time to relapse of schizophrenia. \n\nLurasidone had a small increase from baseline to Month 12 in body weight and body mass index \n\n(Mean (SD): 0.73 (3.36) kg and 0.28 (1.17) kg/m2, respectively) compared to quetiapine extended \n\nrelease (1.23 (4.56) kg and 0.45 (1.63) kg/m2, respectively). Overall, lurasidone had a negligible effect \n\non weight and other metabolic parameters including total cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose levels. \n\n \n\nIn a long-term safety study clinically stable patients were treated using 37 – 111 mg lurasidone or \n\nrisperidone 2 – 6 mg. In that study the rate of relapse over a 12-month period was 20% for lurasidone \n\nand 16% for risperidone. This difference neared, but did not reach, statistical significance. \n\n \n\nIn a long-term trial designed to assess the maintenance of effect, lurasidone was more effective than \n\nplacebo in maintaining symptom control and delaying relapse of schizophrenia. After having been \n\ntreated for an acute episode and stabilized for a minimum of 12 weeks with lurasidone, patients were \n\nthen randomised in a double-blind manner to either continue on lurasidone or on placebo until they \n\nexperienced a relapse in schizophrenia symptoms. In the primary analysis of time to relapse in which \n\npatients that withdrew without relapse were censored at the time of withdrawal, patients on lurasidone \n\nshowed a significantly longer time to relapse compared with patients on placebo (p=0.039). The \n\nKaplan-Meier estimates of the probability of relapse at Week 28 were 42.2% for lurasidone and 51.2% \n\n\n\n45 \n\nfor placebo. The probability of all-cause discontinuation at Week 28 were 58.2% for lurasidone and \n\n69.9% for placebo (p=0.072). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nlurasidone in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in schizophrenia (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\nBipolar Depression \n\n \n\nThe short-term efficacy of lurasidone was studied in a 6-week multicentre, randomized, double-blind, \n\nplacebo-controlled, study of children and adolescent patients (10-17 years of age) who met Diagnostic \n\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) criteria for a major depressive \n\nepisode associated with bipolar I disorder, with or without rapid cycling, and without psychotic features \n\n(N=350). Patients were randomized to flexibly dosed lurasidone 18-74 mg once daily or placebo.  \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the mean change from baseline to Week 6 in Children's \n\nDepression Rating Scale, Revised (CDRS-R) Total Score. The key secondary endpoint was Clinical \n\nGlobal Impression – Bipolar Version, Severity of Illness (CGI-BP-S) Depression Score. Statistically \n\nsignificant differences favouring lurasidone over placebo were shown for these endpoints for the total \n\npopulation studied, beginning at Week 2 and were maintained at each study visit through to the end of \n\nthe study. However, the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints were not met in younger \n\npatients (below 15 years of age). Placebo-adjusted LS mean change (95% CI) from Baseline to Week 6 \n\nLOCF in CDRS-R total score for the lurasidone group was -1.8 (-5.6, 2.0) for subjects in the 10- to 14-\n\nyear-old age patients and was -8.6 (-12.4, -4.8) for subjects in the 15- to 17-year-old age patients.  \n\n \n\nThe safety profile of lurasidone in children included in this short-term study is in general consistent \n\nwith that observed when treated within the approved indication in adults, however, differences in \n\nfrequency of the most commonly occurred adverse reactions have been observed in paediatric patients \n\nfor nausea (very common), diarrhea (common) and decreased appetite (common), compared with \n\nadults (common, unknown, and uncommon, respectively). \n\n \n\nTable 2.1 Bipolar Depression Paediatric Study: Children's Depression Rating Scale, Revised (CDRS-R) \n\nTotal Score and Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Version, Severity of Illness (CGI-BP-S) Depression \n\nScore (Depression) - Change From Baseline to Week 6 - MMRM for Study D1050326: Intent-to-Treat \n\nAnalysis Set \n\nParameters Study Statistic Placebo Lurasidone dose 18.5-74 \n\nmg (a) (b) \n\nPrimary Endpoint: \n\nCDRS-R Total Score  \n N=170 N=173 \n\nBaseline Mean (SD) 58.6 (8.26) 59.2 (8.24) \n\nLS Mean Change (SE) -15.3 (1.08) -21.0 (1.06) \n\nTreatment Difference vs. \n\nplacebo \n\n  \n\nEstimate (SE; 95% CI) -- -5.7 (1.39; -8.4 to -3.0) \n\np-value -- <0.0001 \n\n    \n\nKey Secondary \n\nEndpoint: CGI-BP-S \n\nDepression Score \n\n N=170 N=173 \n\nBaseline Mean (SD) 4.5 4.6 \n\nLS Mean Change (SE) -1.05 (0.087) -1.49 (0.085) \n\nTreatment Difference vs. \n\nplacebo \n\n  \n\nEstimate (SE; 95% CI) -- -0.44 (0.112; -0.66 to -0.22) \n\np-value  -- <0.0001 \n\nN is number of subjects. \n\n(a) p-values for lurasidone vs. placebo were adjusted for multiple comparisons.  \n\n(b) Lurasidone doses of 18.5, 37, 55.5, 74 mg are equivalent to 20, 40, 60 and 80 amounts of lurasidone hydrochloride. \n\n \n\n\n\n46 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nLurasidone reaches peak serum concentrations in approximately 1-3 hours.  \n\n \n\nIn a food effect study, lurasidone mean Cmax and AUC increased approximately by 2-3-times and \n\n1.5-2-times, respectively, when administered with food compared to the levels observed under fasting \n\nconditions.  \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of 37 mg of lurasidone, the mean approximate apparent volume of \n\ndistribution was 6000 L. Lurasidone is highly bound (~99%) to serum proteins. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nLurasidone is metabolised mainly via CYP3A4. The major biotransformation pathways are oxidative \n\nN-dealkylation, hydroxylation of norbornane ring, and S-oxidation. \n\n \n\nLurasidone is metabolised into two active metabolites (ID-14283 and ID-14326) and two non-active \n\nmetabolites (ID-20219 and ID-20220). Lurasidone and its metabolites ID-14283, ID-14326, ID-20219 \n\nand ID-20220 correspond to approximately 11.4, 4.1, 0.4, 24 and 11% respectively, of serum \n\nradioactivity respectively. \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for metabolism of the active metabolite ID-14283. \n\nLurasidone and its active metabolite ID-14283 both contribute to the pharmacodynamic effect at the \n\ndopaminergic and serotonergic receptors.  \n\n \n\nBased on in vitro studies lurasidone is not a substrate of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP4A11, \n\nCYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP2E1 enzymes. \n\n \n\nIn vitro, lurasidone demonstrated no direct, or weak inhibition (direct or time-dependent) \n\n(IC50>5.9 μM) of the enzymes cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, \n\nCYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Based on this data, lurasidone is not expected to affect \n\nthe pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, \n\nCYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. For administration of medicinal products that are \n\nsubstrates of CYP3A4 with a narrow therapeutic range, see section 4.5.  \n\n \n\nLurasidone is an in vitro substrate of the efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP. Lurasidone is not subject \n\nto active uptake transport by OATP1B1 or OATP1B3.  \n\n \n\nLurasidone is an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP and OCT1 in vitro (see section 4.5). Lurasidone is not \n\nexpected to have a clinically relevant inhibitory potential on transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, \n\nOCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, MATE2K or BSEP based on in vitro data. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nFollowing administration of lurasidone, the elimination half-life was 20-40 hours. Following oral \n\nadministration of a radiolabelled dose, approximately 67% dose was recovered in faeces and 19% in \n\nurine. Urine comprised mostly of a number of metabolites with minimal renal excretion of parent \n\ncompound.  \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of lurasidone is dose-proportional within a total daily dose range of 18.5 mg to \n\n148 mg. Steady-state concentrations of lurasidone are reached within 7 days of starting lurasidone. \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups: \n\n \n\nElderly people \n\nLimited data have been collected in healthy subjects ≥ 65 years. Of the data collected, similar \n\nexposure was obtained compared with subjects < 65 years. However, an increase in exposure in \n\nelderly subjects may be expected for patients if they have impaired renal or hepatic function.  \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe serum concentrations of lurasidone are increased in healthy subjects with Child-Pugh Class A, B \n\nand C hepatic impairment with an increased exposure of 1.5-, 1.7- and 3-fold respectively. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe serum concentrations of lurasidone are increased in healthy subjects with mild, moderate and \n\nsevere renal impairment with an increased exposure of 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0-fold respectively. Subjects \n\nwith ESRD (CrCl<15 ml/min) have not been investigated. \n\n \n\nGender \n\nThere were no clinically relevant differences between genders in the pharmacokinetics of lurasidone in \n\na population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with schizophrenia. \n\n \n\nRace \n\nThere were no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of lurasidone in a population \n\npharmacokinetic analysis in patients with schizophrenia. It was noted that Asian subjects had 1.5 fold \n\nincreased exposure to lurasidone compared to Caucasian subjects. \n\n \n\nSmoking \n\nBased on in vitro studies utilising human liver enzymes, lurasidone is not a substrate for CYP1A2; \n\nsmoking should, therefore, not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of lurasidone. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of lurasidone in paediatric patients was investigated in 49 children aged \n\n6-12 years and 56 adolescents aged 13-17 years. Lurasidone was administered as lurasidone \n\nhydrochloride at daily doses of either 20, 40, 80, 120 mg (6-17 years) or 160 mg (10-17 years only) for \n\n7 days. There was no clear correlation between obtained plasma exposure and age or body weight. The \n\npharmacokinetics of lurasidone in paediatric patients aged 6–17 years was generally comparable to \n\nthose observed in adults. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. Major findings in \n\nrepeat-dose toxicity studies of lurasidone were centrally-mediated endocrine changes resulting from \n\nserum prolactin elevations in rats, dogs and monkeys. High serum prolactin levels in long-term \n\nrepeat-dose studies in female rats were associated with effects on bones, adrenal glands, and \n\nreproductive tissues. In a long-term dog repeat-dose study, high serum prolactin levels were associated \n\nwith effects on male and female reproductive tissues. \n\n \n\nIn rats, lurasidone had no effect on male and female reproduction at oral doses of 150 and \n\n0.1 mg/kg/day lurasidone hydrochloride, respectively, or on early embryonic development at an oral \n\ndose of 15 mg/kg/day lurasidone hydrochloride.  \n\n \n\nA fertility study in female rats resulted in prolonged oestrous cycle and delayed copulation at \n\n≥1.5 mg/kg/day lurasidone hydrochloride, whilst the copulation and fertility indices, and the numbers \n\nof corpora lutea, implantations and live foetuses were decreased at 150 mg/kg/day lurasidone \n\nhydrochloride. These effects were due to the hyperprolactinemia following lurasidone treatment, \n\naffecting the oestrous cycle and copulatory behaviour as well as the maintenance of corpus luteum of \n\n\n\n48 \n\nthe female rats, resulting in a decrease in implantation and the number of live foetuses. These \n\nprolactin-related effects are not considered to be relevant to human reproduction. \n\n \n\nA single dose of 10 mg/kg lurasidone hydrochloride to pregnant rats resulted in fetal exposure. In a \n\ndose range finding study in pregnant rats, 150 mg/kg/day lurasidone hydrochloride caused fetal growth \n\nretardation without signs of teratogenicity. Lurasidone was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits at an \n\nexposure similar to or below the maximum recommended human dose (148 mg lurasidone). \n\n \n\nLurasidone was excreted in milk of rats during lactation. \n\n \n\nLurasidone was not genotoxic in a battery of tests. Mammary gland and/or pituitary gland tumours \n\nwere observed in the mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies and are most likely due to the increased \n\nblood prolactin levels. These findings are common in rodents treated with antipsychotic medicinal \n\nproducts with dopamine D2 blocking activity and are considered to be rodent-specific.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What Latuda is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nLatuda contains the active substance lurasidone and belongs to a group of medicines called \n\nantipsychotics. It is used to treat symptoms of schizophrenia in adults aged 18 years or over. \n\nLurasidone works by blocking receptors in the brain to which the substances dopamine and serotonin \n\nattach. Dopamine and serotonin are neurotransmitters (substances that allow nerve cells to \n\ncommunicate with each other) that are involved in the symptoms of schizophrenia. By blocking their \n\nreceptors, lurasidone helps to normalise the activity of the brain, reducing the symptoms of \n\nschizophrenia. \n\n \n\nSchizophrenia is a disorder with symptoms such as hearing things, seeing or sensing things that are not \n\nthere, mistaken beliefs, unusual suspiciousness, becoming withdrawn, incoherent speech and \n\nbehaviour and emotional flatness. People with this disorder may also feel depressed, anxious, guilty, \n\nor tense. This medicine is used to improve your symptoms of schizophrenia. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Latuda \n\n \n\nDo NOT take Latuda if you: \n\n are allergic to lurasidone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n\n are taking medicines which may affect the level of lurasidone in your blood such as: \n- medicines for fungal infections such as itraconazole, ketoconazole (except as a shampoo), \n\nposaconazole or voriconazole \n\n- medicines for an infection such as the antibiotic clarithromycin or telithromycin \n- medicines for HIV infections such as cobicistat, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and \n\nsaquinavir \n\n- boceprevir, and telaprevir (medicines for chronic hepatitis) \n- nefazodone (a medicine for depression)  \n- rifampicin (a medicine for tuberculosis)  \n- carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (medicines for seizures) \n- St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (herbal medicine for depression). \n\n \n\n\n\n65 \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nIt may take several days or even weeks before this medicine will have a full effect. Contact your \n\ndoctor if you have questions on this medicine. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine, or during treatment, especially if you \n\nhave: \n\n Suicidal  thoughts or behaviour  \n\n Parkinson’s disease or dementia  \n\n ever been diagnosed with a condition whose symptoms include high temperature and muscle \nstiffness (also known as neuroleptic malignant syndrome) or if you have ever experienced \n\nrigidity, tremors or problems moving (extrapyramidal symptoms) or abnormal movements of \n\nthe tongue or face (tardive dyskinesia).

This is especially important if you are taking:  \n\n \n\n any medicines that also work in the brain, as their effects could be additive in a negative way \nwith the effects of Latuda on your brain  \n\n medicines that lower blood pressure, as this medicine can also lower blood pressure \n\n medicines for Parkinson’s disease and restless legs syndrome (e.g. levodopa) as this medicine \ncan reduce their effects \n\n medicines containing ergot alkaloid derivatives (used for treating migraines), and other \nmedicines including terfenadine and astemizole (used for treating hay fever and other allergic \n\nconditions), cisapride (used for treating digestive problems), pimozide (used to treating \n\npsychiatric illnesses), quinidine (used for treating heart conditions), bepridil (used for treating \n\nchest pain). \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you take any of these medicines since your doctor may have to change the dose of \n\nthat medicine during treatment with Latuda. \n\n \n\nThe following medicines may increase the level of lurasidone in your blood: \n\n diltiazem (to treat high blood pressure) \n\n erythromycin (to treat infections) \n\n fluconazole (to treat fungal infections) \n\n verapamil (to treat high blood pressure or chest pain). \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\nThe following medicines may decrease the level of lurasidone in your blood:  \n\n amprenavir, efavirenz, etravirine (to treat HIV infection) \n\n aprepitant (to treat nausea and vomiting) \n\n armodafinil, modafinil (to treat sleepiness) \n\n bosentan (to treat high blood pressure or ulcers of the fingers) \n\n nafcillin (to treat infections) \n\n prednisone (to treat inflammatory disease)  \n\n rufinamide (to treat seizures).  \n \n\nTell your doctor if you take any of these medicines since your doctor may change your dose of Latuda. \n\n \n\nLatuda with food, drink and alcohol \n\nAlcohol should be avoided when taking this medicine.
