PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion.\n\nWhite to off-white lyophilised cake or powder.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nUlcerative colitis\n\nEntyvio is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative \ncolitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either \nconventional therapy or a tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) antagonist.\n\nCrohn\u2019s disease\n\nEntyvio is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s \ndisease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either \nconventional therapy or a tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) antagonist.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist healthcare professionals experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of ulcerative colitis or Crohn\u2019s disease (see section 4.4). Patients should be \ngiven the package leaflet and the Patient Alert Card.\n\nPosology\n\nUlcerative colitis \n\nThe recommended dose regimen of intravenous vedolizumab is 300 mg administered by intravenous \ninfusion at 0, 2 and 6 weeks and then every 8 weeks thereafter. \n\nTherapy for patients with ulcerative colitis should be discontinued if no evidence of therapeutic benefit \nis observed by week 10 (see section 5.1).\n\n\n\n3\n\nSome patients who have experienced a decrease in their response may benefit from an increase in \ndosing frequency to intravenous vedolizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks.\n\nIn patients who have responded to treatment with vedolizumab, corticosteroids may be reduced and/or \ndiscontinued in accordance with standard of care.\n\nRetreatment\nIf therapy is interrupted and there is a need to restart treatment with intravenous vedolizumab, dosing \nat every 4 weeks may be considered (see section 5.1). The treatment interruption period in clinical \ntrials extended up to 1 year. Efficacy was regained with no evident increase in adverse reactions or \ninfusion-related reactions during retreatment with vedolizumab (see section 4.8).\n\nCrohn\u2019s disease\n\nThe recommended dose regimen of intravenous vedolizumab is 300 mg administered by intravenous \ninfusion at 0, 2 and 6 weeks and then every 8 weeks thereafter.\n\nPatients with Crohn\u2019s disease, who have not shown a response may benefit from a dose of intravenous \nvedolizumab at week 10 (see section 4.4). Therapy should be continued every 8 weeks from week 14 \nin responding patients. Therapy for patients with Crohn\u2019s disease should be discontinued if no \nevidence of therapeutic benefit is observed by week 14 (see section 5.1).\n\nSome patients who have experienced a decrease in their response may benefit from an increase in \ndosing frequency to intravenous vedolizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks.\n\nIn patients who have responded to treatment with vedolizumab, corticosteroids may be reduced and/or \ndiscontinued in accordance with standard of care.\n\nRetreatment\nIf therapy is interrupted and there is a need to restart treatment with intravenous vedolizumab, dosing \nat every 4 weeks may be considered (see section 5.1). The treatment interruption period in clinical \ntrials extended up to 1 year. Efficacy was regained with no evident increase in adverse reactions or \ninfusion-related reactions during retreatment with vedolizumab (see section 4.8).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly patients\n\nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly patients. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed no \neffect of age (see section 5.2).\n\nPatients with renal or hepatic impairment\n\nVedolizumab has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be \nmade.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety and efficacy of vedolizumab in children aged 0 to 17 years old have not been established. \nNo data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nEntyvio 300 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion is for intravenous use only. It is to be \nreconstituted and further diluted prior to intravenous administration.\n\n\n\n4\n\nEntyvio 300 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion is administered as an intravenous \ninfusion over 30 minutes. Patients should be monitored during and after infusion (see section 4.4).\n\nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nActive severe infections such as tuberculosis (TB), sepsis, cytomegalovirus, listeriosis, and \nopportunistic infections such as Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) (see section 4.4).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nIntravenous vedolizumab should be administered in a healthcare setting equipped to allow \nmanagement of acute hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, if they occur. Appropriate \nmonitoring and medical support measures should be available for immediate use when administering \nintravenous vedolizumab. All patients should be observed continuously during each infusion. For the \nfirst 2 infusions, they should also be observed for approximately 2 hours following completion of the \ninfusion for signs and symptoms of acute hypersensitivity reactions. For all subsequent infusions, \npatients should be observed for approximately 1 hour following completion of the infusion.\n\nTraceability\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nInfusion-related reactions and hypersensitivity reactions\n\nIn clinical studies, infusion-related reactions (IRR) and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, \nwith the majority being mild to moderate in severity (see section 4.8).\n\nIf a severe IRR, anaphylactic reaction, or other severe reaction occurs, administration of Entyvio must \nbe discontinued immediately and appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines)\n(see section 4.3).\n\nIf a mild to moderate IRR occurs, the infusion rate can be slowed or interrupted and appropriate \ntreatment initiated. Once the mild or moderate IRR subsides, continue the infusion. Physicians should \nconsider pre-treatment (e.g., with antihistamine, hydrocortisone and/or paracetamol) prior to the next \ninfusion for patients with a history of mild to moderate IRR to vedolizumab, in order to minimize their \nrisks (see section 4.8).\n\nInfections\n\nVedolizumab is a gut-selective integrin antagonist with no identified systemic immunosuppressive \nactivity (see section 5.1).\n\nPhysicians should be aware of the potential increased risk of opportunistic infections or infections for \nwhich the gut is a defensive barrier (see section 4.8). Vedolizumab treatment is not to be initiated in \npatients with active, severe infections until the infections are controlled, and physicians should \nconsider withholding treatment in patients who develop a severe infection while on chronic treatment \nwith vedolizumab. Caution should be exercised when considering the use of vedolizumab in patients \nwith a controlled chronic severe infection or a history of recurring severe infections. Patients should be \nmonitored closely for infections before, during and after treatment.\nVedolizumab is contraindicated in patients with active tuberculosis (see section 4.3). Before starting \ntreatment with vedolizumab, patients must be screened for tuberculosis according to the local practice. \n\n\n\n5\n\nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis \ntreatment in accordance with local recommendations, before beginning vedolizumab. In patients \ndiagnosed with TB whilst receiving vedolizumab therapy, then vedolizumab therapy should be \ndiscontinued until the TB infection has been resolved.\n\nSome integrin antagonists and some systemic immunosuppressive agents have been associated with \nprogressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a rare and often fatal opportunistic \ninfection caused by the John Cunningham (JC) virus. By binding to the \u03b14\u03b27 integrin expressed on \ngut-homing lymphocytes, vedolizumab exerts an immunosuppressive effect specific to the gut. \nAlthough no systemic immunosuppressive effect was noted in healthy subjects the effects on systemic \nimmune system function in patients with inflammatory bowel disease is not known. \n\nHealthcare professionals should monitor patients on vedolizumab for any new onset or worsening of \nneurological signs and symptoms as outlined in physician education materials, and consider \nneurological referral if they occur. The patient is to be given a Patient Alert Card (see section 4.2). If \nPML is suspected, treatment with vedolizumab must be withheld; if confirmed, treatment must be \npermanently discontinued.\n\nMalignancies\n\nThe risk of malignancy is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. \nImmunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy (see section 4.8).\n\nPrior and concurrent use of biological products\n\nNo vedolizumab clinical trial data are available for patients previously treated with natalizumab or \nrituximab. Caution should be exercised when considering the use of vedolizumab in these patients.\n\nPatients previously exposed to natalizumab should normally wait a minimum of 12 weeks prior to \ninitiating therapy with vedolizumab, unless otherwise indicated by the patient\u2019s clinical condition.\n\nNo clinical trial data for concomitant use of vedolizumab with biologic immunosuppressants are \navailable. Therefore, the use of vedolizumab in such patients is not recommended.\n\nLive and oral vaccines\n\nIn a placebo-controlled study of healthy volunteers, a single 750 mg dose of vedolizumab did not \nlower rates of protective immunity to hepatitis B virus in subjects who were vaccinated \nintramuscularly with 3 doses of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen. Vedolizumab-exposed \nsubjects had lower seroconversion rates after receiving a killed, oral cholera vaccine. The impact on \nother oral and nasal vaccines is unknown. It is recommended that all patients be brought up to date \nwith all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating \nvedolizumab therapy. Patients receiving vedolizumab treatment may continue to receive non-live \nvaccines. There are no data on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients \nreceiving vedolizumab. Administration of the influenza vaccine should be by injection in line with \nroutine clinical practice. Other live vaccines may be administered concurrently with vedolizumab only \nif the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.\n\nInduction of remission in Crohn\u2019s disease\n\nInduction of remission in Crohn\u2019s disease may take up to 14 weeks in some patients. The reasons for\nthis are not fully known and are possibly related to the mechanism of action. This should be taken into \nconsideration, particularly in patients with severe active disease at baseline not previously treated with \nTNF\u03b1 antagonists. (see also section 5.1.)\n\nExploratory subgroup analyses from the clinical trials in Crohn\u2019s disease suggested that vedolizumab \nadministered in patients without concomitant corticosteroid treatment may be less effective for \n\n\n\n6\n\ninduction of remission in Crohn\u2019s disease than in those patients already receiving concomitant \ncorticosteroids (regardless of use of concomitant immunomodulators; see section 5.1).\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo interaction studies have been performed.\n\nVedolizumab has been studied in adult ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease patients with \nconcomitant administration of corticosteroids, immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, \nand methotrexate), and aminosalicylates. Population pharmacokinetic analyses suggest that \nco-administration of such agents did not have a clinically meaningful effect on vedolizumab \npharmacokinetics. The effect of vedolizumab on the pharmacokinetics of commonly co-administered \nmedicinal compounds has not been studied.\n\nVaccinations\n\nLive vaccines, in particular live oral vaccines, should be used with caution concurrently with \nvedolizumab (see section 4.4).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nWomen of childbearing potential should use adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and to\ncontinue its use for at least 18 weeks after the last treatment.\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are limited amount of data from the use of vedolizumab in pregnant women.\n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3).\n\nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of vedolizumab during pregnancy unless \nthe benefits clearly outweigh any potential risk to both the mother and foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nVedolizumab has been detected in human milk. The effect of vedolizumab on infants is unknown. The \nuse of vedolizumab in lactating women should take into account the benefit of therapy to the mother \nand potential risks to the infant.\n\nFertility\n\nThere are no data on the effects of vedolizumab on human fertility. Effects on male and female \nfertility have not been formally evaluated in animal studies (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nVedolizumab has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines, as dizziness has been \nreported in a small number of patients.\n\n\n\n7\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper \nrespiratory tract infection, bronchitis, influenza and sinusitis), headache, nausea, pyrexia, fatigue, \ncough, arthralgia.\n\nInfusion related reactions (with symptoms such as dyspnea, bronchospasm, urticaria, flushing, rash, \nand increased blood pressure and heart rate) have also been reported in patients treated with \nvedolizumab. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe following listing of adverse reactions is based on clinical trial and post marketing experience and \nis displayed by system organ class. Within the system organ classes, adverse reactions are listed under \nheadings of the following frequency categories: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10),\nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100) and very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, \nadverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 1.

No individual Preferred Term reported as an IRR occurred at a rate \nabove 1%. The majority of IRRs were mild or moderate in intensity and < 1% resulted in \ndiscontinuation of study treatment. Observed IRRs generally resolved with no or minimal intervention \nfollowing the infusion. Most infusion related reactions occurred within the first 2 hours. Of those \npatients who had infusion related reactions, those dosed with intravenous vedolizumab had more \ninfusion related reactions with in the first 2 hours as compared to placebo patients with infusion \nrelated reactions. Most infusion related reactions were not serious and occurred during the infusion or \nwithin the first hour after infusion is completed.\n\nOne serious adverse reaction of IRR was reported in a Crohn\u2019s disease patient during the second \ninfusion (symptoms reported were dyspnoea, bronchospasm, urticaria, flushing, rash, and increased \nblood pressure and heart rate) and was successfully managed with discontinuation of infusion and \ntreatment with antihistamine and intravenous hydrocortisone. In patients who received intravenous \nvedolizumab at weeks 0 and 2 followed by placebo, no increase in the rate of IRR was seen upon \nretreatment with intravenous vedolizumab after loss of response.\n\nInfections\n\nIn GEMINI 1 and 2 controlled studies with intravenous vedolizumab, the rate of infections was \n0.85 per patient-year in the vedolizumab-treated patients and 0.70 per patient-year in the \nplacebo-treated patients. The infections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract \ninfection, sinusitis, and urinary tract infections. Most patients continued on vedolizumab after the \ninfection resolved.\n\nIn GEMINI 1 and 2 controlled studies with intravenous vedolizumab, the rate of serious infections was \n0.07 per patient year in vedolizumab-treated patients and 0.06 per patient year in placebo-treated \npatients. Over time, there was no significant increase in the rate of serious infections.\n\nIn controlled and open-label studies in adults with intravenous vedolizumab, serious infections have \nbeen reported, which include tuberculosis, sepsis (some fatal), salmonella sepsis, listeria meningitis, \nand cytomegaloviral colitis.\n\n\n\n9\n\nIn clinical studies with intravenous vedolizumab, the rate of infections in vedolizumab-treated patients \nwith BMI of 30 kg/m2 and above was higher than for those with BMI less than 30 kg/m2.\n\nIn clinical studies with intravenous vedolizumab, a slightly higher incidence of serious infections was \nreported in vedolizumab-treated patients who had prior exposure to TNF\u03b1 antagonist therapy \ncompared to patients who were na\u00efve to previous TNF\u03b1 antagonist therapy.\n\nMalignancy\n\nOverall, results from the clinical program to date do not suggest an increased risk for malignancy with \nvedolizumab treatment; however, the number of malignancies was small and long-term exposure was \nlimited. Long-term safety evaluations are ongoing.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDoses up to 10 mg/kg (approximately 2.5 times the recommended dose) have been administered \nintravenously in clinical trials. No dose-limiting toxicity was seen in clinical trials.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: immunosuppressants, selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: \nL04AA33.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nVedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressive biologic. It is a humanised monoclonal antibody \nthat binds specifically to the \u03b14\u03b27 integrin, which is preferentially expressed on gut homing T helper \nlymphocytes. By binding to \u03b14\u03b27 on certain lymphocytes, vedolizumab inhibits adhesion of these cells \nto mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), but not to vascular cell adhesion \nmolecule-1 (VCAM-1). MAdCAM-1 is mainly expressed on gut endothelial cells and plays a critical \nrole in the homing of T lymphocytes to tissues within the gastrointestinal tract. Vedolizumab does not \nbind to, nor inhibit function of, the \u03b14\u03b21 and \u03b1E\u03b27 integrins.\n\nThe \u03b14\u03b27 integrin is expressed on a discrete subset of memory T helper lymphocytes which \npreferentially migrate into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and cause inflammation that is characteristic \nof ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease, both of which are chronic inflammatory immunologically \nmediated conditions of the GI tract. Vedolizumab reduces gastrointestinal inflammation in UC and CD \npatients. Inhibiting the interaction of \u03b14\u03b27 with MAdCAM-1 with vedolizumab prevents transmigration \nof gut-homing memory T helper lymphocytes across the vascular endothelium into parenchymal tissue \nin nonhuman primates and induced a reversible 3-fold elevation of these cells in peripheral blood. The \nmurine precursor of vedolizumab alleviated gastrointestinal inflammation in colitic cotton-top \ntamarins, a model of ulcerative colitis.\n\nIn healthy subjects, ulcerative colitis patients, or Crohn\u2019s disease patients, vedolizumab does not \nelevate neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, B-helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, total memory T \n\n\n\n10\n\nhelper lymphocytes, monocytes or natural killer cells, in the peripheral blood with no leukocytosis \nobserved.\n\nVedolizumab did not affect immune surveillance and inflammation of the central nervous system in \nExperimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis in non-human primates, a model of multiple sclerosis. \nVedolizumab did not affect immune responses to antigenic challenge in the dermis and muscle (see \nsection 4.4). In contrast, vedolizumab inhibited an immune response to a gastrointestinal antigenic \nchallenge in healthy human volunteers (see section 4.4).\n\nImmunogenicity\n\nAntibodies to vedolizumab may develop during vedolizumab treatment most of which are neutralising. \nThe formation of anti-vedolizumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance of vedolizumab \nand lower rates of clinical remission. \n\nInfusion related reactions after vedolizumab infusion are reported in subjects with anti-vedolizumab \nantibodies. \n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nIn clinical trials with intravenous vedolizumab at doses ranging from 2 to 10 mg/kg, > 95% saturation \nof \u03b14\u03b27 receptors on subsets of circulating lymphocytes involved in gut immune surveillance was \nobserved in patients.\n\nVedolizumab did not affect CD4+ and CD8+ trafficking into the CNS as evidenced by the lack of \nchange in the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ in cerebrospinal fluid pre- and post-vedolizumab administration in \nhealthy human volunteers. These data are consistent with investigations in nonhuman primates which \ndid not detect effects on immune surveillance of the CNS.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nUlcerative colitis\n\nThe efficacy and safety of intravenous vedolizumab for the treatment of adult patients with moderately \nto severely active ulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12 with endoscopic sub score \u2265 2) was \ndemonstrated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating efficacy endpoints at \nweek 6 and week 52 (GEMINI 1). Enrolled patients had failed at least one conventional therapy, \nincluding corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and/or the TNF\u03b1 antagonist infliximab (including \nprimary non-responders). Concomitant stable doses of oral aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and/or \nimmunomodulators were permitted. \n\nFor the evaluation of the week 6 endpoints, 374 patients were randomised in a double-blind fashion \n(3:2) to receive vedolizumab 300 mg or placebo at week 0 and week 2. Primary endpoint was the \nproportion of patients with clinical response (defined as reduction in complete Mayo score of \n\uf0b3 3 points and \uf0b3 30% from baseline with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of \n\uf0b3 1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of \u2264 1 point) at week 6. Table 2 shows the results from \nthe primary and secondary endpoints evaluated.\n\n\n\n11\n\nTable 2.

To evaluate efficacy at week 52, \n373 patients from cohort 1 and 2 who were treated with vedolizumab and had achieved clinical \nresponse at week 6 were randomised in a double-blind fashion (1:1:1) to one of the following \nregimens beginning at week 6: vedolizumab 300 mg every 8 weeks, vedolizumab 300 mg every \n4 weeks, or placebo every 4 weeks. Beginning at week 6, patients who had achieved clinical response \nand were receiving corticosteroids were required to begin a corticosteroid-tapering regimen. Primary \nendpoint was the proportion of patients in clinical remission at week 52. Table 3 shows the results \nfrom the primary and secondary endpoints evaluated.\n\nTable 3.

Patient numbers were n = 72 \nfor placebo, n = 70 for vedolizumab every 8 weeks, and n = 73 for vedolizumab every 4 weeks\n\nExploratory analyses provide additional data on key subpopulations studied. Approximately one-third \nof patients had failed prior TNF\uf061 antagonist therapy. Among these patients, 37% receiving \nvedolizumab every 8 weeks, 35% receiving vedolizumab every 4 weeks, and 5% receiving placebo \nachieved clinical remission at week 52. Improvements in durable clinical response (47%, 43%, 16%), \nmucosal healing (42%, 48%, 8%), durable clinical remission (21%, 13%, 3%) and corticosteroid-free \nclinical remission (23%, 32%, 4%) were seen in the prior TNF\u03b1 antagonist failure population treated \nwith vedolizumab every 8 weeks, vedolizumab every 4 weeks and placebo, respectively.\n\n\n\n12\n\nPatients who failed to demonstrate response at week 6 remained in the study and received \nvedolizumab every 4 weeks. Clinical response using partial Mayo scores was achieved at week 10 and \nweek 14 by greater proportions of vedolizumab patients (32% and 39%, respectively) compared with \nplacebo patients (15% and 21%, respectively).\n\nPatients who lost response to vedolizumab when treated every 8 weeks were allowed to enter an \nopen-label extension study and receive vedolizumab every 4 weeks. In these patients, clinical \nremission was achieved in 25% of patients at week 28 and week 52.\n\nPatients who achieved a clinical response after receiving vedolizumab at week 0 and 2 and were then \nrandomised to placebo (for 6 to 52 weeks) and lost response were allowed to enter the open-label \nextension study and receive vedolizumab every 4 weeks. In these patients, clinical remission was \nachieved in 45% of patients by 28 weeks and 36% of patients by 52 weeks.\n\nIn this open-label extension study, the benefits of vedolizumab treatment as assessed by partial Mayo \nscore, clinical remission, and clinical response were shown for up to 196 weeks.\n\nHealth-related quality of life (HRQOL) was assessed by Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire \n(IBDQ), a disease specific instrument, and SF-36 and EQ-5D, which are generic measures. \nExploratory analysis show clinically meaningful improvements were observed for vedolizumab \ngroups, and the improvements were significantly greater as compared with the placebo group at \nweek 6 and week 52 on EQ-5D and EQ-5D VAS scores, all subscales of IBDQ (bowel symptoms, \nsystemic function, emotional function and social function), and all subscales of SF-36 including the \nPhysical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS). \n\nCrohn\u2019s disease\n\nThe efficacy and safety of intravenous vedolizumab for the treatment of adult patients with moderately \nto severely active Crohn\u2019s disease (Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index [CDAI] score of 220 to 450) were \nevaluated in 2 studies (GEMINI 2 and 3). Enrolled patients have failed at least one conventional \ntherapy, including corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and/or TNF\u03b1 antagonists (including primary \nnon-responders). Concomitant stable doses of oral corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and antibiotics \nwere permitted.\n\nThe GEMINI 2 Study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating efficacy \nendpoints at week 6 and week 52. Patients (n = 368) were randomised in a double-blind fashion (3:2) \nto receive 2 doses of vedolizumab 300 mg or placebo at week 0 and week 2. The 2 primary endpoints \nwere the proportion of patients in clinical remission (defined as CDAI score \u2264 150 points) at week 6 \nand the proportion of patients with enhanced clinical response (defined as a \u2265 100-point decrease in \nCDAI score from baseline) at week 6 (see Table 4). \n\nGEMINI 2 contained 2 cohorts of patients that received vedolizumab at weeks 0 and 2: \ncohort 1 patients were randomised to receive either vedolizumab 300 mg or placebo in a double-blind \nfashion, and cohort 2 patients were treated with open-label vedolizumab 300 mg. To evaluate efficacy \nat week 52, 461 patients from cohorts 1 and 2, who were treated with vedolizumab and had achieved \nclinical response (defined as a \u2265 70-point decrease in CDAI score from baseline) at week 6, were \nrandomised in a double-blind fashion (1:1:1) to one of the following regimens beginning at week 6: \nvedolizumab 300 mg every 8 weeks, vedolizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks, or placebo every 4 weeks. \nPatients showing clinical response at week 6 were required to begin corticosteroid tapering. Primary \nendpoint was the proportion of patients in clinical remission at week 52 (see Table 5).\n\nThe GEMINI 3 Study was a second randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated \nefficacy at week 6 and week 10 in the subgroup of patients defined as having failed at least \n1 conventional therapy and failed TNF\uf061 antagonist therapy (including primary non-responders) as \nwell as the overall population, which also included patients who failed at least 1 conventional therapy \nand were na\u00efve to TNF\uf061 antagonist therapy. Patients (n = 416), which included approximately 75% \nTNF\uf061 antagonist failures patients, were randomised in a double-blind fashion (1:1) to receive either \n\n\n\n13\n\nvedolizumab 300 mg or placebo at weeks 0, 2, and 6. The primary endpoint was the proportion of \npatients in clinical remission at week 6 in the TNF\uf061 antagonist failure subpopulation. As noted in \nTable 4, although the primary endpoint was not met, exploratory analyses show that clinically \nmeaningful results were observed. \n\nTable 4.

Combination treatment, most notably with concomitant \ncorticosteroids, appeared to be more effective in inducing remission in Crohn\u2019s disease than \nvedolizumab alone or with concomitant immunomodulators, which showed a smaller difference from \nplacebo in the rate of remission. Clinical remission rate in GEMINI 2 at week 6 was 10% (difference \nfrom placebo 2%, 95% CI: -6, 10) when administered without corticosteroids compared to 20% \n(difference from placebo 14%, 95% CI: -1, 29) when administered with concomitant corticosteroids. \nIn GEMINI 3 at week 6 and 10 the respective clinical remission rates were 18% (difference from \nplacebo 3%, 95% CI: -7, 13) and 22% (difference from placebo 8%, 95% CI: -3, 19) when \nadministered without corticosteroids compared to 20% (difference from placebo 11%, 95% CI: 2, 20) \nand 35% (difference from placebo 23%, 95% CI: 12, 33) respectively when administered with \nconcomitant corticosteroids. These effects were seen whether or not immunomodulators were also \nconcomitantly administered.\n\nExploratory analyses provide additional data on key subpopulations studied. In GEMINI 2, \napproximately half of patients had previously failed TNF\u03b1 antagonist therapy. Among these patients, \n28% receiving vedolizumab every 8 weeks, 27% receiving vedolizumab every 4 weeks, and 13% \nreceiving placebo achieved clinical remission at week 52. Enhanced clinical response was achieved in \n29%, 38%, 21%, respectively, and corticosteriod-free clinical remission was achieved in 24%, 16%, \n0%, respectively. \n\nPatients who failed to demonstrate response at week 6 in GEMINI 2 were retained in the study and \nreceived vedolizumab every 4 weeks. Enhanced clinical response was observed at week 10 and \nweek 14 for greater proportions of vedolizumab patients 16% and 22%, respectively, compared with \nplacebo patients 7% and 12%, respectively. There was no clinically meaningful difference in clinical \nremission between treatment groups at these time points. Analyses of week 52 clinical remission in \npatients who were non-responders at week 6 but achieved response at week 10 or week 14 indicate \nthat non-responder CD patients may benefit from a dose of vedolizumab at week 10.\n\nPatients who lost response to vedolizumab when treated every 8 weeks in GEMINI 2 were allowed to \nenter an open-label extension study and received vedolizumab every 4 weeks. In these patients, \nclinical remission was achieved in 23% of patients at week 28 and 32% of patients at week 52.\n\nPatients who achieved a clinical response after receiving vedolizumab at week 0 and 2 and were then \nrandomised to placebo (for 6 to 52 weeks) and lost response were allowed to enter the open-label \nextension study and receive vedolizumab every 4 weeks. In these patients, clinical remission was \nachieved in 46% of patients by 28 weeks and 41% of patients by 52 weeks.\n\n\n\n15\n\nIn this open-label extension study, clinical remission and clinical response were observed in patients \nfor up to 196 weeks.\n\nExploratory analysis showed clinically meaningful improvements were observed for the vedolizumab \nevery 4 weeks and every 8 weeks groups in GEMINI 2 and the improvements were significantly \ngreater as compared with the placebo group from baseline to week 52 on EQ-5D and EQ-5D VAS \nscores, total IBDQ score, and IBDQ subscales of bowel symptoms and systemic function.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nvedolizumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s \ndisease (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab have been studied in healthy subjects \nand in patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis or Crohn\u2019s disease. \n\nIn patients administered 300 mg vedolizumab as a 30 minute intravenous infusion on weeks 0 and 2, \nmean serum trough concentrations at week 6 were 27.9 mcg/mL (SD \u00b1 15.51) in ulcerative colitis \nand 26.8 mcg/mL (SD \u00b1 17.45) in Crohn\u2019s disease. In studies with intravenous vedolizumab, starting \nat week 6, patients received 300 mg intravenous vedolizumab every 8 or 4 weeks. In patients with \nulcerative colitis, mean steady-state serum trough concentrations were 11.2 mcg/mL (SD \u00b1 7.24) \nand 38.3 mcg/mL (SD \u00b1 24.43), respectively. In patients with Crohn's disease mean steady-state serum \ntrough concentrations were 13.0 mcg/mL (SD \u00b1 9.08) and 34.8 mcg/mL (SD \u00b1 22.55), respectively.\n\nDistribution\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that the distribution volume of vedolizumab is \napproximately 5 litres. The plasma protein binding of vedolizumab has not been evaluated. \nVedolizumab is a therapeutic monoclonal antibody and is not expected to bind to plasma proteins.\n\nVedolizumab does not pass the blood brain barrier after intravenous administration. Vedolizumab \n450 mg administered intravenously was not detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of healthy subjects.\n\nElimination\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that vedolizumab has a total body clearance of \napproximately 0.169 L/day and a serum half-life of 24 days. The exact elimination route of \nvedolizumab is not known. Population pharmacokinetic analyses suggest that while low albumin, \nhigher body weight and prior treatment with anti-TNF drugs may increase vedolizumab clearance, the \nmagnitude of their effects is not considered to be clinically relevant.\n\nLinearity\n\nVedolizumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics at serum concentrations greater than 1 mcg/mL.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nAge does not impact the vedolizumab clearance in ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease patients \nbased on the population pharmacokinetic analyses. No formal studies have been conducted to examine \nthe effects of either renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab.\n\n\n\n16\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction\nand development. \n\nLong-term animal studies with vedolizumab to assess its carcinogenic potential have not been \nconducted because pharmacologically responsive models to monoclonal antibodies do not exist. In a \npharmacologically responsive species (cynomolgus monkeys), there was no evidence of cellular \nhyperplasia or systemic immunomodulation that could potentially be associated with oncogenesis in \n13- and 26-week toxicology studies. Furthermore, no effects were found of vedolizumab on the \nproliferative rate or cytotoxicity of a human tumour cell line expressing the \u03b14\u03b27 integrin in vitro.\n\nNo specific fertility studies in animals have been performed with vedolizumab. No definitive \nconclusion can be drawn on the male reproductive organs in cynomolgus monkey repeated dose \ntoxicity study. Given the lack of binding of vedolizumab to male reproductive tissue in monkey and \nhuman, and the intact male fertility observed in \u03b27 integrin-knockout mice, it is not expected that \nvedolizumab will affect male fertility.\n\nAdministration of vedolizumab to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during most of gestation resulted in \nno evidence of effects on teratogenicity, prenatal or postnatal development in infants up to 6 months of \nage. Low levels (< 300 mcg/L) of vedolizumab were detected on post-partum day 28 in the milk of 3 \nof 11 cynomolgus monkeys treated 100 mg/kg of vedolizumab dosed every 2 weeks and not in any \nanimals that received 10 mg/kg. \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nUlcerative colitis\n\nEntyvio is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative \ncolitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either \nconventional therapy or a tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) antagonist.\n\nCrohn\u2019s disease\n\nEntyvio is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s \ndisease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either \nconventional therapy or a tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) antagonist.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist healthcare professionals experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of ulcerative colitis or Crohn\u2019s disease (see section 4.4). Patients should be \ngiven the package leaflet.\n\nPosology\n\nUlcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease\n\nThe recommended dose regimen of subcutaneous vedolizumab as a maintenance treatment, following \nat least 2 intravenous infusions, is 108 mg administered by subcutaneous injection once every \n\n\n\n20\n\n2 weeks. The first subcutaneous dose should be administered in place of the next scheduled \nintravenous dose and every 2 weeks thereafter.\nFor the intravenous dose regimen, see section 4.2 of the Entyvio 300 mg powder for concentrate for \nsolution for infusion SmPC.\n\nInsufficient data are available to determine if patients who experience a decrease in response on \nmaintenance treatment with subcutaneous vedolizumab would benefit from an increase in dosing \nfrequency.\n\nThere are no data on transition of patients from subcutaneous vedolizumab to intravenous \nvedolizumab during maintenance treatment.\n\nIn patients who have responded to treatment with vedolizumab, corticosteroids may be reduced and/or \ndiscontinued in accordance with standard of care.\n\nRetreatment and missed dose(s)\nIf treatment with subcutaneous vedolizumab is interrupted or if a patient misses a scheduled dose(s) of \nsubcutaneous vedolizumab, patient should be advised to inject the next subcutaneous dose as soon as \npossible and then every 2 weeks thereafter. The treatment interruption period in clinical trials extended \nup to 46 weeks with no evident increase in adverse reactions or injection site reactions during \nre-initiation of treatment with subcutaneous vedolizumab (see section 4.8).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly patients\n\nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly patients. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed no \neffect of age (see section 5.2).\n\nPatients with renal or hepatic impairment\n\nVedolizumab has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be \nmade.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety and efficacy of vedolizumab in children aged 0 to 17 years old have not been established. \nNo data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nEntyvio solution for injection (in a pre-filled syringe or a pre-filled pen) is for subcutaneous injection \nonly.\n\nAfter proper training on correct subcutaneous injection technique, a patient or caregiver may inject \nwith subcutaneous vedolizumab if their physician determines it is appropriate. Comprehensive \ninstructions for administration using the pre-filled syringe or the pre-filled pen are given in the \nrespective package leaflet.\n\nFor further instructions on preparation and special precautions for handling, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nActive severe infections such as tuberculosis (TB), sepsis, cytomegalovirus, listeriosis, and \nopportunistic infections such as Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n21\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\n\nIn clinical studies, hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with the majority being mild to \nmoderate in severity (see section 4.8).\n\nIf an anaphylactic reaction, or other severe reaction occurs, administration of vedolizumab must be \ndiscontinued immediately and appropriate treatment initiated (see section 4.3).\n\nInfections\n\nVedolizumab is a gut-selective integrin antagonist with no identified systemic immunosuppressive \nactivity (see section 5.1).\n\nPhysicians should be aware of the potential increased risk of opportunistic infections or infections for \nwhich the gut is a defensive barrier (see section 4.8). Treatment is not to be initiated in patients with \nactive, severe infections until the infections are controlled, and physicians should consider withholding \ntreatment in patients who develop a severe infection while on chronic treatment with vedolizumab. \nCaution should be exercised when considering the use of vedolizumab in patients with a controlled \nchronic severe infection or a history of recurring severe infections. Patients should be monitored \nclosely for infections before, during and after treatment.\nVedolizumab is contraindicated in patients with active tuberculosis (see section 4.3). Before starting \ntreatment with vedolizumab, patients must be screened for tuberculosis according to the local practice. \nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis \ntreatment in accordance with local recommendations, before beginning vedolizumab. In patients \ndiagnosed with TB whilst receiving vedolizumab therapy, then vedolizumab therapy should be \ndiscontinued until the TB infection has been resolved.\n\nSome integrin antagonists and some systemic immunosuppressive agents have been associated with \nprogressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a rare and often fatal opportunistic \ninfection caused by the John Cunningham (JC) virus. By binding to the \u03b14\u03b27 integrin expressed on \ngut-homing lymphocytes, vedolizumab exerts an immunosuppressive effect specific to the gut. \nAlthough no systemic immunosuppressive effect was noted in healthy subjects the effects on systemic \nimmune system function in patients with inflammatory bowel disease is not known.\n\nHealthcare professionals should monitor patients on vedolizumab for any new onset or worsening of \nneurological signs and symptoms as outlined in physician education materials, and consider \nneurological referral if they occur. If PML is suspected, treatment with vedolizumab must be withheld; \nif confirmed, treatment must be permanently discontinued.\n\nMalignancies\n\nThe risk of malignancy is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. \nImmunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy (see section 4.8).\n\nPrior and concurrent use of biological products\n\nNo vedolizumab clinical trial data are available for patients previously treated with natalizumab or \nrituximab. Caution should be exercised when considering the use of vedolizumab in these patients.\n\n\n\n22\n\nPatients previously exposed to natalizumab should normally wait a minimum of 12 weeks prior to \ninitiating therapy with vedolizumab, unless otherwise indicated by the patient\u2019s clinical condition.\nNo clinical trial data for concomitant use of vedolizumab with biologic immunosuppressants are \navailable. Therefore, the use of vedolizumab in such patients is not recommended.\n\nLive and oral vaccines\n\nIn a placebo-controlled study of healthy volunteers, a single 750 mg dose of vedolizumab did not \nlower rates of protective immunity to hepatitis B virus in subjects who were vaccinated \nintramuscularly with 3 doses of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen. Vedolizumab-exposed \nsubjects had lower seroconversion rates after receiving a killed, oral cholera vaccine. The impact on\nother oral and nasal vaccines is unknown. It is recommended that all patients be brought up to date \nwith all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating \nvedolizumab therapy. Patients receiving vedolizumab treatment may continue to receive non-live \nvaccines. There are no data on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients \nreceiving vedolizumab. Administration of the influenza vaccine should be by injection in line with \nroutine clinical practice. Other live vaccines may be administered concurrently with vedolizumab only \nif the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.\n\nInduction of remission in Crohn\u2019s disease\n\nInduction of remission in Crohn\u2019s disease may take up to 14 weeks in some patients. The reasons for \nthis are not fully known and are possibly related to the mechanism of action. This should be taken into \nconsideration, particularly in patients with severe active disease at baseline not previously treated with \nTNF\u03b1 antagonists (see also section 5.1.).\n\nExploratory subgroup analyses from the clinical trials in Crohn\u2019s disease suggested that vedolizumab \nadministered in patients without concomitant corticosteroid treatment may be less effective for \ninduction of remission in Crohn\u2019s disease than in those patients already receiving concomitant \ncorticosteroids (regardless of use of concomitant immunomodulators; see section 5.1).\n\nSodium content\n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo interaction studies have been performed.\n\nVedolizumab has been studied in adult ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease patients with \nconcomitant administration of corticosteroids, immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, \nand methotrexate), and aminosalicylates. Population pharmacokinetic analyses suggest that \nco-administration of such agents did not have a clinically meaningful effect on vedolizumab \npharmacokinetics. The effect of vedolizumab on the pharmacokinetics of commonly co-administered \nmedicinal compounds has not been studied.\n\nVaccinations\n\nLive vaccines, in particular live oral vaccines, should be used with caution concurrently with \nvedolizumab (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n23\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nWomen of childbearing potential should use adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and to \ncontinue its use for at least 18 weeks after the last treatment.\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are limited amount of data from the use of vedolizumab in pregnant women.\n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3).\n\nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of vedolizumab during pregnancy unless \nthe benefits clearly outweigh any potential risk to both the mother and foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nVedolizumab has been detected in human milk. The effect of vedolizumab on infants is unknown. The \nuse of vedolizumab in lactating women should take into account the benefit of therapy to the mother \nand potential risks to the infant.\n\nFertility\n\nThere are no data on the effects of vedolizumab on human fertility. Effects on male and female \nfertility have not been formally evaluated in animal studies (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nVedolizumab has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines, as dizziness has been \nreported in a small number of patients.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper \nrespiratory tract infection, bronchitis, influenza and sinusitis), headache, nausea, pyrexia, fatigue, \ncough, arthralgia.\n\nNo clinically relevant differences in the overall safety profile and adverse reactions were observed in \npatients who received subcutaneous vedolizumab compared to the safety profile observed in clinical \nstudies with intravenous vedolizumab with the exception of injection site reactions (with subcutaneous \nadministration). \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe following listing of adverse reactions is based on clinical trial and post marketing experience and \nis displayed by system organ class. Within the system organ classes, adverse reactions are listed under \nheadings of the following frequency categories: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100) and very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, \nadverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\n\n\n24\n\nTable 1.

None resulted in \ndiscontinuation of study treatment or changes to the dosing schedule. The majority of injection site \nreactions resolved within 1-4 days. There were no reports of anaphylaxis following subcutaneous \nvedolizumab administration.\n\nInfections\n\nIn GEMINI 1 and 2 controlled studies with intravenous vedolizumab, the rate of infections was \n0.85 per patient-year in the vedolizumab-treated patients and 0.70 per patient-year in the \nplacebo-treated patients. The infections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract \ninfection, sinusitis, and urinary tract infections. Most patients continued on vedolizumab after the \ninfection resolved.\n\nIn GEMINI 1 and 2 controlled studies with intravenous vedolizumab, the rate of serious infections was \n0.07 per patient year in vedolizumab-treated patients and 0.06 per patient year in placebo-treated \npatients. Over time, there was no significant increase in the rate of serious infections.\n\nIn controlled and open-label studies in adults with intravenous vedolizumab, serious infections have \nbeen reported, which include tuberculosis, sepsis (some fatal), salmonella sepsis, listeria meningitis, \nand cytomegaloviral colitis.\n\nIn clinical studies with subcutaneous vedolizumab, the rate of infections was 0.26 per patient year in \nvedolizumab-treated patients. The most frequent infections were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory \ntract infection, bronchitis and influenza.\n\nIn clinical studies with subcutaneous vedolizumab, the rate of serious infections was 0.02 per patient \nyear in subcutaneous vedolizumab-treated patients.\n\nIn clinical studies with intravenous and subcutaneous vedolizumab, the rate of infections in \nvedolizumab-treated patients with BMI of 30 kg/m2 and above was higher than for those with BMI less \nthan 30 kg/m2.\n\nIn clinical studies with intravenous and subcutaneous vedolizumab, a slightly higher incidence of \nserious infections was reported in vedolizumab-treated patients who had prior exposure to TNF\u03b1 \nantagonist therapy compared to patients who were na\u00efve to previous TNF\u03b1 antagonist therapy.\n\nMalignancy\n\nOverall, results from the clinical program to date do not suggest an increased risk for malignancy with \nvedolizumab treatment; however, the number of malignancies was small and long-term exposure was \nlimited. Long-term safety evaluations are ongoing.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n\n\n26\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDoses up to 10 mg/kg (approximately 2.5 times the recommended dose) have been administered \nintravenously in clinical trials. No dose-limiting toxicity was seen in clinical trials.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: immunosuppressants, selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: \nL04AA33.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nVedolizumab is a gut-selective immunosuppressive biologic. It is a humanised monoclonal antibody \nthat binds specifically to the \u03b14\u03b27 integrin, which is preferentially expressed on gut homing T helper \nlymphocytes. By binding to \u03b14\u03b27 on certain lymphocytes, vedolizumab inhibits adhesion of these cells \nto mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), but not to vascular cell adhesion \nmolecule-1 (VCAM-1). MAdCAM-1 is mainly expressed on gut endothelial cells and plays a critical \nrole in the homing of T lymphocytes to tissues within the gastrointestinal tract. Vedolizumab does not \nbind to, nor inhibit function of, the \u03b14\u03b21 and \u03b1E\u03b27 integrins.\n\nThe \u03b14\u03b27 integrin is expressed on a discrete subset of memory T helper lymphocytes which \npreferentially migrate into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and cause inflammation that is characteristic \nof ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease, both of which are chronic inflammatory immunologically \nmediated conditions of the GI tract. Vedolizumab reduces gastrointestinal inflammation in UC and CD \npatients. Inhibiting the interaction of \u03b14\u03b27 with MAdCAM-1 with vedolizumab prevents transmigration\nof gut-homing memory T helper lymphocytes across the vascular endothelium into parenchymal tissue \nin nonhuman primates and induced a reversible 3-fold elevation of these cells in peripheral blood. The \nmurine precursor of vedolizumab alleviated gastrointestinal inflammation in colitic cotton-top \ntamarins, a model of ulcerative colitis.\n\nIn healthy subjects, ulcerative colitis patients, or Crohn\u2019s disease patients, vedolizumab does not \nelevate neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, B-helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, total memory T \nhelper lymphocytes, monocytes or natural killer cells, in the peripheral blood with no leukocytosis \nobserved.\n\nVedolizumab did not affect immune surveillance and inflammation of the central nervous system in \nExperimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis in non-human primates, a model of multiple sclerosis. \nVedolizumab did not affect immune responses to antigenic challenge in the dermis and muscle (see \nsection 4.4). In contrast, vedolizumab inhibited an immune response to a gastrointestinal antigenic \nchallenge in healthy human volunteers (see section 4.4).\n\nImmunogenicity\n\nAntibodies to vedolizumab may develop during vedolizumab treatment most of which are neutralising. \nThe formation of anti-vedolizumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance of vedolizumab \nand lower rates of clinical remission. \n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nIn clinical trials with intravenous vedolizumab at doses ranging from 2 to 10 mg/kg, > 95% saturation \nof \u03b14\u03b27 receptors on subsets of circulating lymphocytes involved in gut immune surveillance was \nobserved in patients.\n\n\n\n27\n\nVedolizumab did not affect CD4+ and CD8+ trafficking into the CNS as evidenced by the lack of \nchange in the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ in cerebrospinal fluid pre- and post-vedolizumab administration in \nhealthy human volunteers. These data are consistent with investigations in nonhuman primates which \ndid not detect effects on immune surveillance of the CNS.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nUlcerative colitis - vedolizumab for intravenous administration\n\nThe efficacy and safety of intravenous vedolizumab for the treatment of adult patients with moderately \nto severely active ulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12 with endoscopic sub score \u2265 2) was \ndemonstrated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating efficacy endpoints at \nweek 6 and week 52 (GEMINI 1). Enrolled patients had failed at least 1 conventional therapy, \nincluding corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and/or the TNF\u03b1 antagonist infliximab (including \nprimary non-responders). Concomitant stable doses of oral aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and/or \nimmunomodulators were permitted. \n\nFor the evaluation of the week 6 endpoints, 374 patients were randomised in a double-blind fashion \n(3:2) to receive vedolizumab 300 mg or placebo at week 0 and week 2. Primary endpoint was the \nproportion of patients with clinical response (defined as reduction in complete Mayo score of \n\uf0b3 3 points and \uf0b3 30% from baseline with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of \n\uf0b3 1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of \u2264 1 point) at week 6. Table 2 shows the results from \nthe primary and secondary endpoints evaluated.\n\nTable 2.

To evaluate efficacy at week 52, \n373 patients from cohort 1 and 2 who were treated with vedolizumab and had achieved clinical \nresponse at week 6 were randomised in a double-blind fashion (1:1:1) to 1 of the following regimens \nbeginning at week 6: vedolizumab 300 mg every 8 weeks, vedolizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks, or \nplacebo every 4 weeks. Beginning at week 6, patients who had achieved clinical response and were \nreceiving corticosteroids were required to begin a corticosteroid-tapering regimen. Primary endpoint \nwas the proportion of patients in clinical remission at week 52. Table 3 shows the results from the \nprimary and secondary endpoints evaluated.\n\n\n\n28\n\nTable 3.

Patient \nnumbers were n = 72 for placebo, n = 70 for vedolizumab every 8 weeks, and n = 73 for vedolizumab \nevery 4 weeks\n\nExploratory analyses provide additional data on key subpopulations studied. Approximately one-third \nof patients had failed prior TNF\uf061 antagonist therapy. Among these patients, 37% receiving \nvedolizumab every 8 weeks, 35% receiving vedolizumab every 4 weeks, and 5% receiving placebo \nachieved clinical remission at week 52. Improvements in durable clinical response (47%, 43%, 16%), \nmucosal healing (42%, 48%, 8%), durable clinical remission (21%, 13%, 3%) and corticosteroid-free \nclinical remission (23%, 32%, 4%) were seen in the prior TNF\u03b1 antagonist failure population treated \nwith vedolizumab every 8 weeks, vedolizumab every 4 weeks and placebo, respectively.\n\nPatients who failed to demonstrate response at week 6 remained in the study and received \nvedolizumab every 4 weeks. Clinical response using partial Mayo scores was achieved at week 10 and \nweek 14 by greater proportions of vedolizumab patients (32% and 39%, respectively) compared with \nplacebo patients (15% and 21%, respectively).\n\nPatients who lost response to vedolizumab when treated every 8 weeks were allowed to enter an \nopen-label extension study and receive vedolizumab every 4 weeks. In these patients, clinical \nremission was achieved in 25% of patients at week 28 and week 52.\n\nPatients who achieved a clinical response after receiving vedolizumab at week 0 and 2 and were then \nrandomised to placebo (for 6 to 52 weeks) and lost response were allowed to enter the open-label \nextension study and receive vedolizumab every 4 weeks. In these patients, clinical remission was \nachieved in 45% of patients by 28 weeks and 36% of patients by 52 weeks.\n\nIn this open-label extension study, the benefits of vedolizumab treatment as assessed by partial Mayo \nscore, clinical remission, and clinical response were shown for up to 196 weeks.\n\nHealth-related quality of life (HRQOL) was assessed by Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire \n(IBDQ), a disease specific instrument, and SF-36 and EQ-5D, which are generic measures. \nExploratory analysis show clinically meaningful improvements were observed for vedolizumab \ngroups, and the improvements were significantly greater as compared with the placebo group at \nweek 6 and week 52 on EQ-5D and EQ-5D VAS scores, all subscales of IBDQ (bowel symptoms, \nsystemic function, emotional function and social function), and all subscales of SF-36 including the \nPhysical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS).\n\n\n\n29\n\nUlcerative colitis - vedolizumab for subcutaneous administration\n\nThe efficacy and safety of subcutaneous vedolizumab for the treatment of adult patients with \nmoderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12 with endoscopic sub score \u2265 2) \nwas demonstrated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating efficacy \nendpoints at week 52 (VISIBLE 1). In VISIBLE 1, enrolled patients (n = 383) had failed at least \n1 conventional therapy, including corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and/or TNF\u03b1 antagonists \n(including primary non responders). Concomitant stable doses of oral aminosalicylates, corticosteroids \nand/or immunomodulators were permitted.\n\nPatients who achieved clinical response to open-label treatment with intravenous vedolizumab at \nweek 6 were eligible to be randomised For the evaluation of the week 52 endpoints, 216 (56.4%) \npatients were randomised and treated in a double-blind fashion (2:1:1) to 1 of the following regimens: \nsubcutaneous vedolizumab 108 mg every 2 weeks, intravenous vedolizumab 300 mg every 8 weeks, or \nplacebo.\nThe baseline demographics were similar for patients in vedolizumab and placebo groups. The baseline \nMayo score was between 9 to 12 (severe ulcerative colitis) in about 62% and 6 to 8 (moderate \nulcerative colitis) in about 38% of the overall study population.\n\nPrimary study endpoint clinical remission was defined as a complete Mayo score of \u2264 2 points and no \nindividual subscore > 1 point at 52 weeks in patients who had achieved a clinical response at week 6 \nof intravenous vedolizumab induction treatment. Clinical response was defined as a reduction in \ncomplete Mayo score of \u2265 3 points and \u2265 30% from baseline with an accompanying decrease in rectal \nbleeding subscore of \u2265 1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of \u2264 2 points and no individual \nsubscore >1 point.\n\nTable 4 shows the evaluated results from the primary and secondary endpoints.\n\nTable 4.

Clinical remission as assessed by the partial Mayo score was maintained in 77% of \n\n\n\n31\n\npatients at 24 weeks after transitioning to subcutaneous vedolizumab in the open-label extension \nstudy.\n\nCrohn\u2019s disease \u2013 vedolizumab for intravenous administration \n\nThe efficacy and safety of intravenous vedolizumab for the treatment of adult patients with moderately \nto severely active Crohn\u2019s disease (Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index [CDAI] score of 220 to 450) were \nevaluated in 2 studies (GEMINI 2 and 3). Enrolled patients have failed at least 1 conventional therapy, \nincluding corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and/or TNF\u03b1 antagonists (including primary \nnon-responders). Concomitant stable doses of oral corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and antibiotics \nwere permitted.\n\nThe GEMINI 2 Study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating efficacy \nendpoints at week 6 and week 52. Patients (n = 368) were randomised in a double-blind fashion (3:2) \nto receive 2 doses of vedolizumab 300 mg or placebo at week 0 and week 2. The 2 primary endpoints \nwere the proportion of patients in clinical remission (defined as CDAI score \u2264 150 points) at week 6 \nand the proportion of patients with enhanced clinical response (defined as a \u2265 100-point decrease in \nCDAI score from baseline) at week 6 (see Table 6).\n\nGEMINI 2 contained 2 cohorts of patients that received vedolizumab at weeks 0 and 2: \ncohort 1 patients were randomised to receive either vedolizumab 300 mg or placebo in a double-blind \nfashion, and cohort 2 patients were treated with open-label vedolizumab 300 mg. To evaluate efficacy \nat week 52, 461 patients from cohorts 1 and 2, who were treated with vedolizumab and had achieved \nclinical response (defined as a \u2265 70-point decrease in CDAI score from baseline) at week 6, were \nrandomised in a double-blind fashion (1:1:1) to 1 of the following regimens beginning at week 6: \nvedolizumab 300 mg every 8 weeks, vedolizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks, or placebo every 4 weeks. \nPatients showing clinical response at week 6 were required to begin corticosteroid tapering. Primary \nendpoint was the proportion of patients in clinical remission at week 52 (see Table 7).\n\nThe GEMINI 3 Study was a second randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated \nefficacy at week 6 and week 10 in the subgroup of patients defined as having failed at least \n1 conventional therapy and failed TNF\uf061 antagonist therapy (including primary non-responders) as \nwell as the overall population, which also included patients who failed at least 1 conventional therapy \nand were na\u00efve to TNF\uf061 antagonist therapy. Patients (n = 416), which included approximately 75% \nTNF\uf061 antagonist failures patients, were randomised in a double-blind fashion (1:1) to receive either \nvedolizumab 300 mg or placebo at weeks 0, 2, and 6. The primary endpoint was the proportion of \npatients in clinical remission at week 6 in the TNF\uf061 antagonist failure subpopulation. As noted in \nTable 6, although the primary endpoint was not met, exploratory analyses show that clinically \nmeaningful results were observed.\n\n\n\n32\n\nTable 6.

Combination treatment, most notably with concomitant \ncorticosteroids, appeared to be more effective in inducing remission in Crohn\u2019s disease than \nvedolizumab alone or with concomitant immunomodulators, which showed a smaller difference from \nplacebo in the rate of remission. Clinical remission rate in GEMINI 2 at week 6 was 10% (difference \nfrom placebo 2%, 95% CI: -6, 10) when administered without corticosteroids compared to 20% \n(difference from placebo 14%, 95% CI: -1, 29) when administered with concomitant corticosteroids. \nIn GEMINI 3 at week 6 and 10 the respective clinical remission rates were 18% (difference from \nplacebo 3%, 95% CI: -7, 13) and 22% (difference from placebo 8%, 95% CI: -3, 19) when \nadministered without corticosteroids compared to 20% (difference from placebo 11%, 95% CI: 2, 20) \nand 35% (difference from placebo 23%, 95% CI: 12, 33) respectively when administered with \nconcomitant corticosteroids. These effects were seen whether or not immunomodulators were also \nconcomitantly administered.\n\nExploratory analyses provide additional data on key subpopulations studied. In GEMINI 2, \napproximately half of patients had previously failed TNF\u03b1 antagonist therapy. Among these patients, \n28% receiving vedolizumab every 8 weeks, 27% receiving vedolizumab every 4 weeks, and 13% \nreceiving placebo achieved clinical remission at week 52. Enhanced clinical response was achieved in \n29%, 38%, 21%, respectively, and corticosteriod-free clinical remission was achieved in 24%, 16%, \n0%, respectively.\n\nPatients who failed to demonstrate response at week 6 in GEMINI 2 were retained in the study and \nreceived vedolizumab every 4 weeks. Enhanced clinical response was observed at week 10 and \nweek 14 for greater proportions of vedolizumab patients 16% and 22%, respectively, compared with \nplacebo patients 7% and 12%, respectively. There was no clinically meaningful difference in clinical \nremission between treatment groups at these time points. Analyses of week 52 clinical remission in \npatients who were non-responders at week 6 but achieved response at week 10 or week 14 indicate \nthat non-responder CD patients may benefit from a dose of vedolizumab at week 10.\n\nPatients who lost response to vedolizumab when treated every 8 weeks in GEMINI 2 were allowed to \nenter an open-label extension study and received vedolizumab every 4 weeks. In these patients, \nclinical remission was achieved in 23% of patients at week 28 and 32% of patients at week 52.\n\nPatients who achieved a clinical response after receiving vedolizumab at week 0 and 2 and were then \nrandomised to placebo (for 6 to 52 weeks) and lost response were allowed to enter the open-label \nextension study and receive vedolizumab every 4 weeks. In these patients, clinical remission was \nachieved in 46% of patients by 28 weeks and 41% of patients by 52 weeks.\n\n\n\n34\n\nIn this open-label extension study, clinical remission and clinical response were observed in patients \nfor up to 196 weeks.\n\nExploratory analysis showed clinically meaningful improvements were observed for the vedolizumab \nevery 4 weeks and every 8 weeks groups in GEMINI 2 and the improvements were significantly \ngreater as compared with the placebo group from baseline to week 52 on EQ-5D and EQ-5D VAS \nscores, total IBDQ score, and IBDQ subscales of bowel symptoms and systemic function.\n\nCrohn\u2019s disease - vedolizumab for subcutaneous administration\n\nThe efficacy and safety of subcutaneous vedolizumab for the treatment of adult patients with \nmoderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease (CDAI score of 220 to 450) was demonstrated in a \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating efficacy endpoints at \nweek 52 (VISIBLE 2). In VISIBLE 2, enrolled patients (n = 644) had inadequate response to, loss of \nresponse to, or intolerance to one conventional therapy, including corticosteroids, immunomodulators, \nand/or TNF\u03b1 antagonists (including primary non-responders). Concomitant stable doses of oral \naminosalicylates, corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators were permitted.\n\nPatients who achieved clinical response to open-label treatment with intravenous vedolizumab at \nweek 6 were eligible to be randomised. For the evaluation of the week 52 endpoints, 409 (64%) \npatients were randomised and treated in a double-blind fashion (2:1) to receive subcutaneous \nvedolizumab 108 mg (n = 275) or subcutaneous placebo (n = 134) every 2 weeks.\n\nThe baseline demographics were similar for patients in vedolizumab and placebo groups. The baseline \nCDAI was > 330 (severe Crohn\u2019s disease) in about 41% and \u2264 330 (moderate Crohn\u2019s disease) in \nabout 59% of the overall study population.\n\nBeginning at week 6, patients who had achieved clinical response (defined as a \u2265 70-point decrease in \nthe CDAI score from baseline) and were receiving corticosteroids were required to begin a \ncorticosteroid tapering regimen. Primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with clinical \nremission (CDAI score \u2264 150) at week 52. The secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients \nwith enhanced clinical response ( \u2265 100 point decrease in CDAI score from baseline) at week 52, the \nproportion of patients with corticosteroid-free remission (patients using oral corticosteroids at baseline \nwho had discontinued corticosteroids and were in clinical remission) at week 52, and the proportion of \nTNF\u03b1 antagonist na\u00efve patients who achieved clinical remission (CDAI score \u2264 150) at week 52.\n\nTable 8 shows the evaluated results from the primary and secondary endpoints.\n\n\n\n35\n\nTable 8.

Work productivity was assessed by WPAI-CD. Patients treated with \nsubcutaneous vedolizumab maintained improvements in IBDQ, EQ-5D and WPAI-CD scores at \nweek 52 to a greater extent than patients who received placebo.\nPatients who completed VISIBLE 2 were eligible to enrol in an ongoing, open-label extension study to \nevaluate long-term safety and efficacy of subcutaneous vedolizumab treatment in patients with \nulcerative colitis or Crohn\u2019s disease.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nvedolizumab in 1 or more subsets of the paediatric population in ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease \n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab have been studied in healthy subjects \nand in patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis or Crohn\u2019s disease.\n\nAbsorption\n\nIn patients administered 300 mg intravenous vedolizumab as a 30 minute intravenous infusion on \nweeks 0 and 2, mean serum trough concentrations at week 6 were 27.9 mcg/mL (SD \u00b1 15.51) in \nulcerative colitis and 26.8 mcg/mL (SD \u00b1 17.45) in Crohn\u2019s disease. In studies with intravenous \nvedolizumab, starting at week 6, patients received 300 mg intravenous vedolizumab every 8 or \n4 weeks. In patients with ulcerative colitis, mean steady-state serum trough concentrations were \n11.2 mcg/mL (SD \u00b1 7.24) and 38.3 mcg/mL (SD \u00b1 24.43), respectively. In patients with Crohn's \ndisease mean steady-state serum trough concentrations were 13.0 mcg/mL (SD \u00b1 9.08) \nand 34.8 mcg/mL (SD \u00b1 22.55), respectively.\n\nIn studies in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn\u2019s disease receiving subcutaneous vedolizumab, \nstarting at week 6, patients received 108 mg subcutaneous vedolizumab every 2 weeks. The mean \nsteady state serum trough concentrations were 35.8 mcg/mL (SD \u00b1 15.2) in patients with ulcerative \ncolitis and 31.4 mcg/mL (SD \u00b1 14.7) in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease. The bioavailability of \nvedolizumab following single-dose subcutaneous administration of 108 mg relative to single-dose \nintravenous administration was approximately 75%. The median time to reach maximum serum \nconcentration (tmax) was 7 days (range 3 to 14 days), and the mean maximum serum concentration \n(Cmax) was 15.4 mcg/mL (SD \u00b1 3.2).\n\nDistribution\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that the distribution volume of vedolizumab is \napproximately 5 litres. The plasma protein binding of vedolizumab has not been evaluated. \nVedolizumab is a therapeutic monoclonal antibody and is not expected to bind to plasma proteins.\n\n\n\n37\n\nVedolizumab does not pass the blood brain barrier after intravenous administration. Vedolizumab \n450 mg administered intravenously was not detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of healthy subjects.\n\nElimination\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that vedolizumab has a total body clearance of \napproximately 0.169 L/day and a serum half-life of 24 days. The exact elimination route of \nvedolizumab is not known. Population pharmacokinetic analyses suggest that while low albumin, \nhigher body weight and prior treatment with anti-TNF drugs may increase vedolizumab clearance, the \nmagnitude of their effects is not considered to be clinically relevant.\n\nLinearity\n\nVedolizumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics at serum concentrations greater than 1 mcg/mL.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nAge does not impact the vedolizumab clearance in ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease patients \nbased on the population pharmacokinetic analyses. No formal studies have been conducted to examine \nthe effects of either renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \nand development.\n\nLong-term animal studies with vedolizumab to assess its carcinogenic potential have not been \nconducted because pharmacologically responsive models to monoclonal antibodies do not exist. In a \npharmacologically responsive species (cynomolgus monkeys), there was no evidence of cellular \nhyperplasia or systemic immunomodulation that could potentially be associated with oncogenesis in \n13- and 26-week toxicology studies. Furthermore, no effects were found of vedolizumab on the \nproliferative rate or cytotoxicity of a human tumour cell line expressing the \u03b14\u03b27 integrin in vitro.\n\nNo specific fertility studies in animals have been performed with vedolizumab. No definitive \nconclusion can be drawn on the male reproductive organs in cynomolgus monkey repeated dose \ntoxicity study. Given the lack of binding of vedolizumab to male reproductive tissue in monkey and \nhuman, and the intact male fertility observed in \u03b27 integrin-knockout mice, it is not expected that \nvedolizumab will affect male fertility.\n\nAdministration of vedolizumab to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during most of gestation resulted in \nno evidence of effects on teratogenicity, prenatal or postnatal development in infants up to 6 months of \nage. Low levels (< 300 mcg/L) of vedolizumab were detected on post-partum day 28 in the milk of 3 \nof 11 cynomolgus monkeys treated 100 mg/kg of vedolizumab dosed every 2 weeks and not in any \nanimals that received 10 mg/kg.\n\n\n\n38\n\n6.

Use aseptic technique when preparing Entyvio solution for intravenous infusion.\n\n2. Remove flip-off cap from the vial and wipe with alcohol swab. Reconstitute vedolizumab with \n4.8 mL of sterile water for injections at room temperature (20 \u00b0C-25 \u00b0C), using a syringe with a \n21-25 gauge needle.\n\n3. Insert needle into the vial through the centre of the stopper and direct the stream of liquid to the \nwall of the vial to avoid excessive foaming.\n\n4. Gently swirl the vial for at least 15 seconds. Do not vigorously shake or invert.\n\n5. Let the vial sit for up to 20 minutes at room temperature (20 \u00b0C-25 \u00b0C), to allow for \nreconstitution and for any foam to settle; the vial can be swirled and inspected for dissolution \nduring this time. If not fully dissolved after 20 minutes, allow another 10 minutes for \ndissolution.\n\n6. Inspect the reconstituted solution visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to\ndilution. Solution should be clear or opalescent, colourless to light yellow and free of visible \nparticulates. Reconstituted solution with uncharacteristic colour or containing particulates must \nnot be administered.\n\n7. Once dissolved, gently invert vial 3 times.\n\n8. Immediately withdraw 5 mL (300 mg) of reconstituted Entyvio using a syringe with a \n21-25 gauge needle.\n\n9. Add the 5 mL (300 mg) of reconstituted Entyvio to 250 mL of sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL \n(0.9%) solution for injection, and gently mix the infusion bag (5 mL of sodium chloride \n9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection does not have to be withdrawn from the infusion bag \nprior to adding Entyvio). Do not add other medicinal products to the prepared infusion solution \nor intravenous infusion set. Administer the infusion solution over 30 minutes.\n\nOnce reconstituted, the infusion solution should be used as soon as possible.\n\nStorage Condition\nRefrigerator (2 \u00b0C-8 \u00b0C) 20 \u00b0C-25 \u00b0C\n\nReconstituted solution in the vial 8 hours Do not hold1\n\nDiluted solution in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL \n(0.9%) solution for injection\n\n24 hours2, 3 12 hours2\n\n1 Up to 30 minutes are allowed for reconstitution\n2 This time assumes the reconstituted solution is immediately diluted in the sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%)\nsolution for injection and held in the infusion bag only.

Vedolizumab belongs to a group of biological \nmedicines called monoclonal antibodies (MAbs).\n\nHow Entyvio works\nEntyvio works by blocking a protein on the surface of white blood cells that cause the inflammation in \nulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease.

If you do not respond well enough or cannot tolerate \nthese medicines, your doctor may give you Entyvio to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease.\n\nCrohn\u2019s disease\nCrohn\u2019s disease is a disease that causes inflammation of the digestive system. If you have Crohn\u2019s \ndisease you will first be given other medicines.

These may all be symptoms \nof a serious and potentially fatal brain condition known as progressive multifocal \nleukoencephalopathy (PML).\n\n\uf0b7 if you have an infection, or think you have an infection \u2013 signs include chills, shivering, \npersistent cough or a high fever. Some infections may become serious and possibly even \nlife-threatening if left untreated.\n\n\uf0b7 if you experience signs of an allergic reaction such as wheezing, difficulty breathing, hives, \nitching, swelling or dizziness.
