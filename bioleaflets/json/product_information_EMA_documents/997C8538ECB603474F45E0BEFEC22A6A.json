This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nRINVOQ 15 mg prolonged-release tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach prolonged-release tablet contains upadacitinib hemihydrate, equivalent to 15 mg of upadacitinib.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nProlonged-release tablet.\n\nPurple 14 x 8 mm, oblong biconvex prolonged-release tablets imprinted on one side with ‘a15’.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nRINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult \npatients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying \nanti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RINVOQ may be used as monotherapy or in combination with \nmethotrexate.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with upadacitinib should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended dose of upadacitinib is 15 mg once daily.\n\nTreatment should not be initiated in patients with an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) that is \n< 500 cells/mm3, an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) that is < 1,000 cells/mm3 or who have \nhaemoglobin (Hb) levels that are < 8 g/dL (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nDose interruption\n\nTreatment should be interrupted if a patient develops a serious infection until the infection is \ncontrolled.\n\nInterruption of dosing may be needed for management of laboratory abnormalities as described in \nTable 1.\n\n\n\n3\n\nTable 1. Laboratory measures and monitoring guidance\n\nLaboratory measure Action Monitoring guidance\n\nAbsolute Neutrophil Count (ANC)\n\nTreatment should be interrupted \nif ANC is < 1,000 cells/mm3 and \nmay be restarted once ANC \nreturns above this value\n\nEvaluate at baseline and \nthereafter according to \nroutine patient \nmanagement\n\nAbsolute Lymphocyte Count \n(ALC)\n\nTreatment should be interrupted \nif ALC is < 500 cells/mm3 and \nmay be restarted once ALC \nreturns above this value\n\nHaemoglobin (Hb)\n\nTreatment should be interrupted \nif Hb is < 8 g/dL and may be \nrestarted once Hb returns above \nthis value\n\nHepatic transaminases\nTreatment should be temporarily \ninterrupted if drug-induced liver \ninjury is suspected\n\nLipids\nPatients should be managed \naccording to international clinical \nguidelines for hyperlipidaemia\n\n12 weeks after initiation \nof treatment and \nthereafter according to \ninternational clinical \nguidelines for \nhyperlipidaemia\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients aged 65 years and older. There are limited data in patients \naged 75 years and older.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. There are limited \ndata on the use of upadacitinib in subjects with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). Upadacitinib \nshould be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. The use of upadacitinib has not \nbeen studied in subjects with end stage renal disease.\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (Child Pugh A) or moderate (Child Pugh B) \nhepatic impairment (see section 5.2). Upadacitinib should not be used in patients with severe (Child \nPugh C) hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety and efficacy of RINVOQ in children and adolescents aged 0 to less than 18 years have not \nyet been established. No data are available.\n\n\n\n4\n\nMethod of administration\n\nRINVOQ is to be taken orally once daily with or without food and may be taken at any time of the \nday. Tablets should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed, or chewed.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n Active tuberculosis (TB) or active serious infections (see section 4.4).\n Severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).\n Pregnancy (see section 4.6).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nImmunosuppressive medicinal products\n\nCombination with other potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, and \nbiologic DMARDs or other Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors has not been evaluated in clinical studies \nand is not recommended as a risk of additive immunosuppression cannot be excluded.\n\nSerious infections\n\nSerious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving upadacitinib. The most \nfrequent serious infections reported with upadacitinib included pneumonia and cellulitis (see \nsection 4.8). Cases of bacterial meningitis have been reported in patients receiving upadacitinib.\nAmong opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, oral/oesophageal \ncandidiasis, and cryptococcosis were reported with upadacitinib.\n\nUpadacitinib should not be initiated in patients with an active, serious infection, including localised \ninfections.\n\nConsider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating upadacitinib in patients:\n\n with chronic or recurrent infection\n who have been exposed to tuberculosis\n with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection\n who have resided or travelled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or\n with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.\n\nPatients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during \nand after treatment with upadacitinib. Upadacitinib therapy should be interrupted if a patient develops \na serious or opportunistic infection. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with \nupadacitinib should undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an \nimmunocompromised patient; appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, the patient should \nbe closely monitored, and upadacitinib therapy should be interrupted if the patient is not responding to \nantimicrobial therapy. Upadacitinib therapy may be resumed once the infection is controlled.\n\nAs there is a higher incidence of infections in the elderly ≥ 75 years of age, caution should be used \nwhen treating this population.\n\nTuberculosis \n\nPatients should be screened for tuberculosis (TB) before starting upadacitinib therapy. Upadacitinib\nshould not be given to patients with active TB (see section 4.3). Anti-TB therapy should be considered \nprior to initiation of upadacitinib in patients with previously untreated latent TB or in patients with risk \nfactors for TB infection.\n\n\n\n5\n\nConsultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of TB is recommended to aid in the \ndecision about whether initiating anti-TB therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.\n\nPatients should be monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of TB, including patients \nwho tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.\n\nViral reactivation \n\nViral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), was reported in \nclinical studies (see section 4.8). If a patient develops herpes zoster, interruption of upadacitinib \ntherapy should be considered until the episode resolves.\n\nScreening for viral hepatitis and monitoring for reactivation should be performed before starting and \nduring therapy with upadacitinib. Patients who were positive for hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis C \nvirus RNA were excluded from clinical studies. Patients who were positive for hepatitis B surface \nantigen or hepatitis B virus DNA were excluded from clinical studies. If hepatitis B virus DNA is \ndetected while receiving upadacitinib, a liver specialist should be consulted.\n\nVaccination\n\nNo data are available on the response to vaccination with live or inactivated vaccines in patients \nreceiving upadacitinib. Use of live, attenuated vaccines during or immediately prior to upadacitinib\ntherapy is not recommended. Prior to initiating upadacitinib, it is recommended that patients be \nbrought up to date with all immunisations, including prophylactic zoster vaccinations, in agreement \nwith current immunisation guidelines.\n\nMalignancy\n\nThe risk of malignancies, including lymphoma is increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. \nImmunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancies, including lymphoma. \nThe clinical data are currently limited and long-term studies are ongoing.\n\nMalignancies were observed in clinical studies of upadacitinib. The risks and benefits of upadacitinib\ntreatment should be considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other \nthan a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing \nupadacitinib therapy in patients who develop a malignancy.\n\nNon-melanoma skin cancer\n\nNMSCs have been reported in patients treated with upadacitinib. Periodic skin examination is \nrecommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.\n\nHaematological abnormalities\n\nAbsolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) < 1 x 109 cells/L, Absolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC) < 0.5 x 109\n\ncells/L and haemoglobin < 8 g/dL were reported in ≤1 % of patients in clinical trials (see section 4.8).\nTreatment should not be initiated, or should be temporarily interrupted, in patients with an ANC < 1 \nx 109 cells/L, ALC < 0.5 x 109 cells/L or haemoglobin < 8 g/dL observed during routine patient \nmanagement (see section 4.2).\n\nCardiovascular risk\n\nRheumatoid arthritis patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders. Patients treated with \nupadacitinib should have risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidaemia) managed as part of usual \nstandard of care.\n\n\n\n6\n\nLipids\n\nTreatment with upadacitinib was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total \ncholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol\n(see section 4.8). Elevations in LDL cholesterol decreased to pre-treatment levels in response to statin \ntherapy, although evidence is limited. The effect of these lipid parameter elevations on cardiovascular \nmorbidity and mortality has not been determined (see section 4.2 for monitoring guidance).\n\nHepatic transaminase elevations\n\nTreatment with upadacitinib was associated with an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation \ncompared to placebo.\n\nEvaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Prompt investigation of \nthe cause of liver enzyme elevation is recommended to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver \ninjury.\n\nIf increases in ALT or AST are observed during routine patient management and drug-induced liver \ninjury is suspected, upadacitinib therapy should be interrupted until this diagnosis is excluded.\n\nVenous thromboembolism\n\nEvents of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in \npatients receiving JAK inhibitors including upadacitinib. Upadacitinib should be used with caution in \npatients at high risk for DVT/PE. Risk factors that should be considered in determining the patient’s \nrisk for DVT/PE include older age, obesity, a medical history of DVT/PE, patients undergoing major \nsurgery, and prolonged immobilisation. If clinical features of DVT/PE occur, upadacitinib treatment \nshould be discontinued and patients should be evaluated promptly, followed by appropriate treatment.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect the pharmacokinetics of upadacitinib\n\nUpadacitinib is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4. Therefore, upadacitinib plasma exposures can be \naffected by medicinal products that strongly inhibit or induce CYP3A4.\n\nCoadministration with CYP3A4 inhibitors\n\nUpadacitinib exposure is increased when co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as \nketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, and clarithromycin). In a clinical study, \ncoadministration of upadacitinib with ketoconazole resulted in 70% and 75% increases in upadacitinib \nCmax and AUC, respectively. Upadacitinib should be used with caution in patients receiving chronic \ntreatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Consider alternatives to strong CYP3A4 inhibitor \nmedications when used in the long-term.\n\nCoadministration with CYP3A4 inducers\n\nUpadacitinib exposure is decreased when co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inducers (such as \nrifampin and phenytoin), which may lead to reduced therapeutic effect of upadacitinib. In a clinical \nstudy, coadministration of upadacitinib after multiple doses of rifampicin (strong CYP3A inducer) \nresulted in approximately 50% and 60% decreases in upadacitinib Cmax and AUC, respectively. \nPatients should be monitored for changes in disease activity if upadacitinib is co-administered with \nstrong CYP3A4 inducers.\n\nMethotrexate and pH modifying medicinal products (e.g., antacids or proton pump inhibitors) have no \neffect on upadacitinib plasma exposures. \n\n\n\n7\n\nPotential for upadacitinib to affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products\n\nAdministration of multiple 30 mg once daily doses of upadacitinib (a dose that is twice the \nrecommended upadacitinib dose) to healthy subjects had a limited effect on midazolam (sensitive drug \nsubstrate for CYP3A) plasma exposures (26% decrease in midazolam AUC and Cmax), indicating that\nupadacitinib 30 mg once daily may have a weak induction effect on CYP3A. In a clinical study, \nrosuvastatin and atorvastatin AUC were decreased by 33% and 23%, respectively, and rosuvastatin \nCmax was decreased by 23% following the administration of multiple 30 mg once daily doses of \nupadacitinib to healthy subjects. Upadacitinib had no relevant effect on atorvastatin Cmax or on plasma \nexposures of ortho-hydroxyatorvastatin (major active metabolite for atorvastatin). No dose adjustment \nis recommended for CYP3A substrates or for rosuvastatin or atorvastatin when coadministered with \nupadacitinib.\n\nUpadacitinib has no relevant effects on plasma exposures of ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel, \nmethotrexate, or medicinal products that are substrates for metabolism by CYP1A2, CYP2B6,\nCYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment \nand for 4 weeks following the final dose of upadacitinib.\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no or limited data on the use of upadacitinib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Upadacitinib was teratogenic in rats and rabbits with \neffects in bones in rat foetuses and in the heart in rabbit foetuses when exposed in utero.\n\nUpadacitinib is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3).\n\nIf a patient becomes pregnant while taking upadacitinib the parents should be informed of the potential \nrisk to the foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether upadacitinib/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of upadacitinib in milk (see \nsection 5.3).\n\nA risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded.\n\nUpadacitinib should not be used during breast-feeding. A decision must be made whether to \ndiscontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue upadacitinib therapy taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\n\nThe effect of upadacitinib on human fertility has not been evaluated. Animal studies do not indicate \neffects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3).\n\n\n\n8\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nUpadacitinib has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are upper respiratory tract infections\n(13.5%), nausea (3.5%), blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increased (2.5%) and cough (2.2%). The \nmost common serious adverse reactions were serious infections (see section 4.4).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from registrational clinical studies.\nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: very \ncommon (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100). Within each \nfrequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 2.

In \nmethotrexate (MTX)-controlled studies, the frequency of infection over 12/14 weeks in the \nupadacitinib 15 mg monotherapy group was 19.5% compared to 24.0% in the MTX group. The overall \nlong-term rate of infections for the upadacitinib 15 mg group across all five Phase 3 clinical studies \n(2,630 patients) was 93.7 events per 100 patient-years.\n\n\n\n9\n\nIn placebo-controlled clinical studies with background DMARDs, the frequency of serious infection \nover 12/14 weeks in the upadacitinib 15 mg group was 1.2% compared to 0.6% in the placebo group. \nIn MTX-controlled studies, the frequency of serious infection over 12/14 weeks in the upadacitinib \n15 mg monotherapy group was 0.6% compared to 0.4% in the MTX group. The overall long-term rate \nof serious infections for the upadacitinib 15 mg group across all five Phase 3 clinical studies was 3.8 \nevents per 100 patient-years. The most common serious infection was pneumonia. The rate of serious \ninfections remained stable with long-term exposure.\n\nThere was a higher rate of serious infections in patients ≥ 75 years of age, although data are limited.\n\nThe frequencies of infection ADRs for upadacitinib compared to placebo were: URTI (13.5% vs \n9.5%), pneumonia (0.5% vs 0.3%), herpes zoster (0.7% vs 0.2%), herpes simplex (0.8% v 0.5%), and \noral candidiasis (0.4% vs. <0.1%). Most of the herpes zoster events involved a single dermatome and \nwere non-serious.\n\nOpportunistic infections (excluding tuberculosis)\n\nIn placebo-controlled clinical studies with background DMARDs, the frequency of opportunistic \ninfections over 12/14 weeks in the upadacitinib 15 mg group was 0.5% compared to 0.3% in the \nplacebo group. In MTX-controlled studies, there were no cases of opportunistic infection over 12/14\nweeks in the upadacitinib 15 mg monotherapy group and 0.2% in the MTX group. The overall long-\nterm rate of opportunistic infections for the upadacitinib 15 mg group across all five Phase 3 clinical \nstudies was 0.6 events per 100 patient-years.\n\nHepatic transaminase elevations\n\nIn placebo-controlled studies with background DMARDs, for up to 12/14 weeks, alanine transaminase \n(ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) elevations ≥ 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) in at least one \nmeasurement were observed in 2.1% and 1.5% of patients treated with upadacitinib 15 mg, compared \nto 1.5% and 0.7%, respectively, of patients treated with placebo. Most cases of hepatic transaminase \nelevations were asymptomatic and transient.\n\nIn MTX-controlled studies, for up to 12/14 weeks, ALT and AST elevations ≥ 3 x ULN in at least one \nmeasurement were observed in 0.8% and 0.4% of patients treated with upadacitinib 15 mg, compared \nto 1.9% and 0.9%, respectively, of patients treated with MTX.\n\nThe pattern and incidence of elevation in ALT/AST remained stable over time including in long term \nextension studies.\n\nLipid elevations\n\nUpadacitinib 15 mg treatment was associated with dose-dependent increases in lipid parameters \nincluding total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. There was no change \nin the LDL/HDL ratio. Elevations were observed at 2 to 4 weeks of treatment and remained stable \nwith longer-term treatment. Among patients in the controlled studies with baseline values below the \nspecified limits, the following frequencies of patients were observed to shift to above the specified \nlimits on at least one occasion during 12/14 weeks (including patients who had an isolated elevated \nvalue):\n\n\n\n10\n\n Total cholesterol ≥ 5.17 mmol/L (200 mg/dL): 62% vs. 31%, in the upadacitinib 15 mg and \nplacebo groups, respectively\n\n LDL cholesterol ≥ 3.36 mmol/L (130 mg/dL): 42% vs. 19%, in the upadacitinib 15 mg and \nplacebo groups, respectively\n\n HDL cholesterol ≥ 1.03 mmol/L (40 mg/dL): 89% vs. 61%, in the upadacitinib 15 mg and \nplacebo groups, respectively\n\n Triglycerides ≥ 2.26 mmol/L (200 mg/dL): 25% vs. 15%, in the upadacitinib 15 mg and placebo \ngroups, respectively\n\nCreatine phosphokinase\n\nIn placebo-controlled studies with background DMARDs, for up to 12/14 weeks, increases in CPK\nvalues were observed. CPK elevations > 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) were reported in 1.0% and \n0.3% of patients over 12/14 weeks in the upadacitinib 15 mg and placebo groups, respectively. Most \nelevations > 5 x ULN were transient and did not require treatment discontinuation. Mean CPK values \nincreased by 4 weeks with a mean increase of 60 U/L at 12 weeks and then remained stable at an \nincreased value thereafter including with extended therapy.\n\nNeutropaenia\n\nIn placebo-controlled studies with background DMARDs, for up to 12/14 weeks, decreases in \nneutrophil counts below 1,000 cells/mm3 in at least one measurement occurred in 1.1% and <0.1% of \npatients in the upadacitinib 15 mg and placebo groups, respectively. In clinical studies, treatment was \ninterrupted in response to ANC < 1,000 cells/mm3 (see section 4.2). Mean neutrophil counts decreased \nover 4 to 8 weeks. The decreases in neutrophil counts remained stable at a lower value than baseline \nover time including with extended therapy.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nUpadacitinib was administered in clinical studies up to doses equivalent in daily AUC to 60 mg \nprolonged-release once daily. Adverse reactions were comparable to those seen at lower doses and no \nspecific toxicities were identified. Approximately 90% of upadacitinib in the systemic circulation is \neliminated within 24 hours of dosing (within the range of doses evaluated in clinical studies). In case \nof an overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse \nreactions. Patients who develop adverse reactions should receive appropriate treatment.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, selective immunosuppressants ATC code:\nL04AA44\n\nMechanism of action\n\nJanus Kinases (JAKs) are intracellular enzymes that transmit cytokine or growth factor signals \ninvolved in a broad range of cellular processes including inflammatory responses, hematopoiesis and \nimmune surveillance. The JAK family of enzymes contains four members, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and \nTYK2 which work in pairs to phosphorylate and activate signal transducers and activators of \ntranscription (STATs). This phosphorylation, in turn, modulates gene expression and cellular function. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11\n\nJAK1 is important in inflammatory cytokine signals while JAK2 is important for red blood cell \nmaturation and JAK3 signals play a role in immune surveillance and lymphocyte function.\n\nUpadacitinib is a selective and reversible JAK inhibitor. In human cellular assays, upadacitinib \npreferentially inhibits signalling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with functional selectivity over cytokine \nreceptors that signal via pairs of JAK2.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nInhibition of IL-6 induced STAT3 and IL-7 induced STAT5 phosphorylation\n\nIn healthy volunteers, the administration of upadacitinib (immediate release formulation) resulted in a \ndose- and concentration-dependent inhibition of IL-6 (JAK1/JAK2) - induced STAT3 and IL-7 \n(JAK1/JAK3)-induced STAT5 phosphorylation in whole blood. The maximal inhibition was observed \n1 hour after dosing which returned to near baseline by the end of dosing interval.\n\nLymphocytes\n\nTreatment with upadacitinib was associated with a small, transient increase in mean ALC from \nbaseline up to Week 36 which gradually returned to at or near baseline levels with continued \ntreatment.\n\nhsCRP\n\nTreatment with upadacitinib was associated with decreases from baseline in mean hsCRP levels as \nearly as Week 1 which were maintained with continued treatment.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nThe efficacy and safety of upadacitinib 15 mg once daily was assessed in five Phase 3 randomised, \ndouble-blind, multicentre studies in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis \nand fulfilling the ACR/EULAR 2010 classification criteria (see Table 3). Patients 18 years of age and \nolder were eligible to participate. The presence of at least 6 tender and 6 swollen joints and evidence \nof systemic inflammation based on elevation of hsCRP was required at baseline. All studies included \nlong-term extensions for up to 5 years.\n\nThe primary analysis for each of these studies included all randomised subjects who received at least 1 \ndose of study drug, and non-responder imputation was used for categorical endpoints.\n\nAcross the Phase 3 studies, the efficacy seen with upadacitinib 15 mg QD was generally similar to that \nobserved with upadacitinib 30 mg QD.\n\nTable 3: Clinical trials summary\n\nStudy name Population (n) Treatment arms Key outcome measures\nSELECT-EARLY  MTX-naivea\n\n(947)\nUpadacitinib 15 mg\nUpadacitinib 30 mg\nMTX\n\nMonotherapy\n\n Primary endpoint: clinical remission \n(DAS28-CRP) at week 24 \n\n Low disease activity (DAS28-CRP) \n ACR50\n Radiographic progression (mTSS) \n Physical function (HAQ-DI)\n SF-36 PCS\n\n\n\n12\n\nSELECT-\nMONOTHERAPY\n\nMTX-IRb\n\n(648)\nUpadacitinib 15 mg\nUpadacitinib 30 mg\nMTX\n\nMonotherapy\n\n Primary endpoint: low disease activity \n(DAS28-CRP) at week 14\n\n Clinical remission (DAS28-CRP)\n ACR20\n Physical function (HAQ-DI)\n SF-36 PCS\n Morning stiffness\n\nSELECT-NEXT csDMARD-IRc\n\n(661)\nUpadacitinib 15 mg\nUpadacitinib 30 mg\nPlacebo\n\nOn background \ncsDMARDs\n\n Primary endpoint: low disease activity \n(DAS28-CRP) at week 12\n\n Clinical remission (DAS28-CRP)\n ACR20\n Physical function (HAQ-DI)\n SF-36 PCS\n Low disease activity (CDAI)\n Morning stiffness\n FACIT-F\n\nSELECT-\nCOMPARE\n\nMTX-IRd\n\n(1,629)\nUpadacitinib 15 mg\nPlacebo\nAdalimumab 40 mg\n\nOn background MTX\n\nPrimary endpoint: clinical remission \n(DAS28-CRP) at week 12\n\nLow disease activity (DAS28-CRP)\nACR20\nLow disease activity (DAS28-CRP) vs \n\nadalimumab \nRadiographic progression (mTSS)\nPhysical function (HAQ-DI) \nSF-36 PCS\nLow disease activity (CDAI)\nMorning stiffness\nFACIT-F\n\nSELECT-\nBEYOND\n\nbDMARD-IRe\n\n(499)\nUpadacitinib 15 mg\nUpadacitinib 30 mg\nPlacebo\n\nOn background \ncsDMARDs\n\n Primary endpoint: low disease activity \n(DAS28-CRP) at week 12\n\n ACR20\n Physical function (HAQ-DI)\n SF-36 PCS\n\nAbbreviations: ACR20 (or 50) = American College of Rheumatology ≥20% (or ≥50%) improvement;\nbDMARD = biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, CRP = C-Reactive Protein, DAS28 = Disease \nActivity Score 28 joints, mTSS = modified Total Sharp Score, csDMARD = conventional synthetic disease-\nmodifying anti-rheumatic drug, HAQ-DI = Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index, SF-36 PCS = \nShort Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Score, CDAI = Clinical Disease Activity \nIndex, FACIT-F = Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue score, IR = inadequate \nresponder, MTX = methotrexate, n = number randomised\na.

Compared to adalimumab, significantly higher rates of low \ndisease activity were achieved at week 12 in SELECT-COMPARE. Overall, both low disease activity \nand clinical remission rates were consistent across patient populations, with or without MTX.\n\nACR Response\n\nIn all studies, more patients treated with upadacitinib 15 mg achieved ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 \nresponses at 12 weeks compared to placebo, MTX, or adalimumab (Table 4). Time to onset of efficacy \nwas rapid across measures with greater responses seen as early as week 1 for ACR20. Durable \nresponse rates were observed (with or without MTX), with ACR20/50/70 responses maintained for at \nleast 1 year.\n\nTreatment with upadacitinib 15 mg, alone or in combination with csDMARDs, resulted in \nimprovements in individual ACR components, including tender and swollen joint counts, patient and \nphysician global assessments, HAQ-DI, pain assessment and hsCRP.\n\nTable 4: Response and remission\n\nStudy\n\nSELECT\nEARLY\n\nMTX-Naїve\n\nSELECT\nMONO\n\nMTX-IR\n\nSELECT\nNEXT\n\ncsDMARD-IR\n\nSELECT\nCOMPARE\n\nMTX-IR\n\nSELECT\nBEYOND\n\nbDMARD-IR\n\nMTX\nUPA\n15mg MTX\n\nUPA\n15mg PBO\n\nUPA\n15mg PBO\n\nUPA\n15mg\n\nADA\n40mg PBO\n\nUPA\n15mg\n\nN 314 317 216 217 221 221 651 651 327 169 164\n\nWeek\nLDA DAS28-CRP ≤3.2 (% of patients)\n\n12a/14b 28 53g 19 45e 17 48e 14 45e,h 29 14 43e\n\n24c26d 32 60f 18 55g,h 39\n\n48 39 59g 50h 35\n\nCR DAS28-CRP <2.6 (% of patients)\n\n12a/14b 14 36g 8 28e 10 31e 6 29e,h 18 9 29g\n\n24c26d 18 48e 9 41g,h 27\n\n48 29 49g 38i 28\n\nACR20 (% of patients)\n\n12a/14b 54 76g 41 68e 36 64e 36 71e,j 63 28 65e\n\n24c/26d 59 79g 36 67g,i 57\n\n48 57 74g 65i 54\n\nACR50 (% of patients)\n\n12a/14b 28 52g 15 42g 15 38g 15 45g,h 29 12 34g\n\n24c/26d 33 60e 21 54g,h 42\n\n48 43 63g 49i 40\n\nACR70 (% of patients)\n\n12a/14b 14 32g 3 23g 6 21g 5 25g,h 13 7 12\n\n24c/26d 18 44g 10 35g,h 23\n\n48 29 51g 36h 23\n\nCDAI ≤10 (% of patients)\n\n12a/14b 30 46g 25 35l 19 40e 16 40e,h 30 14 32g\n\n\n\n14\n\nRadiographic response\n\nInhibition of progression of structural joint damage was assessed using the modified Total Sharp Score \n(mTSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score, at weeks 24/26 and \nweek 48 in SELECT-EARLY and SELECT-COMPARE.\n\nTreatment with upadacitinib 15 mg resulted in significantly greater inhibition of the progression of \nstructural joint damage compared to placebo in combination with MTX in SELECT-COMPARE and \nas monotherapy compared to MTX in SELECT-EARLY (Table 5).

Moreover, upadacitinib treated patients reported \nsignificant improvements in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness \nTherapy-Fatigue score (FACIT-F) compared to placebo.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nRINVOQ in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in chronic idiopathic arthritis (including \nrheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, spondyloarthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis) (see section \n4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nUpadacitinib plasma exposures are proportional to dose over the therapeutic dose range. Steady-state \nplasma concentrations are achieved within 4 days with minimal accumulation after multiple once-daily \nadministrations.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing oral administration of upadacitinib prolonged-release formulation, upadacitinib is absorbed \nwith a median Tmax of 2 to 4 hours. Coadministration of upadacitinib with a high-fat meal had no \n\n\n\n17\n\nclinically relevant effect on upadacitinib exposures (increased AUC by 29% and Cmax by 39%). In \nclinical trials, upadacitinib was administered without regard to meals (see section 4.2). In vitro, \nupadacitinib is a substrate for the efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP.\n\nDistribution\n\nUpadacitinib is 52% bound to plasma proteins. Upadacitinib partitions similarly between plasma and \nblood cellular components, as indicated by the blood to plasma ratio of 1.0.\n\nMetabolism\n\nUpadacitinib metabolism is mediated by CYP3A4 with a potential minor contribution from CYP2D6. \nThe pharmacologic activity of upadacitinib is attributed to the parent molecule. In a human \nradiolabeled study, unchanged upadacitinib accounted for 79% of the total radioactivity in plasma \nwhile the main metabolite (product of monooxidation followed by glucuronidation) accounted for 13% \nof the total plasma radioactivity. No active metabolites have been identified for upadacitinib.\n\nElimination\n\nFollowing single dose administration of [14C]-upadacitinib immediate-release solution, upadacitinib \nwas eliminated predominantly as the unchanged parent substance in urine (24%) and faeces (38%). \nApproximately 34% of upadacitinib dose was excreted as metabolites. Upadacitinib mean terminal \nelimination half-life ranged from 9 to 14 hours.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nRenal impairment has no clinically relevant effect on upadacitinib exposure. Upadacitinib AUC was \n18%, 33%, and 44% higher in subjects with mild (estimated glomerular filtration rate 60 to \n89 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (estimated glomerular filtration rate 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2), and \nsevere (estimated glomerular filtration rate 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment, respectively, \ncompared to subjects with normal renal function. Upadacitinib Cmax was similar in subjects with \nnormal and impaired renal function.\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nMild (Child-Pugh A) and moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment has no clinically relevant \neffect on upadacitinib exposure. Upadacitinib AUC was 28% and 24% higher in subjects with mild \nand moderate hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to subjects with normal liver function. \nUpadacitinib Cmax was unchanged in subjects with mild hepatic impairment and 43% higher in \nsubjects with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal liver function. \nUpadacitinib was not studied in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of upadacitinib have not yet been evaluated in a paediatric population (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nIntrinsic factors\n\nAge, sex, body weight, race, and ethnicity did not have a clinically meaningful effect on upadacitinib \nexposure.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology.\n\n\n\n18\n\nUpadacitinib, at exposures (based on AUC) approximately 4 and 10 times the clinical dose of 15 mg in \nmale and female Sprague-Dawley rats, respectively, was not carcinogenic in a 2-year carcinogenicity \nstudy in Sprague-Dawley rats. Upadacitinib was not carcinogenic in a 26-week carcinogenicity study \nin CByB6F1-Tg(HRAS)2Jic transgenic mice.\n\nUpadacitinib was not mutagenic or genotoxic based on the results of in vitro and in vivo tests for gene \nmutations and chromosomal aberrations.\n\nUpadacitinib had no effect on fertility in male or female rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day in males and \n75 mg/kg/day in females in a fertility and early embryonic development study. Dose related increases \nin foetal resorptions associated with post-implantation losses at 25 and 75 mg/kg/day in this study in \nrats were attributed to the developmental/teratogenic effects of upadacitinib. Upadacitinib was \nteratogenic in both rats and rabbits. In a pre-/postnatal development study in rats, there were no \nmaternal effects, no effects on parturition, lactation or maternal behaviour and no effects on their \noffspring.\n\nFollowing administration of upadacitinib to lactating rats, the concentrations of upadacitinib in milk \nover time generally paralleled those in plasma, with approximately 30-fold higher exposure in milk \nrelative to maternal plasma. Approximately 97% of drug-related material in milk was parent drug.\n\n6.

What you need to know before you take RINVOQ\n3. How to take RINVOQ\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store RINVOQ\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What RINVOQ is and what it is used for\n\nRINVOQ contains the active substance upadacitinib. It belongs to a group of medicines called Janus \nkinase inhibitors, which help reduce inflammation.\n\nRINVOQ is used to treat adults with rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease that causes \ninflamed joints. If you have moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given \nother medicines, one of which will usually be methotrexate. If these medicines do not work well \nenough, you will be given RINVOQ either alone or in combination with methotrexate to treat your \nrheumatoid arthritis.\n\nRINVOQ works by reducing the activity of an enzyme in the body called ‘Janus kinase’.
