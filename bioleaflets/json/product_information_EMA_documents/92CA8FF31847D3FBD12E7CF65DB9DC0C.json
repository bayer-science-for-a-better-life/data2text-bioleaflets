NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nForcaltonin 100 IU solution for injection \n \n \n2.  QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne ampoule of Forcaltonin 100 IU contains 100 International Units (IU) corresponding to \napproximately 15 micrograms recombinant salmon calcitonin (produced by recombinant DNA \ntechnology in Escherichia coli) in 1 ml of an acetate buffer. \n \nFor excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3.  PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection \n \nClear colourless solution \n \n \n4.  CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1  Therapeutic indications \n \nCalcitonin is indicated for: \n \n• Prevention of acute bone loss due to sudden immobilisation such as in patients with recent \n\nosteoporotic fractures \n \n\n• Paget’s disease \n \n• Hypercalcaemia of malignancy \n\n \n4.2  Posology and method of administration \n \nFor subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous infusion (product specific) use in individuals aged 18 \nyears or more. \n \nSalmon calcitonin may be administered at bedtime to reduce the incidence of nausea or vomiting \nwhich may occur, especially at the initiation of therapy. \n \nPrevention of acute bone loss: \nThe recommended dosage is 100 I.U. daily or 50 I.U. twice daily for 2 to 4 weeks, administered \nsubcutaneously or intramuscularly. The dose may be reduced to 50 I.U. daily at the start of \nremobilisation. The treatment should be maintained until patients are fully mobilized. \n \nPaget’s disease: \nThe recommended dosage is 100 IU per day administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly, \nhowever, a minimum dosage regimen of 50 IU three times a week has achieved clinical and \nbiochemical improvement. Dosage is to be adjusted to the individual patient’s needs. The duration of \ntreatment depends on the indication for treatment and the patient´s response. The effect of calcitonin \nmay be monitored by measurement of suitable markers of bone remodeling, such as serum alkaline \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 3\n\nphosphatase or urinary hydroxyproline or deoxypyridinoline. The dose may be reduced after the \n \n \ncondition of the patient has improved. \n \nHypercalcemia of malignancy: \nThe recommended starting dose is 100 IU every 6 to 8 hours by subcutaneous or intramuscular \ninjection. In addition, salmon calcitonin could be administered by intravenous injection after previous \nrehydration. \nIf the response is not satisfactory after one or two days, the dose may be increased to a maximum of \n400 IU every 6 to 8 hours. In severe or emergency cases, intravenous infusion with up to 10 IU/kg \nbody weight in 500ml 0.9% w/v sodium chloride solution may be administered over a period of at \nleast 6 hours. \n \nUse in elderly, hepatic and renal impairment patients \nExperience with the use of calcitonin in the elderly has shown no evidence of reduced tolerability or \naltered dosage requirements. The same applies to patients with altered hepatic function. The metabolic \nclearance is much lower in patients with end-stage renal failure than in healthy subjects. However, the \nclinical relevance of this finding is not known (see section 5.2) \n \n4.3  Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n \nCalcitonin is also contraindicated in patients with hypocalcaemia. \n \n4.4  Special warnings and special precautions for use \n \nBecause calcitonin is a peptide, the possibility of systemic allergic reactions exists and allergic-type \nreactions including isolated cases of anaphylactic shock have been reported in patients receiving \ncalcitonin. Such reactions should be differentiated from generalised or local flushing, which are \ncommon non-allergic effects of calcitonin (see 4.8). Skin testing should be conducted in patients with \nsuspected sensitivity to calcitonin prior to their treatment with calcitonin. \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially \nsodium free. \n \n4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nSerum calcium levels may be transiently decreased to below normal levels following administration of \ncalcitonin, notably upon initiation of therapy in patients with abnormally high rates of bone turnover. \nThis effect is diminished as osteoclastic activity is reduced. However, care should be exercised in \npatients receiving concurrent treatment with cardiac glycosides or calcium channel blocking agents. \nDosages of these drugs may require adjustment in view of the fact that their effects may be modified \nby changes in cellular electrolyte concentrations. \n \nThe use of calcitonin in combination with bisphosphonates may result in an additive calcium-lowering \neffect. \n \n4.6  Pregnancy and lactation \n \nCalcitonin has not been studied in pregnant women. Calcitonin should be used during pregnancy only \nif treatment is considered absolutely essential by the physician. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 4\n\nIt is not known if the substance is excreted in human milk. In animals, salmon calcitonin has been \nshown to decrease lactation and to be excreted in milk (see 5.3). Therefore, breast-feeding is not \nrecommended during treatment. \n \n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo data exist on the effects of injectable calcitonin on the ability to drive and use machines. Injectable \ncalcitonin may cause transient dizziness (see 4.8. Undesirable effects) which may impair the reaction \nof the patient. Patients must therefore be warned that transient dizziness may occur, in which case they \nshould not drive or use machines. \n \n4.8  Undesirable effects \n \nFrequency categories: \nVery common ( >1/10); common (>1/100, <1/10); uncommon (>1/1,000, < 1/100); rare (>1/10,000, < \n1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), including isolated reports. \n \nGastrointestinal disorder: \nVery common: Nausea with or without vomiting is noted in approximately 10% of patients treated \nwith calcitonin. The effect is more evident on initiation of therapy and tends to decrease or disappear \nwith continued administration or a reduction in dose. An antiemetic may be administered, if required. \nNausea/vomiting are less frequent when the injection is done in the evening and after meals. \nUncommon: diarrhea \n \nVascular disorders: \nVery common: \nSkin flushes (facial or upper body). These are not allergic reactions but are due to a pharmacological \neffect, and are usually observed 10 to 20 minutes after administration. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nUncommon: local inflammatory reactions at the site of subcutaneous or intramuscular injection \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nUncommon: skin rash \n \nNervous system disorders: \nUncommon: metallic taste in the mouth; dizziness \n \nRenal and urinary disorders: \nUncommon: diuresis \n \nMetabolic and nutrition disorders: \nRare: In case of patients with high bone remodelling (Paget’s disease and young patients) a transient \ndecrease of calcaemia may occur between the 4th and the 6th hour after administration, usually \nasymptomatic \n \nInvestigations: \nRare: Neutralising antibodies to calcitonin rarely develop. The development of these antibodies is not \nusually related to loss of clinical efficacy, although their presence in a small percentage of patients \nfollowing long-term therapy with calcitonin may result in a reduced response to the product. The \npresence of antibodies appears to bear no relationship to allergic reactions, which are rare. Calcitonin \nreceptor down-regulation may also result in a reduced clinical response in a small percentage of \npatients following long-term therapy. \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 5\n\nImmune system disorders: \nVery rare: serious allergic-type reactions, such as bronchospasm, swelling of the tongue and throat, \nand in isolated cases, anaphylaxis. \n \n4.9  Overdose \n \nNausea, vomiting, flushing and dizziness are known to be dose dependent when calcitonin is \nadministered parenterally. Single doses (up to 10,000 I.U.) of injectable salmon calcitonin have been \nadministered without adverse reactions, other than nausea and vomiting, and exacerbation of \npharmacological effects. \n \nShould symptoms of overdose appear, treatment should be symptomatic. \n \n \n5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antiparathyroid hormone, ATC code: H05BA01 (calcitonin, salmon). \n \nThe pharmacological properties of the synthetic and recombinant peptides have been demonstrated to \nbe qualitatively and quantitatively equivalent. \nCalcitonin is a calciotropic hormone, which inhibits bone resorption by a direct action on osteoclasts. \nBy inhibiting osteoclast activity via its specific receptors, salmon calcitonin decreases bone resorption. \nIn pharmacological studies, calcitonin has been shown to have analgesic activity in animal models. \n \nCalcitonin markedly reduces bone turnover in conditions with an increased rate of bone resorption \nsuch as Paget ‘s disease and acute bone loss due to sudden immobilisation. \nThe absence of mineralisation defect with calcitonin has been demonstrated by bone \nhistomorphometric studies both in man and in animals. \nDecreases in bone resorption as judged by a reduction in urinary hydroxyproline and \ndeoxypyridinoline are observed following calcitonin treatment in both normal volunteers and patients \nwith bone-related disorders, including Paget’s disease and osteoporosis. \n \nThe calcium-lowering effect of calcitonin is caused both by a decrease in the efflux of calcium from \nthe bone to the ECF and inhibition of renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. \n \n5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nGeneral characteristics of the active substance \nSalmon calcitonin is rapidly absorbed and eliminated. \nPeak plasma concentrations are attained within the first hour of administration. \nAnimal studies have shown that calcitonin is primarily metabolised via proteolysis in the kidney \nfollowing parenteral administration. The metabolites lack the specific biological activity of calcitonin. \nBioavailability following subcutaneous and intramuscular injection in humans is high and similar for \nthe two routes of administration (71% and 66%, respectively). \nCalcitonin has short absorption and elimination half-lives of 10-15 minutes and 50-80 minutes, \nrespectively. Salmon calcitonin is primarily and almost exclusively degraded in the kidneys, forming \npharmacologically inactive fragments of the molecule. Therefore, the metabolic clearance is much \nlower in patients with end-stage renal failure than in healthy subjects. However, the clinical relevance \nof this finding is not known. \nPlasma protein binding is 30 to 40%. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 6\n\nCharacteristics in patients \nThere is a relationship between the subcutaneous dose of calcitonin and peak plasma concentrations. \nFollowing parenteral administration of 100 I.U. calcitonin, peak plasma concentration lies between \nabout 200 and 400 pg/ml. Higher blood levels may be associated with increased incidence of nausea \nand vomiting. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nConventional long-term toxicity, reproduction, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity studies have been \nperformed in laboratory animals. Salmon calcitonin is devoid of embryotoxic, teratogenic and \nmutagenic potential. \nAn increased incidence of pituitary adenomas has been reported in rats given synthetic salmon \ncalcitonin for 1 year. This is considered a species-specific effect and of no clinical relevance. \nSalmon calcitonin does not cross the placental barrier. \n \nIn lactating animals given calcitonin, suppression of milk production has been observed. Calcitonin is \nsecreted into the milk. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n-  If you have further questions, please ask your doctor or your pharmacist. \n-  This medicine has been prescribed for you personally and you should not pass it on to others. \n\nIt may harm them, even if their symptoms are the same as yours. \n \nIn this leaflet: \n1.

Storing FORCALTONIN \n \nFORCALTONIN 100 IU Solution for Injection, \nrecombinant salmon calcitonin \n-  The active substance is recombinant salmon calcitonin. Each ampoule contains 100 IU \n\n(15 micrograms in 1.0 ml) of recombinant salmon calcitonin. The salmon calcitonin contained \nin Forcaltonin is not made by a conventional, chemical method but by genetic engineering. \nHowever, the structure of the active substance of FORCALTONIN is the same as that of \nchemically synthesised salmon calcitonin. The effects of recombinant salmon calcitonin on \nthe body have also been shown to be equivalent to those of synthetic salmon calcitonin. \n\n-  The other ingredients are acetic acid, glacial, sodium acetate trihydrate, sodium chloride and \nwater for injections. \n\n \nThe Marketing Authorisation Holder for FORCALTONIN is Unigene UK Limited, 191 Sparrows \nHerne, Bushey Heath, Hertfordshire WD23 1AJ, UK. \n \nThe manufacturer is FAMAR S.A., 7 P. Marinopoulou Str., 174 56 Alimos, Athens, Greece. \n \n \n1.  WHAT FORCALTONIN IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nFORCALTONIN is a solution for injection. The solution is clear, colourless and sterile. It is contained \nin a glass ampoule. \n \nEach ampoule of FORCALTONIN contains 1 ml of solution with 100 International Units (IU) of the \nactive substance. This corresponds to about 15 micrograms of recombinant salmon calcitonin. Each \npack contains 10 ampoules. \n \nThe active substance of FORCALTONIN is recombinant salmon calcitonin. Salmon calcitonin is a \nhormone which increases the amount of calcium and phosphate laid down in the bones and lowers the \nlevel of calcium circulating in the blood. \n \nFORCALTONIN is used to prevent loss of bone if you are suddenly immobilised, for example, after \nhaving a fracture due to osteoporosis. It is also used to treat Paget's disease (a chronic disease of the \nbones characterised by inflammation and deformation), and hypercalcaemia of malignancy (increased \ncalcium blood levels due to tumours). \n \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 18\n\n2.  BEFORE YOU USE FORCALTONIN \n \nDo not use FORCALTONIN: \n-  if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to salmon calcitonin or any of the other ingredients of \n\nFORCALTONIN. Extreme sensitivity to salmon calcitonin may cause difficulties in \nbreathing (bronchospasm), swelling of the tongue or throat, or even an anaphylactic shock (a \nvery severe type of allergic response). Serious allergic reactions will need emergency \ntreatment. If you are unsure whether you are allergic to salmon calcitonin, please discuss the \nmatter with your doctor.  He can perform a skin test to find out how sensitive you are to \nsalmon calcitonin. Your doctor may then decide that it is not safe for you to receive this \nmedicine. \n\n-  if you have hypocalcaemia. \n \nPregnancy \nIf you are pregnant, please tell your doctor. It is not known whether this medicine is safe to use during \npregnancy. FORCALTONIN should therefore not be given to pregnant women. Calcitonin should be \nused during pregnancy only under exceptional circumstances appreciated by the physician. \n \nBreast-feeding \nYou should not breast-feed your child while you are being treated with FORCALTONIN. \n \nDriving and using machines: \nNo data exist on the effects of injectable calcitonin on the ability to drive and use machines. Injectable \ncalcitonin may cause transient dizziness which may impair the reaction of the patient. Patients must \ntherefore be warned that transient dizziness may occur, in which case they should not drive or use \nmachines.” \n \nImportant Information about some of the Ingredients of FORCALTONIN \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmole (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. essentially sodium \nfree. \n \nUsing FORCALTONIN with other medicines: \nThere have been no reports that other drugs influence the effects of FORCALTONIN. However, \nFORCALTONIN might influence the effects of certain drugs given to treat heart complaints. Please \ntell your doctor if you are receiving treatment for a heart complaint, because the dose of the heart drug \nmay need to be adjusted. \n \nYou should tell your doctor if you are taking other calcium lowering drugs, such as bisphosphonates, \nas the combination of these drugs with FORCALTONIN might cause the amount of calcium in your \nblood to become too low. \n \nUse of FORCALTONIN in children: \nIt is not recommended to use FORCALTONIN in children. \n \n \n3.  HOW TO USE FORCALTONIN \n \nFORCALTONIN is only available from your doctor. It is intended for your use only. Do not pass it on \nto anyone else. \n \nFORCALTONIN must be given by injection. The injection will be given to you by a doctor or a \nnurse. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 19\n\nThe following instructions for use are recommended to ensure that you obtain the full benefit of \ntreatment with FORCALTONIN. In some cases, however, your doctor may decide to use another dose \nor another frequency of dosing. Please ask him to explain the reasons for any changes in your \ntreatment schedule. \n \nPrevention of bone loss due to sudden immobilisation. The recommended dose is 100 International \nUnits (15 micrograms of salmon calcitonin) daily, or 50 International Units (7.5 micrograms salmon \ncalcitonin) twice daily, for 2 to 4 weeks, by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. Your doctor \nmay reduce the dose of FORCALTONIN after your condition has improved. \n \nPaget's disease of bone. The recommended dose is 100 International Units (15 micrograms of salmon \ncalcitonin) once daily by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. A minimum dose of 50 \nInternational Units (7.5 micrograms of salmon calcitonin) three times a week in some patients may be \nsufficient. Your doctor may reduce the dose of FORCALTONIN you receive after your condition has \nimproved. \n \nHypercalcaemia of malignancy. The recommended starting dose is 100 International Units (15 \nmicrograms of salmon calcitonin) every 6 to 8 hours by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. If the \nresponse to treatment is not satisfactory after one or two days, the dose may be increased to 400 \nInternational Units every 6 to 8 hours. In severe or emergency cases, an intravenous infusion with 10 \nInternational Units per kilogram body weight in 500 ml 0.9% w/v sodium chloride solution may be \ngiven to you by your doctor or nurse over a period of 6 hours. \n \nIf you have any questions about your treatment schedule, ask your doctor or nurse. If you have the \nimpression that the effect of FORCALTONIN is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist. \n \nDuration of treatment \nThe length of time over which you will receive FORCALTONIN will depend on the way you respond \nto the treatment. Your body's response to treatment will be tested at regular intervals and your doctor \nwill decide whether your treatment needs to be continued and which dose should be used. \n \nIf you have any questions about the length of your treatment, ask your doctor or nurse. You should \nalso talk to your doctor if you feel that the effect of FORCALTONIN is decreasing or that you are no \nlonger benefiting from treatment. Never change the dose yourself or stop injecting the medicine \nwithout consulting your doctor first. \n \nIf you use more FORCALTONIN than you should: \nIf you or your doctor accidentally inject more than the recommended dose of FORCALTONIN, it is \nextremely unlikely to have any serious effects. \n \nIf you forget to take FORCALTONIN: \nIf you forget to inject your medicine at the correct time, inject it as soon as you remember unless it is \nalmost time for the next dose. In this case, you should wait until it is time to inject the next dose and \nthen continue as before. Never take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. \nTell your doctor as soon as possible if you miss a dose of FORCALTONIN. \n \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n 20\n\n4.  POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, FORCALTONIN can have side effects. \n \nYou should discuss the possible undesirable effects with your doctor who will be able to advise you \non the risks and benefits of your treatment. Some of the undesirable effects will disappear without \nbeing treated but others may need medical attention. Tell your doctor or nurse immediately, if you \nnotice any of the effects listed below. \n \nThe only serious undesirable effect which has been reported in patients treated with salmon calcitonin \nis an allergic reaction. Examples of serious allergic reactions to salmon calcitonin are: \n \n• difficulties in breathing (bronchospasm) \n• swelling of the tongue or throat \n• anaphylactic shock (a very severe type of allergic response) \n \n\nSuch allergic reactions have only been seen in a very few cases and the most extreme form, \nanaphylactic shock, is very rare. Serious allergic reactions will need emergency treatment. Inform \nyour doctor immediately if any of the above effects occur. He will take the appropriate \ncountermeasures. \n \nApproximately 10% of patients treated with salmon calcitonin suffer from nausea, sometimes with \nvomiting. This undesirable effect occurs mostly at the beginning of treatment and tends to decrease or \neven disappear as treatment continues. The effect may also disappear if the dose is reduced. \n \nIrritation at or around the injection site has been reported occasionally in patients treated with salmon \ncalcitonin. The effect disappears without the need for special treatment. It is recommended that you do \nnot inject your medicine at exactly the same site each time you use it in order to avoid discomfort. \n \nFlushing of the face and hands has been noted. Again, this effect disappears with time, usually during \nthe first or second week of treatment. \n \nOther possible but less frequent undesirable effects are: \n \n• skin rash \n• diuresis (increase in urination) \n• diarrhoea \n• metallic taste in the mouth \n• dizziness \n \n\nAll of these undesirable effects are mild and occur in isolated cases only. Most of the effects do not \nlast long and disappear of their own accord. The remaining effects can be treated by your doctor if \nthey persist. \n \nLike all medicines, FORCALTONIN may have undesirable effects which are very rare. If you notice \nany unwanted effects not mentioned in this leaflet or any change in your health while receiving this \nmedicine, or afterwards, please inform your doctor, nurse or pharmacist (chemist). \n \n \n5.
