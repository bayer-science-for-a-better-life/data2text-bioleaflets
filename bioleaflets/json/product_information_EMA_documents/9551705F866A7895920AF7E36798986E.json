This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \n\nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO 300 mg solution for injection  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO 300 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION  \n\n \n\nOne unit (vial or pre-filled syringe) contains 300 mg of lanadelumab* in 2 mL solution. \n\n \n\n*Lanadelumab is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology.  \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  \n\n \n\nSolution for injection  \n\nSolution for injection in pre-filled syringe. \n\n \n\nThe solution is colourless to slightly yellow, appearing either clear or slightly opalescent.  \n\n \n\nThe solution has a pH of approximately 6.0 and an osmolality of approximately 300 mOsm/kg.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS  \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO is indicated for routine prevention of recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) \n\nin patients aged 12 years and older.  \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration  \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \n\nmanagement of patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE).  \n\n \n\nPosology  \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 300 mg lanadelumab every 2 weeks. In patients who are stably \n\nattack free on treatment, a dose reduction of 300 mg lanadelumab every 4 weeks may be considered, \n\nespecially in patients with low weight. \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO is not intended for treatment of acute HAE attacks (see section 4.4)  \n\n \n\nMissed doses  \n\n \n\nIf a dose of TAKHZYRO is missed, the patient should be instructed to administer the dose as soon as \n\npossible ensuring at least 10 days between doses.  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nSpecial populations  \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nAge is not expected to affect exposure to lanadelumab. No dose adjustment is required for patients \n\nabove 65 years of age (see section 5.2).  \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment  \n\n \n\nNo studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment is not \n\nexpected to affect exposure to lanadelumab. No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment (see section 5.2).  \n\n \n\nRenal impairment  \n\n \n\nNo studies have been conducted in patients with severe renal impairment. Renal impairment is not \n\nexpected to affect exposure to lanadelumab or the safety profile. No dose adjustment is required in \n\npatients with renal impairment. (see section 5.2).  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of TAKHZYRO in children aged less than 12 years have not been established. \n\nNo data are available.  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO is intended for subcutaneous (SC) administration only.  \n\n \n\nEach TAKHZYRO unit (vial or pre-filled syringe) is intended for single use only (see section 6.6).  \n\n \n\nThe injection should be restricted to the recommended injection sites: the abdomen, the thighs, and the \n\nupper outer arms (see section 5.2). Rotation of the injection site is recommended. \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO may be self-administered or administered by a caregiver only after training on SC \n\ninjection technique by a healthcare professional.  \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications  \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n\n \n\nTraceability  \n\n \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.  \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions  \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions have been observed. In case of a severe hypersensitivity reaction, \n\nadministration of TAKHZYRO must be stopped immediately and appropriate treatment must be \n\ninitiated.  \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTAKHZYRO is not intended for treatment of acute HAE attacks. In case of a breakthrough HAE \n\nattack, individualized treatment should be initiated with an approved rescue medication.  \n\n \n\nThere are no available clinical data on the use of lanadelumab in HAE patients with normal C1-INH \n\nactivity. \n\n \n\nInterference with coagulation test  \n\n \n\nLanadelumab can increase activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) due to an interaction of \n\nlanadelumab with the aPTT assay. The reagents used in the aPTT laboratory test initiate intrinsic \n\ncoagulation through the activation of plasma kallikrein in the contact system. Inhibition of plasma \n\nkallikrein by lanadelumab can increase aPTT in this assay. None of the increases in aPTT in patients \n\ntreated with TAKHZYRO were associated with abnormal bleeding adverse events. There were no \n\ndifferences in international normalised ratio (INR) between treatment groups.  \n\n \n\nSodium content  \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \n\n'sodium-free'.  \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n\n \n\nNo dedicated drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted. Based on the characteristics of \n\nlanadelumab, no pharmacokinetic interactions with co-administered medicinal products is expected. \n\n \n\nAs expected, concomitant use of the rescue medication C1 esterase inhibitor results in an additive \n\neffect on lanadelumab-cHMWK response based on the mechanism of action (MOA) of lanadelumab \n\nand C1 esterase inhibitor (see section 5.1).  \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \n\n \n\nPregnancy  \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited data from the use of lanadelumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not \n\nindicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive or developmental toxicity (see \n\nsection 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of lanadelumab during \n\npregnancy.  \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding  \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether lanadelumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be excreted \n\nin breast milk during the first few days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon \n\nafterwards; consequently, a risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded during this short period. \n\nAfterwards, lanadelumab could be used during breast-feeding if clinically needed. \n\n \n\nFertility  \n\n \n\nLanadelumab’s effect on fertility has not been evaluated in humans. Lanadelumab had no effect on \n\nmale or female fertility in cynomolgus monkeys (see section 5.3).  \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO has negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines.  \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile  \n\n \n\nThe most commonly (52.4%) observed adverse reaction associated with TAKHZYRO was injection \n\nsite reactions (ISR) including injection site pain, injection site erythema and injection site bruising. Of \n\nthese ISRs, 97% were of mild intensity, 90% resolved within 1 day after onset with a median duration \n\nof 6 minutes.  \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reaction (mild and moderate pruritus, discomfort and tingling of tongue) was \n\nobserved (1.2%), see section 4.4.  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n\n \n\nTable 1 summarises adverse reactions observed in the HELP study that included 84 subjects with \n\nHAE, who received at least one dose of TAKHZYRO.  \n\n \n\nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed in Table 1 is defined using the following convention: \n\nVery common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n\n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000).  \n\n \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions reported with lanadelumab  \n\n \n\nSystem organ class  Adverse drug reaction  Frequency  \n\nImmune system disorders  Hypersensitivity*  Common  \n\nNervous system disorders  Dizziness  Common  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  Rash maculo-papular  Common  \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \n\ndisorders  \nMyalgia  Common  \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \n\nsite conditions  \nInjection site reactions**  Very common  \n\nInvestigations  \nAlanine aminotransferase increased Common  \n\nAspartate aminotransferase increased Common  \n\n*Hypersensitivity includes: pruritus, discomfort and tingling of tongue.  \n\n**Injection site reactions include: pain, erythema, bruising, discomfort, haematoma, haemorrhage, \n\npruritus, swelling, induration, paraesthesia, reaction, warmth, oedema and rash.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\n \n\nThe safety of TAKHZYRO was evaluated in a subgroup of 23 subjects aged 12 to <18 years old. \n\nResults of the subgroup analysis were consistent with overall study results for all subjects.  \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity  \n\n \n\nTreatment with lanadelumab has been associated with development of treatment emergent anti-drug \n\nantibodies (ADA) in 11.9% (10/84) of subjects. All antibody titres were low. The ADA response was \n\ntransient in 20% (2/10) of ADA positive subjects. 2.4% (2/84) of lanadelumab-treated subjects tested \n\npositive for neutralising antibodies.  \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nThe development of ADA including neutralising antibodies against TAKHZYRO did not appear to \n\nadversely affect the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) profiles or clinical response.  \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V.  \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose  \n\n \n\nNo case of overdose has been reported. There is no available information to identify potential signs \n\nand symptoms of overdose. If symptoms should occur, symptomatic treatment is recommended. There \n\nis no antidote available.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other haematological agents, drugs used in hereditary angioedema, ATC \n\ncode: B06AC05 \n\n  \n\nMechanism of action  \n\n \n\nLanadelumab is a fully human, monoclonal antibody (IgG1/ κ-light chain). Lanadelumab inhibits \n\nactive plasma kallikrein proteolytic activity. Increased plasma kallikrein activity leads to angioedema \n\nattacks in patients with HAE through the proteolysis of high-molecular-weight-kininogen (HMWK) to \n\ngenerate cleaved HMWK (cHMWK) and bradykinin. Lanadelumab provides sustained control of \n\nplasma kallikrein activity and thereby limits bradykinin generation in patients with HAE.  \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects  \n\n \n\nConcentration-dependent inhibition of plasma kallikrein, measured as reduction of cHMWK levels, \n\nwas demonstrated after SC administration of TAKHZYRO 150 mg every 4 weeks, 300 mg every \n\n4 weeks or 300 mg every 2 weeks in subjects with HAE.  \n\n \n\nThe PK-PD relationship between TAKHZYRO and cHMWK is described by an indirect exposure-\n\nresponse pharmacological model. The cHMWK formation rate was maximally reduced by 53.7% with \n\nan IC50 of 5705 ng/ml.  \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety  \n\n \n\nHELP study  \n\n \n\nThe HELP study was a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group study \n\nin 125 (115 adults and 10 adolescents) subjects with symptomatic type I or II HAE. Subjects were \n\nrandomised into 1 of 4 parallel treatment arms, stratified by baseline attack rate, in a 3:2:2:2 ratio \n\n(placebo, lanadelumab 150 mg every 4 weeks [q4wks], lanadelumab 300 mg every 4 weeks [q4wks], \n\nor lanadelumab 300 mg every 2 weeks [q2wks] by SC injection) for the 26-week treatment period.  \n\n \n\nThe median (range) age of the study population was 42 (12 to 73) years with 88 female subjects \n\n(70%).

Interim analysis indicates that the effect was sustained up to one year \n\nof treatment.  \n\nPaediatric population  \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nTAKHZYRO in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of hereditary \n\nangioedema attacks.  \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n\n \n\nThe single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics of lanadelumab have been studied in patients with \n\nHAE. Pharmacokinetics of lanadelumab showed linear dose-exposure response with doses up to \n\n400 mg and reproducible exposure following subcutaneous administration up to 12 months. The \n\nabsolute bioavailability of lanadelumab after subcutaneous administration has not been determined. In \n\nthe HELP study, patients treated with 300 mg q2 wks presented mean (SD) area under the curve over \n\nthe dosing interval at steady-state (AUCtau,ss), maximum concentration at steady-state (Cmax,ss) and \n\nminimum concentration at steady-state (Cmin,ss) of 408 µg*day/ml (138), 34.4 µg/mL (11.2), and \n\n25.4 µg/mL (9.18), respectively. The anticipated time to reach steady state concentration was \n\napproximately 70 days.  \n\n \n\nAbsorption  \n\n \n\nFollowing SC administration, the time to maximum concentration is approximately 5 days. The site of \n\nSC injection (thigh, arm, or abdomen) and self-administration did not affect the absorption of \n\nlanadelumab.  \n\n \n\nDistribution  \n\n \n\nThe mean (SD) volume of distribution of lanadelumab in patients with HAE is 14.5 litres (4.53). \n\nLanadelumab is a therapeutic monoclonal antibody and is not expected to bind to plasma proteins.  \n\n \n\nElimination  \n\n \n\nLanadelumab has a mean (SD) total body clearance of 0.0297 L/h (0.0124) and a terminal elimination \n\nhalf-life of approximately 14 days.  \n\n \n\nSpecial populations  \n\n \n\nNo dedicated studies have been conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of lanadelumab in special \n\npatient populations including gender, age, pregnant women or the presence of renal or hepatic \n\nimpairment.  \n\n \n\nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis, after correcting for body weight, no influence of gender or \n\nage (12 to 75 years) was apparent on the clearance or volume of distribution of lanadelumab.  \n\n \n\nAlthough body weight was identified as an important covariate describing the variability of clearance, \n\na 300 mg q2wks dose regimen provided sufficient exposure for the indication (see section 5.1).  \n\n \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment  \n\n \n\nAs IgG monoclonal antibodies are mainly eliminated via intracellular catabolism, renal impairment or \n\nhepatic impairment is not expected to influence clearance of lanadelumab.  \n\n\n\n10 \n\nAccordingly, in a population pharmacokinetic analysis, renal impairment (estimated GFR: \n\n60 to 89 ml/min/1.73 m2 [mild, N=98] and 30 to 59 ml/min/1.73m2 [moderate, N=9]) had no effect on \n\nthe clearance or volume of distribution of lanadelumab.  \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n\n \n\nIn repeat-dose studies evaluating once weekly SC injection in both rats (up to 28 days) and \n\ncynomolgus monkeys (up to 6 months) lanadelumab was well-tolerated at doses of up to and including \n\n50 mg/kg (highest dose tested) with no organs of toxicity identified. Exposures in cynomolgus \n\nmonkeys following 6 months of administration were approximately 23-fold greater than that noted at \n\n300 mg q2 wks based on AUC. \n\n \n\nLanadelumab is not expected to interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal material, as it is \n\nmade up entirely of naturally occurring amino acids and contains no inorganic or synthetic linkers or \n\nother nonprotein portions; therefore no genotoxicity evaluation has been conducted. \n\nCarcinogenicity has not been evaluated in animals as based on the weight of evidence approach, \n\nlanadelumab is considered to have a low risk for carcinogenicity.  \n\n \n\nThe effects of lanadelumab on fertility were evaluated in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys. In a \n\n13-week study, once weekly SC administration of lanadelumab had no effects on male or female \n\nfertility at doses of 10 or 50 mg/kg (highest dose tested). Exposures in sexually mature cynomolgus \n\nmonkeys in the fertility study were approximately 20-and 22-fold greater than that noted at \n\n300 mg q2 wks based on Cmax and AUC, respectively.  \n\n \n\nIn the ePPND study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys administered once weekly doses of 10 or 50 mg/kg \n\n(highest dose tested), there were no lanadelumab-related effects on pregnancy and parturition, \n\nembryo-foetal development, survival, growth, and/or postnatal development of offspring. Exposures in \n\nthe ePPND study were approximately 32-fold greater than that noted at 300 mg q2 wks based on \n\nAUC.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

You may need to read it again.  \n\n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n\n• This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

Instructions for use  \n \n\n \n\n1. What TAKHZYRO is and what it is used for  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO contains the active substance lanadelumab.  \n\n \n\nWhat TAKHZYRO is used for  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO is a medicine used in adults,  and adolescents aged 12 years and older to prevent \n\nangioedema attacks, in patients with HAE.  \n\n \n\nWhat hereditary angioedema (HAE) is  \n\n \n\nHAE is a condition which runs in families. With this condition your blood does not have enough of a \n\nprotein called ‘C1 inhibitor’, or C1 inhibitor does not work properly. This leads to too much ‘plasma \n\nkallikrein’, which in turn produces higher levels of ‘bradykinin’ in your bloodstream. Too much \n\nbradykinin leads to symptoms of HAE like swelling and pain on the, \n\n• hands and feet  \n\n• face, eyelids, lips or tongue  \n\n• voice-box (larynx), which may make breathing difficult  \n\n• genitals  \n \n\nHow TAKHZYRO works  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO is a type of protein that blocks the activity of plasma kallikrein. This helps to reduce the \n\namount of bradykinin in your bloodstream and prevents symptoms of HAE.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use TAKHZYRO  \n\n \n\nDo not use TAKHZYRO:  \n\n \n\nIf you are allergic to lanadelumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\n \n\n• Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using TAKHZYRO.  \n\n• If you have a severe allergic reaction to TAKHZYRO with symptoms such as a rash, a tight \nchest, wheezing, or a fast heart beat, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately.  \n\n \n\nKeeping a record  \n\n \n\nIt is strongly recommended that every time you have a dose of TAKHZYRO, you write down the \n\nname and batch number of the medicine. This is so that you keep a record of the batches used.  \n\n \n\nLaboratory tests  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you are using TAKHZYRO before you have laboratory tests to measure how well \n\nyour blood is clotting. This is because TAKHZYRO in the blood may interfere with some laboratory \n\ntests, leading to inaccurate results \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO is not recommended for use in children under 12 years of age. This is because it has not \n\nbeen studied in this age group.  \n\n \n\nOther medicines and TAKHZYRO  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines.  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO is not known to affect other medicines or be affected by other medicines.  \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before starting to use TAKHZYRO. There is limited information \n\non the safety of TAKHZYRO use during pregnancy and breast-feeding. As a precautionary measure, it \n\nis preferable to avoid the use of lanadelumab during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Your doctor will \n\ndiscuss with you the risks and benefits of taking this medicine.  \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines  \n\n \n\nThis medicine has negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines.  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO contains sodium  \n\n \n\nThe medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml of solution, that is to say essentially \n\n‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use TAKHZYRO  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO is provided in single-use vials as ready-to-use solution. Your treatment will be started \n\nand managed under the supervision of a doctor experienced in the care of patients with HAE.  \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has \n\ntold you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure or have any further questions \n\non the use of this medicine.  \n\n \n\nHow much TAKHZYRO to use  \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 300 mg every 2 weeks. If you have not had an attack for a long \n\nperiod, your doctor may change the dose to 300 mg every 4 weeks, especially if you have a low body \n\nweight.  \n\n \n\nHow to inject TAKHZYRO  \n\n \n\nIf you inject TAKHZYRO yourself or if your caregiver injects it, you or your caregiver must \n\ncarefully read and follow the instructions in section 7, “Instructions for use”.  \n\n \n\n• TAKHZYRO is for injection under the skin (‘subcutaneous injection’).  \n\n• The injection can be given either by yourself or a caregiver.  \n\n• A doctor, pharmacist or nurse should show you how to prepare and inject TAKHZYRO \nproperly before you use it for the first time. Do not inject yourself or someone else until you \n\nhave been trained to inject the medicine.  \n\n• Insert the needle into the fatty tissue in the tummy (abdomen), thigh or upper arm.  \n\n• Inject the medicine in a different place each time.  \n\n• Use each vial of TAKHZYRO only once.  \n \n\nIf you use more TAKHZYRO than you should  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you take too much TAKHZYRO.  \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use TAKHZYRO  \n\n \n\nIf you miss a dose of TAKHZYRO, inject your dose as soon as possible but there must be at least \n\n10 days between each dose. If you are not sure when to inject TAKHZYRO after a missed dose, ask \n\nyour doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n\n \n\nIf you stop using TAKHZYRO  \n\n \n\nIt is important that you keep injecting TAKHZYRO as instructed by your doctor even if you feel \n\nbetter.  \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects  \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n\n \n\nIf you have a severe allergic reaction to TAKHZYRO with symptoms such as a rash, tight chest, \n\nwheezing, or a fast heart beat, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately.  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you notice any of the following side effects.  \n\n \n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):  \n\n \n\n• Reactions where the injection is given – symptoms include pain, skin redness, bruising, \ndiscomfort, swelling, bleeding, itching, hardening of skin, tingling, warmth and rash.  \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):  \n\n \n\n• Allergic reactions including itching, discomfort and tingling of the tongue  \n\n• Dizziness, feeling faint  \n\n• Raised skin rash  \n\n• Muscle pain  \n\n• Blood tests showing liver changes  \n \n\nReporting of side effects  \n\n \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Prepare the vial of TAKHZYRO  \n2. Attach blunt tip vial access needle to syringe  \n3. Transfer TAKHZYRO into syringe and switch to the pointed-tip injection needle  \n4. Select and prepare injection site  \n5. Inject TAKHZYRO  \n \n\n \n\nStep 1: Prepare the vial of TAKHZYRO  \n\n \n\na) Take the vial out of the refrigerator \n15 minutes before use to allow it to reach \n\nroom temperature (15°C to 25°C) before \n\npreparing an injection.  \n\nb) Clean your work area and wash your hands \nbefore preparing your dose. Do not touch any \n\nsurface or your body, especially your face, \n\nafter washing your hands before injection.  \n\nc) Gather your TAKHZYRO and supplies and \nplace them on your well-lit work surface.  \n\nd) Remove the vial from the packaging. Do not \nuse the vial if the cap covering the stopper is \n\nmissing.  \n\n \n\ne) Gently invert the vial 3 to 5 times to \nensure the solution is mixed. Do not shake \n\nthe vial as this can cause foaming.  \n\nf) Check the solution in the vial for particles or \na change in the colour (normally it is \n\ncolourless to slightly yellow). Do not use if \n\nyou see particles or a change in colour.  \n\n \n\nImportant: Do not shake.  \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\n \n \n\ng) Remove the plastic cap from the vial. Do not \nremove the vial rubber stopper.  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nh) Place the vial on a flat surface. Clean the vial \nrubber stopper with an alcohol wipe and \n\nallow it to dry.  \n\n \n\nStep 2: Attach blunt tip vial access needle to syringe  \n\n \n\n \n\na) Screw the 18 gauge blunt tip vial access needle to \nthe 3 ml syringe.  \n\n \n\nb) Pull back the plunger to fill the syringe with air \nequal to the amount of solution in the vial.  \n\nImportant: Do not remove the needle cap \n\nfrom the needle when attaching to the syringe.  \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nc) Pull off the needle cap straight away from the \nsyringe without touching the needle. Do not pull \n\non the plunger.  \n\n \n\n \n\nStep 3: Transfer TAKHZYRO into syringe and switch to the pointed-tip injection needle  \n\n \n\n \n\na) Insert the needle into the centre of the rubber \nstopper.  \n\nb) Push the plunger down to inject air into the vial \nand hold the plunger down.  \n\n \n\nc) Slowly turn the vial upside down with needle and \nsyringe attached. Pull back on the plunger to \n\nwithdraw the full dose in the vial.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nd) Remove large air bubbles by gently tapping on \nthe syringe with your fingers until the bubbles \n\nrise to the top of the syringe.  \n\n \n\nSlowly push the plunger, allowing air to go back \n\ninto the vial, until the solution reaches the top of \n\nthe syringe.  \n\n \n\nRepeat these steps until large air bubbles are \n\nremoved.  \n\nImportant: Be sure to keep the tip of the \n\nneedle in the liquid to avoid drawing air in as \n\nyou pull back the plunger.  \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\n \n\ne) Without removing the needle from the vial, \nunscrew the syringe by holding the top of the \n\nneedle and turning the syringe counter clockwise.  \n\n \n\nReturn the syringe to an upright position.  \n\n \n\nf) Place the 18 gauge blunt-tip vial access needle \nand the vial in a sharps container.  \n\n \n\n \n\ng) Screw the 27 gauge x 13 mm pointed-tip \ninjection needle to the syringe.  \n\n \n\n \n\nImportant: Do not remove the needle cap \n\nfrom the needle when attaching to the syringe.  \n\nDo not use the blunt tip vial access needle to \n\ninject TAKHZYRO as this may cause pain \n\nand bleeding.  \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nStep 4: Select and prepare injection site \n\n  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\na) Choose an injection site on your stomach \n(abdomen), thigh, or upper arm. The \n\ninjection should be given subcutaneously.  \n\nb) Clean your injection site with an alcohol \nwipe and allow the skin to dry completely.  \n\n \n\nStep 5: Inject TAKHZYRO \n\n \n\n \n\nc) Pull off the needle cap straight from the syringe \nwithout touching the needle. Do not pull on the \n\nplunger. Do not touch the needle tip or allow it to \n\ntouch any other surface.  \n\n \n \n\n \n\nImportant: \n\n• It is important to use \ndifferent injection sites to \n\nkeep skin healthy.  \n\n• The area you choose for \ninjection should be at least \n\n5 cm away from any scars \n\nor your belly button (navel). \n\nDo not choose an area that \n\nis bruised, swollen, or \n\npainful.  \n\n• The outer area of the upper \narm is not recommended if \n\nyou are injecting yourself.  \n\nImportant: Inject TAKHZYRO within 2 hours \n\nof preparing the dosing syringe at room \n\ntemperature.  Alternatively, you can place the \n\ndosing syringe in a refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C \n\nand you must use it within 8 hours.  \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n \n\nd) Gently pinch about 3 cm of skin at your cleaned \ninjection site and insert the needle.  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\ne) Push the plunger slowly until all the medicine has \nbeen injected. Release the skin fold and gently \n\nremove the needle. Do not recap the needle.  \n\n \n\nf) Place the 27 gauge x 13 mm pointed-tip injection \nneedle and the syringe in a sharps container.  \n\n \n\nImportant: Be sure to inject into a \n\nsubcutaneous space which is not too shallow \n\n(skin layer) or too deep (muscle).  \n\n\n\n47 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO 300 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n\nlanadelumab  \n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring.

Instructions for use  \n \n\n \n\n1. What TAKHZYRO is and what it is used for  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO contains the active substance lanadelumab.  \n\n \n\nWhat TAKHZYRO is used for  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO is a medicine used in adults,  and adolescents aged 12 years and older to prevent \n\nangioedema attacks, in patients with HAE.  \n\n \n\nWhat hereditary angioedema (HAE) is  \n\n \n\nHAE is a condition which runs in families. With this condition your blood does not have enough of a \n\nprotein called ‘C1 inhibitor’, or C1 inhibitor does not work properly. This leads to too much ‘plasma \n\nkallikrein’, which in turn produces higher levels of ‘bradykinin’ in your bloodstream. Too much \n\nbradykinin leads to symptoms of HAE like swelling and pain on the, \n\n• hands and feet  \n\n• face, eyelids, lips or tongue  \n\n• voice-box (larynx), which may make breathing difficult  \n\n• genitals  \n \n\nHow TAKHZYRO works  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO is a type of protein that blocks the activity of plasma kallikrein. This helps to reduce the \n\namount of bradykinin in your bloodstream and prevents symptoms of HAE.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n48 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use TAKHZYRO  \n\n \n\nDo not use TAKHZYRO:  \n\n \n\nIf you are allergic to lanadelumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\n \n\n• Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using TAKHZYRO.  \n\n• If you have a severe allergic reaction to TAKHZYRO with symptoms such as a rash, a tight \nchest, wheezing, or a fast heart beat, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately.  \n\n \n\nKeeping a record  \n\n \n\nIt is strongly recommended that every time you have a dose of TAKHZYRO, you write down the \n\nname and batch number of the medicine. This is so that you keep a record of the batches used.  \n\n \n\nLaboratory tests  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you are using TAKHZYRO before you have laboratory tests to measure how well \n\nyour blood is clotting. This is because TAKHZYRO in the blood may interfere with some laboratory \n\ntests, leading to inaccurate results \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO is not recommended for use in children under 12 years of age. This is because it has not \n\nbeen studied in this age group.  \n\n \n\nOther medicines and TAKHZYRO  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines.  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO is not known to affect other medicines or be affected by other medicines.  \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before starting to use TAKHZYRO. There is limited information \n\non the safety of TAKHZYRO use during pregnancy and breast-feeding. As a precautionary measure, it \n\nis preferable to avoid the use of lanadelumab during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Your doctor will \n\ndiscuss with you the risks and benefits of taking this medicine.  \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines  \n\n \n\nThis medicine has negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines.  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO contains sodium  \n\n \n\nThe medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml of solution, that is to say essentially \n\n‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n49 \n\n3. How to use TAKHZYRO  \n\n \n\nTAKHZYRO is provided in single-use pre-filled syringes as ready-to-use solution. Your treatment \n\nwill be started and managed under the supervision of a doctor experienced in the care of patients with \n\nHAE.  \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has \n\ntold you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure or have any further questions \n\non the use of this medicine.  \n\n \n\nHow much TAKHZYRO to use  \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 300 mg every 2 weeks. If you have not had an attack for a long \n\nperiod, your doctor may change the dose to 300 mg every 4 weeks, especially if you have a low body \n\nweight.  \n\n \n\nHow to inject TAKHZYRO  \n\n \n\nIf you inject TAKHZYRO yourself or if your caregiver injects it, you or your caregiver must \n\ncarefully read and follow the instructions in section 7, “Instructions for use”.  \n\n \n\n• TAKHZYRO is for injection under the skin (‘subcutaneous injection’).  \n\n• The injection can be given either by yourself or a caregiver.  \n\n• A doctor, pharmacist or nurse should show you how to prepare and inject TAKHZYRO \nproperly before you use it for the first time. Do not inject yourself or someone else until you \n\nhave been trained to inject the medicine.  \n\n• Insert the needle into the fatty tissue in the tummy (abdomen), thigh or upper arm.  \n\n• Inject the medicine in a different place each time.  \n\n• Use each pre-filled syringe of TAKHZYRO only once.  \n \n\nIf you use more TAKHZYRO than you should  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you take too much TAKHZYRO.  \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use TAKHZYRO  \n\n \n\nIf you miss a dose of TAKHZYRO, inject your dose as soon as possible but there must be at least \n\n10 days between each dose. If you are not sure when to inject TAKHZYRO after a missed dose, ask \n\nyour doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n\n \n\nIf you stop using TAKHZYRO  \n\n \n\nIt is important that you keep injecting TAKHZYRO as instructed by your doctor even if you feel \n\nbetter.

Gather an alcohol swab, cotton ball/gauze pad, adhesive bandage and a sharps disposal \ncontainer (Figure B) and place on a clean, flat, surface in a well-lit area. These supplies are not \n\nincluded in the TAKHZYRO packaging.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure B  \n\nb. Remove TAKHZYRO from refrigerator, open the carton box and remove the TAKHZYRO pre-\nfilled syringe from the tray.  \n\n• Do not use the TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe if the tamper evident seal is open or \nbroken.  \n\n• Before you prepare your injection, allow the pre-filled syringe to reach room \ntemperature for at least 15 to 30 minutes.  \n\n• Your medicine is sensitive to warm temperatures. Do not use external heat sources \nsuch as hot water to warm your TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe.  \n\n• Do not remove the needle cap until you are ready to inject.  \n\nc. Wash your hands with soap and water. Dry your hands completely (Figure C).  \n\n \n\nFigure C  \n\nd. Check the expiration date on the label (Figure D).  \n\n\n\n53 \n\n• Do not use TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe if the expiration date has passed.  \n\n \n\nFigure D  \n\ne. Visually inspect the TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe for any damage and make sure the \nmedicine is colourless to slightly yellow.  \n\n• Do not use product if syringe is damaged – e.g., cracked syringe.  \n\n• Do not administer if the medicine is discoloured, cloudy or has flakes or particles in it \nand call your Healthcare Provider.  \n\n• You might see air bubbles in the TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe. This is normal and \nwill not affect your dose.  \n\nSTEP 2: Select and prepare your injection site  \n\na. The TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe should be injected into your stomach (abdomen), thigh, or \nthe back of the upper arm (the outer area of the upper arm is not recommended if you are \n\ninjecting yourself) (Figure E).  \n\n• It is important to rotate injection sites to keep skin healthy. Each new injection should \nbe given at least 3 cm from the last site you used.  \n\n• Do not inject into an area of your body where the skin is irritated, reddened, bruised, \nor infected.  \n\n• The area you choose for injection should be at least 5 cm away from any scars or your \nbelly button (navel).  \n\n \n\nFigure E  \n\nb. Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab and allow it to dry.  \n\n• Do not fan or blow on the clean site.  \n\n\n\n54 \n\n• Do not touch this area again before giving your injection.  \n\nc. Remove needle cap from the TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe. Gently pull the needle cap straight \noff with one hand and firmly hold the middle of the TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe with the \n\nother hand. Throw away the needle cap (Figure F).  \n\n• Do not recap your TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe.  \n\n• Do not use the TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe if it has been dropped without the \nneedle cap on or if the needle looks damaged or bent.  \n\n• Do not touch the needle or allow the needle to touch anything.  \n\n \n\nFigure F  \n\nSTEP 3: Inject TAKHZYRO  \n\na. Grip the TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe in one hand like a pencil. Avoid touching the needle or \npushing on the plunger (Figure G).  \n\n \n\nFigure G  \n\nb. With your other hand, gently pinch about 3 cm fold of skin at the cleaned injection site.  \n\nc. With one quick, short motion, push needle all the way into skin.  Make sure to keep the needle \nin place (Figure H).  \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\nFigure H \n\nd. Slowly push the plunger until all of the liquid is injected and the syringe is empty, then gently \n\nlet go of your skin.  \n\ne. Slowly withdraw needle while maintaining the syringe at the same angle (Figure I).  \n\n \n\nFigure I  \n\nf. Press cotton ball or gauze pad over injection site if needed and hold for 10 seconds.  \n\n• Do not rub the injection site. You may have a minor bleeding. This is normal.  \n\n• Cover injection site with an adhesive bandage if needed.  \n\ng. Throw away your used TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe.  \n\n• Do not touch the needle.  \n\n• To avoid a needle-stick injury, do not recap the needle.  \n\n• Put your used TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringes in a sharps disposal container right away \n\nafter use.  \n\n• Do not reuse the TAKHZYRO pre-filled syringe and any of your injection supplies.  \n\nImportant: Always keep the sharps disposal container out of the reach of children.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
