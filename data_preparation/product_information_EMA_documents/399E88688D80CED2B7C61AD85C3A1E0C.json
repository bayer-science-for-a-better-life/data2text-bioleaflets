PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \nColourless and opalescent suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza in individuals 60 years of age and over, especially in those who run an \nincreased risk of associated complications. \n \nThe use of IDflu should be based on official recommendations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nIndividuals 60 years of age and over: 0.1 ml. \n \nPaediatric population \nIDflu is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years due to insufficient data \non safety and efficacy. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nMethod of administration \nImmunisation should be carried out by intradermal route. \nThe recommended site of administration is the region of the deltoid. \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \nFor instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to any \nresidues such as eggs (ovalbumin, chicken proteins), neomycin, formaldehyde and octoxinol 9.  \n \nImmunisation shall be postponed in subjects with febrile illness or acute infection. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nIDflu should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \nVery limited data in immunocompromised patients are available for IDflu. \n \nIn case of presence of liquid at the injection site after vaccine administration, re-vaccination is not \nrequired. \n \nInterference with serological testing: See section 4.5. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIDflu may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Immunisation should be carried out on \nseparate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant \ntreatment. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false positive results in serology tests using the ELISA method to \ndetect antibodies against HIV1, Hepatitis C and especially HTLV1 have been observed. The Western \nBlot technique disproves the false-positive ELISA test results. The transient false positive reactions \ncould be due to the IgM response by the vaccine. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nThis vaccine is intended for individuals 60 years of age and over. Therefore, this information is not \napplicable. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nIDflu has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \na. Summary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of IDflu has been assessed in 3 open-label randomised clinical trials, 3,372 vaccinees \nreceived an injection of IDflu. \n \nSafety evaluation was performed for all subjects during the first 3 weeks following vaccination and \nserious adverse reactions were collected during six months of follow-up for 2,974 subjects \n(population of two out of the three clinical trials). \n \nThe most common reactions occurring after vaccine administration were local reactions at injection \nsite. \nApparent local reactions after intradermal administration were more frequent than after intramuscular \nadministration of an adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted comparator vaccine. \nMost reactions resolved spontaneously within 1 to 3 days after onset. \n \nSystemic safety profile of IDflu is similar to the comparator vaccine, adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted, \nadministered intramuscularly. \n \nAfter repetitive yearly injections the safety profile of IDflu is similar to the previous injections. \n \nb. Tabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nThe data below summarizes the frequencies of the adverse reactions that were recorded following \nvaccination during clinical trials and worldwide post-marketing experience, using the following \nconvention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare \n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from available data). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nOrgan class Very \ncommon \n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very \nrare \n\nNot known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n \n\n     Allergic \nreactions \nincluding \ngeneralized \nskin reactions \nsuch as \nurticaria, \nanaphylactic \nreactions, \nangioedema, \nshock \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache   Paresthesia, \nneuritis \n \n\n  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Sweating Pruritus, \nrash \n\n  \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\nMyalgia  Arthralgia    \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nLocal \nreactions: \nredness*, \ninduration \nswelling, \npruritus, pain \n\nMalaise, \nshivering, \nfever, \n \nLocal \nreactions: \necchymosis \n\nFatigue    \n\n* In some cases, local redness lasted up to 7 days. \n \nc.

Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdose is unlikely to have any untoward effect. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group:  Influenza vaccines, ATC code: J07BB02 \n \nImmunogenicity \nSeroprotection is generally obtained within 2 to 3 weeks. The duration of postvaccinal immunity to \nhomologous strains or to strains closely related to the vaccine strains varies but is usually \n6-12 months. \n \nIn a pivotal randomised comparative phase III trial, 2,606 subjects over 60 years of age received \n0.1 ml of IDflu by intradermal route and 1,089 subjects over 60 years of age received 0.5 ml of a \ntrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine administered by intramuscular route. \n \nIn this comparative trial the geometric mean titres (GMTs), seroprotection rate*, seroconversion or \nsignificant increase rate** and the geometric mean titre ratio (GMTR) for anti-HA antibody \n(measured by HI) were assessed according to predefined criteria. \n \nData were as follows (values in brackets show the 95% confidence intervals): \n \n\n Intradermal 15µg \n\n A/H1N1 A/H3N2 B \n\n A/New Caledonia/ 20/99 A/Wisconsin/ 67/2005 B/Malaysia/ 2506/2004 \n N = 2,585 N = 2,586 N = 2,582 \n\nGeometric mean of titre (1/dil) 81.7 \n(78.0 ; 85.6) \n\n298.0 \n(282 ; 315) \n\n39.9 \n(38.3 ; 41.6) \n\nSeroprotection rate (%) * 77.0 \n(75.3 ; 78.6) \n\n93.3 \n(92.3 ; 94.3) \n\n55.7 \n(53.8 ; 57.6) \n\nSeroconversion or significant \nincrease rate (%) ** \n\n38.7 \n(36.8 ; 40.6) \n\n61.3 \n(59.3 ; 63.1) \n\n36.4 \n(34.5 ; 38.3) \n\nGeometric mean of titre ratio \n(GMTR) \n\n3.97 \n(3.77 ; 4.18) \n\n8.19 \n(7.68 ; 8.74) \n\n3.61 \n(3.47 ; 3.76) \n\n* Seroprotection = HI titre ≥ 40 \n** Seroconversion = negative pre-vaccination HI titre and post vaccination HI titre ≥ 40, Significant \nincrease = positive pre-vaccination HI titre and at least a 4-fold increase in post-vaccination HI titre \nGMTR: Geometric mean titre ratio of individual (post-/pre-vaccination titre). \n \nIDflu is at least as immunogenic as the comparator trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine \nadministered by intramuscular route for each of the 3 influenza strains in subjects from 60 years of \nage and over. \n \nAcross all three influenza strains, for the comparator intramuscular vaccine GMTs ranged between \n34.8 (1/dil) and 181.0 (1/dil), seroprotection rates ranged between 48.9% and 87.9%, seroconversion \nor significant increase rates ranged between 30.0% and 46.9% and GMTRs ranged between 3.04 and \n5.35-fold over baseline HI titres. \n \nIn a randomised comparative phase III trial, 398 subjects over 65 years of age received 0.1 ml of IDflu \nby intradermal route and 397 subjects over 65 years of age received 0.5 ml of a trivalent inactivated \nadjuvanted (MF-59 containing) influenza vaccine at the same dosage administered by intramuscular \nroute. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nIDflu is as immunogenic as the comparator trivalent adjuvanted (MF-59 containing) vaccine in terms \nof GMT for each of the 3 influenza strains with the SRH method and for 2 strains with the HI method. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on animal studies. The vaccine was \nimmunogenic in mice and rabbits. In repeated-dose toxicity studies in rabbits there was no significant \nevidence of systemic toxicity. Nevertheless, single and repeated administrations led to transient local \nerythema and oedema. Genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential were not assessed because these \nstudies are not appropriate for a vaccine. Fertility and toxicity studies to reproduction in females have \nnot identified any specific potential hazard for humans. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This vaccine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n \n1. What IDflu is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use IDflu \n3. How to use IDflu  \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store IDflu  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What IDflu is and what it is used for \n \nIDflu is a vaccine.This vaccine is recommended to help to protect you against flu. \nThe vaccine may be administered to individuals of 60 years of age and over, especially in those who \nrun an increased risk of associated complications. \n \nWhen an injection of IDflu is given, the immune system (body's natural defences) will develop \nprotection against flu infection. \nIDflu will help to protect you against the three strains of virus contained in the vaccine, or other \nstrains closely related to them. Full effect of the vaccine is generally achieved 2-3 weeks after the \nvaccination. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use IDflu \n \nDo not use IDflu: \n- If you are allergic to: \n\n• The active substances, \n• Any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6), \n• Any component that may be present in very small amounts such as eggs (ovalbumin, \n\nchicken proteins), neomycin, formaldehyde and octoxinol 9. \n- If you have an illness with fever or acute infection, the vaccination shall be postponed until \n\nafter you have recovered. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using IDflu. \n \n- You should tell your doctor before vaccination if you have a poor immune response \n\n(immunosuppression) due to disease or medicines, because the vaccine may not work very well \nin this case. \n\n \n- This vaccine should under no circumstances be administered into a vein (intravascularly). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n- If, for any reason, you have a blood test within a few days following an influenza vaccination, \n\nplease tell your doctor. Tests for HIV-1, hepatitis C virus and HTLV-1 may be affected. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nIDflu is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years. \n \nOther vaccines or medicines and IDflu \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \n- Other vaccines: IDflu can be given at the same time as other vaccines by using separate limbs. \n\nIt should be noted that the side effects may be intensified. \n- Tell your doctor if you have been treated with medicines that may reduce your immune \n\nresponse such as corticosteroids (for example cortisone), medicines against cancer \n(chemotherapy), radiotherapy or other medicines affecting the immune system. In this case, the \nvaccine may not work very well. \n\n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nThis vaccine is intended for individuals 60 years of age and over. Therefore, this information is not \napplicable. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThis vaccine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n \n3. How to use IDflu  \n \nAlways use this vaccine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is 0.1 ml for individuals 60 years of age and over. \n \nIDflu is administered to you by your doctor or nurse. \n \nIDflu is given as an injection into the upper layer of the skin (preferably the muscle of the upper arm). \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nYou should see your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms of angioedema, such as: \n\n• Swollen face, tongue or pharynx \n• Difficulty to swallow \n• Hives and difficulties to breathe. \n\n \nDuring clinical trials and after the vaccine came on the market, the following side effects were \nreported with the use of IDflu. \n \nVery common reactions (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n- At the injection site: redness, hardness, swelling, itching and pain. \n- Headache and muscular pain. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n23 \n\nCommon reactions (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n- Bruising at the injection site. \n- Feeling generally unwell, fever (38.0°C or higher) and shivering. \n \nUncommon reactions (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n- Tiredness, joint pain and increased sweating. \n \nRare reactions (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people) \n- Tingling or numbness, inflammation of nerves, itching and rash. \n \nReactions of not known frequency (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n- Allergic reactions including skin reactions that may spread throughout the body such as hives, \n\nsevere allergic reactions (anaphylactic reactions), swollen face, tongue or pharynx, difficulty to \nswallow, hives and difficulties to breathe (angioedema), failure of the circulatory system \n(shock) leading to medical emergency. \n\n \nMost of side effects listed above disappeared without treatment within 1 to 3 days after onset. In some \ncases, redness at the injection site lasted up to 7 days. \n \nThe following side effects have been reported with other vaccines given to prevent flu. These side \neffects may occur with IDflu. \n• Temporary reduction in the number of blood particles called platelets which can result in \n\nbruising or bleeding, temporary swelling of the glands in the neck, armpit or groin.  \n• Pain located on the nerve route, convulsions associated with fever, nervous system disorders \n\nincluding inflammation of the brain or spinal cord or Guillain-Barré syndrome which causes \nextreme weakness and paralysis. \n\n• Vessel inflammation which may result in very rare cases in temporary kidney problems. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store IDflu  \n \nKeep this vaccine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this vaccine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton after EXP. The expiry date \nrefers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze.
