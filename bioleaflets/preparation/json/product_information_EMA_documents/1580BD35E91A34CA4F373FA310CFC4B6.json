NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nFulvestrant Mylan 250 mg solution for injection in prefilled syringe \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne pre-filled syringe contains 250 mg fulvestrant in 5 ml solution. \n \nExcipients with known effect (per 5 ml) \nEthanol, anhydrous (500 mg) \nBenzyl alcohol (500 mg) \nBenzyl benzoate (750 mg) \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nClear, colourless to yellow, viscous solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nFulvestrant is indicated: \n• as monotherapy for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic \n\nbreast cancer in postmenopausal women:  \n- not previously treated with endocrine therapy, or \n- with disease relapse on or after adjuvant antiestrogen therapy, or disease progression on \n\nantiestrogen therapy. \n• in combination with palbociclib for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human \n\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast \ncancer in women who have received prior endocrine therapy (see section 5.1). \n\n \nIn pre- or perimenopausal women, the combination treatment with palbociclib should be combined \nwith a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nAdult females (including elderly) \n\nThe recommended dose is 500 mg at intervals of one month, with an additional 500 mg dose given \ntwo weeks after the initial dose. \n \n\nWhen fulvestrant is used in combination with palbociclib, please also refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics of palbociclib. \n \nPrior to the start of treatment with the combination of fulvestrant plus palbociclib, and throughout its \nduration, pre/perimenopausal women should be treated with LHRH agonists according to local clinical \npractice. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance ≥30 ml/min). Safety and efficacy have not been evaluated in patients with severe \nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min), and, therefore, caution is recommended in these \npatients (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. \nHowever, as fulvestrant exposure may be increased, fulvestrant should be used with caution in these \npatients. There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of fulvestrant in children from birth to 18 years of age have not been \nestablished. Currently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on \na posology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nFulvestrant Mylan should be administered as two consecutive 5 ml injections by slow intramuscular \ninjection (1-2 minutes/injection), one in each buttock (gluteal area). \n \nCaution should be taken if injecting Fulvestrant Mylan at the dorsogluteal site due to the proximity of \nthe underlying sciatic nerve. \n \nFor detailed instructions for administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nPregnancy and lactation (see section 4.6). \nSevere hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFulvestrant should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nFulvestrant should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \nless than 30 ml/min). \n \nDue to the intramuscular route of administration, fulvestrant should be used with caution if treating \npatients with bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia or those taking anticoagulant treatment. \n \nThromboembolic events are commonly observed in women with advanced breast cancer and have \nbeen observed in clinical studies with fulvestrant (see section 4.8). This should be taken into \nconsideration when prescribing fulvestrant to patients at risk. \n \nInjection site related events including sciatica, neuralgia, neuropathic pain, and peripheral neuropathy \nhave been reported with fulvestrant injection. Caution should be taken while administering fulvestrant \nat the dorsogluteal injection site due to the proximity of the underlying sciatic nerve (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.8). \n \nThere are no long-term data on the effect of fulvestrant on bone. Due to the mechanism of action of \nfulvestrant, there is a potential risk of osteoporosis. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nThe efficacy and safety of fulvestrant (either as monotherapy or in combination with palbociclib) have \nnot been studied in patients with critical visceral disease. \n \nWhen fulvestrant is combined with palbociclib, please also refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics of palbociclib. \n \nInterference with estradiol antibody assays  \n \nDue to the structural similarity of fulvestrant and estradiol, fulvestrant may interfere with antibody \nbased-estradiol assays and may result in falsely increased levels of estradiol. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nFulvestrant is not recommended for use in children and adolescents as safety and efficacy have not \nbeen established in this group of patients (see section 5.1). \n \nFulvestrant Mylan contains 10% w/v ethanol (alcohol) \n \nThis medicine contains 10% w/v ethanol (alcohol) as an excipient, i.e. 500 mg in each 5 ml. The \namount in one treatment dose (i.e. two syringes) of this medicine is equivalent to 25 ml beer or 10 ml \nwine. The small amount of alcohol in this medicine will not have any noticeable effects. \n \n \nFulvestrant Mylan contains benzyl alcohol \n \nThis medicinal product contains 500 mg benzyl alcohol in each 5 ml which is equivalent to 100 mg/ml \n(10% w/v). Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA clinical interaction study with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4) demonstrated that fulvestrant does \nnot inhibit CYP3A4. Clinical interaction studies with rifampicin (inducer of CYP3A4) and \nketoconazole (inhibitor of CYP3A4) showed no clinically relevant change in fulvestrant clearance. \nDose adjustment is therefore not necessary in patients who are receiving fulvestrant and CYP3A4 \ninhibitors or inducers concomitantly. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nPatients of child-bearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with Fulvestrant \nMylan and for 2 years after the last dose. \n \nPregnancy \nFulvestrant is contraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3). Fulvestrant has been shown to cross the \nplacenta after single intramuscular doses in rat and rabbit. Studies in animals have shown reproductive \ntoxicity including an increased incidence of foetal abnormalities and deaths (see section 5.3). If \npregnancy occurs while taking fulvestrant, the patient must be informed of the potential hazard to the \nfoetus and potential risk for loss of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nBreast-feeding must be discontinued during treatment with fulvestrant. Fulvestrant is excreted in milk \nin lactating rats. It is not known whether fulvestrant is excreted in human milk. Considering the \npotential for serious adverse reactions due to fulvestrant in breast-fed infants, use during lactation is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nFertility \nThe effects of fulvestrant on fertility in humans has not been studied. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFulvestrant has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. However, since \nasthenia has been reported very commonly with fulvestrant, caution should be observed by those \npatients who experience this adverse reaction when driving or operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nMonotherapy \n\nThis section provides information based on all adverse reactions from clinical studies, post-marketing \nstudies or spontaneous reports. In the pooled dataset of fulvestrant monotherapy, the most frequently \nreported adverse reactions were injection site reactions, asthenia, nausea, and increased hepatic \nenzymes (ALT, AST, ALP). \n \nIn table 1, the following frequency categories for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were calculated \nbased on the fulvestrant 500 mg treatment group in pooled safety analyses of studies that compared \nfulvestrant 500 mg with fulvestrant 250 mg [CONFIRM (Study D6997C00002), FINDER 1 (Study \nD6997C00004), FINDER 2 (Study D6997C00006), and NEWEST (Study D6997C00003) studies], or \nfrom FALCON (Study D699BC00001) alone that compared fulvestrant 500 mg with anastrozole \n1 mg. Where frequencies differ between the pooled safety analysis and FALCON, the highest \nfrequency is presented. The frequencies in Table 1 were based on all reported adverse drug reactions, \nregardless of the investigator assessment of causality. The median duration of fulvestrant 500 mg \ntreatment across the pooled dataset (including the studies mentioned above plus FALCON) was 6.5 \nmonths. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions listed below are classified according to frequency and System Organ Class (SOC). \nFrequency groupings are defined according to the following convention: Very common (≥1/10), \nCommon (≥1/100 to <1/10), Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100). Within each frequency grouping \nadverse reactions are reported in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1  Adverse Drug Reactions reported in patients treated with fulvestrant \n\nmonotherapy \n \nAdverse reactions by system organ class and frequency \nInfections and infestations  Common  Urinary tract infections \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders  Common  Reduced platelet counte \nImmune system disorders  Very common  Hypersensitivity reactionse \n Uncommon Anaphylactic reactions \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders  Common  Anorexiaa \nNervous system disorders  Common  Headache \nVascular disorders  Very common  Hot flushese \n Common Venous thromboembolisma \n\n\n\n6 \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  Very common  Nausea \nCommon  Vomiting, diarrhoea \n\nHepatobiliary disorders  Very common  Elevated hepatic enzymes (ALT, \nAST, ALP) a \n\n Common  Elevated bilirubina \n Uncommon  Hepatic failurec,f, hepatitis f, \n\nelevated gamma-GT f \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Very common  Rashe \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders \n\nVery common  Joint and musculoskeletal paind \n\n Common Back paina \nReproductive system and breast disorders Common Vaginal haemorrhagee \n Uncommon Vaginal moniliasis f, leukorrhea f \nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nVery common Astheniaa, injection site reactionsb \nCommon Neuropathy peripherale, sciaticae \nUncommon Injection site haemorrhage f, \n\ninjection site haematoma f, \nneuralgiac,f \n\na  Includes adverse drug reactions for which the exact contribution of fulvestrant cannot be assessed due to \nthe underlying disease. \n\nb  The term injection site reactions does not include the terms injection site haemorrhage, injection site \nhaematoma, sciatica, neuralgia and neuropathy peripheral. \n\nc  The event was not observed in major clinical studies (CONFIRM, FINDER 1, FINDER 2, NEWEST). \n The frequency has been calculated using the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the point \n\nestimate. This is calculated as 3/560 (where 560 is the number of patients in the major clinical studies), \nwhich equates to a frequency category of ‘uncommon’. \n\nd Includes: arthralgia, and less frequently musculoskeletal pain, myalgia and pain in extremity. \ne Frequency category differs between pooled safety dataset and FALCON. \nf ADR was not observed in FALCON. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nThe descriptions included below are based on the safety analysis set of 228 patients who received at \nleast one (1) dose of fulvestrant and 232 patients who received at least one (1) dose of anastrozole, \nrespectively in the Phase 3 FALCON study. \n \nJoint and musculoskeletal pain  \n\nIn the FALCON study, the number of patients who reported an adverse reaction of joint and \nmusculoskeletal pain was 65 (31.2%) and 48 (24.1%) for fulvestrant and anastrozole arms, \nrespectively. Of the 65 patients in the fulvestrant arm, 40% (26/65) of patients reported joint and \nmusculoskeletal pain within the first month of treatment, and 66.2% (43/65) of patients within the first \n3 months of treatment. No patients reported events that were CTCAE Grade ≥3 or that required a dose \nreduction, dose interruption, or discontinued treatment due to these adverse reactions. \n \nCombination therapy with palbociclib \n\nThe overall safety profile of fulvestrant when used in combination with palbociclib is based on data \nfrom 517 patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in the \nrandomised PALOMA3 study (see section 5.1).  The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions of any \ngrade reported in patients receiving fulvestrant in combination with palbociclib were neutropenia, \nleukopenia, infections, fatigue, nausea, anaemia, stomatitis, diarrhoea, and thrombocytopenia. The \nmost common (≥2%) Grade ≥3 adverse reactions were neutropenia, leukopenia, anaemia, infections, \nAST increased, thrombocytopenia, and fatigue.  \n \nTable 2 reports the adverse reactions from PALOMA3. \n\n\n\n7 \n\nMedian duration of exposure to fulvestrant was 11.2 months in the fulvestrant + palbociclib arm and \n4.9 months in the fulvestrant + placebo arm. Median duration of exposure to palbociclib in the \nfulvestrant + palbociclib arm was 10.8 months.  \n \nTable 2  Adverse reactions based on PALOMA3 Study (N=517) \n \n\nSystem Organ Class \nFrequency \nPreferred Terma \n\nFulvestrant + Palbociclib \n(N=345) \n\nFulvestrant + placebo \n(N=172) \n\nAll Grades \nn (%) \n\nGrade ≥ 3 \nn (%) \n\nAll Grades \nn (%) \n\nGrade ≥ 3 \nn (%) \n\nInfections and infestations \nVery common     \n   Infectionsb 163 (47.2) 11 (3.2) 54 (31.4) 5 (2.9) \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nVery common     \n   Neutropeniac 287 (83.2) 228 (66.1) 7 (4.1) 1 (0.6) \n   Leukopeniad 183 (53.0) 105 (30.4) 9 (5.2) 2 (1.2) \n   Anaemiae 102 (29.6) 12 (3.5) 22 (12.8) 3 (1.7) \n   Thrombocytopeniaf 78 (22.6) 8 (2.3) 0 (0.0) 0 \nUncommon     \n   Febrile neutropenia 3 (0.9) 3 (0.9) 1 (0.6) 1 (0.6) \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nVery common     \n   Decreased appetite 55 (15.9) 3 (0.9) 14 (8.1) 1 (0.6) \nNervous system disorders \nCommon     \n   Dysgeusia 23 (6.7) 0 5 (2.9) 0 \nEye disorders \nCommon     \n   Lacrimation increased 22 (6.4) 0 2 (1.2) 0 \n   Vision blurred 20 (5.8) 0 3 (1.7) 0 \n   Dry eye 13 (3.8) 0 3 (1.7) 0 \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nCommon     \n   Epistaxis 23 (6.7) 0 3 (1.7) 0 \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common     \n   Nausea 117 (33.9) 0 48 (27.9) 1 (0.6) \n   Stomatitisg 97 (28.1) 2 (0.6) 22 (12.8) 0 \n   Diarrhoea 81 (23.5) 0 33 (19.2) 2 (1.2) \n   Vomiting 65 (18.8) 2 (0.6) 26 (15.1) 1 (0.6) \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery common     \n   Alopecia 62 (18.0) 0 11 (6.4) 0 \n   Rashh 58 (16.8) 2 (0.6) 11 (6.4) 0 \nCommon     \n   Dry skin 21 (6.1) 0 2 (1.2) 0 \n\n\n\n8 \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common     \n   Fatigue 142 (41.2) 8 (2.3) 50 (29.1) 2 (1.2) \n   Pyrexia 44 (12.8) 1 (0.3) 9 (5.2) 0 \nCommon     \n   Asthenia 26 (7.5) 0 9 (5.2) 1 (0.6) \nInvestigations \nCommon     \n   AST increased 26 (7.5) 10 (2.9) 9 (5.2) 3 (1.7) \n   ALT increased 20 (5.8) 6 (1.7) 6 (3.5) 0 \nALT=alanine aminotransferase; AST=aspartate aminotransferase; N/n=number of patients \na Preferred Terms (PTs) are listed according to MedDRA 17.1. \nb Infections includes all PTs that are part of the System Organ Class Infections and infestations. \nc Neutropenia includes the following PTs: Neutropenia, Neutrophil count decreased. \nd Leukopenia includes the following PTs: Leukopenia, White blood cell count decreased. \ne Anaemia includes the following PTs: Anaemia, Haemoglobin decreased, Haematocrit decreased. \nf Thrombocytopenia includes the following PTs: Thrombocytopenia, Platelet count decreased. \ng Stomatitis includes the following PTs: Aphthous stomatitis, Cheilitis, Glossitis, Glossodynia, Mouth ulceration, \nMucosal inflammation, Oral pain, Oropharyngeal discomfort, Oropharyngeal pain, Stomatitis. \nh Rash includes the following PTs: Rash, Rash maculo-papular, Rash pruritic, Rash erythematous, Rash papular, \nDermatitis, Dermatitis acneiform, Toxic skin eruption. \n  \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nNeutropenia \n\nIn patients receiving fulvestrant in combination with palbociclib in the PALOMA3 study, neutropenia \nof any grade was reported in 287 (83.2%) patients, with Grade 3 neutropenia being reported in 191 \n(55.4%) patients, and Grade 4 neutropenia being reported in 37 (10.7%) patients. In the fulvestrant + \nplacebo arm (n=172), neutropenia of any grade was reported in 7 (4.1%) patients, with Grade 3 \nneutropenia reported in 1 (0.6%) patient. There were no reports of Grade 4 neutropenia in the \nfulvestrant + placebo arm. \n \nIn patients receiving fulvestrant in combination with palbociclib, the median time to first episode of \nany grade neutropenia was 15 days (range: 13-317) and the median duration of Grade ≥3 neutropenia \nwas 7 days. Febrile neutropenia has been reported in 0.9% patients receiving fulvestrant in \ncombination with palbociclib. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere are isolated reports of overdose with fulvestrant in humans. If overdose occurs, symptomatic \nsupportive treatment is recommended. Animal studies suggest that no effects other than those related \ndirectly or indirectly to anti-estrogenic activity were evident with higher doses of fulvestrant (see \nsection 5.3).  \n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Endocrine therapy, anti-estrogens, ATC code: L02BA03 \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \nFulvestrant is a competitive estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist with an affinity comparable to estradiol. \nFulvestrant blocks the trophic actions of estrogens without any partial agonist (estrogen-like) activity. \nThe mechanism of action is associated with down-regulation of estrogen receptor protein levels. \nClinical studies in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer have shown that fulvestrant \nsignificantly down-regulates ER protein in ER positive tumours compared with placebo. There was \nalso a significant decrease in progesterone receptor expression consistent with a lack of intrinsic \nestrogen agonist effects. It has also been shown that fulvestrant 500 mg downregulates ER and the \nproliferation marker Ki67, to a greater degree than fulvestrant 250 mg in breast tumours in \npostmenopausal neoadjuvant setting. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety in advanced breast cancer \n \nMonotherapy \n\nA Phase 3 clinical study was completed in 736 postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer \nwho had disease recurrence on or after adjuvant endocrine therapy or progression following endocrine \ntherapy for advanced disease. The study included 423 patients whose disease had recurred or \nprogressed during anti-estrogen therapy (AE subgroup) and 313 patients whose disease had recurred \nor progressed during aromatase inhibitor therapy (AI subgroup). This study compared the efficacy and \nsafety of fulvestrant 500 mg (n=362) with fulvestrant 250 mg (n=374). Progression-free survival \n(PFS) was the primary endpoint; key secondary efficacy endpoints included objective response rate \n(ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR) and overall survival (OS).

A total of 462 patients were randomised 1:1 sequentially to receive either fulvestrant 500 mg \nor anastrozole 1 mg. \n \nRandomisation was stratified by disease setting (locally advanced or metastatic), prior chemotherapy \nfor advanced disease, and measurable disease. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint of the study was investigator assessed progression-free survival (PFS) \nevaluated according to RECIST 1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours). Key secondary \nefficacy endpoints included overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). \n \nPatients enrolled in this study had a median age of 63 years (range 36-90). The majority of patients \n(87.0%) had metastatic disease at baseline. Fifty-five percent (55.0%) of patients had visceral \nmetastasis at baseline. A total of 17.1% of patients received a prior chemotherapy regimen for \nadvanced disease; 84.2% of patients had measurable disease. \n \nConsistent results were observed across the majority of pre-specified patient subgroups. For the \nsubgroup of patients with disease limited to non-visceral metastasis (n=208), the HR was 0.592 (95% \nCI: 0.419, 0.837) for the fulvestrant arm compared to the anastrozole arm. For the subgroup of patients \nwith visceral metastasis (n=254), the HR was 0.993 (95% CI: 0.740, 1.331) for the fulvestrant arm \ncompared to the anastrozole arm.

Seventy seven percent (77%) of the study \npopulation had estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. These studies compared the safety and \nefficacy of monthly administration of fulvestrant 250 mg versus the daily administration of 1 mg \nanastrozole (aromatase inhibitor). Overall, fulvestrant at the 250 mg monthly dose was at least as \neffective as anastrozole in terms of progression free survival, objective response, and time to death. \nThere were no statistically significant differences in any of these endpoints between the two treatment \ngroups. Progression-free survival was the primary endpoint. Combined analysis of both studies \nshowed that 83% of patients who received fulvestrant progressed, compared with 85% of patients who \nreceived anastrozole. Combined analysis of both studies showed the hazard ratio of fulvestrant 250 mg \nto anastrozole for progression-free survival was  \n0.95 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.10). The objective response rate for Fulvestrant 250 mg was 19.2% compared \nwith 16.5% for anastrozole. The median time to death was 27.4 months for patients treated with \nfulvestrant and 27.6 months for patients treated with anastrozole. The hazard ratio of fulvestrant \n250 mg to anastrozole for time to death was 1.01 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.19). \n \nCombination therapy with palbociclib \n\nA Phase 3, international, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre study of fulvestrant \n500 mg plus palbociclib 125 mg versus fulvestrant 500 mg plus placebo was conducted in women with \nHR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced breast cancer not amenable to resection or radiation \ntherapy with curative intent or metastatic breast cancer, regardless of their menopausal status, whose \ndisease progressed after prior endocrine therapy in the (neo) adjuvant or metastatic setting. \n \n\nTime from randomisation (months) \n\nPr\nob\n\nab\nili\n\nty\n o\n\nf P\nFS\n\n \n\nNumber of patients at risk \n\nFUL500 230 187 171 150 124 110 96 81 63 44 24 11 2 0 \n\nANAS1 232 194 162 139 120 102 84 60 45 31 22 10 0 0 \n \n\nTreatment     ——— Fulvestrant 500 mg (N=230)   - - - - - - Anastrozole 1 mg (N=232) \n\n\n\n13 \n\nA total of 521 pre/peri- and postmenopausal women who had progressed on or within 12 months from \ncompletion of adjuvant endocrine therapy on or within 1 month from prior endocrine therapy for \nadvanced disease, were randomised 2:1 to fulvestrant plus palbociclib or fulvestrant plus placebo and \nstratified by documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy, menopausal status at study entry \n(pre/peri- versus postmenopausal), and presence of visceral metastases. Pre/perimenopausal women \nreceived the LHRH agonist goserelin. Patients with advanced/metastatic, symptomatic, visceral \nspread, that were at risk of life-threatening complications in the short term (including patients with \nmassive uncontrolled effusions [pleural, pericardial, peritoneal], pulmonary lymphangitis, and over \n50% liver involvement), were not eligible for enrolment into the study. \n \nPatients continued to receive assigned treatment until objective disease progression, symptomatic \ndeterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first. \nCrossover between treatment arms was not allowed. \n \nPatients were well matched for baseline demographics and prognostic characteristics between the \nfulvestrant plus palbociclib arm and the fulvestrant plus placebo arm. The median age of patients \nenrolled in this study was 57 years (range 29, 88). In each treatment arm the majority of patients were  \nWhite, had documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy, and were postmenopausal. \nApproximately 20% of patients were pre/perimenopausal. All patients had received prior systemic \ntherapy and most patients in each treatment arm had received a previous chemotherapy regimen for \ntheir primary diagnosis. More than half (62%) had an ECOG PS of 0, 60% had visceral metastases, \nand 60% had received more than 1 prior hormonal regimen for their primary diagnosis. \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was investigator-assessed PFS evaluated according to RECIST 1.1. \nSupportive PFS analyses were based on an Independent Central Radiology Review. Secondary \nendpoints included OR, CBR, OS, safety, and time-to-deterioration (TTD) in pain endpoint. \n \nThe study met its primary endpoint of prolonging investigator-assessed PFS at the interim analysis \nconducted on 82% of the planned PFS events; the results crossed the pre-specified Haybittle-Peto \nefficacy boundary (α=0.00135), demonstrating a statistically significant prolongation in PFS and a \nclinically meaningful treatment effect.

A total of 335 patients in the fulvestrant plus palbociclib arm and 166 patients \nin the fulvestrant plus placebo arm completed the questionnaire at baseline and at least 1 post-baseline \nvisit. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nTime-to-Deterioration was pre-specified as time between baseline and first occurrence of ≥10 points \nincrease from baseline in pain symptom scores. Addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant resulted in a \nsymptom benefit by significantly delaying Time-to-Deterioration in pain symptom compared with \nfulvestrant plus placebo (median 8.0 months versus 2.8 months; HR of 0.64 [95% CI: 0.49, 0.85]; \np<0.001). \n \nEffects on the postmenopausal endometrium \nPreclinical data do not suggest a stimulatory effect of fulvestrant on the postmenopausal endometrium \n(see section 5.3). A 2-week study in healthy postmenopausal volunteers treated with 20 μg per day \nethinylestradiol showed that pre-treatment with fulvestrant 250 mg resulted in significantly reduced \nstimulation of the postmenopausal endometrium, compared to pre-treatment with placebo, as judged \nby ultrasound measurement of endometrium thickness. \n \nNeoadjuvant treatment for up to 16 weeks in breast cancer patients treated with either fulvestrant \n500 mg or fulvestrant 250 mg did not result in clinically significant changes in endometrial thickness, \nindicating a lack of agonist effect. There is no evidence of adverse endometrial effects in the breast \ncancer patients studied. No data are available regarding endometrial morphology.  \n \nIn two short-term studies (1 and 12 weeks) in premenopausal patients with benign gynaecologic \ndisease, no significant differences in endometrial thickness were observed by ultrasound measurement \nbetween fulvestrant and placebo groups. \n \nEffects on bone \n\nThere are no long-term data on the effect of fulvestrant on bone. Neoadjuvant treatment for up to 16 \nweeks in breast cancer patients with either fulvestrant 500 mg or fulvestrant 250 mg did not result in \nclinically significant changes in serum bone-turnover markers. \n \nPaediatric population \nFulvestrant is not indicated for use in children. The European Medicines Agency has waived the \nobligation to submit the results of studies with fulvestrant in all subsets of the paediatric population in \nbreast cancer (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nAn open-label phase 2 study investigated the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant in  \n30 girls aged 1 to 8 years with Progressive Precocious Puberty associated with McCune Albright \nSyndrome (MAS). The paediatric patients received 4 mg/kg monthly intramuscular dose of \nfulvestrant. This 12-month study investigated a range of MAS endpoints and showed a reduction in the \nfrequency of vaginal bleeding and a reduction in the rate of bone age advancement. The steady-state \ntrough concentrations of fulvestrant in children in this study were consistent with that in adults (see \nsection 5.2). There were no new safety concerns arising from this small study, but 5-year data are yet \nnot available. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nAfter administration of fulvestrant long-acting intramuscular injection, fulvestrant is slowly absorbed \nand maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached after about 5 days. Administration of \nfulvestrant 500 mg regimen achieves exposure levels at, or close to, steady state within the first month \nof dosing (mean [CV]: AUC 475 [33.4%] ng.days/ml, Cmax 25.1 [35.3%] ng/ml, Cmin \n16.3 [25.9%] ng/ml, respectively). At steady state, fulvestrant plasma concentrations are maintained \nwithin a relatively narrow range with up to an approximately 3-fold difference between maximum and \ntrough concentrations. After intramuscular administration, the exposure is approximately \ndose-proportional in the dose range 50 to 500 mg. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nDistribution \nFulvestrant is subject to extensive and rapid distribution. The large apparent volume of distribution at \nsteady state (Vdss) of approximately 3 to 5 l/kg suggests that distribution is largely extravascular. \nFulvestrant is highly (99%) bound to plasma proteins. Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), low \ndensity lipoprotein (LDL), and high density lipoprotein (HDL) fractions are the major binding \ncomponents. No interaction studies were conducted on competitive protein binding. The role of sex \nhormone-binding globulin (SHBG) has not been determined.  \n \nBiotransformation \nThe metabolism of fulvestrant has not been fully evaluated, but involves combinations of a number of \npossible biotransformation pathways analogous to those of endogenous steroids. Identified metabolites \n(includes 17-ketone, sulphone, 3-sulphate, 3- and 17-glucuronide metabolites) are either less active or \nexhibit similar activity to fulvestrant in anti-estrogen models. Studies using human liver preparations \nand recombinant human enzymes indicate that CYP3A4 is the only P450 isoenzyme involved in the \noxidation of fulvestrant; however, non-P450 routes appear to be more predominant in vivo. In vitro \ndata suggest that fulvestrant does not inhibit CYP450 isoenzymes. \n \nElimination \nFulvestrant is eliminated mainly in metabolised form. The major route of excretion is via the faeces, \nwith less than 1% being excreted in the urine. Fulvestrant has a high clearance, 11±1.7 ml/min/kg,  \nsuggesting a high hepatic extraction ratio. The terminal half-life (t1/2) after intramuscular \nadministration is governed by the absorption rate and was estimated to be 50 days.  \n \nSpecial populations \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from phase 3 studies, no difference in fulvestrant’s \npharmacokinetic profile was detected with regard to age (range 33 to 89 years), weight (40-127 kg) or \nrace.  \n \nRenal impairment \n\nMild to moderate impairment of renal function did not influence the pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant to \nany clinically relevant extent. \n \nHepatic impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant has been evaluated in a single-dose clinical study conducted in \nwomen with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A and B). A high dose of a \nshorter duration intramuscular injection formulation was used. There was up to about 2.5-fold increase \nin AUC in women with hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects. In patients administered \nfulvestrant, an increase in exposure of this magnitude is expected to be well tolerated. Women with \nsevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) were not evaluated. \n \nPaediatric population \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant has been evaluated in a clinical study conducted in 30 girls with \nProgressive Precocious Puberty associated with McCune Albright Syndrome (see section 5.1). The \npaediatric patients were aged 1 to 8 years and received 4 mg/kg monthly intramuscular dose of \nfulvestrant. The geometric mean (standard deviation) steady state trough concentration (Cmin,ss) and \nAUCss was 4.2 (0.9) ng/mL and 3680 (1020) ng*hr/mL, respectively. Although the data collected \nwere limited, the steady-state trough concentrations of fulvestrant in children appear to be consistent \nwith those in adults. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe acute toxicity of fulvestrant is low.  \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nFulvestrant solution for injection and other formulations of fulvestrant were well tolerated in animal \nspecies used in multiple dose studies. Local reactions, including myositis and granulomata at the \ninjection site were attributed to the vehicle but the severity of myositis in rabbits increased with \nfulvestrant, compared to the saline control. In toxicity studies with multiple intramuscular doses of \nfulvestrant in rats and dogs, the antiestrogenic activity of fulvestrant was responsible for most of the \neffects seen, particularly in the female reproductive system, but also in other organs sensitive to \nhormones in both sexes. Arteritis involving a range of different tissues was seen in some dogs after \nchronic (12 months) dosing. \n \nIn dog studies following oral and intravenous administration, effects on the cardiovascular system \n(slight elevations of the S-T segment of the ECG [oral], and sinus arrest in one dog [intravenous]) \nwere seen. These occurred at exposure levels higher than in patients (Cmax >15 times) and are likely to \nbe of limited significance for human safety at the clinical dose. \n \nFulvestrant showed no genotoxic potential. \n \nFulvestrant showed effects upon reproduction and embryo/foetal development consistent with its \nanti-estrogenic activity, at doses similar to the clinical dose. In rats, a reversible reduction in female \nfertility and embryonic survival, dystocia and an increased incidence of foetal abnormalities \nincluding tarsal flexure were observed. Rabbits given fulvestrant failed to maintain pregnancy. \nIncreases in placental weight and post-implantation loss of foetuses were seen. There was an \nincreased incidence of foetal variations in rabbits (backwards displacement of the pelvic girdle and \n27 pre-sacral vertebrae). \n \nA two-year oncogenicity study in rats (intramuscular administration of fulvestrant) showed increased \nincidence of ovarian benign granulosa cell tumours in female rats at the high dose, 10 mg/rat/15 days \nand an increased incidence of testicular Leydig cell tumours in males. In a two-year mouse \noncogenicity study (daily oral administration) there was an increased incidence of ovarian sex cord \nstromal tumours (both benign and malignant) at doses of 150 and 500 mg/kg/day. At the no-effect \nlevel for these findings, systemic exposure levels (AUC) were, in rats, approximately 1.5–fold the \nexpected human exposure levels in females and 0.8-fold in males, and in mice, approximately 0.8-\nfold the expected human exposure levels in both males and females. Induction of such tumours is \nconsistent with pharmacology-related endocrine feedback alterations in gonadotropin levels caused \nby anti-estrogens in cycling animals. Therefore these findings are not considered to be relevant to the \nuse of fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. \n \nEnvironmental risk assessment (ERA) \nEnvironmental risk assessment studies have shown that fulvestrant may have potential to cause \nadverse effects to the aquatic environment (see section 6.6). \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1.  What Fulvestrant Mylan is and what it is used for \n \nFulvestrant Mylan contains the active substance fulvestrant, which belongs to the group of estrogen \nblockers. Estrogens, a type of female sex hormones, can in some cases be involved in the growth of \nbreast cancer.  \n \nFulvestrant Mylan is used either:  \n• alone, to treat postmenopausal women with a type of breast cancer called estrogen receptor \n\npositive breast cancer that is locally advanced or has spread to other parts of the body \n(metastatic), or \n\n• in combination with palbociclib to treat women with a type of breast cancer called hormone \nreceptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer, that is \nlocally advanced or has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). Women who have not \nreached menopause will also be treated with a medicine called a luteinizing hormone releasing \nhormone (LHRH) agonist. \n\n \nWhen fulvestrant is given in combination with palbociclib, it is important that you also read the \npackage leaflet for palbociclib. If you have any questions about palbociclib, please ask your doctor. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Fulvestrant Mylan  \n \nDo not use Fulvestrant Mylan \n- if you are allergic to fulvestrant or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding \n- if you have severe liver problems \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse before using Fulvestrant Mylan if any of these apply to \nyou: \n- kidney or liver problems \n- low numbers of platelets (which help blood clotting) or bleeding disorders  \n- previous problems with blood clots \n\n\n\n31 \n\n- osteoporosis (loss of bone density) \n- alcoholism \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nFulvestrant Mylan is not indicated in children and adolescents under 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Fulvestrant Mylan \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \nIn particular, you should tell your doctor if you are using anticoagulants (medicines to prevent blood \nclots). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou must not use Fulvestrant Mylan if you are pregnant. If you can become pregnant, you should use \neffective contraception while you are being treated with Fulvestrant Mylan and for 2 years after your \nlast dose. \n \nYou must not breast-feed while on treatment with Fulvestrant Mylan.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nFulvestrant Mylan is not expected to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, if you feel \ntired after treatment do not drive or use machines. \n \nFulvestrant Mylan contains 10% w/v ethanol (alcohol) i.e.  500 mg in each 5 ml, equivalent to 25 \nml beer or 10 ml wine  per one treatment dose (i.e. two syringes). The small amount of alcohol in this \nmedicine will not have any noticeable effects. \n \n \nFulvestrant Mylan contains benzyl alcohol \nThis medicine contains 500 mg benzyl alcohol in each 5 ml which is equivalent to 100 mg/ml (10% \nw/v). Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions.  \n \nFulvestrant Mylan contains benzyl benzoate \nThis medicine contains 750 mg benzyl benzoate in each 5 ml, which is equivalent to 150 mg/ml \n(15%w/v). \n \n \n3. How to use Fulvestrant Mylan \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you.  Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.   \n \nThe recommended dose is 500 mg fulvestrant (two 250 mg/5 ml injections) given once a month, with \nan additional 500 mg dose given 2 weeks after the initial dose. \n \nYour doctor or nurse will give you Fulvestrant Mylan as a slow intramuscular injection, one into each \nof your buttocks. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nYou may need immediate medical treatment if you experience any of the following side effects:  \n \n• Allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions, including swelling of the face, lips, tongue and/or throat \n\nthat may be signs of anaphylactic reactions \n• Thromboembolism (increased risk of blood clots)* \n• Inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)   \n• Liver failure \n\n \nTell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you notice any of the following side effects: \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n• Injection site reactions, such as pain and/or inflammation  \n• Abnormal levels of liver enzymes (in blood tests)* \n• Nausea (feeling sick)  \n• Weakness, tiredness* \n• Joint and musculoskeletal pain \n• Hot flushes \n• Skin rash \n• Allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions, including swelling of the face, lips, tongue and/or throat \n\n \nAll other side effects: \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n• Headache \n• Vomiting, diarrhoea, or loss of appetite* \n• Urinary tract infections \n• Back pain* \n• Increase of bilirubin (bile pigment produced by the liver)  \n• Thromboembolism (increased risk of blood clots)* \n• Decreased levels of platelets (thrombocytopenia) \n• Vaginal bleeding \n• Lower back pain irradiating to leg on one side (sciatica) \n• Sudden weakness, numbness, tingling, or loss of movement in your leg, especially on only one \n\nside of your body, sudden problems with walking or balance (peripheral neuropathy) \n \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n• Thick, whitish vaginal discharge and candidiasis (infection) \n• Bruising and bleeding at the site of injection \n• Increase of gamma-GT, a liver enzyme seen in a blood test \n• Inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) \n• Liver failure \n• Numbness, tingling and pain \n• Anaphylactic reactions \n\n \n* Includes side effects for which the exact role of Fulvestrant Mylan cannot be assessed due to the \nunderlying disease. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

With the \n\nother hand, take hold of the cap (A) and carefully tilt back \nand forth until the cap disconnects and can be pulled off, \ndo not twist (see Figure 1). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n• Remove the cap (A) in a straight upward direction. To \n\nmaintain sterility do not touch the syringe tip (B) (see \nFigure 2). \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n• Attach the safety needle to the Luer-Lok and twist until \n\nfirmly seated (see Figure 3). \n• Check that the needle is locked to the Luer connector \n\nbefore moving out of the vertical plane.  \n• Pull shield straight off needle to avoid damaging needle \n\npoint. \n• Transport filled syringe to point of administration. \n• Remove needle sheath. \n• Expel excess gas from the syringe. \n\n \n \n\n \n• Administer intramuscularly slowly (1-2 minutes/injection)  \n\ninto the buttock (gluteal area). For user convenience, the needle \nbevel- up position is oriented to the lever arm (see Figure 4).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n• After injection, immediately apply a single-finger stroke to \nthe activation assisted lever arm to activate the shielding  \nmechanism (see Figure 5).  \nNOTE: Activate away from self and others. Listen for click  \nand visually confirm needle tip is fully covered. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nDisposal \nPre-filled syringes are for single use only.  \nThis medicine may pose a risk to the aquatic environment.
