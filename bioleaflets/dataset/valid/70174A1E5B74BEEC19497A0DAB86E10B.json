CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSovaldi is indicated in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of chronic \nhepatitis C (CHC) in adults and paediatric patients aged 3 years and above (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and \n5.1). \n \nFor hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype specific activity, see sections 4.4 and 5.1. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nSovaldi treatment should be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the management of \npatients with CHC. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of Sovaldi in adults is one 400 mg tablet, taken orally, once daily with food \n(see section 5.2). \n \nThe recommended dose of Sovaldi in paediatric patients aged 3 years and above is based on weight (as \ndetailed in Table 2). Sovaldi should be taken with food (see section 5.2). \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nSovaldi oral granules are available for the treatment of chronic HCV-infection in paediatric patients \naged 3 years and above having difficulty in swallowing film-coated tablets. Please refer to the \nSummary of Product Characteristics for Sovaldi 150 mg or 200 mg granules. \n \nSovaldi should be used in combination with other medicinal products. Monotherapy of Sovaldi is not \nrecommended (see section 5.1). Refer also to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal \nproducts that are used in combination with Sovaldi. The recommended co-administered medicinal \nproduct(s) and treatment duration for Sovaldi combination therapy are provided in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Recommended co-administered medicinal product(s) and treatment duration for adults \nand paediatric patients treated with Sovaldi combination therapy \n\nPatient population* Treatment Duration \nAdult patients with \ngenotype 1, 4, 5 or 6 \nCHC \n\nSovaldi + ribavirinc + \npeginterferon alfa \n\n12 weeksa,b \n\nSovaldi + ribavirinc \n \nOnly for use in patients ineligible or \nintolerant to peginterferon alfa (see \nsection 4.4) \n\n24 weeks \n\nAdult and paediatric \npatients aged 3 years \nand above with \ngenotype 2 CHC \n\nSovaldid + ribavirinc, e 12 weeksb \n\nAdult patients with \ngenotype 3 CHC \n\nSovaldi + ribavirinc + \npeginterferon alfa \n\n12 weeksb \n\nSovaldi + ribavirinc 24 weeks \nPaediatric patients aged \n3 years and above with \ngenotype 3 CHC \n\n \nSovaldid + ribavirine \n\n \n24 weeks \n\nAdult patients with \nCHC awaiting liver \ntransplantation \n\nSovaldi + ribavirinc Until liver \ntransplantationf \n\n* Includes patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). \na. For previously treated patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, no data exists with the combination of Sovaldi, ribavirin \nand peginterferon alfa (see section 4.4). \nb. Consideration should be given to potentially extending the duration of therapy beyond 12 weeks and up to 24 weeks; \nespecially for those subgroups who have one or more factors historically associated with lower response rates to \ninterferon-based therapies (e.g. advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, high baseline viral concentrations, black race, IL28B non \nCC genotype, prior null response to peginterferon alfa and ribavirin therapy). \nc. Adults: weight-based ribavirin (< 75 kg = 1,000 mg and \u2265 75 kg = 1,200 mg); administered orally in two divided doses \nwith food. \nd. See Table 2 for weight-based Sovaldi dosing recommendations for paediatric patients aged 3 years and above. \ne. See Table 3 for weight-based ribavirin dosing recommendations for paediatric patients aged 3 years and above. \nf. See Special patient populations \u2013 Patients awaiting liver transplantation below. \n \nTable 2: Dosing for paediatric patients aged 3 years and above using Sovaldi tablets* \nBody Weight (kg)  Dosing of Sovaldi Tablets  Sofosbuvir Daily Dose \n\n \n\u2265 35 one 400 mg tablet once daily  \n\nor \ntwo 200 mg tablets once daily  \n \n\n400 mg/day  \n \n\n17 to < 35  one 200 mg tablet once daily  \n \n\n200 mg/day  \n \n\n*Sovaldi is also available as granules for use in paediatric patients with CHC aged 3 years and above (see section 5.1). \nPatients that weigh < 17 kg are not recommended to take tablets. Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for \nSovaldi 150 mg or 200 mg granules. \n \nIn paediatric patients aged 3 years and above the following ribavirin dosing is recommended where \nribavirin is divided into two daily doses and given with food: \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTable 3: Guidance for ribavirin dosing when administered in combination with Sovaldi to HCV-\ninfected paediatric patients aged 3 years and above  \nBody weight kg (lbs) RBV daily dose* \n\n< 47 (< 103) 15 mg/kg/day \n\n47-49 (103-108) 600 mg/day \n\n50-65 (110-143) 800 mg/day \n\n66-80 (145-176) 1000 mg/day \n\n> 81 (178) 1200 mg/day \n* The daily dosage of ribavirin is weight-based and is administered orally in two divided doses with food. \n \nConcerning co-administration with other direct-acting antivirals against HCV, see section 4.4. \n \nDose modification in adults \nDose reduction of Sovaldi is not recommended. \n \nIf sofosbuvir is used in combination with peginterferon alfa, and a patient has a serious adverse \nreaction potentially related to this medicinal product, the peginterferon alfa dose should be reduced or \ndiscontinued. Refer to the peginterferon alfa Summary of Product Characteristics for additional \ninformation about how to reduce and/or discontinue the peginterferon alfa dose. \n \nIf a patient has a serious adverse reaction potentially related to ribavirin, the ribavirin dose should be \nmodified or discontinued, if appropriate, until the adverse reaction abates or decreases in severity. \nTable 4 provides guidelines for dose modifications and discontinuation based on the patient\u2019s \nhaemoglobin concentration and cardiac status. \n \nTable 4: Ribavirin dose modification guideline for co-administration with Sovaldi in adults \n\nLaboratory values Reduce ribavirin dose to \n600 mg/day if: \n\nDiscontinue ribavirin if: \n\nHaemoglobin in patients with no \ncardiac disease \n\n<10 g/dL <8.5 g/dL \n\nHaemoglobin in patients with \nhistory of stable cardiac disease \n\n\u22652 g/dL decrease in haemoglobin \nduring any 4 week treatment \nperiod \n\n<12 g/dL despite 4 weeks at \nreduced dose \n\n \nOnce ribavirin has been withheld due to either a laboratory abnormality or clinical manifestation, an \nattempt may be made to restart ribavirin at 600 mg daily and further increase the dose to 800 mg daily. \nHowever, it is not recommended that ribavirin be increased to the original assigned dose (1,000 mg to \n1,200 mg daily). \n \nDose modification in paediatric patients aged 3 years and above \nDose reduction of Sovaldi is not recommended. \n \nIf a patient has a serious adverse reaction potentially related to ribavirin, the ribavirin dose should be \nmodified or discontinued, if appropriate, until the adverse reaction abates or decreases in severity. \nRefer to the ribavirin prescribing information for guidance on dose modification or discontinuation. \n \nDiscontinuation of dosing  \nIf the other medicinal products used in combination with Sovaldi are permanently discontinued, \nSovaldi should also be discontinued (see section 4.4). \n \nVomiting and missed doses \nPatients should be instructed that if vomiting occurs within 2 hours of dosing an additional dose \nshould be taken. If vomiting occurs more than 2 hours after dosing, no further dose is needed. These \n\n\n\n5 \n\nrecommendations are based on the absorption kinetics of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 suggesting that \nthe majority of the dose is absorbed within 2 hours after dosing. \n \nIf a dose is missed and it is within 18 hours of the normal time, patients should be instructed to take \nthe dose as soon as possible and then patients should take the next dose at the usual time. If it is after \n18 hours then patients should be instructed to wait and take the next dose at the usual time. Patients \nshould be instructed not to take a double dose. \n \nSpecial patient populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is warranted for elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Sovaldi is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.  \n \nSafety data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate \n[eGFR] <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis. Sovaldi \ncan be used in these patients with no dose adjustment when no other relevant treatment options are \navailable (see section 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Sovaldi is required for patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh-Turcotte [CPT] class A, B or C) (see section 5.2). The safety and efficacy of \nSovaldi have not been established in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. \n \nPatients awaiting liver transplantation \nThe duration of administration of Sovaldi in patients awaiting liver transplantation should be guided \nby an assessment of the potential benefits and risks for the individual patient (see section 5.1). \n \nAdult liver transplant recipients \nSovaldi in combination with ribavirin is recommended for 24 weeks in liver transplant recipients. In \nadults a starting ribavirin dose of 400 mg administered orally in two divided doses with food is \nrecommended. If the starting dose of ribavirin is well-tolerated, the dose can be titrated up to a \nmaximum of 1,000-1,200 mg daily (1,000 mg for patients weighing <75 kg and 1,200 mg for patients \nweighing \u226575 kg). If the starting dose of ribavirin is not well-tolerated, the dose should be reduced as \nclinically indicated based on haemoglobin levels (see section 5.1). \n \nPaediatric population aged < 3 years \nThe safety and efficacy of Sovaldi in children aged <3 years have not yet been established. No data are \navailable. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. \n \nPatients should be instructed to swallow the tablet(s) whole. The film-coated tablet(s) should not be \nchewed or crushed, due to the bitter taste of the active substance. The tablet(s) should be taken with \nfood (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nMedicinal products that are strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inducers in the intestine (carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin and St. John\u2019s wort). Co-administration will significantly \n\n\n\n6 \n\ndecrease sofosbuvir plasma concentration and could result in loss of efficacy of Sovaldi (see \nsection 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \n \nSovaldi is not recommended for administration as monotherapy and should be prescribed in \ncombination with other medicinal products for the treatment of hepatitis C infection. If the other \nmedicinal products used in combination with Sovaldi are permanently discontinued, Sovaldi should \nalso be discontinued (see section 4.2). Consult the Summary of Product Characteristics for \nco-prescribed medicinal products before starting therapy with Sovaldi. \n \nSevere bradycardia and heart block \n \nLife-threatening cases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when sofosbuvir-\ncontaining regimens are used in combination with amiodarone. Bradycardia has generally occurred \nwithin hours to days, but cases with a longer time to onset have been observed mostly up to 2 weeks \nafter initiating HCV treatment. \n \nAmiodarone should only be used in patients on Sovaldi when other alternative anti-arrhythmic \ntreatments are not tolerated or are contraindicated. \n \nShould concomitant use of amiodarone be considered necessary it is recommended that patients \nundergo cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration, after \nwhich outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the \nfirst 2 weeks of treatment. \n \nDue to the long half-life of amiodarone, cardiac monitoring as outlined above should also be carried \nout for patients who have discontinued amiodarone within the past few months and are to be initiated \non Sovaldi. \n \nAll patients with concurrent or recent use of amiodarone should be warned of the symptoms of \nbradycardia and heart block and should be advised to seek medical advice urgently should they \nexperience them. \n \nHCV/HBV (hepatitis B virus) co-infection \n \nCases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after \ntreatment with direct-acting antiviral agents. HBV screening should be performed in all patients before \ninitiation of treatment. HBV/HCV co-infected patients are at risk of HBV reactivation, and should \ntherefore be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines. \n \nTreatment-experienced patients with genotype 1, 4, 5 and 6 HCV infection \n \nSovaldi has not been studied in a Phase 3 study in treatment-experienced patients with genotype 1, 4, 5 \nand 6 HCV infection. Thus, the optimal treatment duration in this population has not been established \n(see also sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \nConsideration should be given to treating these patients, and potentially extending the duration of \ntherapy with sofosbuvir, peginterferon alfa and ribavirin beyond 12 weeks and up to 24 weeks; \nespecially for those subgroups who have one or more factors historically associated with lower \nresponse rates to interferon-based therapies (advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, high baseline viral \nconcentrations, black race, IL28B non CC genotype). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nTreatment of patients with genotype 5 or 6 HCV infection \n \nThe clinical data to support the use of Sovaldi in patients with genotype 5 and 6 HCV infection is very \nlimited (see section 5.1). \n \nInterferon-free therapy for genotype 1, 4, 5 and 6 HCV infection \n \nInterferon-free regimens for patients with genotype 1, 4, 5 and 6 HCV infection with Sovaldi have not \nbeen investigated in Phase 3 studies (see section 5.1). The optimal regimen and treatment duration \nhave not been established. Such regimens should only be used for patients that are intolerant to or \nineligible for interferon therapy, and are in urgent need of treatment. \n \nCo-administration with other direct-acting antivirals against HCV \n \nSovaldi should only be co-administered with other direct-acting antiviral medicinal products if the \nbenefit is considered to outweigh the risks based upon available data. There are no data to support the \nco-administration of Sovaldi and telaprevir or boceprevir. Such co-administration is not recommended \n(see also section 4.5). \n \nPregnancy and concomitant use with ribavirin \n \nWhen Sovaldi is used in combination with ribavirin or peginterferon alfa/ribavirin, women of \nchildbearing potential or their male partners must use an effective form of contraception during the \ntreatment and for a period of time after the treatment as recommended in the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for ribavirin. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for \nadditional information. \n \nUse with moderate P-gp inducers \n \nMedicinal products that are moderate P-gp inducers in the intestine (e.g. modafinil, oxcarbazepine and \nrifapentine) may decrease sofosbuvir plasma concentration leading to reduced therapeutic effect of \nSovaldi. Co-administration of such medicinal products is not recommended with Sovaldi (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nUse in diabetic patients  \n \nDiabetics may experience improved glucose control, potentially resulting in symptomatic \nhypoglycaemia, after initiating HCV direct-acting antiviral treatment. Glucose levels of diabetic \npatients initiating direct-acting antiviral therapy should be closely monitored, particularly within the \nfirst 3 months, and their diabetic medication modified when necessary. The physician in charge of the \ndiabetic care of the patient should be informed when direct-acting antiviral therapy is initiated. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nSafety data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and \nESRD requiring haemodialysis. Sovaldi can be used in these patients with no dose adjustment when \nno other relevant treatment options are available (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). When Sovaldi is used \nin combination with ribavirin or peginterferon alfa/ribavirin, refer also to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for ribavirin for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) <50 mL/min (see also \nsection 5.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nSofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug. After oral administration of Sovaldi, sofosbuvir is rapidly \nabsorbed and subject to extensive first-pass hepatic and intestinal metabolism. Intracellular hydrolytic \nprodrug cleavage catalysed by enzymes including carboxylesterase 1 and sequential phosphorylation \nsteps catalysed by nucleotide kinases result in formation of the pharmacologically active uridine \n\n\n\n8 \n\nnucleoside analogue triphosphate. The predominant inactive circulating metabolite GS-331007 that \naccounts for greater than 90% of drug-related material systemic exposure is formed through pathways \nsequential and parallel to formation of active metabolite. The parent sofosbuvir accounts for \napproximately 4% of drug-related material systemic exposure (see section 5.2). In clinical \npharmacology studies, both sofosbuvir and GS-331007 were monitored for purposes of \npharmacokinetic analyses. \n \nSofosbuvir is a substrate of drug transporter P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) while \nGS-331007 is not. \n \nMedicinal products that are strong P-gp inducers in the intestine (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, \nphenytoin, rifampicin and St. John\u2019s wort) may significantly decrease sofosbuvir plasma concentration \nleading to reduced therapeutic effect of Sovaldi and thus are contraindicated with Sovaldi (see \nsection 4.3). Medicinal products that are moderate P-gp inducers in the intestine (e.g. modafinil, \noxcarbazepine and rifapentine) may decrease sofosbuvir plasma concentration leading to reduced \ntherapeutic effect of Sovaldi. Co-administration with such medicinal products is not recommended \nwith Sovaldi (see section 4.4). Co-administration of Sovaldi with medicinal products that inhibit P-gp \nand/or BCRP may increase sofosbuvir plasma concentration without increasing GS-331007 plasma \nconcentration, thus Sovaldi may be co-administered with P-gp and/or BCRP inhibitors. Sofosbuvir and \nGS-331007 are not inhibitors of P-gp and BCRP and thus are not expected to increase exposures of \nmedicinal products that are substrates of these transporters. \n \nThe intracellular metabolic activation pathway of sofosbuvir is mediated by generally low affinity and \nhigh capacity hydrolase and nucleotide phosphorylation pathways that are unlikely to be affected by \nconcomitant medicinal products (see section 5.2). \n \nPatients treated with vitamin K antagonists \n \nAs liver function may change during treatment with Sovaldi, a close monitoring of International \nNormalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended. \n \nImpact of DAA therapy on drugs metabolized by the liver \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of drugs that are metabolized by the liver (e.g. immunosuppressive agents such \nas calcineurin inhibitors) may be impacted by changes in liver function during DAA therapy, related to \nclearance of HCV. \n \nOther interactions \n \nDrug interaction information for Sovaldi with potential concomitant medicinal products is summarised \nin Table 5 below (where 90% confidence interval (CI) of the geometric least-squares mean (GLSM) \nratio were within \u201c\u2194\u201d, extended above \u201c\u2191\u201d, or extended below \u201c\u2193\u201d the predetermined equivalence \nboundaries).

Significant \nteratogenic and/or embryocidal effects have been demonstrated in all animal species exposed to \nribavirin (see section 4.4). Women of childbearing potential or their male partners must use an \neffective form of contraception during treatment and for a period of time after the treatment has \nconcluded as recommended in the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin. Refer to the \nSummary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for additional information. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of sofosbuvir \nin pregnant women. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. \nNo effects on foetal development have been observed in rats and rabbits at the highest doses tested. \nHowever, it has not been possible to fully estimate exposure margins achieved for sofosbuvir in the rat \nrelative to the exposure in humans at the recommended clinical dose (see section 5.3). \n \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Sovaldi during pregnancy. \n \nHowever, if ribavirin is co-administered with sofosbuvir, the contraindications regarding use of \nribavirin during pregnancy apply (see also the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether sofosbuvir and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nAvailable pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of metabolites in milk (for details \nsee section 5.3). \n \nA risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Therefore, Sovaldi should not be used during \nbreast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of Sovaldi on fertility are available. Animal studies do not indicate \nharmful effects on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSovaldi has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be informed \nthat fatigue and disturbance in attention, dizziness and blurred vision have been reported during \ntreatment with sofosbuvir in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile in adults \n \nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on pooled data from five Phase 3 clinical studies (both \ncontrolled and uncontrolled). \n \nSovaldi has been studied in combination with ribavirin, with or without peginterferon alfa. In this \ncontext, no adverse drug reactions specific to sofosbuvir have been identified. The most common \nadverse drug reactions occurring in patients receiving sofosbuvir and ribavirin or sofosbuvir, ribavirin \nand peginterferon alfa were fatigue, headache, nausea and insomnia. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse drug reactions have been identified with sofosbuvir in combination with \nribavirin or in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin (Table 6). The adverse reactions are \nlisted below by body system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as follows: very \ncommon (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to \n<1/1,000) or very rare (<1/10,000). \n \nTable 6: Adverse drug reactions identified with sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin or \npeginterferon alfa and ribavirin \n\nFrequency SOFa + RBVb SOF + PEGc + RBV \nInfections and infestations: \nCommon nasopharyngitis  \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders: \nVery common haemoglobin decreased anaemia, neutropenia, lymphocyte count \n\ndecreased, platelet count decreased \nCommon anaemia  \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: \nVery common decreased appetited decreased appetite \nCommon  weight decreased \nPsychiatric disorders: \nVery common insomnia insomnia \nCommon depression depression, anxiety, agitation \nNervous system disorders: \nVery common headache dizziness, headache \nCommon disturbance in attention migraine, memory impairment, \n\ndisturbance in attention \nEye disorders: \nCommon  vision blurred \n\n\n\n15 \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: \nVery common  dyspnoea, cough \nCommon dyspnoea, dyspnoea \n\nexertional, cough \ndyspnoea exertional \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: \nVery common nausea diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting \nCommon abdominal discomfort, \n\nconstipation, dyspepsia \nconstipation, dry mouth, \ngastroesophageal reflux \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: \nVery common blood bilirubin increased blood bilirubin increased \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nVery common  rash, pruritus \nCommon alopecia, dry skin, pruritus alopecia, dry skin \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \nVery common  arthralgia, myalgia \nCommon arthralgia, back pain, \n\nmuscle spasms, myalgia \nback pain, muscle spasms \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nVery common fatigue, irritability chills, fatigue, influenza-like illness, \n\nirritability, pain, pyrexia \nCommon pyrexia, asthenia chest pain, asthenia \na.

Decreased appetite was identified as an adverse drug \nreaction to Sovaldi in combination with ribavirin oral solution in paediatric patients aged 3 to < 12 years \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nCardiac arrhythmias \nCases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when sofosbuvir containing-regimes \nare used in combination with amiodarone and/or other medicinal products that lower heart rate (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nSkin disorders \nFrequency not known: Stevens-Johnson syndrome \n \nOther special population(s) \n \nHIV/HCV co-infection \nThe safety profile of sofosbuvir and ribavirin in HCV/HIV co-infected adult patients was similar to \nthat observed in mono-infected HCV patients treated with sofosbuvir and ribavirin in Phase 3 clinical \nstudies (see section 5.1). \n \nPatients awaiting liver transplantation \nThe safety profile of sofosbuvir and ribavirin in HCV infected adult patients prior to liver \ntransplantation was similar to that observed in patients treated with sofosbuvir and ribavirin in Phase 3 \nclinical studies (see section 5.1). \n \nPatients with Renal Impairment  \nSofosbuvir in a fixed dose combination with ledipasvir was administered for 12 weeks to 18 patients \nwith genotype 1 CHC and severe renal impairment in an open-label study (Study 0154). The safety of \nsofosbuvir in a fixed dose combination with either ledipasvir or velpatasvir has been studied in 154 \npatients with ESRD requiring dialysis (Study 4062 and Study 4063). In this setting, exposure of \nsofosbuvir metabolite GS-331007 is 20-fold increased, exceeding levels where adverse reactions have \nbeen observed in preclinical trials. In this limited clinical safety data set, the rate of adverse events and \ndeaths was not clearly elevated from what is expected in ESRD patients. \n \nAdult liver transplant recipients \nThe safety profile of sofosbuvir and ribavirin in liver transplant adult recipients with chronic \nhepatitis C was similar to that observed in patients treated with sofosbuvir and ribavirin in Phase 3 \nclinical studies (see section 5.1). In study 0126, decreases in haemoglobin during treatment were very \n\n\n\n16 \n\ncommon with 32.5% (13/40 patients) experiencing a decline in haemoglobin to <10 g/dL, 1 of whom \nalso had a decline to <8.5 g/dL. Eight patients (20%) received epoetin and/or a blood product. In \n5 patients (12.5%), study drugs were discontinued, modified or interrupted due to adverse events. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Sovaldi in paediatric patients aged 3 years and above are based on data \nfrom 106 patients who were treated with Sovaldi and ribavirin for 12 weeks (genotype 2 patients) and \nfor 24 weeks (genotype 3 patients) in a Phase 2, open-label clinical trial. No adverse drug reactions \nspecific to Sovaldi have been identified. The adverse reactions observed were generally consistent \nwith those observed in clinical studies of Sovaldi plus ribavirin in adults (see Table 6). Decreased \nappetite was observed as a very common adverse drug reaction to Sovaldi when given in combination \nwith ribavirin oral solution in paediatric patients aged 3 to < 12 years. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe highest documented dose of sofosbuvir was a single supratherapeutic dose of sofosbuvir 1,200 mg \nadministered to 59 healthy subjects. In that study, there were no untoward effects observed at this dose \nlevel, and adverse reactions were similar in frequency and severity to those reported in the placebo and \nsofosbuvir 400 mg treatment groups. The effects of higher doses are unknown. \n \nNo specific antidote is available for overdose with Sovaldi. If overdose occurs the patient must be \nmonitored for evidence of toxicity. Treatment of overdose with Sovaldi consists of general supportive \nmeasures including monitoring of vital signs as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient. \nHaemodialysis can efficiently remove (53% extraction ratio) the predominant circulating metabolite \nGS-331007. A 4-hour haemodialysis session removed 18% of the administered dose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, direct-acting antiviral; ATC code: J05AP08 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nSofosbuvir is a pan-genotypic inhibitor of the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is \nessential for viral replication. Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug that undergoes intracellular \nmetabolism to form the pharmacologically active uridine analog triphosphate (GS-461203), which can \nbe incorporated into HCV RNA by the NS5B polymerase and acts as a chain terminator. In a \nbiochemical assay, GS-461203 inhibited the polymerase activity of the recombinant NS5B from HCV \ngenotype 1b, 2a, 3a and 4a with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value ranging from 0.7 to \n2.6 \u03bcM. GS-461203 (the active metabolite of sofosbuvir) is not an inhibitor of human DNA and \nRNA polymerases nor an inhibitor of mitochondrial RNA polymerase. \n \nAntiviral activity \n \nIn HCV replicon assays, the effective concentration (EC50) values of sofosbuvir against full-length \nreplicons from genotype 1a, 1b, 2a, 3a and 4a were 0.04, 0.11, 0.05, 0.05 and 0.04 \u03bcM, respectively, \nand EC50 values of sofosbuvir against chimeric 1b replicons encoding NS5B from genotype 2b, 5a or \n6a were 0.014 to 0.015 \u03bcM. The mean \u00b1 SD EC50 of sofosbuvir against chimeric replicons encoding \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n17 \n\nNS5B sequences from clinical isolates was 0.068 \u00b1 0.024 \u03bcM for genotype 1a (n = 67), \n0.11 \u00b1 0.029 \u03bcM for genotype 1b (n = 29), 0.035 \u00b1 0.018 \u03bcM for genotype 2 (n = 15) and \n0.085 \u00b1 0.034 \u03bcM for genotype 3a (n = 106). In these assays, the in vitro antiviral activity of \nsofosbuvir against the less common genotypes 4, 5 and 6 was similar to that observed for genotypes 1, \n2 and 3. \n \nThe presence of 40% human serum had no effect on the anti-HCV activity of sofosbuvir. \n \nResistance \n \nIn cell culture \nHCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir have been selected in cell culture for multiple \ngenotypes including 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 5a and 6a. Reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir was associated \nwith the primary NS5B substitution S282T in all replicon genotypes examined. Site-directed \nmutagenesis of the S282T substitution in replicons of 8 genotypes conferred 2- to 18-fold reduced \nsusceptibility to sofosbuvir and reduced the replication viral capacity by 89% to 99% compared to the \ncorresponding wild-type. In biochemical assays, recombinant NS5B polymerase from genotypes 1b, \n2a, 3a and 4a expressing the S282T substitution showed reduced susceptibility to GS-461203 \ncompared to respective wild-types. \n \nIn clinical studies - Adults \nIn a pooled analysis of 991 patients who received sofosbuvir in Phase 3 studies, 226 patients qualified \nfor resistance analysis due to virologic failure or early study drug discontinuation and having \nHCV RNA >1,000 IU/mL. Post-baseline NS5B sequences were available for 225 of the 226 patients, \nwith deep sequencing data (assay cutoff of 1%) from 221 of these patients. The sofosbuvir-associated \nresistance substitution S282T was not detected in any of these patients by deep sequencing or \npopulation sequencing. The S282T substitution in NS5B was detected in a single subject receiving \nSovaldi monotherapy in a Phase 2 study. This subject harboured <1% HCV S282T at baseline and \ndeveloped S282T (>99%) at 4 weeks post-treatment which resulted in a 13.5-fold change in sofosbuvir \nEC50 and reduced viral replication capacity. The S282T substitution reverted to wild-type over the next \n8 weeks and was no longer detectable by deep sequencing at 12 weeks post-treatment. \n \nTwo NS5B substitutions, L159F and V321A, were detected in post-treatment relapse samples from \nmultiple genotype 3 HCV infected patients in the Phase 3 clinical studies. No shift in the phenotypic \nsusceptibility to sofosbuvir or ribavirin of subject isolates with these substitutions was detected. In \naddition, S282R and L320F substitutions were detected on treatment by deep sequencing in a \npre-transplant subject with a partial treatment response. The clinical significance of these findings is \nunknown. \n \nEffect of baseline HCV polymorphisms on treatment outcome \n \nAdult population \nBaseline NS5B sequences were obtained for 1,292 patients from Phase 3 studies by population \nsequencing and the S282T substitution was not detected in any subject with available baseline \nsequence. In an analysis evaluating the effect of baseline polymorphisms on treatment outcome, no \nstatistically significant association was observed between the presence of any HCV NS5B variant at \nbaseline and treatment outcome. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe presence of NS5B RAVs did not impact treatment outcome; all patients with baseline NS5B \nnucleoside inhibitor RAVs achieved SVR following treatment with sofosbuvir. \n \nCross-resistance \n \nHCV replicons expressing the sofosbuvir-associated resistance substitution S282T were fully \nsusceptible to other classes of anti-HCV agents. Sofosbuvir retained activity against the \nNS5B substitutions L159F and L320F associated with resistance to other nucleoside inhibitors. \n\n\n\n18 \n\nSofosbuvir was fully active against substitutions associated with resistance to other direct-acting \nantivirals with different mechanisms of actions, such as NS5B non-nucleoside inhibitors, NS3 protease \ninhibitors and NS5A inhibitors. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy of sofosbuvir was evaluated in five Phase 3 studies in a total of 1,568 adult patients with \ngenotypes 1 to 6 chronic hepatitis C. One study was conducted in treatment-na\u00efve patients with \ngenotype 1, 4, 5 or 6 chronic hepatitis C in combination with peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin and \nthe other four studies were conducted in patients with genotype 2 or 3 chronic hepatitis C in \ncombination with ribavirin including one in treatment-na\u00efve patients, one in interferon intolerant, \nineligible or unwilling patients, one in patients previously treated with an interferon-based regimen, \nand one in all patients irrespective of prior treatment history or ability to receive treatment with \ninterferon. Patients in these studies had compensated liver disease including cirrhosis. Sofosbuvir was \nadministered at a dose of 400 mg once daily. The ribavirin dose was weight-based at 1,000-1,200 mg \ndaily administered in two divided doses, and the peginterferon alfa 2a dose, where applicable, was \n180 \u03bcg per week. Treatment duration was fixed in each study and was not guided by patients\u2019 \nHCV RNA levels (no response guided algorithm). \n \nPlasma HCV RNA values were measured during the clinical studies using the COBAS TaqMan \nHCV test (version 2.0), for use with the High Pure System. The assay had a lower limit of \nquantification (LLOQ) of 25 IU/mL. Sustained virologic response (SVR) was the primary endpoint to \ndetermine the HCV cure rate for all studies which was defined as HCV RNA less than LLOQ at \n12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12). \n \nClinical studies in patients with genotype 1, 4, 5 and 6 chronic hepatitis C \nTreatment-na\u00efve adult patients - NEUTRINO (study 110) \nNEUTRINO was an open-label, single-arm study that evaluated 12 weeks of treatment with sofosbuvir \nin combination with peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin in treatment-na\u00efve patients with genotype 1, 4, \n5 or 6 HCV infection. \n \nTreated patients (n = 327) had a median age of 54 years (range: 19 to 70); 64% of the patients were \nmale; 79% were White; 17% were Black; 14% were Hispanic or Latino; mean body mass index was \n29 kg/m2 (range: 18 to 56 kg/m2); 78% had baseline HCV RNA greater than 6 log10 IU/mL; 17% had \ncirrhosis; 89% had HCV genotype 1 and 11% had HCV genotype 4, 5 or 6.

The primary endpoint of the study was \npost-transplant virologic response (pTVR, HCV RNA <LLOQ at 12 weeks post-transplant). \nHCV infected patients, regardless of genotype, with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) meeting the \nMILAN criteria received 400 mg sofosbuvir and 1,000-1,200 mg ribavirin daily for a maximum of \n24 weeks, subsequently amended to 48 weeks, or until the time of liver transplantation, whichever \noccurred first. An interim analysis was conducted on 61 patients who received sofosbuvir and \nribavirin; the majority of patients had HCV genotype 1, 44 patients were CPT class A and 17 patients \nwere CPT class B.

Following treatment with sofosbuvir 200 mg or \n400 mg in combination with ribavirin the SVR12 rate in patients with ESRD was 40% and 60%, \nrespectively. The safety and efficacy of 12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in 18 \ngenotype 1 HCV-infected patients with severe renal impairment not requiring dialysis was also studied \nin Study 0154. At baseline, two patients had cirrhosis and the mean eGFR was 24.9 mL/min (range: \n9.0-39.6). SVR12 was achieved in 100 % (18/18) of patients treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir.  \n \nStudy 4063 was an open-label study that evaluated a fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir and \nledipasvir in 95 patients with HCV-infection and ESRD requiring dialysis. The SVR rates for the 8, \n12, and 24 week ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment groups were 93% (42/45), 100% (31/31), and 79% \n(15/19), respectively. Of the seven patients who did not achieve SVR12, none experienced virologic \nfailure or relapsed. \n \nStudy 4062 was an open-label study that evaluated a fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir and \nvelpatasvir in 59 HCV-infected patients with ESRD requiring dialysis. The SVR rate was 95% \n(56/59); of the three patients that did not achieve SVR12, one had completed sofosbuvir with \nvelpatasvir treatment and relapsed.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe efficacy of sofosbuvir in HCV-infected patients aged 3 years and above was evaluated in a \nPhase 2, open label clinical trial that enrolled 106 patients with genotype 2 (n = 31) or genotype 3 \n(n = 75) chronic HCV infection. Patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection in the trial were treated \nwith sofosbuvir with ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks, respectively. \n \nPatients aged 12 to < 18 Years: \nSofosbuvir was evaluated in 52 patients 12 to < 18 years with genotype 2 (n = 13) or genotype 3 (n = \n39) HCV infection. The median age was 15 years (range: 12 to 17); 40% of the patients were female; \n90% were White, 4% were Black, and 2% were Asian; 4% were Hispanic/Latino; mean weight was \n60.4 kg (range: 29.6 to 75.6 kg); 17% were treatment experienced; 65% had baseline HCV RNA \nlevels greater than or equal to 800,000 IU/mL; and no patients had known cirrhosis. The majority of \npatients (69%) had been infected through vertical transmission. \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nThe SVR12 rate was 98% overall (100% [13/13] in genotype 2 patients and 97% [38/39]) in \ngenotype 3 patients. No patient experienced on-treatment virologic failure or relapse; one patient with \ngenotype 3 HCV infection achieved SVR4 but did not return for the SVR12 visit. \n \nPatients aged 6 to < 12 Years:  \nSofosbuvir was evaluated in 41 patients 6 to < 12 years of age with genotype 2 (n = 13), or genotype 3 \n(n = 28) HCV infection. The median age was 9 years (range: 6 to 11); 73% of the patients were \nfemale; 71% were White and 20% were Asian; 15% were Hispanic/Latino; mean weight was 33.7 kg \n(range: 15.1 to 80.0 kg); 98% were treatment naive; 46% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than \nor equal to 800,000 IU /mL; and no patients had known cirrhosis. The majority of patients (98%) had \nbeen infected through vertical transmission. \n \nThe SVR12 rate was 100% (100% [13/13] in genotype 2 patients and 100% [28/28] in genotype 3 \npatients). No patients experienced on-treatment virologic failure or relapse. \n \nPatients aged 3 to < 6 Years:  \nSofosbuvir was evaluated in 13 patients 3 to < 6 years with genotype 2 (n = 5) or genotype 3 (n = 8) \nHCV infection. The median age was 4 years (range: 3 to 5); 77% of the patients were female; 69% \nwere White, 8% were Black, and 8% were Asian; 8% were Hispanic/Latino; mean weight was 16.8 kg \n(range: 13.0 to 19.2 kg); 100% were treatment naive; 23% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than \nor equal to 800,000 IU/mL; and no patients had known cirrhosis. The majority of patients (85%) had \nbeen infected through vertical transmission. \n \nThe SVR12 rate was 92% overall (80% [4/5] in genotype 2 patients and 100% [8/8] in genotype 3 \npatients). No patients experienced on-treatment virologic failure or relapse; one patient with \ngenotype 2 HCV prematurely discontinued study treatment after three days due to abnormal taste of \nthe medication and did not return for post-treatment Week 12. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nSofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug that is extensively metabolised. The active metabolite is formed in \nhepatocytes and not observed in plasma. The predominant (>90%) metabolite, GS-331007, is inactive. \nIt is formed through sequential and parallel pathways to the formation of active metabolite. \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of sofosbuvir and the predominant circulating metabolite GS-331007 \nhave been evaluated in healthy adult subjects and in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Following oral \nadministration, sofosbuvir was absorbed quickly and the peak plasma concentration was observed \n~0.5-2 hour post-dose, regardless of dose level. Peak plasma concentration of GS-331007 was \nobserved between 2 to 4 hours post-dose. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients \nwith genotypes 1 to 6 HCV infection (n = 986), steady-state AUC0-24 for sofosbuvir and GS-331007 \nwas 1,010 ng\u2022h/mL and 7,200 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. Relative to healthy subjects (n = 284), the \nsofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUC0-24 was 57% higher and 39% lower, respectively in HCV infected \npatients. \n \nEffects of food \nRelative to fasting conditions, the administration of a single dose of sofosbuvir with a standardised \nhigh fat meal slowed the rate of absorption of sofosbuvir. The extent of absorption of sofosbuvir was \nincreased approximately 1.8-fold, with little effect on peak concentration. The exposure to GS-331007 \nwas not altered in the presence of a high-fat meal. \n \nDistribution \n \nSofosbuvir is not a substrate for hepatic uptake transporters, organic anion-transporting polypeptide \n(OATP) 1B1 or 1B3, and organic cation transporter (OCT) 1. While subject to active tubular secretion, \nGS-331007 is not a substrate for renal transporters including organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 or 3, \n\n\n\n28 \n\nOCT2, MRP2, P-gp, BCRP or MATE1. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 are not inhibitors of drug \ntransporters P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, BSEP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OCT1. GS-331007 is not an \ninhibitor of OAT1, OCT2, and MATE1. \n \nSofosbuvir is approximately 85% bound to human plasma proteins (ex vivo data) and the binding is \nindependent of drug concentration over the range of 1 \u03bcg/mL to 20 \u03bcg/mL. Protein binding of \nGS-331007 was minimal in human plasma. After a single 400 mg dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir in healthy \nsubjects, the blood to plasma ratio of 14C-radioactivity was approximately 0.7. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nSofosbuvir is extensively metabolised in the liver to form the pharmacologically active nucleoside \nanalog triphosphate GS-461203. The metabolic activation pathway involves sequential hydrolysis of \nthe carboxyl ester moiety catalysed by human cathepsin A (CatA) or carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) and \nphosphoramidate cleavage by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) followed by \nphosphorylation by the pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway. Dephosphorylation results in the \nformation of nucleoside metabolite GS-331007 that cannot be efficiently rephosphorylated and lacks \nanti-HCV activity in vitro. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 are not substrates or inhibitors of UGT1A1 or \nCYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 enzymes. \n \nAfter a single 400 mg oral dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir and GS-331007 accounted for \napproximately 4% and >90% of drug-related material (sum of molecular weight-adjusted AUC of \nsofosbuvir and its metabolites) systemic exposure, respectively. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing a single 400 mg oral dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir, mean total recovery of the dose was greater \nthan 92%, consisting of approximately 80%, 14%, and 2.5% recovered in urine, faeces, and expired \nair, respectively. The majority of the sofosbuvir dose recovered in urine was GS-331007 (78%) while \n3.5% was recovered as sofosbuvir. This data indicate that renal clearance is the major elimination \npathway for GS-331007 with a large part actively secreted. The median terminal half-lives of \nsofosbuvir and GS-331007 were 0.4 and 27 hours respectively. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nThe dose linearity of sofosbuvir and its primary metabolite, GS-331007, was evaluated in fasted \nhealthy subjects. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUCs are near dose proportional over the dose range of \n200 mg to 400 mg. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nGender and race \nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to gender or race have been identified for \nsofosbuvir and GS-331007. \n \nElderly \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV infected patients showed that within the age range (19 to \n75 years) analysed, age did not have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure to sofosbuvir and \nGS-331007. Clinical studies of sofosbuvir included 65 patients aged 65 and over. The response rates \nobserved for patients over 65 years of age were similar to that of younger patients across treatment \ngroups. \n \nRenal impairment \nA summary of the effect of varying degrees of renal impairment (RI) on the exposures of sofosbuvir \nand GS-331007 compared to subjects with normal renal function, as described in the text below, are \nprovided in Table 24.  \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nTable 24: Effect of varying degrees of renal impairment on exposures (AUC) of sofosbuvir and \nGS-331007 compared to subjects with normal renal function \n HCV-Negative Subjects HCV-Infected Subjects \n\nMild RI \n(eGFR \n\u226550 and \n<80 mL/min/ \n1.73m2) \n\nModerate RI \n(eGFR \n\u226530 and \n<50 mL/min/ \n1.73m2) \n\nSevere RI \n(eGFR \n<30 mL/min/ \n1.73m2) \n\nESRD Requiring \nDialysis \n\nSevere RI \n(eGFR \n<30 mL/min/ \n1.73m2) \n\nESRD \nRequiring \nDialysis Dosed \n\n1 hr \nBefore \nDialysis \n\nDosed \n1 hr \nAfter \nDialysis \n\nSofosbuvir 1.6-fold\u2191 2.1-fold\u2191 2.7-fold\u2191 1.3-fold\u2191 1.6-fold\u2191 ~2-fold\u2191 1.9-fold\u2191 \nGS-331007 1.6-fold\u2191 1.9-fold\u2191 5.5-fold\u2191 \u226510-fold\u2191 \u226520-fold\u2191 ~7-fold\u2191 21-fold\u2191 \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir were studied in adult HCV negative patients with mild \n(eGFR \u226550 and <80 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (eGFR \u226530 and <50 mL/min/1.73 m2), severe renal \nimpairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and patients with ESRD requiring haemodialysis following a \nsingle 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir, relative to adult patients with normal renal function \n(eGFR >80 mL/min/1.73 m2). GS-331007 is efficiently removed by haemodialysis with an extraction \ncoefficient of approximately 53%. Following a single 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir, a 4 hour \nhaemodialysis removed 18% of administered sofosbuvir dose. \n \nIn HCV-infected adult patients with severe renal impairment treated with sofosbuvir 200 mg with \nribavirin (n=10) or sofosbuvir 400 mg with ribavirin (n=10) for 24 weeks or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir \n90/400 mg (n=18) for 12 weeks, the pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 were consistent \nwith that observed in HCV negative adult patients with severe renal impairment.  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 were studied in HCV-infected adult patients with \nESRD requiring dialysis treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (n = 94) for 8, 12, or 24 weeks or \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir (n = 59) for 12 weeks, and compared to patients without renal impairment in the \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir Phase 2/3 trials (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir were studied following 7-day dosing of 400 mg sofosbuvir in \nadult HCV-infected patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (CPT class B and C). \nRelative to patients with normal hepatic function, the sofosbuvir AUC0-24 was 126% and 143% higher \nin moderate and severe hepatic impairment, while the GS-331007 AUC0-24 was 18% and 9% higher, \nrespectively. Population pharmacokinetics analysis in adult HCV-infected patients indicated that \ncirrhosis had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure to sofosbuvir and GS-331007. No dose \nadjustment of sofosbuvir is recommended for patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic \nimpairment (see section 4.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nSofosbuvir and GS-331007 exposures in paediatric patients aged 3 years and above were similar to \nthose in adults from Phase 2/3 studies following administration of sofosbuvir. The pharmacokinetics \nof sofosbuvir and GS-331007 have not been established in paediatric patients aged < 3 years (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) \n \nEfficacy, in terms of rapid virologic response, has been shown to correlate with exposure to sofosbuvir \nas well as GS 331007. However, neither of these entities has been evidenced to be a general surrogate \nmarker for efficacy (SVR12) at the therapeutic 400 mg dose. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn repeat dose toxicology studies in rat and dog, high doses of the 1:1 diastereomeric mixture caused \nadverse liver (dog) and heart (rat) effects and gastrointestinal reactions (dog). Exposure to sofosbuvir \nin rodent studies could not be detected likely due to high esterase activity; however, exposure to the \nmajor metabolite GS-331007 at the adverse dose was 29 times (rat) and 123 times (dog) higher than \n\n\n\n30 \n\nthe clinical exposure at 400 mg sofosbuvir. No liver or heart findings were observed in chronic \ntoxicity studies at exposures 9 times (rat) and 27 times (dog) higher than the clinical exposure. \n \nSofosbuvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial \nmutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo mouse \nmicronucleus assays. \n \nCarcinogenicity studies in mice and rats do not indicate any carcinogenicity potential of sofosbuvir \nadministered at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in mouse and 750 mg/kg/day in rat. Exposure to \nGS-331007 in these studies was up to 30 times (mouse) and 15 times (rat) higher than the clinical \nexposure at 400 mg sofosbuvir. \n \nSofosbuvir had no effects on embryo-foetal viability or on fertility in rat and was not teratogenic in rat \nand rabbit development studies. No adverse effects on behaviour, reproduction or development of \noffspring in rat were reported. In rabbit studies exposure to sofosbuvir was 9 times the expected \nclinical exposure. In the rat studies, exposure to sofosbuvir could not be determined but exposure \nmargins based on the major human metabolite ranged from 8 to 28 times higher than the clinical \nexposure at 400 mg sofosbuvir. \n \nSofosbuvir-derived material was transferred through the placenta in pregnant rats and into the milk of \nlactating rats. \n \n \n6.

Sovaldi should be taken with food (see section 5.2). \n \nSovaldi should be used in combination with other medicinal products.  Monotherapy of Sovaldi is not \nrecommended (see section 5.1). Refer also to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal \n\n\n\n33 \n\nproducts that are used in combination with Sovaldi. The recommended co-administered medicinal \nproduct(s) and treatment duration for Sovaldi combination therapy are provided in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Recommended co-administered medicinal product(s) and treatment duration for adults \nand paediatric patients treated Sovaldi combination therapy \nPatient population* Treatment Duration \n\nAdult patients with genotype 1, 4, \n5 or 6 CHC \n\nSovaldi + ribavirinc + peginterferon alfa 12 weeksa,b \n\nSovaldi + ribavirinc \n \nOnly for use in patients ineligible or intolerant to \npeginterferon alfa (see section 4.4) \n\n24 weeks \n\nAdult and paediatric patients aged \n3 years and above with \ngenotype 2 CHC \n\nSovaldid + ribavirinc,e 12 weeksb \n\nAdult patients with genotype 3 \nCHC \n\nSovaldi + ribavirinc + peginterferon alfa 12 weeksb \n\nSovaldi + ribavirinc 24 weeks \n\nPaediatric patients aged 3 years \nand above with genotype 3 CHC Sovaldi\n\nd + ribavirine 24 weeks \n\nAdult patients with CHC awaiting \nliver transplantation Sovaldi + ribavirin\n\nc Until liver transplantationf \n* Includes patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). \na. For previously treated patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, no data exists with the combination of Sovaldi, ribavirin \nand peginterferon alfa (see section 4.4). \nb. Consideration should be given to potentially extending the duration of therapy beyond 12 weeks and up to 24 weeks; \nespecially for those subgroups who have one or more factors historically associated with lower response rates to \ninterferon-based therapies (e.g. advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, high baseline viral concentrations, black race, IL28B non \nCC genotype, prior null response to peginterferon alfa and ribavirin therapy). \nc. Adults: weight-based ribavirin (<75 kg = 1,000 mg and \u226575 kg = 1,200 mg); administered orally in two divided doses with \nfood. Paediatric Patients: for ribavirin dosing recommendations see Table 3 below. \nd. See Table 2 for weight-based Sovaldi dosing recommendations for paediatric patients aged 3 years and above. \ne.

Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for Sovaldi 200 mg or 400 mg tablets. \n \nIn paediatric patients aged 3 years and above the following ribavirin dosing is recommended where \nribavirin is divided into two daily doses and given with food: \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nTable 3: Guidance for ribavirin dosing when administered in combination with Sovaldi to HCV-infected \npaediatric patients aged 3 years and above. \n\nBody weight kg Ribavirin Dose* \n< 47 15 mg/kg/day \n47-49 600 mg/day \n50-65 800 mg/day \n66-80 1000 mg/day \n> 81 1200 mg/day \n\n* The daily dosage of ribavirin is weight-based and is administered orally in two divided doses with food. \n \nConcerning co-administration with other direct-acting antivirals against HCV, see section 4.4. \n \nDose modification in adults \nDose reduction of Sovaldi is not recommended. \n \nIf sofosbuvir is used in combination with peginterferon alfa, and a patient has a serious adverse \nreaction potentially related to this medicinal product, the peginterferon alfa dose should be reduced or \ndiscontinued. Refer to the peginterferon alfa Summary of Product Characteristics for additional \ninformation about how to reduce and/or discontinue the peginterferon alfa dose. \n \nIf a patient has a serious adverse reaction potentially related to ribavirin, the ribavirin dose should be \nmodified or discontinued, if appropriate, until the adverse reaction abates or decreases in severity. \nTable 4 provides guidelines for dose modifications and discontinuation based on the patient\u2019s \nhaemoglobin concentration and cardiac status. \n \nTable 4: Ribavirin dose modification guideline for co-administration with Sovaldi in adults \n\nLaboratory values Reduce ribavirin dose to \n600 mg/day if: \n\nDiscontinue ribavirin if: \n\nHaemoglobin in patients with no \ncardiac disease \n\n<10 g/dL <8.5 g/dL \n\nHaemoglobin in patients with history \nof stable cardiac disease \n\n\u22652 g/dL decrease in haemoglobin \nduring any 4 week treatment \nperiod \n\n<12 g/dL despite 4 weeks at \nreduced dose \n\n \nOnce ribavirin has been withheld due to either a laboratory abnormality or clinical manifestation, an \nattempt may be made to restart ribavirin at 600 mg daily and further increase the dose to 800 mg daily.  \nHowever, it is not recommended that ribavirin be increased to the original assigned dose (1,000 mg to \n1,200 mg daily). \n \nDose modification in paediatric patients aged 3 years and above  \nDose reduction of Sovaldi is not recommended. \n \nIf a patient has a serious adverse reaction potentially related to ribavirin, the ribavirin dose should be \nmodified or discontinued, if appropriate, until the adverse reaction abates or decreases in severity. \nRefer to the ribavirin prescribing information for guidance on dose modification or discontinuation. \n \nDiscontinuation of dosing  \nIf the other medicinal products used in combination with Sovaldi are permanently discontinued, \nSovaldi should also be discontinued (see section 4.4). \n \nVomiting and missed doses \nPatients should be instructed that if vomiting occurs within 2 hours of dosing an additional dose \nshould be taken. If vomiting occurs more than 2 hours after dosing, no further dose is needed. These \nrecommendations are based on the absorption kinetics of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 suggesting that \nthe majority of the dose is absorbed within 2 hours after dosing. \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nIf a dose is missed and it is within 18 hours of the normal time, patients should be instructed to take \nthe dose as soon as possible and then patients should take the next dose at the usual time. If it is after \n18 hours then patients should be instructed to wait and take the next dose at the usual time. Patients \nshould be instructed not to take a double dose. \n \nSpecial patient populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is warranted for elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Sovaldi is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.   \n \nSafety data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate \n[eGFR] <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis. Sovaldi \ncan be used in these patients with no dose adjustment when no other relevant treatment options are \navailable (see section 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Sovaldi is required for patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh-Turcotte [CPT] class A, B or C) (see section 5.2). The safety and efficacy of \nSovaldi have not been established in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. \n \nPatients awaiting liver transplantation \nThe duration of administration of Sovaldi in patients awaiting liver transplantation should be guided \nby an assessment of the potential benefits and risks for the individual patient (see section 5.1). \n \nAdult liver transplant recipients \nSovaldi in combination with ribavirin is recommended for 24 weeks in liver transplant recipients. In \nadults a starting ribavirin dose of 400 mg administered orally in two divided doses with food is \nrecommended. If the starting dose of ribavirin is well-tolerated, the dose can be titrated up to a \nmaximum of 1,000-1,200 mg daily (1,000 mg for patients weighing <75 kg and 1,200 mg for patients \nweighing \u226575 kg). If the starting dose of ribavirin is not well-tolerated, the dose should be reduced as \nclinically indicated based on haemoglobin levels (see section 5.1). \n \nPaediatric population aged < 3 years \nThe safety and efficacy of Sovaldi in children aged <3 years have not yet been established. No data are \navailable. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. \n \nSovaldi must be taken shortly before food, shortly after food, or with food. \n \nTo help with swallowing of the Sovaldi oral granules you can use food or water as detailed below. \nAlternatively, Sovaldi can be swallowed without food or water. \n \nTaking Sovaldi granules with food to aid swallowing \nTo administer with food to aid swallowability of the granules, patients should be instructed to sprinkle \nthe granules on one or more spoonfuls of non-acidic soft food at or below room temperature. Patients \nshould be instructed to take the Sovaldi granules within 30 minutes of gently mixing with food and to \nswallow the entire contents without chewing to avoid a bitter taste. Examples of non-acidic foods \ninclude chocolate syrup, mashed potato, and ice-cream.  \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nTaking Sovaldi granules with water to aid swallowing \nTo administer with water, patients should be instructed that the granules can be taken directly into the \nmouth and swallowed with water.  \n \nTaking Sovaldi granules without food or water \nTo administer without food or water, patients should be instructed that the granules can be taken \ndirectly into the mouth and swallowed. Patients should be instructed to swallow the entire contents \nwithout chewing (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nMedicinal products that are strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inducers in the intestine (carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin and St. John\u2019s wort). Co-administration will significantly \ndecrease sofosbuvir plasma concentration and could result in loss of efficacy of Sovaldi (see \nsection 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \n \nSovaldi is not recommended for administration as monotherapy and should be prescribed in \ncombination with other medicinal products for the treatment of hepatitis C infection. If the other \nmedicinal products used in combination with Sovaldi are permanently discontinued, Sovaldi should \nalso be discontinued (see section 4.2). Consult the Summary of Product Characteristics for \nco-prescribed medicinal products before starting therapy with Sovaldi. \n \nSevere bradycardia and heart block \n \nLife-threatening cases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when sofosbuvir-\ncontaining regimens are used in combination with amiodarone. Bradycardia has generally occurred \nwithin hours to days, but cases with a longer time to onset have been observed mostly up to 2 weeks \nafter initiating HCV treatment. \n \nAmiodarone should only be used in patients on Sovaldi when other alternative anti-arrhythmic \ntreatments are not tolerated or are contraindicated. \n \nShould concomitant use of amiodarone be considered necessary it is recommended that patients \nundergo cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration, after \nwhich outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the \nfirst 2 weeks of treatment. \n \nDue to the long half-life of amiodarone, cardiac monitoring as outlined above should also be carried \nout for patients who have discontinued amiodarone within the past few months and are to be initiated \non Sovaldi. \n \nAll patients with concurrent or recent use of amiodarone should be warned of the symptoms of \nbradycardia and heart block and should be advised to seek medical advice urgently should they \nexperience them. \n \nHCV/HBV (hepatitis B virus) co-infection \n \nCases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after \ntreatment with direct-acting antiviral agents. HBV screening should be performed in all patients before \ninitiation of treatment.  HBV/HCV co-infected patients are at risk of HBV reactivation, and should \ntherefore be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines. \n\n\n\n37 \n\nTreatment-experienced patients with genotype 1, 4, 5 and 6 HCV infection \n \nSovaldi has not been studied in a Phase 3 study in treatment-experienced patients with genotype 1, 4, 5 \nand 6 HCV infection. Thus, the optimal treatment duration in this population has not been established \n(see also sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \nConsideration should be given to treating these patients, and potentially extending the duration of \ntherapy with sofosbuvir, peginterferon alfa and ribavirin beyond 12 weeks and up to 24 weeks; \nespecially for those subgroups who have one or more factors historically associated with lower \nresponse rates to interferon-based therapies (advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, high baseline viral \nconcentrations, black race, IL28B non CC genotype). \n \nTreatment of patients with genotype 5 or 6 HCV infection \n \nThe clinical data to support the use of Sovaldi in patients with genotype 5 and 6 HCV infection is very \nlimited (see section 5.1). \n \nInterferon-free therapy for genotype 1, 4, 5 and 6 HCV infection \n \nInterferon-free regimens for patients with genotype 1, 4, 5 and 6 HCV infection with Sovaldi have not \nbeen investigated in Phase 3 studies (see section 5.1). The optimal regimen and treatment duration \nhave not been established. Such regimens should only be used for patients that are intolerant to or \nineligible for interferon therapy, and are in urgent need of treatment. \n \nCo-administration with other direct-acting antivirals against HCV \n \nSovaldi should only be co-administered with other direct-acting antiviral medicinal products if the \nbenefit is considered to outweigh the risks based upon available data. There are no data to support the \nco-administration of Sovaldi and telaprevir or boceprevir. Such co-administration is not recommended \n(see also section 4.5). \n \nPregnancy and concomitant use with ribavirin \n \nWhen Sovaldi is used in combination with ribavirin or peginterferon alfa/ribavirin, women of \nchildbearing potential or their male partners must use an effective form of contraception during the \ntreatment and for a period of time after the treatment as recommended in the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for ribavirin. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for \nadditional information. \n \nUse with moderate P-gp inducers \n \nMedicinal products that are moderate P-gp inducers in the intestine (e.g. modafinil, oxcarbazepine and \nrifapentine) may decrease sofosbuvir plasma concentration leading to reduced therapeutic effect of \nSovaldi. Co-administration of such medicinal products is not recommended with Sovaldi (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nUse in diabetic patients  \n \nDiabetics may experience improved glucose control, potentially resulting in symptomatic \nhypoglycaemia, after initiating HCV direct-acting antiviral treatment. Glucose levels of diabetic \npatients initiating direct-acting antiviral therapy should be closely monitored, particularly within the \nfirst 3 months, and their diabetic medication modified when necessary. The physician in charge of the \ndiabetic care of the patient should be informed when direct-acting antiviral therapy is initiated. \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nRenal impairment \n \nSafety data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and \nESRD requiring haemodialysis. Sovaldi can be used in these patients with no dose adjustment when \nno other relevant treatment options are available (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). When Sovaldi is used \nin combination with ribavirin or peginterferon alfa/ribavirin, refer also to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for ribavirin for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) <50 mL/min (see also \nsection 5.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nSofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug. After oral administration of Sovaldi, sofosbuvir is rapidly \nabsorbed and subject to extensive first-pass hepatic and intestinal metabolism.  Intracellular hydrolytic \nprodrug cleavage catalysed by enzymes including carboxylesterase 1 and sequential phosphorylation \nsteps catalysed by nucleotide kinases result in formation of the pharmacologically active uridine \nnucleoside analogue triphosphate. The predominant inactive circulating metabolite GS-331007 that \naccounts for greater than 90% of drug-related material systemic exposure is formed through pathways \nsequential and parallel to formation of active metabolite. The parent sofosbuvir accounts for \napproximately 4% of drug-related material systemic exposure (see section 5.2). In clinical \npharmacology studies, both sofosbuvir and GS-331007 were monitored for purposes of \npharmacokinetic analyses. \n \nSofosbuvir is a substrate of drug transporter P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) while \nGS-331007 is not. \n \nMedicinal products that are strong P-gp inducers in the intestine (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, \nphenytoin, rifampicin and St. John\u2019s wort) may significantly decrease sofosbuvir plasma concentration \nleading to reduced therapeutic effect of Sovaldi and thus are contraindicated with Sovaldi (see \nsection 4.3). Medicinal products that are moderate P-gp inducers in the intestine (e.g. modafinil, \noxcarbazepine and rifapentine) may decrease sofosbuvir plasma concentration leading to reduced \ntherapeutic effect of Sovaldi. Co-administration with such medicinal products is not recommended \nwith Sovaldi (see section 4.4). Co-administration of Sovaldi with medicinal products that inhibit P-gp \nand/or BCRP may increase sofosbuvir plasma concentration without increasing GS-331007 plasma \nconcentration, thus Sovaldi may be co-administered with P-gp and/or BCRP inhibitors. Sofosbuvir and \nGS-331007 are not inhibitors of P-gp and BCRP and thus are not expected to increase exposures of \nmedicinal products that are substrates of these transporters. \n \nThe intracellular metabolic activation pathway of sofosbuvir is mediated by generally low affinity and \nhigh capacity hydrolase and nucleotide phosphorylation pathways that are unlikely to be affected by \nconcomitant medicinal products (see section 5.2). \n \nPatients treated with vitamin K antagonists \n \nAs liver function may change during treatment with Sovaldi, a close monitoring of International \nNormalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended. \n \nImpact of DAA therapy on drugs metabolized by the liver \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of drugs that are metabolized by the liver (e.g. immunosuppressive agents such \nas calcineurin inhibitors) may be impacted by changes in liver function during DAA therapy, related to \nclearance of HCV. \n \nOther interactions \n \nDrug interaction information for Sovaldi with potential concomitant medicinal products is summarised \nin Table 5 below (where 90% confidence interval (CI) of the geometric least-squares mean (GLSM) \n\n\n\n39 \n\nratio were within \u201c\u2194\u201d, extended above \u201c\u2191\u201d, or extended below \u201c\u2193\u201d the predetermined equivalence \nboundaries).

Significant \nteratogenic and/or embryocidal effects have been demonstrated in all animal species exposed to \nribavirin (see section 4.4). Women of childbearing potential or their male partners must use an \neffective form of contraception during treatment and for a period of time after the treatment has \nconcluded as recommended in the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin. Refer to the \nSummary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for additional information. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of sofosbuvir \nin pregnant women. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. \nNo effects on foetal development have been observed in rats and rabbits at the highest doses tested. \nHowever, it has not been possible to fully estimate exposure margins achieved for sofosbuvir in the rat \nrelative to the exposure in humans at the recommended clinical dose (see section 5.3). \n \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Sovaldi during pregnancy. \n \nHowever, if ribavirin is co-administered with sofosbuvir, the contraindications regarding use of \nribavirin during pregnancy apply (see also the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether sofosbuvir and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. \n \nAvailable pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of metabolites in milk (for details \nsee section 5.3). \n \nA risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  Therefore, Sovaldi should not be used during \nbreast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of Sovaldi on fertility are available.  Animal studies do not indicate \nharmful effects on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSovaldi has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be informed \nthat fatigue and disturbance in attention, dizziness and blurred vision have been reported during \ntreatment with sofosbuvir in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile in adults \n \nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on pooled data from five Phase 3 clinical studies (both \ncontrolled and uncontrolled). \n \nSovaldi has been studied in combination with ribavirin, with or without peginterferon alfa. In this \ncontext, no adverse drug reactions specific to sofosbuvir have been identified. The most common \n\n\n\n45 \n\nadverse drug reactions occurring in patients receiving sofosbuvir and ribavirin or sofosbuvir, ribavirin \nand peginterferon alfa were fatigue, headache, nausea and insomnia. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse drug reactions have been identified with sofosbuvir in combination with \nribavirin or in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin (Table 6). The adverse reactions are \nlisted below by body system organ class and frequency.  Frequencies are defined as follows: very \ncommon (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to \n<1/1,000) or very rare (<1/10,000). \n \nTable 6: Adverse drug reactions identified with sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin or \npeginterferon alfa and ribavirin \nFrequency SOFa + RBVb SOF + PEGc + RBV \nInfections and infestations: \nCommon nasopharyngitis  \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders: \n\nVery common haemoglobin decreased anaemia, neutropenia, lymphocyte count decreased, platelet count decreased \nCommon anaemia  \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: \nVery common decreased appetited decreased appetite \nCommon  weight decreased \nPsychiatric disorders: \nVery common insomnia insomnia \nCommon depression depression, anxiety, agitation \nNervous system disorders: \nVery common headache dizziness, headache \n\nCommon disturbance in attention migraine, memory impairment, disturbance in attention \nEye disorders: \nCommon  vision blurred \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: \nVery common  dyspnoea, cough \nCommon dyspnoea, dyspnoea exertional, cough dyspnoea exertional \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nVery common nausea diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting \n\nCommon abdominal discomfort, constipation, dyspepsia \nconstipation, dry mouth, gastroesophageal \nreflux \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: \nVery common blood bilirubin increased blood bilirubin increased \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nVery common  rash, pruritus \nCommon alopecia, dry skin, pruritus alopecia, dry skin \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \nVery common  arthralgia, myalgia \n\nCommon arthralgia, back pain, muscle spasms, myalgia back pain, muscle spasms \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \n\nVery common fatigue, irritability chills, fatigue, influenza-like illness, irritability, pain, pyrexia \nCommon pyrexia, asthenia chest pain, asthenia \na.

Decreased appetite was identified as an adverse drug \nreaction to Sovaldi in combination with ribavirin oral solution in paediatric patients aged 3 to < 12 years \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nCardiac arrhythmias \nCases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when sofosbuvir containing-regimes \nare used in combination with amiodarone and/or other medicinal products that lower heart rate (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nSkin disorders \nFrequency not known: Stevens-Johnson syndrome \n \nOther special population(s) \n \nHIV/HCV co-infection \nThe safety profile of sofosbuvir and ribavirin in HCV/HIV co-infected adult patients was similar to \nthat observed in mono-infected HCV patients treated with sofosbuvir and ribavirin in Phase 3 clinical \nstudies (see section 5.1). \n \nPatients awaiting liver transplantation \nThe safety profile of sofosbuvir and ribavirin in HCV infected adult patients prior to liver \ntransplantation was similar to that observed in patients treated with sofosbuvir and ribavirin in Phase 3 \nclinical studies (see section 5.1). \n \nPatients with Renal Impairment  \nSofosbuvir in a fixed dose combination with ledipasvir was administered for 12 weeks to 18 patients \nwith genotype 1 CHC and severe renal impairment in an open-label study (Study 0154). The safety of \nsofosbuvir in a fixed dose combination with either ledipasvir or velpatasvir has been studied in 154 \npatients with ESRD requiring dialysis (Study 4062 and Study 4063). In this setting, exposure of \nsofosbuvir metabolite GS-331007 is 20-fold increased, exceeding levels where adverse reactions have \nbeen observed in preclinical trials. In this limited clinical safety data set, the rate of adverse events and \ndeaths was not clearly elevated from what is expected in ESRD patients. \n \nAdult liver transplant recipients \nThe safety profile of sofosbuvir and ribavirin in liver transplant adult recipients with chronic \nhepatitis C was similar to that observed in patients treated with sofosbuvir and ribavirin in Phase 3 \nclinical studies (see section 5.1). In study 0126, decreases in haemoglobin during treatment were very \ncommon with 32.5% (13/40 patients) experiencing a decline in haemoglobin to <10 g/dL, 1 of whom \nalso had a decline to <8.5 g/dL. Eight patients (20%) received epoetin and/or a blood product.  In \n5 patients (12.5%), study drugs were discontinued, modified or interrupted due to adverse events. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Sovaldi in paediatric patients aged 3 years and above are based on data \nfrom 106 patients who were treated with Sovaldi and ribavirin for 12 weeks (genotype 2 patients) and \nfor 24 weeks (genotype 3 patients) in a Phase 2, open-label clinical trial. No adverse drug reactions \nspecific to Sovaldi have been identified. The adverse reactions observed were generally consistent \nwith those observed in clinical studies of Sovaldi plus ribavirin in adults (see Table 6). Decreased \nappetite was observed as a very common adverse drug reaction to Sovaldi when given in combination \nwith ribavirin oral solution in paediatric patients 3 to < 12 years. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n47 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe highest documented dose of sofosbuvir was a single supratherapeutic dose of sofosbuvir 1,200 mg \nadministered to 59 healthy subjects. In that study, there were no untoward effects observed at this dose \nlevel, and adverse reactions were similar in frequency and severity to those reported in the placebo and \nsofosbuvir 400 mg treatment groups. The effects of higher doses are unknown. \n \nNo specific antidote is available for overdose with Sovaldi.  If overdose occurs the patient must be \nmonitored for evidence of toxicity. Treatment of overdose with Sovaldi consists of general supportive \nmeasures including monitoring of vital signs as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient.  \nHaemodialysis can efficiently remove (53% extraction ratio) the predominant circulating metabolite \nGS-331007. A 4-hour haemodialysis session removed 18% of the administered dose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, direct-acting antiviral; ATC code: J05AP08 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nSofosbuvir is a pan-genotypic inhibitor of the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is \nessential for viral replication. Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug that undergoes intracellular \nmetabolism to form the pharmacologically active uridine analog triphosphate (GS-461203), which can \nbe incorporated into HCV RNA by the NS5B polymerase and acts as a chain terminator. In a \nbiochemical assay, GS-461203 inhibited the polymerase activity of the recombinant NS5B from HCV \ngenotype 1b, 2a, 3a and 4a with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value ranging from 0.7 to \n2.6 \u03bcM.  GS-461203 (the active metabolite of sofosbuvir) is not an inhibitor of human DNA and \nRNA polymerases nor an inhibitor of mitochondrial RNA polymerase. \n \nAntiviral activity \n \nIn HCV replicon assays, the effective concentration (EC50) values of sofosbuvir against full-length \nreplicons from genotype 1a, 1b, 2a, 3a and 4a were 0.04, 0.11, 0.05, 0.05 and 0.04 \u03bcM, respectively, \nand EC50 values of sofosbuvir against chimeric 1b replicons encoding NS5B from genotype 2b, 5a or \n6a were 0.014 to 0.015 \u03bcM. The mean \u00b1 SD EC50 of sofosbuvir against chimeric replicons encoding \nNS5B sequences from clinical isolates was 0.068 \u00b1 0.024 \u03bcM for genotype 1a (n = 67), \n0.11 \u00b1 0.029 \u03bcM for genotype 1b (n = 29), 0.035 \u00b1 0.018 \u03bcM for genotype 2 (n = 15) and \n0.085 \u00b1 0.034 \u03bcM for genotype 3a (n = 106). In these assays, the in vitro antiviral activity of \nsofosbuvir against the less common genotypes 4, 5 and 6 was similar to that observed for genotypes 1, \n2 and 3. \n \nThe presence of 40% human serum had no effect on the anti-HCV activity of sofosbuvir. \n \nResistance \n \nIn cell culture \nHCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir have been selected in cell culture for multiple \ngenotypes including 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 5a and 6a. Reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir was associated \nwith the primary NS5B substitution S282T in all replicon genotypes examined.  Site-directed \nmutagenesis of the S282T substitution in replicons of 8 genotypes conferred 2- to 18-fold reduced \nsusceptibility to sofosbuvir and reduced the replication viral capacity by 89% to 99% compared to the \ncorresponding wild-type. In biochemical assays, recombinant NS5B polymerase from genotypes 1b, \n2a, 3a and 4a expressing the S282T substitution showed reduced susceptibility to GS-461203 \ncompared to respective wild-types. \n \n\n\n\n48 \n\nIn clinical studies - Adults \nIn a pooled analysis of 991 patients who received sofosbuvir in Phase 3 studies, 226 patients qualified \nfor resistance analysis due to virologic failure or early study drug discontinuation and having \nHCV RNA >1,000 IU/mL. Post-baseline NS5B sequences were available for 225 of the 226 patients, \nwith deep sequencing data (assay cutoff of 1%) from 221 of these patients. The sofosbuvir-associated \nresistance substitution S282T was not detected in any of these patients by deep sequencing or \npopulation sequencing. The S282T substitution in NS5B was detected in a single subject receiving \nSovaldi monotherapy in a Phase 2 study. This subject harboured <1% HCV S282T at baseline and \ndeveloped S282T (>99%) at 4 weeks post-treatment which resulted in a 13.5-fold change in sofosbuvir \nEC50 and reduced viral replication capacity. The S282T substitution reverted to wild-type over the next \n8 weeks and was no longer detectable by deep sequencing at 12 weeks post-treatment. \n \nTwo NS5B substitutions, L159F and V321A, were detected in post-treatment relapse samples from \nmultiple genotype 3 HCV infected patients in the Phase 3 clinical studies. No shift in the phenotypic \nsusceptibility to sofosbuvir or ribavirin of subject isolates with these substitutions was detected.  In \naddition, S282R and L320F substitutions were detected on treatment by deep sequencing in a \npre-transplant subject with a partial treatment response. The clinical significance of these findings is \nunknown. \n \nEffect of baseline HCV polymorphisms on treatment outcome \n \nAdult population \nBaseline NS5B sequences were obtained for 1,292 patients from Phase 3 studies by population \nsequencing and the S282T substitution was not detected in any subject with available baseline \nsequence. In an analysis evaluating the effect of baseline polymorphisms on treatment outcome, no \nstatistically significant association was observed between the presence of any HCV NS5B variant at \nbaseline and treatment outcome. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe presence of NS5B RAVs did not impact treatment outcome; all patients with baseline NS5B \nnucleoside inhibitor RAVs achieved SVR following treatment with sofosbuvir.  \n \nCross-resistance \n \nHCV replicons expressing the sofosbuvir-associated resistance substitution S282T were fully \nsusceptible to other classes of anti-HCV agents. Sofosbuvir retained activity against the \nNS5B substitutions L159F and L320F associated with resistance to other nucleoside inhibitors.  \nSofosbuvir was fully active against substitutions associated with resistance to other direct-acting \nantivirals with different mechanisms of actions, such as NS5B non-nucleoside inhibitors, NS3 protease \ninhibitors and NS5A inhibitors. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy of sofosbuvir was evaluated in five Phase 3 studies in a total of 1,568 adult patients with \ngenotypes 1 to 6 chronic hepatitis C.  One study was conducted in treatment-na\u00efve patients with \ngenotype 1, 4, 5 or 6 chronic hepatitis C in combination with peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin and \nthe other four studies were conducted in patients with genotype 2 or 3 chronic hepatitis C in \ncombination with ribavirin including one in treatment-na\u00efve patients, one in interferon intolerant, \nineligible or unwilling patients, one in patients previously treated with an interferon-based regimen, \nand one in all patients irrespective of prior treatment history or ability to receive treatment with \ninterferon. Patients in these studies had compensated liver disease including cirrhosis. Sofosbuvir was \nadministered at a dose of 400 mg once daily. The ribavirin dose was weight-based at 1,000-1,200 mg \ndaily administered in two divided doses, and the peginterferon alfa 2a dose, where applicable, was \n180 \u03bcg per week. Treatment duration was fixed in each study and was not guided by patients\u2019 \nHCV RNA levels (no response guided algorithm). \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nPlasma HCV RNA values were measured during the clinical studies using the COBAS TaqMan \nHCV test (version 2.0), for use with the High Pure System. The assay had a lower limit of \nquantification (LLOQ) of 25 IU/mL. Sustained virologic response (SVR) was the primary endpoint to \ndetermine the HCV cure rate for all studies which was defined as HCV RNA less than LLOQ at \n12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12). \n \nClinical studies in patients with genotype 1, 4, 5 and 6 chronic hepatitis C \nTreatment-na\u00efve adult patients - NEUTRINO (study 110) \nNEUTRINO was an open-label, single-arm study that evaluated 12 weeks of treatment with sofosbuvir \nin combination with peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin in treatment-na\u00efve patients with genotype 1, 4, \n5 or 6 HCV infection. \n \nTreated patients (n = 327) had a median age of 54 years (range: 19 to 70); 64% of the patients were \nmale; 79% were White; 17% were Black; 14% were Hispanic or Latino; mean body mass index was \n29 kg/m2 (range: 18 to 56 kg/m2); 78% had baseline HCV RNA greater than 6 log10 IU/mL; 17% had \ncirrhosis; 89% had HCV genotype 1 and 11% had HCV genotype 4, 5 or 6.

Following treatment with sofosbuvir 200 mg or \n400 mg in combination with ribavirin the SVR12 rate in patients with ESRD was 40% and 60%, \nrespectively. The safety and efficacy of 12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in 18 \ngenotype 1 HCV-infected patients with severe renal impairment not requiring dialysis was also studied \nin Study 0154. At baseline, two patients had cirrhosis and the mean eGFR was 24.9 mL/min (range: \n9.0-39.6).  SVR12 was achieved in 100 % (18/18) of patients treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir.  \n \nStudy 4063 was an open-label study that evaluated a fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir and \nledipasvir in 95 patients with HCV-infection and ESRD requiring dialysis. The SVR rates for the 8, \n12, and 24 week ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment groups were 93% (42/45), 100% (31/31), and 79% \n(15/19), respectively. Of the seven patients who did not achieve SVR12, none experienced virologic \nfailure or relapsed. \n \nStudy 4062 was an open-label study that evaluated a fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir and \nvelpatasvir in 59 HCV-infected patients with ESRD requiring dialysis. The SVR rate was 95% \n(56/59); of the three patients that did not achieve SVR12, one had completed sofosbuvir with \nvelpatasvir treatment and relapsed.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe efficacy of sofosbuvir in HCV-infected patients aged 3years and above was evaluated in a \nPhase 2, open label clinical trial that enrolled 106 patients with genotype 2 (n = 31) or genotype 3 \n(n = 75) chronic HCV infection.  Patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection in the trial were treated \nwith sofosbuvir with ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks, respectively. \n \nPatients aged 12 to < 18 Years: \nSofosbuvir was evaluated in 52 patients 12 to < 18 years with genotype 2 (n = 13) or genotype 3 (n = \n39) HCV infection. The median age was 15 years (range: 12 to 17); 40% of the patients were female; \n90% were White, 4% were Black, and 2% were Asian; 4% were Hispanic/Latino; mean weight was \n60.4 kg (range: 29.6 to 75.6 kg); 17% were treatment experienced; 65% had baseline HCV RNA \nlevels greater than or equal to 800,000 IU/mL; and no patients had known cirrhosis.  The majority of \npatients (69%) had been infected through vertical transmission. \n \nThe SVR12 rate was 98% overall (100% [13/13] in genotype 2 patients and 97% [38/39]) in \ngenotype 3 patients. No patient experienced on-treatment virologic failure or relapse; one patient with \ngenotype 3 HCV infection achieved SVR4 but did not return for the SVR12 visit. \n \nPatients aged 6 to < 12 Years:  \nSofosbuvir was evaluated in 41 patients 6 to < 12 years of age with genotype 2 (n = 13), or genotype 3 \n(n = 28) HCV infection. The median age was 9 years (range: 6 to 11); 73% of the patients were \nfemale; 71% were White and 20% were Asian; 15% were Hispanic/Latino; mean weight was 33.7 kg \n(range: 15.1 to 80.0 kg); 98% were treatment naive; 46% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than \nor equal to 800,000 IU /mL; and no patients had known cirrhosis. The majority of patients (98%) had \nbeen infected through vertical transmission. \n \nThe SVR12 rate was 100% (100% [13/13] in genotype 2 patients and 100% [28/28] in genotype 3 \npatients). No patients experienced on-treatment virologic failure or relapse. \n \nPatients aged 3 to < 6 Years:  \nSofosbuvir was evaluated in 13 patients 3 to < 6 years with genotype 2 (n = 5) or genotype 3 (n = 8) \nHCV infection. The median age was 4 years (range: 3 to 5); 77% of the patients were female; 69% \nwere White, 8% were Black, and 8% were Asian; 8% were Hispanic/Latino; mean weight was 16.8 kg \n(range: 13.0 to 19.2 kg); 100% were treatment naive; 23% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than \nor equal to 800,000 IU/mL; and no patients had known cirrhosis. The majority of patients (85%) had \nbeen infected through vertical transmission. \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \nThe SVR12 rate was 92% overall (80% [4/5] in genotype 2 patients and 100% [8/8] in genotype 3 \npatients). No patients experienced on-treatment virologic failure or relapse; one patient with \ngenotype 2 HCV prematurely discontinued study treatment after three days due to abnormal taste of \nthe medication and did not return for post-treatment Week 12. \n \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nSofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug that is extensively metabolised.  The active metabolite is formed in \nhepatocytes and not observed in plasma. The predominant (>90%) metabolite, GS-331007, is inactive. \nIt is formed through sequential and parallel pathways to the formation of active metabolite. \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of sofosbuvir and the predominant circulating metabolite GS-331007 \nhave been evaluated in healthy adult subjects and in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Following oral \nadministration, sofosbuvir was absorbed quickly and the peak plasma concentration was observed \n~0.5-2 hour post-dose, regardless of dose level. Peak plasma concentration of GS-331007 was \nobserved between 2 to 4 hours post-dose. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients \nwith genotypes 1 to 6 HCV infection (n = 986), steady-state AUC0-24 for sofosbuvir and GS-331007 \nwas 1,010 ng\u2022h/mL and 7,200 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. Relative to healthy subjects (n = 284), the \nsofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUC0-24 was 57% higher and 39% lower, respectively in HCV infected \npatients. \n \nEffects of food \nRelative to fasting conditions, the administration of a single dose of sofosbuvir with a standardised \nhigh fat meal slowed the rate of absorption of sofosbuvir. The extent of absorption of sofosbuvir was \nincreased approximately 1.8-fold, with little effect on peak concentration. The exposure to GS-331007 \nwas not altered in the presence of a high-fat meal. \n \nDistribution \n \nSofosbuvir is not a substrate for hepatic uptake transporters, organic anion-transporting polypeptide \n(OATP) 1B1 or 1B3, and organic cation transporter (OCT) 1. While subject to active tubular secretion, \nGS-331007 is not a substrate for renal transporters including organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 or 3, \nOCT2, MRP2, P-gp, BCRP or MATE1.  Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 are not inhibitors of drug \ntransporters P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, BSEP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OCT1.  GS-331007 is not an \ninhibitor of OAT1, OCT2, and MATE1. \n \nSofosbuvir is approximately 85% bound to human plasma proteins (ex vivo data) and the binding is \nindependent of drug concentration over the range of 1 \u03bcg/mL to 20 \u03bcg/mL.  Protein binding of \nGS-331007 was minimal in human plasma. After a single 400 mg dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir in healthy \nsubjects, the blood to plasma ratio of 14C-radioactivity was approximately 0.7. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nSofosbuvir is extensively metabolised in the liver to form the pharmacologically active nucleoside \nanalog triphosphate GS-461203. The metabolic activation pathway involves sequential hydrolysis of \nthe carboxyl ester moiety catalysed by human cathepsin A (CatA) or carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) and \nphosphoramidate cleavage by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) followed by \nphosphorylation by the pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway. Dephosphorylation results in the \nformation of nucleoside metabolite GS-331007 that cannot be efficiently rephosphorylated and lacks \nanti-HCV activity in vitro.  Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 are not substrates or inhibitors of UGT1A1 or \nCYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 enzymes. \n \n\n\n\n59 \n\nAfter a single 400 mg oral dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir and GS-331007 accounted for \napproximately 4% and >90% of drug-related material (sum of molecular weight-adjusted AUC of \nsofosbuvir and its metabolites) systemic exposure, respectively. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing a single 400 mg oral dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir, mean total recovery of the dose was greater \nthan 92%, consisting of approximately 80%, 14%, and 2.5% recovered in urine, faeces, and expired \nair, respectively. The majority of the sofosbuvir dose recovered in urine was GS-331007 (78%) while \n3.5% was recovered as sofosbuvir. This data indicate that renal clearance is the major elimination \npathway for GS-331007 with a large part actively secreted. The median terminal half-lives of \nsofosbuvir and GS-331007 were 0.4 and 27 hours respectively. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nThe dose linearity of sofosbuvir and its primary metabolite, GS-331007, was evaluated in fasted \nhealthy subjects. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUCs are near dose proportional over the dose range of \n200 mg to 400 mg. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nGender and race \nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to gender or race have been identified for \nsofosbuvir and GS-331007. \n \nElderly \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV infected patients showed that within the age range \n(19 to 75 years) analysed, age did not have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure to sofosbuvir \nand GS-331007. Clinical studies of sofosbuvir included 65 patients aged 65 and over.  The response \nrates observed for patients over 65 years of age were similar to that of younger patients across \ntreatment groups. \n \nRenal impairment \nA summary of the effect of varying degrees of renal impairment (RI) on the exposures of sofosbuvir \nand GS-331007 compared to subjects with normal renal function, as described in the text below, are \nprovided in Table 24.  \n \nTable 24: Effect of varying degrees of renal impairment on exposures (AUC) of sofosbuvir and \nGS-331007 compared to subjects with normal renal function \n\n HCV-Negative Subjects HCV-Infected \nSubjects \n\nMild RI \n(eGFR \u226550 \nand <80 \nmL/min/1.73\nm2) \n\nModerate RI \n(eGFR \u226530 \nand <50 \nmL/min/1.73\nm2) \n\nSevere RI \n(eGFR <30 \nmL/min/1.7\n3m2) \n\nESRD Requiring \nDialysis \n\nSevere RI \n(eGFR <30 \nmL/min/1.\n73m2) \n\nESRD \nRequiring \nDialysis Dosed 1 hr \n\nBefore \nDialysis \n\nDosed 1 hr \nAfter \nDialysis \n\nSofosbuvir 1.6-fold\u2191 2.1-fold\u2191 2.7-fold\u2191 1.3-fold\u2191 1.6-fold\u2191 ~2-fold\u2191 1.9-fold\u2191 \nGS-331007 1.6-fold\u2191 1.9-fold\u2191 5.5-fold\u2191 \u226510-fold\u2191 \u226520-fold\u2191 ~7-fold\u2191 21-fold\u2191 \n\n \nThe pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir were studied in HCV negative adult patients with mild \n(eGFR \u226550 and <80 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (eGFR \u226530 and <50 mL/min/1.73 m2), severe renal \nimpairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and patients with ESRD requiring haemodialysis following a \nsingle 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir, relative to adult patients with normal renal function \n(eGFR >80 mL/min/1.73 m2). GS-331007 is efficiently removed by haemodialysis with an extraction \ncoefficient of approximately 53%. Following a single 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir, a 4 hour \nhaemodialysis removed 18% of administered sofosbuvir dose. \n \n\n\n\n60 \n\nIn HCV-infected adult patients with severe renal impairment treated with sofosbuvir 200 mg with \nribavirin (n=10) or sofosbuvir 400 mg with ribavirin (n=10) for 24 weeks or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir \n90/400 mg (n=18) for 12 weeks, the pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 were consistent \nwith that observed in HCV negative adult patients with severe renal impairment.  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 were studied in HCV-infected adult patients with \nESRD requiring dialysis treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (n = 94) for 8, 12, or 24 weeks or \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir (n = 59) for 12 weeks, and compared to patients without renal impairment in the \nledipasvir/sofosbuvir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir Phase 2/3 trials (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir were studied following 7-day dosing of 400 mg sofosbuvir in \nadult HCV-infected patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (CPT class B and C).  \nRelative to patients with normal hepatic function, the sofosbuvir AUC0-24 was 126% and 143% higher \nin moderate and severe hepatic impairment, while the GS-331007 AUC0-24 was 18% and 9% higher, \nrespectively. Population pharmacokinetics analysis in adult HCV-infected patients indicated that \ncirrhosis had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure to sofosbuvir and GS-331007. No dose \nadjustment of sofosbuvir is recommended for patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic \nimpairment (see section 4.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nSofosbuvir and GS-331007 exposures in paediatric patients aged 3 years and above were similar to \nthose in adults from Phase 2/3 studies following administration of sofosbuvir.   \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 have not been established in paediatric patients \naged < 3 years (see section 4.2). \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) \n \nEfficacy, in terms of rapid virologic response, has been shown to correlate with exposure to sofosbuvir \nas well as GS 331007. However, neither of these entities has been evidenced to be a general surrogate \nmarker for efficacy (SVR12) at the therapeutic 400 mg dose. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn repeat dose toxicology studies in rat and dog, high doses of the 1:1 diastereomeric mixture caused \nadverse liver (dog) and heart (rat) effects and gastrointestinal reactions (dog). Exposure to sofosbuvir \nin rodent studies could not be detected likely due to high esterase activity; however, exposure to the \nmajor metabolite GS-331007 at the adverse dose was 29 times (rat) and 123 times (dog) higher than \nthe clinical exposure at 400 mg sofosbuvir. No liver or heart findings were observed in chronic \ntoxicity studies at exposures 9 times (rat) and 27 times (dog) higher than the clinical exposure. \n \nSofosbuvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial \nmutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo mouse \nmicronucleus assays. \n \nCarcinogenicity studies in mice and rats do not indicate any carcinogenicity potential of sofosbuvir \nadministered at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in mouse and 750 mg/kg/day in rat. Exposure to \nGS-331007 in these studies was up to 30 times (mouse) and 15 times (rat) higher than the clinical \nexposure at 400 mg sofosbuvir. \n \nSofosbuvir had no effects on embryo-foetal viability or on fertility in rat and was not teratogenic in rat \nand rabbit development studies. No adverse effects on behaviour, reproduction or development of \noffspring in rat were reported. In rabbit studies exposure to sofosbuvir was 9 times the expected \nclinical exposure. In the rat studies, exposure to sofosbuvir could not be determined but exposure \nmargins based on the major human metabolite ranged from 8 to 28 times higher than the clinical \nexposure at 400 mg sofosbuvir. \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \nSofosbuvir-derived material was transferred through the placenta in pregnant rats and into the milk of \nlactating rats. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n\u2022 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\u2022 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\u2022 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\u2022 If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Sovaldi is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Sovaldi \n3. How to take Sovaldi \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Sovaldi \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \nIf Sovaldi has been prescribed for your child, please note that all the information in this leaflet is \napplicable to your child (in this case please read \u201cyour child\u201d instead of \u201cyou\u201d). \n \n1. What Sovaldi is and what it is used for \n \nSovaldi contains the active substance sofosbuvir which is given to treat hepatitis C virus infection in \nadults and children 3 years of age and older. \n \nHepatitis C is a virus that infects the liver. This medicine works by lowering the amount of hepatitis C \nvirus in your body and removing the virus from your blood over a period of time. \n \nSovaldi is always taken with other medicines to treat hepatitis C. It will not work on its own. It is \ncommonly taken with either: \n \n\u2022 Ribavirin (children and adult patients), or \n\u2022 Peginterferon alfa and ribavirin (adult patients) \n \nIt is very important that you also read the leaflets for the other medicines that you will be taking with \nSovaldi. If you have any questions about your medicines, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Sovaldi \n \nDo not take Sovaldi \n\u2022 If you are allergic to sofosbuvir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6 of this leaflet). \n \n\u2022 If you are currently taking any of the following medicines: \n\n\u2022 Rifampicin (antibiotic used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); \n\n\n\n79 \n\n\u2022 St. John\u2019s wort (herbal medicine used to treat depression); \n\u2022 Carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (medicines used to treat epilepsy and \n\nprevent seizures). \n \n\uf0e0If any of these conditions apply to you, tell your doctor immediately. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nSovaldi is always taken with other medicines to treat hepatitis C (see section 1 above). Talk to your \ndoctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine if you: \n \n\u2022 currently take, or have taken in the last few months, the medicine amiodarone to treat irregular \n\nheartbeats, as it may result in a life-threatening slowing of your heart beat. Your doctor may \nconsider different treatments if you have taken this medicine. If treatment with Sovaldi is \nneeded, you may require additional heart monitoring; \n\n\u2022 have liver problems other than hepatitis C, e.g. if you are awaiting a liver transplantation; \n\u2022 have a current or previous infection with the hepatitis B virus, since your doctor may want to \n\nmonitor you more closely; \n\u2022 have diabetes. You may need closer monitoring of your blood glucose levels and/or adjustment \n\nof your diabetes medication after starting Sovaldi. Some diabetic patients have experienced low \nsugar levels in the blood (hypoglycaemia) after starting treatment with medicines like Sovaldi. \n\n \nTell your doctor immediately if you currently take, or have taken in the last months, any medicines \nfor heart problems and during treatment you experience: \n\u2022 slow or irregular heartbeat, or heart rhythm problems; \n\u2022 shortness of breath or worsening of existing shortness of breath; \n\u2022 chest-pain; \n\u2022 light-headedness; \n\u2022 palpitations \n\u2022 near fainting or fainting \n \nBlood tests \nYour doctor will test your blood before, during and after your treatment with Sovaldi. This is so your \ndoctor can: \n\u2022 Decide what other medicines you should take with Sovaldi and for how long; \n\u2022 Confirm that your treatment has worked and you are free of the hepatitis C virus. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children under 3 years of age. The use of Sovaldi in children under \n3 years of age has not yet been studied. \n \nOther medicines and Sovaldi \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  \n \nWarfarin and other similar medicines called vitamin K antagonists are used to thin the blood. Your \ndoctor may need to increase the frequency of your blood tests to check how well your blood can clot. \n \nYour liver function may change with treatment of hepatitis C and therefore may affect other \nmedications (e.g. medicines used to suppress your immune system, etc.). Your doctor may need to \nclosely monitor these other medicines you are taking and make adjustments after starting Sovaldi. \n \nTalk to your doctor about taking Sovaldi if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\u2022 Oxcarbazepine (a medicine used to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures); \n\u2022 Modafinil (a medicine to treat people with narcolepsy to help them stay awake). \n\u2022 Rifapentine (a medicine used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); \nThis is because they may make Sovaldi work less well. \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \nTell your doctor if you take any of the following medicines: \n\u2022 amiodarone, used to treat irregular heartbeats. \n \nIf you are not sure of what medicines can be taken with Sovaldi, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nPregnancy and contraception \nPregnancy must be avoided due to the use of Sovaldi together with ribavirin. It is very important that \nyou read the \"Pregnancy\" section in the ribavirin package leaflet very carefully. Ribavirin can be very \ndamaging to an unborn baby. Therefore, special precautions in sexual activity must be taken if there is \nany chance for pregnancy to occur. \n \n\u2022 Sovaldi is commonly used together with ribavirin. Ribavirin can damage your unborn baby. It is \n\ntherefore very important that you (or your partner) do not become pregnant during this \ntherapy. \n\n\u2022 You or your partner must use an effective birth control method during treatment and \nafterwards. It is very important that you read the \u201cPregnancy\u201d section in the ribavirin package \nleaflet very carefully. Ask your doctor for an effective contraceptive method suitable for you. \n\n\u2022 If you or your partner become pregnant during Sovaldi treatment or in the months that follow, \nyou must contact your doctor immediately. \n\n \nBreast-feeding \nYou should not breast-feed during treatment with Sovaldi. It is not known whether sofosbuvir, the \nactive substance of Sovaldi, passes into human breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nWhen taking Sovaldi together with other medicines for the treatment of hepatitis C infection, patients \nhave reported tiredness, dizziness, blurred vision and reduced attention. If you feel tired, dizzy, have \nblurred vision or reduced attention after taking Sovaldi you should not take part in activities such as \ndriving, riding a bike or operating machines. \n \n \n3. How to take Sovaldi \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nRecommended dose \nSovaldi is to be taken as advised by your doctor.

If you vomit more \nthan 2 hours after taking Sovaldi you do not need to take another dose until your next regularly \nscheduled dose. \n \nKidney problems \nTell your doctor if you have kidney problems or if you are on kidney dialysis. \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \nIf you take more Sovaldi than you should \nIf you accidentally take more than the recommended dose you should contact your doctor or nearest \nemergency department immediately for advice. Keep the tablet bottle with you so that you can easily \ndescribe what you have taken. \n \nIf you forget to take Sovaldi \nIt is important not to miss a dose of this medicine. \n \nIf you do miss a dose: \n\u2022 and you notice within 18 hours of the time you usually take Sovaldi, you must take the dose as \n\nsoon as possible. Then take the next dose at your usual time. \n\u2022 and you notice 18 hours or more after the time you usually take Sovaldi, wait and take the \n\nnext dose at your usual time.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get.  See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet.  See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Sovaldi is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Sovaldi \n3. How to take Sovaldi \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Sovaldi \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \nIf Sovaldi has been prescribed for your child, please note that all the information in this leaflet is \napplicable to your child (in this case please read \u201cyour child\u201d instead of \u201cyou\u201d). \n \n1. What Sovaldi is and what it is used for \n \nSovaldi granules contain the active substance sofosbuvir which is given in a granule formulation to \ntreat hepatitis C virus infection in adults and children aged 3 years of age and older. \n \nHepatitis C is a virus that infects the liver. This medicine works by lowering the amount of hepatitis C \nvirus in your body and removing the virus from your blood over a period of time. \n \nSovaldi is always taken with other medicines to treat hepatitis C.  It will not work on its own.  It is \ncommonly taken with either: \n \n\u2022 Ribavirin (children and adult patients), or \n\u2022 Peginterferon alfa and ribavirin (adult patients) \n \nIt is very important that you also read the leaflets for the other medicines that you will be taking with \nSovaldi. If you have any questions about your medicines, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Sovaldi \n \nDo not take Sovaldi \n\u2022 If you are allergic to sofosbuvir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6 of this leaflet). \n \n \n\n\n\n86 \n\n\u2022 If you are currently taking any of the following medicines: \n\u2022 Rifampicin (antibiotic used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); \n\u2022 St. John\u2019s wort (herbal medicine used to treat depression); \n\u2022 Carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (medicines used to treat epilepsy and \n\nprevent seizures). \n \n\uf0e0 If any of these conditions apply to you, tell your doctor immediately. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nSovaldi is always taken with other medicines to treat hepatitis C (see section 1 above). Talk to your \ndoctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine if you: \n \n\u2022 Currently take, or have taken in the last few months, the medicine amiodarone to treat irregular \n\nheartbeats, as it may result in a life-threatening slowing of your heart beat. Your doctor may \nconsider different treatments if you have taken this medicine. If treatment with Sovaldi is \nneeded, you may require additional heart monitoring; \n\n\u2022 have liver problems other than hepatitis C, e.g. if you are awaiting a liver transplantation; \n\u2022 have a current or previous infection with the hepatitis B virus, since your doctor may want to \n\nmonitor you more closely; \n\u2022 have diabetes. You may need closer monitoring of your blood glucose levels and/or adjustment \n\nof your diabetes medication after starting Sovaldi. Some diabetic patients have experienced low \nsugar levels in the blood (hypoglycaemia) after starting treatment with medicines like Sovaldi. \n\n \nTell your doctor immediately if you currently take, or have taken in the last months, any medicines \nfor heart problems and during treatment you experience: \n\u2022 slow or irregular heartbeat, or heart rhythm problems; \n\u2022 shortness of breath or worsening of existing shortness of breath; \n\u2022 chest-pain; \n\u2022 light-headedness; \n\u2022 palpitations \n\u2022 near fainting or fainting \n \nBlood tests \nYour doctor will test your blood before, during and after your treatment with Sovaldi.  This is so your \ndoctor can:  \n\u2022 Decide what other medicines you should take with Sovaldi and for how long; \n\u2022 Confirm that your treatment has worked and you are free of the hepatitis C virus. \n \nChildren  \nDo not give this medicine to children under 3 years of age. The use of Sovaldi in children under \n3 years of age has not yet been studied. \n \nOther medicines and Sovaldi \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.   \n \nWarfarin and other similar medicines called vitamin K antagonists are used to thin the blood. Your \ndoctor may need to increase the frequency of your blood tests to check how well your blood can clot. \n \nYour liver function may change with treatment of hepatitis C and therefore may affect other \nmedications (e.g. medicines used to suppress your immune system, etc.). Your doctor may need to \nclosely monitor these other medicines you are taking and make adjustments after starting Sovaldi. \n \nTalk to your doctor about taking Sovaldi if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\u2022 Oxcarbazepine (a medicine used to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures); \n\u2022 Modafinil (a medicine to treat people with narcolepsy to help you stay awake). \n\n\n\n87 \n\n\u2022 Rifapentine (a medicine used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); \nThis is because they may make Sovaldi work less well. \n \nTell your doctor if you take any of the following medicines: \n\u2022 amiodarone, used to treat irregular heartbeats. \n \nIf you are not sure of what medicines can be taken with Sovaldi, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nPregnancy and contraception \nPregnancy must be avoided due to the use of Sovaldi together with ribavirin. It is very important that \nyou read the \"Pregnancy\" section in the ribavirin package leaflet very carefully. Ribavirin can be very \ndamaging to an unborn baby. Therefore, special precautions in sexual activity must be taken if there is \nany chance for pregnancy to occur. \n \n\u2022 Sovaldi is commonly used together with ribavirin.  Ribavirin can damage your unborn baby.  It \n\nis therefore very important that you (or your partner) do not become pregnant during this \ntherapy. \n\n\u2022 You or your partner must use an effective birth control method during treatment and \nafterwards.  It is very important that you read the \u201cPregnancy\u201d section in the ribavirin package \nleaflet very carefully.  Ask your doctor for an effective contraceptive method suitable for you. \n\n\u2022 If you or your partner become pregnant during Sovaldi treatment or in the months that follow, \nyou must contact your doctor immediately. \n\n \nBreast-feeding \nDo not breast-feed during treatment with Sovaldi.  It is not known whether sofosbuvir, the active \nsubstance of Sovaldi, passes into human breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nWhen taking Sovaldi together with other medicines for the treatment of hepatitis C infection, patients \nhave reported tiredness, dizziness, blurred vision and reduced attention. If you feel tired, dizzy, have \nblurred vision or reduced attention after taking Sovaldi you should not take part in activities such as \ndriving, riding a bike or operating machines. \n \nSovaldi granules contain lactose \n\n\u2022 If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, \ncontact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. \n\n \n \n3. How to take Sovaldi \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.

Then take the next dose at your usual time. \n\u2022 and you notice 18 hours or more after the time you usually take Sovaldi, wait and take the \n\nnext dose at your usual time. Do not take a double dose (two doses close together). \n \nDo not stop taking Sovaldi \nYou should not stop taking this medicine unless your doctor tells you. It is very important that you \ncomplete the full course of treatment to give the medicines the best chance to treat your hepatitis C \nvirus infection. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

following medicines: rifampicin (antibiotic used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); 79 st. john's wort (herbal medicine used to treat depression); carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (medicines used to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures). if any of these conditions apply to you, tell your doctor immediately. warnings and precautions sovaldi is always taken with other medicines to treat hepatitis c (see section 1 above). talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine if you: currently take, or have taken in the last few months, the medicine amiodarone to treat irregular heartbeats, as it may result in a life-threatening slowing of your heart beat. your doctor may consider different treatments if you have taken this medicine. if treatment with sovaldi is needed, you may require additional heart monitoring; have liver problems other than hepatitis c, e.g. if you are awaiting a liver transplantation; have a current or previous infection with the hepatitis b virus, since your doctor may want to monitor you more closely; have diabetes. you may need closer monitoring of your blood glucose levels and/or adjustment of your diabetes medication after starting sovaldi. some diabetic patients have experienced low sugar levels in the blood (hypoglycaemia) after starting treatment with medicines like sovaldi. tell your doctor immediately if you

(e.g. medicines used to suppress your immune system, etc.). your doctor may need to closely monitor these other medicines you are taking and make adjustments after starting sovaldi. talk to your doctor about taking sovaldi if you are taking any of the following medicines: oxcarbazepine (a medicine used to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures); modafinil (a medicine to treat people with narcolepsy to help them stay awake). rifapentine (a medicine used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); this is because they may make sovaldi work less well. tell your doctor if you take any
