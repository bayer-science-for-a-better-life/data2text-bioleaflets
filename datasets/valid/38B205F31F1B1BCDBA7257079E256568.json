Version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly patients\nThe limited data on the safety and efficacy of Alunbrig in patients aged 65 years and older suggest that \na dose adjustment is not required in elderly patients (see section 4.8). There are no available data on \npatients over 85 years of age.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment of Alunbrig is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nclass A) or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B). A reduced starting dose of 60 mg once \ndaily for the first 7 days, then 120 mg once daily is recommended for patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh class C) (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment of Alunbrig is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment \n(estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \u2265 30 mL/min). A reduced starting dose of 60 mg once \ndaily for the first 7 days, then 90 mg once daily is recommended for patients with severe renal \nimpairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min) (see section 5.2). Patients with severe renal impairment should be \nclosely monitored for new or worsening respiratory symptoms that may indicate ILD/pneumonitis \n(e.g., dyspnoea, cough, etc.) particularly in the first week (see section 4.4).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Alunbrig in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established. No \ndata are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nAlunbrig is for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole and with water. Alunbrig may be \ntaken with or without food.\n\nGrapefruit or grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of brigatinib and should be avoided\n(see section 4.5).\n\n\n\n7\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nPulmonary adverse reactions\n\nSevere, life-threatening, and fatal pulmonary adverse reactions, including those with features \nconsistent with ILD/pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with Alunbrig (see section 4.8). \n\nMost pulmonary adverse reactions were observed within the first 7 days of treatment. Grade 1-2 \npulmonary adverse reactions resolved with interruption of treatment or dose modification. Increased \nage and shorter interval (less than 7 days) between the last dose of crizotinib and the first dose of \nAlunbrig were independently associated with an increased rate of these pulmonary adverse reactions. \nThese factors should be considered when initiating treatment with Alunbrig. Patients with a history of \nILD or drug-induced pneumonitis were excluded from the pivotal trials. \n\nSome patients experienced pneumonitis later in treatment with Alunbrig.\n\nPatients should be monitored for new or worsening respiratory symptoms (e.g., dyspnoea, cough, etc.), \nparticularly in the first week of treatment. Evidence of pneumonitis in any patient with worsening \nrespiratory symptoms should be promptly investigated. If pneumonitis is suspected, the dose of \nAlunbrig should be withheld, and the patient evaluated for other causes of symptoms (e.g., pulmonary \nembolism, tumour progression, and infectious pneumonia). The dose should be modified accordingly \n(see section 4.2).\n\nHypertension\n\nHypertension has occurred in patients treated with Alunbrig (see section 4.8).\n\nBlood pressure should be monitored regularly during treatment with Alunbrig. Hypertension should be \ntreated according to standard guidelines to control blood pressure. Heart rate should be monitored \nmore frequently in patients if concomitant use of a medicinal product known to cause bradycardia \ncannot be avoided. For severe hypertension (\u2265 Grade 3), Alunbrig should be withheld until \nhypertension has recovered to Grade 1 or to baseline. The dose should be modified accordingly (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nBradycardia\n\nBradycardia has occurred in patients treated with Alunbrig (see section 4.8). Caution should be \nexercised when administering Alunbrig in combination with other agents known to cause bradycardia. \nHeart rate and blood pressure should be monitored regularly.\n\nIf symptomatic bradycardia occurs, treatment with Alunbrig should be withheld and concomitant \nmedicinal products known to cause bradycardia should be evaluated. Upon recovery, the dose should \nbe modified accordingly (see section 4.2). In case of life-threatening bradycardia, if no contributing \nconcomitant medication is identified or in case of recurrence, treatment with Alunbrig should be \ndiscontinued (see section 4.2).\n\nVisual disturbance\n\nVisual disturbance adverse reactions have occurred in patients treated with Alunbrig (see section 4.8). \nPatients should be advised to report any visual symptoms. For new or worsening severe visual \nsymptoms, an ophthalmologic evaluation and dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.2).\n\n\n\n8\n\nCreatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation\n\nElevations of CPK have occurred in patients treated with Alunbrig (see section 4.8). Patients should be \nadvised to report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. CPK levels should be \nmonitored regularly during Alunbrig treatment. Based on the severity of the CPK elevation, and if \nassociated with muscle pain or weakness, treatment with Alunbrig should be withheld, and the dose \nmodified accordingly (see section 4.2).\n\nElevations of pancreatic enzymes\n\nElevations of amylase and lipase have occurred in patients treated with Alunbrig (see section 4.8). \nLipase and amylase should be monitored regularly during treatment with Alunbrig. Based on the \nseverity of the laboratory abnormalities, treatment with Alunbrig should be withheld, and the dose \nmodified accordingly (see section 4.2).\n\nHepatotoxicity\n\nElevations of hepatic enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase) and bilirubin\nhave occurred in patients treated with Alunbrig (see section 4.8). Liver function, including AST, ALT \nand total bilirubin should be assessed prior to the initiation of Alunbrig and then every 2 weeks during \nthe first 3 months of treatment. Thereafter, monitoring should be performed periodically. Based on the \nseverity of the laboratory abnormalities, treatment should be withheld, and the dose modified \naccordingly (see section 4.2).\n\nHyperglycaemia\n\nElevations of serum glucose have occurred in patients treated with Alunbrig. Fasting serum glucose \nshould be assessed prior to initiation of Alunbrig and monitored periodically thereafter. \nAntihyperglycaemic treatment should be initiated or optimised as needed. If adequate hyperglycaemic \ncontrol cannot be achieved with optimal medical management, Alunbrig should be withheld until \nadequate hyperglycaemic control is achieved; upon recovery reducing the dose as described in Table 1 \nmay be considered or Alunbrig may be permanently discontinued.\n\nDrug-drug interactions\n\nThe concomitant use of Alunbrig with strong CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided. If concomitant use \nof strong CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided, the dose of Alunbrig should be reduced from 180 mg \nto 90 mg, or from 90 mg to 60 mg. After discontinuation of a strong CYP3A inhibitor, Alunbrig \nshould be resumed at the dose that was tolerated prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A inhibitor.\n\nThe concomitant use of Alunbrig with strong and moderate CYP3A inducers should be avoided (see \nsection 4.5). \n\nFertility\n\nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective non-hormonal contraception \nduring treatment with Alunbrig and for at least 4 months following the final dose. Men with female\npartners of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment \nand for at least 3 months after the last dose of Alunbrig (see section 4.6).\n\nLactose\n\nAlunbrig contains lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal \nproduct.\n\n\n\n9\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nAgents that may increase brigatinib plasma concentrations\n\nCYP3A inhibitors\n\nIn vitro studies demonstrated that brigatinib is a substrate of CYP3A4/5. In healthy subjects, \ncoadministration of multiple 200 mg twice daily doses of itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, with \na single 90 mg brigatinib dose increased brigatinib Cmax by 21%, AUC0-INF by 101% (2-fold), and \nAUC0-120 by 82% (< 2-fold), relative to a 90 mg brigatinib dose administered alone. The concomitant \nuse of strong CYP3A inhibitors with Alunbrig, including but not limited to certain antivirals (e.g., \nindinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir), macrolide antibiotics (e.g., clarithromycin, telithromycin, \ntroleandomycin), antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, voriconazole), and nefazodone should be avoided. If \nconcomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided, the dose of Alunbrig should be \nreduced by approximately 50% (i.e. from 180 mg to 90 mg, or from 90 mg to 60 mg). After \ndiscontinuation of a strong CYP3A inhibitor, Alunbrig should be resumed at the dose that was \ntolerated prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A inhibitor.\n\nModerate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., diltiazem and verapamil) may increase the AUC of brigatinib by \napproximately 40% based on simulations from a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model. No \ndose adjustment is required for Alunbrig in combination with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Patients \nshould be closely monitored when Alunbrig is coadministered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors.\n\nGrapefruit or grapefruit juice may also increase plasma concentrations of brigatinib and should be \navoided (see section 4.2).\n\nCYP2C8 inhibitors\n\nIn vitro studies demonstrated that brigatinib is a substrate of CYP2C8. In healthy subjects, \ncoadministration of multiple 600 mg twice daily doses of gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, \nwith a single 90 mg brigatinib dose reduced brigatinib Cmax by 41%, AUC0-INF by 12%, and AUC0-120\n\nby 15%, relative to a 90 mg brigatinib dose administered alone. The effect of gemfibrozil on the \npharmacokinetics of brigatinib is not clinically meaningful and the underlying mechanism for the \ndecreased exposure of brigatinib is unknown. No dose adjustment is required during coadministration \nwith strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.\n\nP-gp and BCRP inhibitors\n\nBrigatinib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in vitro. \nGiven that brigatinib exhibits high solubility and high permeability, inhibition of P-gp and BCRP is \nnot expected to result in a clinically meaningful change in the systemic exposure of brigatinib. No \ndose adjustment is required for Alunbrig during coadministration with P-gp and BCRP inhibitors.\n\nAgents that may decrease brigatinib plasma concentrations\n\nCYP3A inducers\n\nIn healthy subjects, coadministration of multiple 600 mg daily doses of rifampicin, a strong CYP3A \ninducer, with a single 180 mg brigatinib dose decreased brigatinib Cmax by 60%, AUC0-INF by 80% \n(5-fold), and AUC0-120 by 80% (5-fold), relative to a 180 mg brigatinib dose administered alone. The \nconcomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers with Alunbrig, including but not limited to rifampicin, \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, and St. John\u2019s wort should be avoided. \n\nModerate CYP3A inducers may decrease the AUC of brigatinib by approximately 50% based on \nsimulations from a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model. The concomitant use of moderate \nCYP3A inducers with Alunbrig, including but not limited to efavirenz, modafinil, bosentan, etravirine, \nand nafcillin should be avoided.\n\n\n\n10\n\nAgents that may have their plasma concentrations altered by brigatinib\n\nCYP3A substrates\n\nIn vitro studies in hepatocytes have shown that brigatinib is an inducer of CYP3A4. Clinical drug-drug \ninteraction studies with sensitive CYP3A substrates have not been conducted. Brigatinib may reduce \nplasma levels of coadministered medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by CYP3A.\nTherefore, coadministration of Alunbrig with CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., \nalfentanil, fentanyl, quinidine, cyclosporine, sirolimus, tacrolimus) should be avoided as their \neffectiveness may be reduced.\n\nAlunbrig may also induce other enzymes and transporters (e.g., CYP2C, P-gp) via the same \nmechanisms responsible for induction of CYP3A (e.g., pregnane X receptor activation).\n\nTransporter substrates\n\nCoadministration of brigatinib with substrates of P-gp (e.g., digoxin, dabigatran, colchicine, \npravastatin), BCRP (e.g., methotrexate, rosuvastatin, sulfasalazine), organic cation transporter \n1 (OCT1), multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1), and 2K (MATE2K) may increase their \nplasma concentrations. Patients should be closely monitored when Alunbrig is coadministered with \nsubstrates of these transporters with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., digoxin, dabigatran, \nmethotrexate).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females\n\nWomen of childbearing age being treated with Alunbrig should be advised not to become pregnant and \nmen being treated with Alunbrig should be advised not to father a child during treatment. Women of \nreproductive potential should be advised to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment \nwith Alunbrig and for at least 4 months following the final dose. Men with female partners of \nreproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at \nleast 3 months after the last dose of Alunbrig.\n\nPregnancy\n\nAlunbrig may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). There are no clinical data on the use of Alunbrig in \npregnant women. Alunbrig should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the \nmother requires treatment. If Alunbrig is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant \nwhile taking this medicinal product, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether Alunbrig is excreted in human milk. Available data cannot exclude potential \nexcretion in human milk. Breast-feeding should be stopped during treatment with Alunbrig.\n\nFertility\n\nNo human data on the effect of Alunbrig on fertility are available. Based on repeat-dose toxicity\nstudies in male animals, Alunbrig may cause reduced fertility in males (see section 5.3). The clinical \nrelevance of these findings to human fertility is unknown.\n\n\n\n11\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nAlunbrig has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, caution should be \nexercised when driving or operating machines as patients may experience visual disturbance, \ndizziness, or fatigue while taking Alunbrig.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (\u2265 25%) reported in patients treated with Alunbrig at the \nrecommended dosing regimen were increased AST, increased CPK, hyperglycaemia, increased lipase, \nhyperinsulinaemia, diarrhoea, increased ALT, increased amylase, anaemia, nausea, fatigue, \nhypophosphataemia, decreased lymphocyte count, cough, increased alkaline phosphatase, rash, \nincreased APTT, myalgia, headache, hypertension, decreased white blood cell count, dyspnoea, and \nvomiting. \nThe most common serious adverse reactions (\u2265 2%) reported in patients treated with Alunbrig at the \nrecommended dosing regimen other than events related to neoplasm progression were pneumonia, \npneumonitis, dyspnoea and pyrexia. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe data described below reflect exposure to Alunbrig at the recommended dosing regimen in three \nclinical trials: a Phase 3 trial (ALTA 1L) in patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC previously \nnot treated with an ALK-inhibitor (N = 136), a Phase 2 trial (ALTA) in patients treated with Alunbrig \nwith ALK-positive NSCLC who previously progressed on crizotinib (N = 110), and a phase 1/2 dose \nescalation/expansion trial in patients with advanced malignancies (N = 28). Across these studies, the \nmedian duration of exposure in patients receiving Alunbrig at the recommended dosing regimen was \n21.8 months.\n\nAdverse reactions reported are presented in Table 3 and are listed by system organ class, preferred \nterm and frequency. Frequency categories are very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10) and \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented \nin order of frequency.\n\nTable 3: Adverse reactions reported in patients treated with Alunbrig (per Common \nTerminology Criteria

reactions\n\nPulmonary adverse reactions\n\nIn ALTA 1L, 2.9% of patients experienced any Grade ILD/pneumonitis early in treatment (within \n8 days), with Grade 3-4 ILD/pneumonitis in 2.2% of patients. There were no fatal ILD/pneumonitis. \nAdditionally, 3.7% of patients experienced pneumonitis later in treatment.\n\nIn ALTA, 6.4% of patients experienced pulmonary adverse reactions of any grade, including \nILD/pneumonitis, pneumonia and dyspnoea, early in treatment (within 9 days, median onset: 2 days); \n2.7% of patients had Grade 3-4 pulmonary adverse reactions and 1 patient (0.5%) had fatal \npneumonia. Following Grade 1-2 pulmonary adverse reactions, treatment with Alunbrig was either \ninterrupted and then restarted or the dose was reduced. Early pulmonary adverse reactions also \noccurred in a dose escalation study in patients (N = 137) (Study 101) including three fatal cases \n(hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia). Additionally, 2.3% of patients in \nALTA experienced pneumonitis later in treatment, with 2 patients having Grade 3 pneumonitis (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nElderly\n\nEarly pulmonary adverse reaction was reported in 10.1% of patients \u2265 65 years of age compared with \n3.1% of patients < 65 years of age. \n\nHypertension\n\nHypertension was reported in 30% of patients treated with Alunbrig at the 180 mg regimen with 11% \nhaving Grade 3 hypertension. Dose reduction for hypertension occurred in 1.5% at the 180 mg \nregimen. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, in all patients, increased over time (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\nBradycardia\n\nBradycardia was reported in 8.4% of patients treated with Alunbrig at the 180 mg regimen. \n\nHeart rates of less than 50 beats per minute (bpm) were reported in 8.4% of patients at the 180 mg \nregimen. (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nVisual disturbance\n\nVisual disturbance adverse reactions were reported in 14% of patients treated with Alunbrig at the \n180 mg regimen. Of these, three Grade 3 adverse reactions (1.1%) including macular oedema and \ncataract were reported.\n\nDose reduction for visual disturbance occurred in two patients (0.7%) at the 180 mg regimen (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n\n\n15\n\nPeripheral neuropathy\n\nPeripheral neuropathy adverse reactions were reported in 20% of patients treated at the 180 mg \nregimen. Thirty-three percent of patients had resolution of all peripheral neuropathy adverse reactions. \nThe median duration of peripheral neuropathy adverse reactions was 6.6 months, with a maximum \nduration of 28.9 months.\n\nCreatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation\n\nIn ALTA 1L and ALTA, elevations of CPK were reported in 64% of patients treated with Alunbrig at \nthe 180 mg regimen. The incidence of Grade 3-4 elevations of CPK was 18%. The median time to \nonset for CPK elevations was 28 days.\n\nDose reduction for CPK elevation occurred in 10% of patients at the 180 mg regimen (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nElevations of pancreatic enzymes\n\nElevations of amylase and lipase were reported in 47% and 54% of patients treated with Alunbrig, \nrespectively at the 180 mg regimen. For elevations to Grade 3 and 4, the incidences for amylase and \nlipase were 7.7% and 15%, respectively. The median time to onset for amylase elevations and lipase \nelevations was 17 days and 29 days, respectively.\n\nDose reduction for elevation of lipase and amylase occurred in 4.7% and 2.9% of patients, respectively \nat the 180 mg regimen (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nElevation of hepatic enzymes\n\nElevations of ALT and AST were reported in 49% and 68% of patients treated with Alunbrig, \nrespectively at the 180 mg regimen. For elevations to Grade 3 and 4, the incidences for ALT and AST \nwere 4.7% and 3.6%, respectively.\n\nDose reduction for elevation of ALT and AST occurred in 0.7% and 1.1% of patients, respectively at \nthe 180 mg regimen (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nHyperglycaemia\n\nSixty one percent of patients experienced hyperglycaemia. Grade 3 hyperglycemia occurred in 6.6% of \npatients. \n\nNo patients had dose reductions due to hyperglycaemia.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with Alunbrig. In the event of an overdose, monitor the \npatient for adverse reactions (see section 4.8) and provide appropriate supportive care.\n\n\n\n16\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agent, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE43\n\nMechanism of action\n\nBrigatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets ALK, c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1), and insulin-like \ngrowth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R). Brigatinib inhibited autophosphorylation of ALK and \nALK-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream signalling protein STAT3 in in vitro and in vivo\nassays. \n\nBrigatinib inhibited the in vitro proliferation of cell lines expressing EML4-ALK and NPM-ALK \nfusion proteins and demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC \nxenograft growth in mice. Brigatinib inhibited the in vitro and in vivo viability of cells expressing \nmutant forms of EML4-ALK associated with resistance to ALK inhibitors, including G1202R and \nL1196M.\n\nCardiac electrophysiology\n\nIn Study 101, the QT interval prolongation potential of Alunbrig was assessed in 123 patients with \nadvanced malignancies following once daily brigatinib doses of 30 mg to 240 mg. The maximum \nmean QTcF (corrected QT by the Fridericia method) change from baseline was less than 10 msec. An \nexposure-QT analysis suggested no concentration-dependent QTc interval prolongation. \n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nALTA 1L\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Alunbrig was evaluated in a randomised (1:1), open-label, multicentre trial \n(ALTA 1L) in 275 adult patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC who had not previously \nreceived an ALK-targeted therapy. Eligibility criteria permitted enrolment of patients with a \ndocumented ALK rearrangement based on a local standard of care testing and an ECOG Performance \nstatus of 0-2. Patients were allowed to have up to 1 prior regimen of chemotherapy in the locally \nadvanced or metastatic setting. Neurologically stable patients with treated or untreated central nervous \nsystem (CNS) metastases, including leptomeningeal metastases, were eligible. Patients with a history \nof pulmonary interstitial disease, drug-related pneumonitis, or radiation pneumonitis were excluded. \n\nPatients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive Alunbrig 180 mg once daily with a 7-day lead-in at \n90 mg once daily (N = 137) or crizotinib 250 mg orally twice daily (N = 138). Randomisation was \nstratified by brain metastases (present, absent) and prior chemotherapy use for locally advanced or \nmetastatic disease (yes, no). \n\nThe major outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) according to Response Evaluation \nCriteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) as evaluated by a Blinded Independent Review Committee \n(BIRC). Additional outcome measures as evaluated by the BIRC include confirmed objective response \nrate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), time to response, disease control rate (DCR), intracranial \nORR, intracranial PFS, and intracranial DOR. Investigator-assessed outcomes include PFS and overall \nsurvival.\n\nBaseline demographics and disease characteristics in ALTA 1L were median age 59 years old (range \n27 to 89; 32% 65 and over), 59% White and 39% Asian, 55% female, 39% ECOG PS 0, and 56% \nECOG PS 1, 58% never smokers, 93% Stage IV disease, 96% adenocarcinoma histology, 30% CNS\nmetastases at baseline, 14% prior radiotherapy to the brain, and 27% prior chemotherapy. Sites of \nextra-thoracic metastases include brain (30% of patients), bone (31% of patients), and liver (20% of \npatients). The median relative dose intensity was 97% for Alunbrig and 99% for crizotinib.\n\n\n\n17\n\nAt the primary analysis performed at a median follow-up duration of 11 months in the Alunbrig arm,\nthe ALTA 1L study met its primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in \nPFS by BIRC. A protocol specified efficacy analysis performed at a median follow-up duration of \n24.9 months in the Alunbrig arm formed the basis for the results from this study (Table 4 and \nFigure 1).\n\nTable 4: Efficacy Results in ALTA IL (ITT Population) \n\nEfficacy Parameters Alunbrig\nN = 137\n\nCrizotinib\nN = 138\n\nMedian duration of follow-up (months) 24.9\n(range: 0\u201334.1)\n\n15.2\n(range: 0.1\u201336)\n\nPrimary efficacy parameters\nPFS (BIRC) \n\nNumber of Patients with Events, n (%) 63 (46%) 87 (63%)\nProgressive Disease, n (%) 56 (40.9%)a 82 (59.4%)b\n\nDeath, n (%) 7 (5.1%) 5 (3.6%)\nMedian (in months) (95% CI) 24 (18.5, NE) 11 (9.2, 12.9)\nHazard ratio (95% CI) 0.49 (0.35, 0.68)\nLog-rank p-valuec <0.0001\n\nSecondary efficacy parameters\nConfirmed Objective Response Rate (BIRC)\n\nResponders, n (%) \n(95% CI)\n\n101 (73.7%)\n(65.5, 80.9) \n\n85 (61.6%)\n(52.9, 69.7) \n\np-valuec,d 0.0342\n\nComplete Response, % 14.6% 8.7%\nPartial Response, % 59.1% 52.9%\n\nDuration of Confirmed Response (BIRC)\nMedian (months) (95% CI) NE (19.4, NE) 13.8 (9.3, 20.8)\n\nOverall Survival\nNumber of Events, n (%) 33 (24.1) 37 (26.8)\n\nMedian (in months) (95% CI) NE (NE, NE) NE (NE, NE) \nHazard ratio (95% CI) 0.92 (0.57, 1.47) \nLog-rank p-valued 0.7710\n\nBIRC = Blinded Independent Review Committee; NE = Not Estimable; CI = Confidence Interval\na includes 2 patients with palliative radiotherapy to the brain\nb includes 8 patients with palliative radiotherapy to the brain\nc Stratified by presence of iCNS metastases at baseline and prior chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease for \nlog-rank test and Cochran Mantel-Haenszel test, respectively \nd From a Cochran Mantel-Haenszel test\n\n\n\n18\n\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier Plot of Progression-Free Survival by BIRC in ALTA 1L\n\n137 114 97 89 84 81 75 66 39 18 3\n\n138 116 80 68 49 41 37 36 17 8 2 1\n\nBrigatinib\n\nCrizotinib\n\nNumber at Risk\n\n0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 33 36\n\nMonths\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nP\nro\n\ng\nre\n\ns\ns\n\nio\nn\n\n-f\nre\n\ne\n S\n\nu\nrv\n\niv\na\n\nl \n(%\n\n)\n\nBrigatinib\n\nCrizotinib\n\nBIRC assessment of intracranial efficacy according to RECIST v1.1 in patients with any brain \nmetastases and patients with measurable brain metastases (\u2265 10 mm in longest diameter) at baseline \nare summarised in Table 5. \n\nTable 5: BIRC-assessed Intracranial Efficacy in Patients in ALTA 1L\n\nEfficacy Parameters\n\nPatients with Measurable Brain Metastases at \nBaseline\n\nAlunbrig\nN = 18\n\nCrizotinib\nN = 23\n\nConfirmed Intracranial Objective Response Rate\nResponders, n (%) \n(95% CI)\n\n14 (77.8%) \n(52.4, 93.6) \n\n6 (26.1%) \n(10.2, 48.4) \n\np-valuea,b 0.0014\nComplete Response % 27.8% 0\nPartial Response % 50% 26.1%\n\nDuration of Confirmed Intracranial Responsec\n\nMedian (months) (95% CI) NE (5.7, NE) 9.2 (3.9, 9.2) \nPatients with Any Brain Metastases at Baseline\n\nAlunbrig\nN = 47\n\nCrizotinib\nN = 49\n\nConfirmed Intracranial Objective Response Rate\nResponders, n (%) \n(95% CI)\n\n31 (66%) \n(50.7, 79.1) \n\n8 (16.3%) \n(7.32, 29.7) \n\np-valuea,b < 0.0001\nComplete Response (%) 44.7% 4.1%\nPartial Response (%) 21.3% 12.2%\n\n\n\n19\n\nDuration of Confirmed Intracranial Responsec\n\nMedian (months) (95% CI) 24 (16.9, NE) 9.2 (3.9, NE) \nIntracranial PFSd\n\nNumber of Patients with Events, n (%) 21 (44.7%) 32 (65.3%) \nProgressive Disease, n (%) 21 (44.7%)e 29 (59.2%)f\n\nDeath, n (%) 0 3 (6.1%)\nMedian (in months) (95% CI) 24 (13, NE) 5.6 (3.7, 7.5) \nHazard ratio (95% CI) 0.31 (0.17, 0.56) \nLog-rank p-value < 0.0001 \nCI = Confidence Interval; NE = Not Estimable\na Stratified by presence prior chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease for log-rank test and Cochran \nMantel-Haenszel test, respectively \nbFrom a Cochran Mantel-Haenszel test\nc measured from date of first confirmed intracranial response until date of intracranial disease progression (new intracranial \nlesions, intracranial target lesion diameter growth \u2265 20% from nadir, or unequivocal progression of intracranial nontarget \nlesions) or death or censoring\nd measured from date of randomisation until date of intracranial disease progression (new intracranial lesions, intracranial \ntarget lesion diameter growth \u226520% from nadir, or unequivocal progression of intracranial nontarget lesions) or death or \ncensoring.\ne includes 1 patient with palliative radiotherapy to the brain\nf includes 2 patients with palliative radiotherapy to the brain\n\nALTA\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Alunbrig was evaluated in a randomised (1:1), open-label, multicenter trial \n(ALTA) in 222 adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC who had \nprogressed on crizotinib. Eligibility criteria permitted enrolment of patients with a documented ALK \nrearrangement based on a validated test, ECOG Performance Status of 0-2, and prior chemotherapy. \nAdditionally, patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases were included, provided they \nwere neurologically stable and did not require an increasing dose of corticosteroids. Patients with a \nhistory of pulmonary interstitial disease or drug-related pneumonitis were excluded.\n\nPatients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive Alunbrig either 90 mg once daily (90 mg regimen, \nN = 112) or 180 mg once daily with 7-day lead-in at 90 mg once daily (180 mg regimen, N = 110). \nThe median duration of follow-up was 22.9 months. Randomisation was stratified by brain metastases \n(present, absent) and best prior response to crizotinib therapy (complete or partial response, any other \nresponse/unknown). \n\nThe major outcome measure was confirmed objective response rate (ORR) according to Response \nEvaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) as evaluated by investigator. Additional outcome \nmeasures included confirmed ORR as evaluated by an Independent Review Committee (IRC); time to \nresponse; progression free survival (PFS); duration of response (DOR); overall survival; and \nintracranial ORR and intracranial DOR as evaluated by an IRC. \n\nBaseline demographics and disease characteristics in ALTA were median age 54 years old \n(range 18 to 82; 23% 65 and over), 67% White and 31% Asian, 57% female, 36% ECOG PS 0 and \n57% ECOG PS 1, 7% ECOG PS2, 60% never smoker, 35% former smoker, 5% current smoker,\n98% Stage IV, 97% adenocarcinoma, and 74% prior chemotherapy.

After a single dose and at steady \nstate, systemic exposure was dose proportional over the dose range of 60-240 mg once daily. Modest \naccumulation was observed upon repeated dosing (geometric mean accumulation ratio: 1.9 to 2.4). \nThe geometric mean steady state Cmax of brigatinib at doses of 90 mg and 180 mg once daily was \n552 and 1,452 ng/mL, respectively, and the corresponding AUC0-\uf074 was 8,165 and 20,276 h\u2219ng/mL, \nrespectively. Brigatinib is a substrate of the transporter proteins P-gp and BCRP.\n\nIn healthy subjects, compared to overnight fasting, a high fat meal reduced brigatinib Cmax by 13%\nwith no effect on AUC. Brigatinib can be administered with or without food. \n\n\n\n22\n\nDistribution\n\nBrigatinib was moderately bound (91%) to human plasma proteins and binding was not \nconcentration-dependent. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio is 0.69. In patients given brigatinib \n180 mg once daily, the geometric mean apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of brigatinib at steady \nstate was 307 L, indicating moderate distribution into tissues.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nIn vitro studies demonstrated that brigatinib is primarily metabolised by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, and to \na much lesser extent by CYP3A5.\n\nFollowing oral administration of a single 180 mg dose of [14C]brigatinib to healthy subjects, \nN-demethylation and cysteine conjugation were the two major metabolic clearance pathways. In urine \nand faeces combined, 48%, 27%, and 9.1% of the radioactive dose was excreted as unchanged \nbrigatinib, N-desmethyl brigatinib (AP26123), and brigatinib cysteine conjugate, respectively. \nUnchanged brigatinib was the major circulating radioactive component (92%) along with AP26123 \n(3.5%), the primary metabolite also observed in vitro. In patients, at steady state, the plasma AUC of \nAP26123 was < 10% of brigatinib exposure. In in vitro kinase and cellular assays, the metabolite, \nAP26123, inhibited ALK with approximately 3-fold lower potency than brigatinib.\n\nElimination\n\nIn patients given brigatinib 180 mg once daily, the geometric mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of \nbrigatinib at steady state was 8.9 L/h and the median plasma elimination half-life was 24 h.\n\nThe primary route of excretion of brigatinib is in faeces. In six healthy male subjects given a single \n180 mg oral dose of [14C]brigatinib, 65% of the administered dose was recovered in faeces and 25% of \nthe administered dose was recovered in urine. Unchanged brigatinib represented 41% and 86% of the \ntotal radioactivity in faeces and urine, respectively, the remainder being metabolites.\n\nSpecific populations\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of brigatinib was characterised in healthy subjects with normal hepatic function \n(N = 9), and patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A, N = 6), moderate hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh class B, N = 6), or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C, N = 6). \nThe pharmacokinetics of brigatinib was similar between healthy subjects with normal hepatic function \nand patients with mild (Child-Pugh class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment. \nUnbound AUC0-INF was 37% higher in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) as \ncompared to healthy subjects with normal hepatic function (see section 4.2).\n\nRenal impairment\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of brigatinib is similar in patients with normal renal function and in patients \nwith mild or moderate renal impairment (eGFR \u2265 30 mL/min) based on the results of population \npharmacokinetic analyses. In a pharmacokinetic study, unbound AUC0-INF was 94% higher in patients \nwith severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min, N = 6) as compared to patients with normal renal \nfunction (eGFR \u2265 90 mL/min, N = 8) (see section 4.2).\n\nRace and gender\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses showed that race and gender had no impact on the \npharmacokinetics of brigatinib. \n\n\n\n23\n\nAge, body weight, and albumin concentrations\n\nThe population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that body weight, age, and albumin concentration \nhad no clinically relevant impact on the pharmacokinetics of brigatinib.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nSafety pharmacology studies with brigatinib identified potential for pulmonary effects (altered \nrespiration rate; 1-2 times the human Cmax), cardiovascular effects (altered heart rate and blood \npressure; at 0.5 times the human Cmax), and renal effects (reduced renal function; at 1-2.5 times the \nhuman Cmax), but did not indicate any potential for QT prolongation or neurofunctional effects.\n\nAdverse reactions seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels with possible \nrelevance to clinical use were as follows: gastrointestinal system, bone marrow, eyes, testes, liver, \nkidney, bone, and heart. These effects were generally reversible during the non-dosing recovery \nperiod; however, effects in the eyes and testes were notable exceptions due to lack of recovery.\nIn repeated dose toxicity studies, lung changes (foamy alveolar macrophages) were noted in monkeys \nat \u2265 0.2 times the human AUC; however, these were minimal and similar to those reported as \nbackground findings in naive monkeys, and there was no clinical evidence of respiratory distress in \nthese monkeys.\n\nCarcinogenicity studies have not been performed with brigatinib. \n\nBrigatinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) or the mammalian cell \nchromosomal aberration assays, but slightly increased the number of micronuclei in a rat bone marrow \nmicronucleus test. The mechanism of micronucleus induction was abnormal chromosome segregation \n(aneugenicity) and not a clastogenic effect on chromosomes. This effect was observed at \napproximately five fold the human exposure at the 180 mg once daily dose. \n\nBrigatinib may impair male fertility. Testicular toxicity was observed in repeat-dose animal studies. In \nrats, findings included lower weight of testes, seminal vesicles and prostate gland, and testicular \ntubular degeneration; these effects were not reversible during the recovery period. In monkeys, \nfindings included reduced size of testes along with microscopic evidence of hypospermatogenesis; \nthese effects were reversible during the recovery period. Overall, these effects on the male \nreproductive organs in rats and monkeys occurred at exposures \u2265 0.2-times the AUC observed in \npatients at the 180 mg once daily dose. No apparent adverse effects on female reproductive organs \nwere observed in general toxicology studies in rats and monkeys. \n\nIn an embryo-foetal development study in which pregnant rats were administered daily doses of \nbrigatinib during organogenesis; dose-related skeletal anomalies were observed at doses as low as \napproximately 0.7-times the human exposure by AUC at the 180 mg once daily dose. Findings \nincluded embryo-lethality, reduced foetal growth, and skeletal variations. \n\n6.

What Alunbrig is and what it is used for\n\nAlunbrig contains the active substance brigatinib, a type of cancer medicine called a kinase inhibitor. \nAlunbrig is used to treat adults with advanced stages of a lung cancer called non-small cell lung \ncancer. It is given to patients whose lung cancer is related to an abnormal form of a gene called \nanaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK).\n\nHow Alunbrig works\n\nThe abnormal gene produces a protein known as a kinase that stimulates the growth of the cancer \ncells. Alunbrig blocks the action of this protein and thus slows down the growth and spread of the \ncancer.\n\n2.
