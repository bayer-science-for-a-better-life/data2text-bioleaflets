NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRasagiline ratiopharm 1 mg tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 1 mg rasagiline (as mesilate).  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet \n \nWhite to off-white, round, flat, bevelled tablets, debossed with \u201cGIL\u201d and \u201c1\u201d underneath on one side and \nplain on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRasagiline ratiopharm is indicated in adults for the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease as \nmonotherapy (without levodopa) or as adjunct therapy (with levodopa) in patients with end of dose \nfluctuations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of rasagiline is 1 mg (one tablet of Rasagiline ratiopharm) once daily, to be taken \nwith or without levodopa. \n \nElderly \nNo change in dose is required for elderly patients (see section 5.2).  \n \nHepatic impairment \nRasagiline is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). Rasagiline use \nin patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be avoided. Caution should be used when initiating \ntreatment with rasagiline in patients with mild hepatic impairment. In case patients progress from mild to \nmoderate hepatic impairment rasagiline should be stopped (see section 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo special precautions are required in patients with renal impairment. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Rasagiline ratiopharm in children and adolescents have not been established. \nThere is no relevant use of Rasagiline ratiopharm in the paediatric population in the indication \nParkinson\u2019s disease. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use.  \nRasagiline ratiopharm may be taken with or without food. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nConcomitant treatment with other monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (including medicinal and natural \nproducts without prescription e.g. St. John's Wort) or pethidine (see section 4.5). At least 14 days must \nelapse between discontinuation of rasagiline and initiation of treatment with MAO inhibitors or pethidine. \n \nSevere hepatic impairment. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nConcomitant use of rasagiline with other medicinal products \n \nThe concomitant use of rasagiline and fluoxetine or fluvoxamine should be avoided (see section 4.5). At \nleast five weeks should elapse between discontinuation of fluoxetine and initiation of treatment with \nrasagiline. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of rasagiline and initiation of treatment \nwith fluoxetine or fluvoxamine. \n \nThe concomitant use of rasagiline and dextromethorphan or sympathomimetics such as those present in \nnasal and oral decongestants or cold medicinal product containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine is not \nrecommended (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of rasagiline and levodopa \nSince rasagiline potentiates the effects of levodopa, the adverse reactions of levodopa may be increased \nand pre-existing dyskinesia exacerbated. Decreasing the dose of levodopa may ameliorate this adverse \nreaction.  \n \nThere have been reports of hypotensive effects when rasagiline is taken concomitantly with levodopa. \nPatients with Parkinson\u2019s disease are particularly vulnerable to the adverse reactions of hypotension due \nto existing gait issues. \n \nDopaminergic effects \n \nExcessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and sudden sleep onset (SOS) episodes \nRasagiline may cause daytime drowsiness, somnolence, and, occasionally, especially if used with other \ndopaminergic medicinal products - falling asleep during activities of daily living. Patients must be \ninformed of this and advised to exercise caution while driving or operating machines during treatment \nwith rasagiline. Patients who have experienced somnolence and/or an episode of sudden sleep onset must \nrefrain from driving or operating machines (see section 4.7). \n \nImpulse control disorders (ICDs) \nICDs can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or dopaminergic treatments. Similar \nreports of ICDs have also been received post-marketing with rasagiline. Patients should be regularly \nmonitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients and carers should be made aware of \nthe behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders that were observed in patients treated with \nrasagiline, including cases of compulsions, obsessive thoughts, pathological gambling, increased libido, \nhypersexuality, impulsive behaviour and compulsive spending or buying. \n \nMelanoma \n \nDuring the clinical development program, the occurrence of cases of melanoma prompted the \nconsideration of a possible association with rasagiline. The data collected suggests that Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease, and not any medicinal products in particular, is associated with a higher risk of skin cancer (not \nexclusively melanoma). Any suspicious skin lesion should be evaluated by a specialist. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n \n\nHepatic impairment \n \nCaution should be used when initiating treatment with rasagiline in patients with mild hepatic \nimpairment. Rasagiline use in patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be avoided. In case \npatients progress from mild to moderate hepatic impairment, rasagiline should be stopped (see \nsection 5.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nMAO Inhibitors \n \nRasagiline is contraindicated along with other MAO inhibitors (including medicinal and natural products \nwithout prescription e.g. St. John's Wort) as there may be a risk of non-selective MAO inhibition that may \nlead to hypertensive crises (see section 4.3). \n \nPethidine \n \nSerious adverse reactions have been reported with the concomitant use of pethidine and MAO inhibitors \nincluding another selective MAO-B inhibitor. The concomitant administration of rasagiline and pethidine \nis contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nSympathomimetics \n \nWith MAO inhibitors there have been reports of medicinal product interactions with the concomitant use \nof sympathomimetic medicinal products. Therefore, in view of the MAO inhibitory activity of rasagiline, \nconcomitant administration of rasagiline and sympathomimetics such as those present in nasal and oral \ndecongestants or cold medicinal products, containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, is not recommended \n(see section 4.4). \n \nDextromethorphan \n \nThere have been reports of medicinal product interactions with the concomitant use of dextromethorphan \nand non-selective MAO inhibitors. Therefore, in view of the MAO inhibitory activity of rasagiline, the \nconcomitant administration of rasagiline and dextromethorphan is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nSNRI/SSRI/tri- and tetracyclic antidepressants \n \nThe concomitant use of rasagiline and fluoxetine or fluvoxamine should be avoided (see section 4.4). \n \nFor concomitant use of rasagiline with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)/selective serotonin-\nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) in clinical trials, see section 4.8. \n \nSerious adverse reactions have been reported with the concomitant use of SSRIs, SNRIs, \ntricyclic/tetracyclic antidepressants and MAO inhibitors. Therefore, in view of the MAO inhibitory \nactivity of rasagiline, antidepressants should be administered with caution.  \n \nAgents that affect CYP1A2 activity \n \nIn vitro metabolism studies have indicated that cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) is the major enzyme \nresponsible for the metabolism of rasagiline.  \n \nCYP1A2 inhibitors \nCo-administration of rasagiline and ciprofloxacin (an inhibitor of CYP1A2) increased the AUC of \nrasagiline by 83%. Co-administration of rasagiline and theophylline (a substrate of CYP1A2) did not \naffect the pharmacokinetics of either product. Thus, potent CYP1A2 inhibitors may alter rasagiline \nplasma levels and should be administered with caution. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n \n\nCYP1A2 inducers \nThere is a risk that the plasma levels of rasagiline in smoking patients could be decreased, due to \ninduction of the metabolising enzyme CYP1A2. \n \nOther cytochrome P450 isoenzymes \n \nIn vitro studies showed that rasagiline at a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/ml (equivalent to a level that is \n160 times the average Cmax ~ 5.9-8.5 ng/ml in Parkinson\u2019s disease patients after 1 mg rasagiline multiple \ndosing), did not inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, \nCYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4 and CYP4A. These results indicate that rasagiline\u2019s therapeutic \nconcentrations are unlikely to cause any clinically significant interference with substrates of these \nenzymes (see section 5.3). \n \nLevodopa and other Parkinson\u2019s disease medicinal products  \n \nIn Parkinson\u2019s disease patients receiving rasagiline as adjunct therapy to chronic levodopa treatment, \nthere was no clinically significant effect of levodopa treatment on rasagiline clearance. \n \nConcomitant administration of rasagiline and entacapone increased rasagiline oral clearance by 28%.  \n \nTyramine/rasagiline interaction \n \nResults of five tyramine challenge studies (in volunteers and Parkinson\u2019s disease patients), together with \nresults of home monitoring of blood pressure after meals (of 464 patients treated with 0.5 or 1 mg/day of \nrasagiline or placebo as adjunct therapy to levodopa for six months without tyramine restrictions), and the \nfact that there were no reports of tyramine/rasagiline interaction in clinical studies conducted without \ntyramine restriction, indicate that rasagiline can be used safely without dietary tyramine restrictions. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of rasagiline in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or \nindirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary \nmeasure, it is preferable to avoid the use of rasagiline during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nNon-clinical data indicate that rasagiline inhibits prolactin secretion and thus, may inhibit lactation. \nIt is not known whether rasagiline is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when \nrasagiline is administered to a breast-feeding mother. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of rasagiline on fertility are available. Non-clinical data indicate that \nrasagiline has no effect on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nIn patients experiencing somnolence/sudden sleep episodes, rasagiline may have major influence on the \nability to drive and use machines. \nPatients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are \nreasonably certain that rasagiline does not affect them adversely. \n \nPatients being treated with rasagiline and presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes must \nbe informed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness may put themselves \nor others at risk of serious injury or death (e.g. operating machines) until they have gained sufficient \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n \n\nexperience with rasagiline and other dopaminergic medications to gauge whether or not it affects their \nmental and/or motor performance adversely. \n \nIf increased somnolence or new episodes of falling asleep during activities of daily living (e.g. watching \ntelevision, passenger in a car, etc.) are experienced at any time during treatment, the patients should not \ndrive or participate in potentially dangerous activities.  \nPatients should not drive, operate machinery, or work at heights during treatment if they have previously \nexperienced somnolence and/or have fallen asleep without warning prior to use of rasagiline.  \n \nPatients should be cautioned about possible additive effects of sedating medicinal products, alcohol, or \nother central nervous system depressants (e.g. benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants) in \ncombination with rasagiline, or when taking concomitant medications that increase plasma levels of \nrasagiline (e.g. ciprofloxacin) (see section 4.4). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn clinical studies in Parkinson's disease patients the most commonly reported adverse reactions were: \nheadache, depression, vertigo, and flu (influenza and rhinitis) in monotherapy; dyskinesia, orthostatic \nhypotension, fall, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and dry mouth in adjunct to levodopa therapy; \nmusculoskeletal pain as back and neck pain, and arthralgia in both regimens. These adverse reactions \nwere not associated with an elevated rate of drug discontinuation.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are listed below in Tables 1 and 2 by system organ class and frequency using the \nfollowing conventions: very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data). \n \nMonotherapy \nThe tabulated list below includes adverse reactions which were reported with a higher incidence in \nplacebo-controlled studies, in patients receiving 1 mg/day rasagiline. \n \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Not known \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n Influenza   \n\nNeoplasms \nbenign, \nmalignant and \nunspecified \n(including cysts \nand polyps) \n\n Skin carcinoma   \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic system \ndisorders \n\n Leucopenia   \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Allergy   \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n  Decreased appetite  \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n Depression, \nHallucinations* \n\n Impulse control \ndisorders* \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache  Cerebrovascular \naccident \n\nSerotonin \nsyndrome*, \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Not known \n\nExcessive daytime \nsleepiness (EDS) \nand sudden sleep \nonset (SOS) \nepisodes* \n\nEye disorders  Conjunctivitis   \nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n Vertigo   \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n Angina pectoris Myocardial \ninfarction \n\n \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n   Hypertension* \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Rhinitis   \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Flatulence   \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n Dermatitis Vesiculobullous \nrash \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n Musculoskeletal \npain, \nNeck pain, \nArthritis \n\n  \n\nRenal and \nurinary disorders \n\n Urinary urgency   \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\n Fever, \nMalaise \n\n  \n\n*See section description of selected adverse reactions \n \nAdjunct Therapy \nThe tabulated list below includes adverse reactions which were reported with a higher incidence in \nplacebo-controlled studies in patients receiving 1 mg/day rasagiline.  \n \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Not known \n\nNeoplasms \nbenign, \nmalignant and \nunspecified \n\n  Skin melanoma*  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n Decreased appetite   \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n Hallucinations*, \nAbnormal dreams \n\nConfusion Impulse control \ndisorders* \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nDyskinesia Dystonia, \nCarpal tunnel \nsyndrome, \nBalance disorder \n\nCerebrovascular \naccident \n\nSerotonin \nsyndrome*, \nExcessive daytime \nsleepiness (EDS) \nand sudden sleep \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Not known \n\nonset (SOS) \nepisodes* \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n  Angina pectoris  \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n Orthostatic \nhypotension* \n\n Hypertension* \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Abdominal pain, \nConstipation, \nNausea and \nvomiting, \nDry mouth \n\n  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n Rash   \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders* \n\n Arthralgia, \nNeck pain \n\n  \n\nInvestigations  Decreased weight   \nInjury, poisoning \nand procedural \ncomplications \n\n Fall   \n\n*See section description of selected adverse reactions \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nOrthostatic hypotension \nIn blinded placebo-controlled studies, severe orthostatic hypotension was reported in one subject (0.3%) \nin the rasagiline arm (adjunct studies), none in the placebo arm. Clinical trial data further suggest that \northostatic hypotension occurs most frequently in the first two months of rasagiline treatment and tends to \ndecrease over time. \n \nHypertension \nRasagiline selectively inhibits MAO-B and is not associated with increased tyramine sensitivity at the \nindicated dose (1 mg/day). In blinded placebo-controlled studies (monotherapy and adjunct) severe \nhypertension was not reported in any subjects in the rasagiline arm. In the post-marketing period, cases of \nelevated blood pressure, including rare serious cases of hypertensive crisis associated with ingestion of \nunknown amounts of tyramine-rich foods, have been reported in patients taking rasagiline. In post-\nmarketing period, there was one case of elevated blood pressure in a patient using the ophthalmic \nvasoconstrictor tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride while taking rasagiline. \n \nImpulse control disorders \nOne case of hypersexuality was reported in monotherapy placebo-controlled study. The following were \nreported during post-marketing exposure with unknown frequency: compulsions, compulsive shopping, \ndermatillomania, dopamine dysregulation syndrome, impulse-control disorder, impulsive behaviour, \nkleptomania, theft, obsessive thoughts, obsessive-compulsive disorder, stereotypy, gambling, pathological \ngambling, libido increased, hypersexuality, psychosexual disorder, sexually inappropriate behaviour. Half \nof the reported ICD cases were assessed as serious. Only single cases of reported cases had not recovered \nat the time they were reported. \n \nExcessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and sudden sleep onset (SOS) episodes \nExcessive daily sleepiness (hypersomnia, lethargy, sedation, sleep attacks, somnolence, sudden onset of \nsleep) can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or other dopaminergic treatments. A \nsimilar pattern of excessive daily sleepiness has been reported post-marketing with rasagiline. \nCases of patients, treated with rasagiline and other dopaminergic medicinal products, falling asleep while \nengaged in activities of daily living have been reported. Although many of these patients reported \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n \n\nsomnolence while on rasagiline with other dopaminergic medicinal products, some perceived that they \nhad no warning signs, such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior \nto the event. Some of these events have been reported more than 1-year after initiation of treatment. \n \nHallucinations \nParkinson\u2019s disease is associated with symptoms of hallucinations and confusion. In post-marketing \nexperience, these symptoms have also been observed in Parkinson\u2019s disease patients treated with \nrasagiline. \n \nSerotonin syndrome \nRasagiline clinical trials did not allow concomitant use of fluoxetine or fluvoxamine with rasagiline, but \nthe following antidepressants and doses were allowed in the rasagiline trials: amitriptyline \u2264 50 mg/daily, \ntrazodone \u2264 100 mg/daily, citalopram \u2264 20 mg/daily, sertraline \u2264 100 mg/daily, and paroxetine \n\u2264 30 mg/daily (see section 4.5). \n \nIn the post-marketing period, cases of potentially life-threating serotonin syndrome associated with \nagitation, confusion, rigidity, pyrexia and myoclonus have been reported by patients treated with \nantidepressants, meperidine, tramadol, methadone, or propoxyphene concomitantly with rasagiline. \n \nMalignant melanoma \nIncidence of skin melanoma in placebo-controlled clinical studies was 2/380 (0.5%) in rasagiline 1 mg as \nadjacent to levodopa therapy group vs. 1/388 (0.3%) incidence in placebo group. Additional cases of \nmalignant melanoma were reported during post-marketing period. These cases were considered serious in \nall reports. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose  \n \nSymptoms \n \nSymptoms reported following overdose of rasagiline in doses ranging from 3 mg to 100 mg included \nhypomania, hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome. \n \nOverdose can be associated with significant inhibition of both MAO-A and MAO-B. In a single-dose \nstudy healthy volunteers received 20 mg/day and in a ten-day study healthy volunteers received \n10 mg/day. Adverse reactions were mild or moderate and not related to rasagiline treatment. In a dose \nescalation study in patients on chronic levodopa therapy treated with 10 mg/day of rasagiline, there were \nreports of cardiovascular adverse reactions (including hypertension and postural hypotension) which \nresolved following treatment discontinuation. These symptoms may resemble those observed with non-\nselective MAO inhibitors. \n \nManagement \n \nThere is no specific antidote. In case of overdose, patients should be monitored and the appropriate \nsymptomatic and supportive therapy instituted. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-Parkinson-Drugs, monoamine oxidase -B inhibitors, ATC code: \nN04BD02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nRasagiline was shown to be a potent, irreversible MAO-B selective inhibitor, which may cause an \nincrease in extracellular levels of dopamine in the striatum. The elevated dopamine level and subsequent \nincreased dopaminergic activity are likely to mediate rasagiline's beneficial effects seen in models of \ndopaminergic motor dysfunction. \n \n1-Aminoindan is an active major metabolite and it is not a MAO-B inhibitor.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy of rasagiline was established in three studies: as monotherapy treatment in study I and as \nadjunct therapy to levodopa in the studies II and III. \n \nMonotherapy \nIn study I, 404 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (138 patients), rasagiline 1 mg/day \n(134 patients) or rasagiline 2 mg/day (132 patients) and were treated for 26 weeks, there was no active \ncomparator. \nIn this study, the primary measure of efficacy was the change from baseline in the total score of the \nUnified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS, parts I-III). The difference between the mean change \nfrom baseline to week 26/termination (LOCF, Last Observation Carried Forward) was statistically \nsignificant (UPDRS, parts I-III: for rasagiline 1 mg compared to placebo -4.2, 95% CI  \n[-5.7, -2.7]; p<0.0001; for rasagiline 2 mg compared to placebo -3.6, 95% CI [-5.0, -2.1]; p<0.0001, \nUPDRS Motor, part II: for rasagiline 1 mg compared to placebo -2.7, 95% CI [-3.87, -1.55], p<0.0001; \nfor rasagiline 2 mg compared to placebo -1.68, 95% CI [-2.85, -0.51], p=0.0050). The effect was evident, \nalthough its magnitude was modest in this patient population with mild disease. There was a significant \nand beneficial effect in quality of life (as assessed by PD-QUALIF scale). \n \nAdjunct therapy \nIn study II, patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (229 patients), or rasagiline 1 mg/day \n(231 patients) or the catechol-O\u2013methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor, entacapone, 200 mg taken along \nwith scheduled doses of levodopa (LD)/decarboxylase inhibitor (227 patients), and were treated for \n18 weeks. In study III, patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (159 patients), rasagiline \n0.5 mg/day (164 patients), or rasagiline 1 mg/day (149 patients), and were treated for 26 weeks.  \nIn both studies, the primary measure of efficacy was the change from baseline to treatment period in the \nmean number of hours that were spent in the \u201cOFF\u201d state during the day (determined from \u201c24-hour\u201d \nhome diaries completed for 3 days prior to each of the assessment visits). \n \nIn study II, the mean difference in the number of hours spent in the \u201cOFF\u201d state compared to placebo was \n-0.78h, 95% CI [-1.18, -0.39], p=0.0001. The mean total daily decrease in the OFF time was similar in the \nentacapone group (-0.80h, 95% CI [-1.20, -0.41], p<0.0001) to that observed in the rasagiline 1 mg group. \nIn study III, the mean difference compared to placebo was -0.94h, 95% CI [-1.36, -0.51], p<0.0001. There \nwas also a statistically significant improvement over placebo with the rasagiline 0.5 mg group, yet the \nmagnitude of improvement was lower. The robustness of the results for the primary efficacy endpoint, \nwas confirmed in a battery of additional statistical models and was demonstrated in three cohorts (ITT, \nper protocol and completers). \nThe secondary measures of efficacy included global assessments of improvement by the examiner, \nActivities of Daily Living (ADL) subscale scores when OFF and UPDRS motor while ON. Rasagiline \nproduced statistically significant benefit compared to placebo.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n \n\nRasagiline is rapidly absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentration (Cmax) in approximately 0.5 hours. \nThe absolute bioavailability of a single rasagiline dose is about 36%.  \nFood does not affect the Tmax of rasagiline, although Cmax and exposure (AUC) are decreased by \napproximately 60% and 20%, respectively, when the medicinal product is taken with a high fat meal. \nBecause AUC is not substantially affected, rasagiline can be administered with or without food. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe mean volume of distribution following a single intravenous dose of rasagiline is 243 l. Plasma protein \nbinding following a single oral dose of 14C-labelled rasagiline is approximately 60 to 70%. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nRasagiline undergoes almost complete biotransformation in the liver prior to excretion. The metabolism \nof rasagiline proceeds through two main pathways: N-dealkylation and/or hydroxylation to yield: 1-\naminoindan, 3-hydroxy-N-propargyl-1 aminoindan and 3-hydroxy-1-aminoindan. In vitro experiments \nindicate that both routes of rasagiline metabolism are dependent on cytochrome P450 system, with \nCYP1A2 being the major iso-enzyme involved in rasagiline metabolism. Conjugation of rasagiline and its \nmetabolites was also found to be a major elimination pathway to yield glucuronides. Ex vivo and in vitro \nexperiments demonstrate that rasagiline is neither inhibitor nor inducer of major CYP450 enzymes (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nElimination \n \nAfter oral administration of 14C-labelled rasagiline, elimination occurred primarily via urine (62.6%) and \nsecondarily via faeces (21.8%), with a total recovery of 84.4% of the dose over a period of 38 days. Less \nthan 1% of rasagiline is excreted as unchanged product in urine. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nRasagiline pharmacokinetics is linear with dose over the range of 0.5-2 mg in Parkinson\u2019s disease \npatients. Its terminal half-life is 0.6-2 hours. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIn subjects with mild hepatic impairment, AUC and Cmax were increased by 80% and 38%, respectively. \nIn subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, AUC and Cmax were increased by 568% and 83%, \nrespectively (see section 4.4).  \n \nRenal impairment \n \nRasagiline's pharmacokinetics characteristics in subjects with mild (CLcr 50-80 ml/min) and moderate \n(CLcr 30-49 ml/min) renal impairment were similar to healthy subjects. \n \nElderly \n \nAge has little influence on rasagiline pharmacokinetics in the elderly (> 65 years) (see section 4.2) \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on the standard studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproduction and development. \n \nRasagiline did not present genotoxic potential in vivo and in several in vitro systems using bacteria or \nhepatocytes.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Rasagiline ratiopharm is and what it is used for \n \nRasagiline ratiopharm contains the active substance rasagiline and it is used for the treatment of \nParkinson\u2019s disease in adults. It can be used together with or without Levodopa (another medicine that is \nused to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease). \n \nWith Parkinson\u2019s disease, there is a loss of cells that produce dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a \nchemical in the brain involved in movement control. Rasagiline ratiopharm helps to increase and sustain \nlevels of dopamine in the brain. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Rasagiline ratiopharm \n \nDo not take Rasagiline ratiopharm \n- If you are allergic to rasagiline or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n- If you have severe liver problems.  \n \nDo not take the following medicines while taking Rasagiline ratiopharm: \n- Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (e.g. for treatment of depression or Parkinson\u2019s disease, or \n\nused for any other indication), including medicinal and natural products without prescription e.g. \nSt. John's Wort. \n\n- Pethidine (a strong pain killer). \nYou must wait at least 14 days after stopping Rasagiline ratiopharm treatment and starting treatment with \nMAO inhibitors or pethidine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Rasagiline ratiopharm \n- If you have any liver problems \n- You should speak with your doctor about any suspicious skin changes. \n \nTell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing unusual behaviours where \nyou cannot resist the impulse, urges or cravings to carry out certain harmful or detrimental activities to \nyourself or others. These are called impulse control disorders. In patients taking Rasagiline ratiopharm \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n \n\nand/or other medicines used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease, behaviours such as compulsions, obsessive \nthoughts, addictive gambling, excessive spending, impulsive behaviour and an abnormally high sex drive \nor an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings have been observed. Your doctor may need to adjust or stop \nyour dose (see section 4). \n \nRasagiline ratiopharm may cause drowsiness and may cause you to suddenly fall asleep \nduring day time activities, especially if you are taking other dopaminergic medicinal \nproducts (used for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease). For further information please \nrefer to section driving and using machines. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThere is no relevant use of Rasagiline ratiopharm in children and adolescents. Therefore, Rasagiline \nratiopharm is not recommended for use under the age of 18. \n \nOther medicines and Rasagiline ratiopharm \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nEspecially tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n- Certain antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective serotonin-norepinephrine \n\nreuptake inhibitors, tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants)  \n- The antibiotic ciprofloxacin used against infections \n- The cough suppressant dextromethorphan \n- Sympathomimetics such as those present in eye drops, nasal and oral decongestants and cold \n\nmedicine containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine \nThe use of Rasagiline ratiopharm together with the antidepressants containing fluoxetine or fluvoxamine \nshould be avoided. \nIf you are starting treatment with Rasagiline ratiopharm, you should wait at least 5 weeks after stopping \nfluoxetine treatment. \nIf you are starting treatment with fluoxetine or fluvoxamine, you should wait at least 14 days after \nstopping Rasagiline ratiopharm treatment. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are smoking or intend to stop smoking. Smoking could decrease the \namount of Rasagiline ratiopharm in the blood. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  \n \nYou should avoid taking Rasagiline ratiopharm if you are pregnant, as the effects of Rasagiline \nratiopharm on pregnancy and the unborn child are not known. \n \nDriving and using machines \nAsk your doctor for advice before you drive and operate machines, since Parkinson\u2019s disease itself as \nwell as the treatment with Rasagiline ratiopharm may influence your ability to do so. Rasagiline \nratiopharm can make you feel dizzy or drowsy; it can also cause episodes of sudden sleep onset. \nThis might be enhanced if you take other medicines to treat the symptoms of your Parkinson\u2019s disease, or \nif you take medicines which can make you feel drowsy, or if you drink alcohol while taking Rasagiline \nratiopharm. If you have experienced somnolence and/or episodes of sudden sleep onset before, or while \ntaking Rasagiline ratiopharm do not drive or operate machinery (see section 2). \n \n \n3. How to take Rasagiline ratiopharm \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n \n\nThe recommended dose of Rasagiline ratiopharm is 1 tablet of 1 mg taken by mouth once daily. \nRasagiline ratiopharm may be taken with or without food.  \n \nIf you take more Rasagiline ratiopharm than you should \nIf you think that you may have taken too many Rasagiline ratiopharm tablets, contact your doctor or \npharmacist immediately. Take the Rasagiline ratiopharm carton/ blister or bottle with you to show the \ndoctor or pharmacist. \n \nSymptoms reported following overdose of Rasagiline ratiopharm included slightly euphoric mood (light \nform of mania), extremely high blood pressure and serotonin syndrome (see section 4). \n \nIf you forget to take Rasagiline ratiopharm \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Take the next dose normally, when it is time \nto take it. \n \nIf you stop taking Rasagiline ratiopharm \nDo not stop taking Rasagiline ratiopharm without first talking to your doctor.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
