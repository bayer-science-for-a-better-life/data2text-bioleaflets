NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nTRAVATAN 40 micrograms/mL eye drops, solution \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach mL of solution contains 40 micrograms of travoprost. \n\n \n\nExcipient(s) with known effect: \n\n \n\nEach mL of solution contains polyquaternium-1 (POLYQUAD) 10 microgram, propylene glycol \n\n7.5 mg, polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 40 (HCO-40) 2 mg (see section 4.4.) \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nEye drops, solution. (eye drops) \n\n \n\nClear, colourless solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nDecrease of elevated intraocular pressure in adult patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle \n\nglaucoma (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nDecrease of elevated intraocular pressure in paediatric patients aged 2 months to < 18 years with \n\nocular hypertension or paediatric glaucoma (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nUse in adults, including elderly population \n\nThe dose is one drop of TRAVATAN in the conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s) once daily. \n\nOptimal effect is obtained if the dose is administered in the evening. \n\n \n\nNasolacrimal occlusion or gently closing the eyelid after administration is recommended. This may \n\nreduce the systemic absorption of medicinal products administered via the ocular route and result in a \n\ndecrease in systemic adverse reactions. \n\n \n\nIf more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used, the medicinal products must be \n\nadministered at least 5 minutes apart (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nIf a dose is missed, treatment should be continued with the next dose as planned. The dose should not \n\nexceed one drop in the affected eye(s) daily. \n\n \n\nWhen substituting another ophthalmic antiglaucoma medicinal product with TRAVATAN, the other \n\nmedicinal product should be discontinued and TRAVATAN should be started the following day. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n  \n\nHepatic and renal impairment \n\nTRAVATAN has been studied in patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment and in patients with \n\nmild to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance as low as 14 ml/min). No dosage adjustment is \n\nnecessary in these patients (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nTRAVATAN can be used in paediatric patients from 2 months to < 18 years at the same posology as \n\nin adults. However, data in the age group 2 months to < 3 years (9 patients) is limited (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of TRAVATAN in children below the age of 2 months have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of Administration \n\n \n\nFor ocular use. \n\n \n\nFor patients who wear contact lenses, please refer to section 4.4. \n\n \n\nThe patient should remove the protective overwrap immediately prior to initial use. To prevent \n\ncontamination of the dropper tip and solution, care must be taken not to touch the eyelids, surrounding \n\nareas or other surfaces with the dropper tip of the bottle. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nEye colour change \n\n \n\nTRAVATAN may gradually change the eye colour by increasing the number of melanosomes \n\n(pigment granules) in melanocytes. Before treatment is instituted, patients must be informed of the \n\npossibility of a permanent change in eye colour. Unilateral treatment can result in permanent \n\nheterochromia. The long term effects on the melanocytes and any consequences thereof are currently \n\nunknown. The change in iris colour occurs slowly and may not be noticeable for months to years. The \n\nchange in eye colour has predominantly been seen in patients with mixed coloured irides, i.e., \n\nblue-brown, grey-brown, yellow-brown and green-brown; however, it has also been observed in \n\npatients with brown eyes. Typically, the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically \n\ntowards the periphery in affected eyes, but the entire iris or parts of it may be become more brownish. \n\nAfter discontinuation of therapy, no further increase in brown iris pigment has been observed. \n\n \n\nPeriorbital and eye lid changes \n\n \n\nIn controlled clinical trials, periorbital and/or eyelid skin darkening in association with the use of \n\nTRAVATAN has been reported in 0.4% of patients. Periorbital and lid changes including deepening \n\nof the eyelid sulcus have also been observed with prostaglandin analogues. \n\n \n\nTRAVATAN may gradually change eyelashes in the treated eye(s); these changes were observed in \n\nabout half of the patients in clinical trials and include: increased length, thickness, pigmentation, \n\nand/or number of lashes. The mechanism of eyelash changes and their long term consequences are \n\ncurrently unknown. \n\n \n\nTRAVATAN has been shown to cause slight enlargement of the palpebral fissure in studies in the \n\nmonkey. However, this effect was not observed during the clinical trials and is considered to be \n\nspecies specific. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n  \n\nThere is no experience of TRAVATAN in inflammatory ocular conditions; nor in neovascular, \n\nangle-closure, narrow-angle or congenital glaucoma and only limited experience in thyroid eye \n\ndisease, in open-angle glaucoma of pseudophakic patients and in pigmentary or pseudoexfoliative \n\nglaucoma. TRAVATAN should therefore be used with caution in patients with active intraocular \n\ninflammation. \n\n \n\nAphakic patients \n\n \n\nMacular oedema has been reported during treatment with prostaglandin F2a analogues. Caution is \n\nrecommended when using Travatan in aphakic patients, pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior \n\nlens capsule or anterior chamber lenses, or in patients with known risk factors for cystoid macular \n\noedema. \n\n \n\nIritis/uveitis \n\n \n\nIn patients with known predisposing risk factors for iritis/uveitis, TRAVATAN should be used with \n\ncaution. \n\n \n\nContact with the skin \n\n \n\nSkin contact with TRAVATAN must be avoided as transdermal absorption of travoprost has been \n\ndemonstrated in rabbits. \n\n \n\nProstaglandins and prostaglandin analogues are biologically active materials that may be absorbed \n\nthrough the skin. Women who are pregnant or attempting to become pregnant should exercise \n\nappropriate precautions to avoid direct exposure to the contents of the bottle. In the unlikely event of \n\ncoming in contact with a substantial portion of the contents of the bottle, thoroughly cleanse the \n\nexposed area immediately. \n\n \n\nContact lenses \n\n \n\nPatients must be instructed to remove contact lenses prior to application of TRAVATAN and wait \n\n15 minutes after instillation of the dose before reinsertion. \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\n \n\nTRAVATAN contains propylene glycol which may cause skin irritation. \n\nTRAVATAN contains polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 40 which may cause skin reactions. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nEfficacy and safety data in the age group 2 months to < 3 years (9 patients) is limited (see section 5.1). \n\nNo data are available for children below the age of 2 months. \n\n \n\nIn children < 3 years old that mainly suffer from PCG (primary congenital glaucoma), surgery (e.g. \n\ntrabeculotomy/goniotomy) remains the first line treatment. \n\n \n\nNo long-term safety data are available in the paediatric population. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n  \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of child-bearing potential/contraception \n\n \n\nTRAVATAN must not be used in women of child bearing age/potential unless adequate contraceptive \n\nmeasures are in place (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nTravoprost has harmful pharmacological effects on pregnancy and/or the fetus/new-born child. \n\nTRAVATAN should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n\n \n\nBreastfeeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether travoprost from the eye drops is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies \n\nhave shown excretion of travoprost and metabolites in breast milk. The use of TRAVATAN by \n\nbreast-feeding mothers is not recommended. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no data on the effects of TRAVATAN on human fertility. Animal studies showed no effect \n\nof travoprost on fertility at doses more than 250 times the maximum recommended human ocular \n\ndose. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nTRAVATAN has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines, however as with \n\nany eye drop, temporary blurred vision or other visual disturbances may affect the ability to drive or \n\nuse machines. If blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient must wait until the vision clears before \n\ndriving or using machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials with TRAVATAN, the most common adverse reactions were ocular hypearemia \n\nand iris hyperpigmentation, occurring in approximately 20% and 6% of patients respectively. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions are classified according to the following convention: very \n\ncommon (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 \n\nto<1/1,000), very rare <1/10,000), or not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the \n\navailable data). Within each frequency group, adverse reactions are presented in decreasing \n\norder of seriousness. The adverse reactions were obtained from clinical studies and post- \n\nmarketing data with TRAVATAN. \n\n\n\n6 \n  \n\n \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse Reactions \n\nImmune system disorders Uncommon hypersensitivity, seasonal allergy \n\nPsychiatric disorders Not known depression, anxiety, insomnia \n\nNervous system disorder Uncommon headache \n\nRare dizziness, visual field defect, dysgeusia \n\nEye disorders Very common ocular hyperaemia \n\nCommon iris hyperpigmentation, eye pain, ocular \n\ndiscomfort, dry eye, eye pruritus, eye \n\nirritation  \n\nUncommon corneal erosion, uveitis, iritis, anterior chamber \n\ninflammation, keratitis, punctate keratitis, \n\nphotophobia, eye discharge , blepharitis, erythema \n\nof eyelid, periorbital oedema, eyelids pruritus, \n\nvisual acuity reduced, vision blurred, lacrimation \n\nincreased, conjunctivitis, ectropion, cataract, eyelid \n\nmargin crusting, growth of eyelashes \n\nRare iridocyclitis, ophthalmic herpes simplex, eye \n\ninflammation, photopsia, eczema eyelids, \n\nconjunctival oedema, halo vision, conjunctival \n\nfollicles, hypoaesthesia eye, trichiasis, \n\nmeibomianitis, anterior chamber pigmentation, \n\nmydriasis, asthenopia, eyelash hyperpigmentation, \n\neyelash thickening \n\nNot known macular oedema, lid sulcus deepened \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders Not known vertigo, tinnitus \n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon palpitations \n\nRare heart rate irregular, heart rate decreased \n\nNot known chest pain, bradycardia, tachycardia, \n\narrhythmia \n\nVascular disorders Rare blood pressure diastolic decreased, blood \n\npressure systolic increased, hypotension, \n\nhypertension \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \n\nand mediastinal \n\ndisorders \n\nUncommon cough, nasal congestion, throat irritation \n\nRare dyspnoea, asthma, respiratory disorder, \n\noropharyngeal pain, dysphonia, rhinitis \n\nallergic, nasal dryness \n\nNot known asthma aggravated, epistaxis \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Rare peptic ulcer reactivated, gastrointestinal \n\ndisorder, constipation, dry mouth \n\nNot known diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders \n\nUncommon skin hyperpigmentation (periocular), skin \n\ndiscolouration, hair texture abnormal, \n\nhypertrichosis \n\nRare dermatitis allergic, dermatitis contact, \n\nerythema, rash, hair colour changes, \n\nmadarosis \n\nNot known pruritus, hair growth abnormal \n\nMusculoskeletal and \n\nconnective tissue disorders \n\nRare musculoskeletal pain, arthralgia \n\n\n\n7 \n  \n\nRenal and urinary \n\ndisorders \n\nNot known dysuria, urinary incontinence \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site \n\nconditions  \n\nRare asthenia \n\nInvestigations Not known prostatic specific antigen increased \n\n \n\nPaediatric Population \n\n \n\nIn a 3 month phase 3 study and a 7 days pharmacokinetic study, involving 102 paediatric patients \n\nexposed to TRAVATAN, the types and characteristics of adverse reactions reported were similar to \n\nwhat has been observed in adult patients. The short-term safety profiles in the different paediatric \n\nsubsets were also similar (see section 5.1). The most frequent adverse reactions reported in the \n\npaediatric population were ocular hyperaemia (16.9%) and growth of eyelashes (6.5%). In a similar \n\n3 month study in adult patients, these events occurred at an incidence of 11.4% and 0.0%, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\nAdditional adverse drug reactions reported in paediatric patients in the 3 month paediatric study \n\n(n=77) compared to a similar trial in adults (n=185) included erythema of eyelid, keratitis, lacrimation \n\nincreased, and photophobia all reported as single events with an incidence of 1.3% versus 0.0% seen \n\nin adults. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nNo cases of overdose have been reported. A topical overdose is not likely to occur or to be associated \n\nwith toxicity. A topical overdose of TRAVATAN may be flushed from the eye(s) with lukewarm \n\nwater. Treatment of a suspected oral ingestion is symptomatic and supportive. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals-antiglaucoma preparations and miotics-prostaglandin \n\nanalogues \n\nATC code: S01E E04 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nTravoprost, a prostaglandin F2 analogue, is a highly selective full agonist which has a high affinity for \n\nthe prostaglandin FP receptor, and reduces the intraocular pressure by increasing the outflow of \n\naqueous humour via trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral pathways. Reduction of the intraocular \n\npressure in man starts about 2 hours after administration and maximum effect is reached after \n\n12 hours. Significant lowering of intraocular pressure can be maintained for periods exceeding \n\n24 hours with a single dose. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n  \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nIn a clinical trial, patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who were treated with \n\nTRAVATAN (polyquaternium-preserved) dosed once-daily in the evening demonstrated 8 to 9 mmHg \n\nreductions (approximately 33%) in intraocular pressure from 24 to 26 mmHg baseline. Data on \n\nadjunctive administration of TRAVATAN with timolol 0.5% and limited data with brimonidine 0.2% \n\nwere collected during clinical trials that showed an additive effect of TRAVATAN with these \n\nglaucoma medications. No clinical data are available on adjunctive use with other ocular hypotensive \n\nmedications. \n\n \n\nSecondary pharmacology \n\n \n\nTravoprost significantly increased optic nerve head blood flow in rabbits following 7 days of topical \n\nocular administration (1.4 micrograms, once-daily). \n\n \n\nTRAVATAN preserved with polyquaternium-1 induced minimal ocular surface toxicity, compared to \n\neye drops preserved with benzalkonium chloride, on cultured human corneal cells and following \n\ntopical ocular administration in rabbits. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of TRAVATAN in paediatric patients from 2 months to less than 18 years of age was \n\ndemonstrated in a 12-week, double-masked clinical study of travoprost compared with timolol in \n\n152 patients diagnosed with ocular hypertension or paediatric glaucoma. Patients received either \n\ntravoprost 0.004% once daily or timolol 0.5% (or 0.25% for subjects younger than 3 years old) twice \n\ndaily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the intraocular pressure (IOP) change from baseline at \n\nWeek 12 of the study. Mean IOP reductions in the travoprost and timolol groups were similar (see \n\nTable 1). \n\n \n\nIn the age groups 3 to < 12 years (n=36) and 12 to < 18 years (n=26), mean IOP reduction at Week 12 \n\nin the travoprost group was similar to that in the timolol group. Mean IOP reduction at Week 12 in the \n\n2 months to < 3 years of age group was 1.8 mmHg in the travoprost group and 7.3 mmHg in the \n\ntimolol group. IOP reductions for this group were based on only 6 patients in the timolol group and \n\n9 patients in the travoprost group where 4 patients in the travoprost group versus 0 patients in the \n\ntimolol group had no relevant mean IOP reduction at Week 12. No data are available for children less \n\nthan 2 months old. \n\n \n\nThe effect on IOP was seen after the second week of treatment and was consistently maintained \n\nthroughout the 12 week period of study for all age groups. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Comparison of Mean IOP Change from Baseline (mmHg) at Week 12 \n\n \n\nTravoprost Timolol   \n\n N \n\nMean \n\n(SE) N \n\nMean \n\n(SE) \n\nMean \n\nDifferencea (95% CI) \n\n 53 -6.4 \n\n(1.05) \n\n60 -5.8 \n\n(0.96) \n\n-0.5 (-2.1, 1.0) \n\nSE = Standard Error; CI = Confidence Interval; \naMean difference is Travoprost – Timolol. Estimates based on least squares means \n\nderived from a statistical model that accounts for correlated IOP measurements within \n\npatient where primary diagnosis and baseline IOP stratum are in the model.  \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n  \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nTravoprost is an ester prodrug. It is absorbed through the cornea where the isopropyl ester is \n\nhydrolysed to the active free acid. Studies in rabbits have shown peak concentrations of 20 ng/mL of \n\nthe free acid in aqueous humour one to two hours after topical dosing of TRAVATAN. Aqueous \n\nhumour concentrations declined with a half-life of approximately 1.5 hours. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nFollowing topical ocular administration of TRAVATAN to healthy volunteers, low systemic exposure \n\nto active free acid was demonstrated. Peak active free acid plasma concentrations of 25 pg/mL or less \n\nwere observed between 10 and 30 minutes post-dose. Thereafter, plasma levels declined rapidly to \n\nbelow the 10 pg/mL assay quantitation limit before 1 hour post-administration. Due to the low plasma \n\nconcentrations and rapid elimination following topical dosing, the elimination half-life of active free \n\nacid in man could not be determined. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nMetabolism is the major route of elimination of both travoprost and the active free acid. The systemic \n\nmetabolic pathways parallel those of endogenous prostaglandin F2 which are characterised by \n\nreduction of the 13-14 double bond, oxidation of the 15-hydroxyl and -oxidative cleavages of the \n\nupper side chain. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nTravoprost free acid and its metabolites are mainly excreted by the kidneys. TRAVATAN has been \n\nstudied in patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment and in patients with mild to severe renal \n\nimpairment (creatinine clearance as low as 14 ml/min). No dosage adjustment is necessary in these \n\npatients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nA pharmacokinetic study in paediatric patients aged 2 months to < 18 years demonstrated very low \n\nplasma exposure to travoprost free acid, with concentrations ranging from below the 10 pg/mL assay \n\nlimt of quantitation (BLQ) to 54.5 pg/mL. In 4 previous systemic pharmacokinetic studies in adult \n\npopulations, travoprost free acid plasma concentrations ranged from BLQ to 52.0 pg/mL. While most \n\nof the plasma data across all studies was non-quantifiable, making statistical comparisons of systemic \n\nexposure across age groups unfeasible, the overall trend shows that plasma exposure to travoprost free \n\nacid following topical administration of TRAVATAN is extremely low across all age groups \n\nevaluated. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nIn ocular toxicity studies in monkeys, administration of travoprost at a dose of 0.45 microgram, twice \n\na day, was shown to induce increased palpebral fissure. Topical ocular administration of travoprost to \n\nmonkeys at concentrations of up to 0.012% to the right eye, twice daily for one year resulted in no \n\nsystemic toxicity. \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n  \n\nReproduction toxicity studies have been undertaken in rat, mice and rabbit by systemic route. Findings \n\nare related to FP receptor agonist activity in uterus with early embryolethality, post-implantation loss, \n\nfoetotoxicity. In pregnant rat, systemic administration of travoprost at doses more than 200 times the \n\nclinical dose during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of malformations. \n\nLow levels of radioactivity were measured in amniotic fluid and foetal tissues of pregnant rats \n\nadministered 3H-travoprost. Reproduction and development studies have demonstrated a potent effect \n\non foetal loss with a high rate observed in rats and mice (180 pg/ml and 30 pg/ml plasma, \n\nrespectively) at exposures 1.2 to 6 times the clinical exposure (up to 25 pg/ml). \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What TRAVATAN is and what it is used for \n \n\nTRAVATAN contains travoprost, one of a group of medicines called prostaglandin analogues. It \n\nworks by reducing the pressure in the eye. It may be used on its own or with other drops e.g. \n\nbeta-blockers, which also reduce pressure. \n\n \n\nTRAVATAN is used to reduce high pressure in the eye in adults, adolescents and children from \n\n2 months old onward. This pressure can lead to an illness called glaucoma. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use TRAVATAN \n\n \n\nDo not use TRAVATAN \n\n If you are allergic to travoprost or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor for advice if this applies to you. \n\n \n\nWarning and Precautions \n\n TRAVATAN may increase the length, thickness, colour and/or number of your eyelashes. \nChanges in the eyelids including unusual hair growth or in the tissues around the eye have also \n\nbeen observed. \n\n TRAVATAN may change the colour of your iris (the coloured part of your eye). This change \nmay be permanent. A change in the colour of the skin around the eye may also occur. \n\n If you have had cataract surgery, talk to your doctor before you use TRAVATAN. \n\n If you have current or previous history of an eye inflammation (iritis and uveitis), talk to your \ndoctor before you use TRAVATAN. \n\n TRAVATAN may rarely cause breathlessness or wheezing or increase the symptoms of \nasthma. If you are concerned about changes in your breathing pattern when using TRAVATAN \n\nadvise your doctor as soon as possible. \n\n Travoprost may be absorbed through the skin. If any of the medicinal product comes into \ncontact with the skin, it should be washed off straight away. This is especially important in \n\nwomen who are pregnant or are attempting to become pregnant. \n\n\n\n23 \n  \n\n If you wear soft contact lenses, do not use the drops with your lenses in. After using the drops \nwait 15 minutes before putting your lenses back in. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nTRAVATAN can be used in children from 2 months to < 18 years at the same dose as for adults. Use \n\nof TRAVATAN is not recommended to those children under 2 months of age. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and TRAVATAN \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or used any other medicines. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast feeding and fertility \n\nDo not use TRAVATAN if you are pregnant. If you think that you may be pregnant speak with your \n\ndoctor right away. If you could become pregnant you must use adequate contraception whilst you use \n\nTRAVATAN. \n\n \n\nDo not use TRAVATAN if you are breast feeding. TRAVATAN may get into your milk. \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor for advice before taking any medicine \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nYou may find that your vision is blurred for a time just after you use TRAVATAN. Do not drive or \n\nuse machines until this has worn off. \n\n \n\nTRAVATAN contains hydrogenated castor oil and propylene glycol which may cause skin \n\nreactions and irritation. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use TRAVATAN \n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or the doctor treating your child has told you. You \n\nshould check with your doctor, the doctor treating your child or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is \n\nOne drop in the affected eye or eyes, once a day - in the evening. \n\nOnly use TRAVATAN in both eyes if your doctor told you to. Use it for as long as your doctor or the \n\ndoctor treating your child told you to. \n\n \n\nOnly use TRAVATAN for dropping in your or your child’s eye(s). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 1 2 3 4 \n\n \n\n Immediately before using a bottle for the first time, tear open the overwrap pouch, take the \nbottle out (picture 1) and write the date of opening on the carton in the space provided \n\n Wash your hands \n\n Twist off the cap \n\n Hold the bottle, pointing down, between your thumb and fingers \n\n Tilt your head or your child’s head gently back. Pull down the eyelid with a clean finger, until \nthere is a ‘pocket’ between the eyelid and the eye. The drop will go in here (picture 2) \n\n Bring the bottle tip close to the eye. Use a mirror if it helps \n\n\n\n24 \n  \n\n Do not touch the eye or eyelid, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper. It \ncould infect the drops \n\n Gently squeeze the bottle to release one drop of TRAVATAN at a time. (picture 3) \n\n After using TRAVATAN, keep the eyelid closed, apply gentle pressure by pressing a finger into \nthe corner of the eye, by the nose (picture 4) for at least 1 minute. This helps to stop \n\nTRAVATAN getting into the rest of the body \n\n If you use drops in both eyes, repeat the steps for the other eye \n\n Close the bottle cap firmly immediately after use \n\n Only use one bottle at a time. Do not open the pouch until you need to use the bottle. \n \n\nIf a drop misses the eye, try again. \n\n \n\nIf you or your child are using other eye preparations such as eye drop or eye ointment, wait for at \n\nleast 5 minutes between putting in TRAVATAN and the other eye preparations. \n\n \n\nIf you or your child receive more TRAVATAN than you should \n\nRinse all the medicine out with warm water. Don’t put in any more drops until it’s time for the next \n\nregular dose. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use TRAVATAN \n\nContinue with the next dose as planned. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\nNever use more than one drop in the affected eye(s) in a single day. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using TRAVATAN \nDo not stop using TRAVATAN without first speaking to your doctor or the doctor treating your child, \n\nthe pressure in your eye or your child’s eye will not be controlled which could lead to loss of sight. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, the doctor treating your \n\nchild or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nNow turn over  \n \n\n \n\n4.
