CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nRenal cell carcinoma (RCC) \n\n \n\nVotrient is indicated in adults for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and \n\nfor patients who have received prior cytokine therapy for advanced disease. \n\n \n\nSoft-tissue sarcoma (STS) \n\n \n\nVotrient is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with selective subtypes of advanced soft-tissue \n\nsarcoma (STS) who have received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease or who have progressed \n\nwithin 12 months after (neo) adjuvant therapy. \n\n \n\nEfficacy and safety has only been established in certain STS histological tumour subtypes (see \n\nsection 5.1). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nVotrient treatment should only be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of \n\nanti-cancer medicinal products. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nAdults \n\nThe recommended dose of pazopanib for the treatment of RCC or STS is 800 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nDose modifications \n\nDose modification (decrease or increase) should be in 200 mg decrements or increments in a stepwise \n\nfashion based on individual tolerability in order to manage adverse reactions. The dose of pazopanib \n\nshould not exceed 800 mg. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nPazopanib should not be used in children younger than 2 years of age because of safety concerns with \n\nregard to organ growth and maturation (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of pazopanib in children aged 2 to 18 years of age have not yet been \n\nestablished. No data are available (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nThere are limited data on the use of pazopanib in patients aged 65 years and older. In the RCC studies \n\nof pazopanib, overall no clinically significant differences in safety of pazopanib were observed \n\nbetween subjects aged at least 65 years and younger subjects. Clinical experience has not identified \n\ndifferences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some \n\nelderly patients cannot be ruled out. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nRenal impairment is unlikely to have a clinically relevant effect on pazopanib pharmacokinetics given \n\nthe low renal excretion of pazopanib and metabolites (see section 5.2). Therefore, no dose adjustment \n\nis required in patients with creatinine clearance above 30 ml/min. Caution is advised in patients with \n\ncreatinine clearance below 30 ml/min as there is no experience of pazopanib in this patient population. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nDosing recommendations in hepatically impaired patients are based on pharmacokinetic studies of \n\npazopanib in patients with varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction (see section 5.2). All patients should \n\nhave liver function tests to determine whether they have hepatic impairment before starting and during \n\npazopanib therapy (see section 4.4). Administration of pazopanib to patients with mild or moderate \n\nhepatic impairment should be undertaken with caution and close monitoring of tolerability. 800 mg \n\npazopanib once daily is the recommended dose in patients with mild abnormalities in serum liver tests \n\n(defined either as normal bilirubin and any degree of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation or as \n\nan elevation of bilirubin (>35% direct) up to 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) regardless of the ALT \n\nvalue). A reduced pazopanib dose of 200 mg once daily is recommended in patients with moderate \n\nhepatic impairment (defined as an elevation of bilirubin >1.5 to 3 x ULN regardless of the ALT value) \n\n(see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPazopanib is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (defined as total bilirubin \n\n>3 x ULN regardless of the ALT value). \n\n \n\nSee section 4.4 for liver monitoring and dose modification for patients with drug-induced \n\nhepatotoxicity. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nPazopanib is for oral use. It should be taken without food, at least one hour before or two hours after a \n\nmeal (see section 5.2). The film-coated tablets should be taken whole with water and not broken or \n\ncrushed (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nHepatic effects \n\n \n\nCases of hepatic failure (including fatalities) have been reported during use of pazopanib. \n\nAdministration of pazopanib to patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment should be \n\nundertaken with caution and close monitoring. 800 mg pazopanib once daily is the recommended dose \n\nin patients with mild abnormalities in serum liver tests (either normal bilirubin and any degree of ALT \n\nelevation or elevation of bilirubin up to 1.5 x ULN regardless of the ALT value). A reduced pazopanib \n\ndose of 200 mg once daily is recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (elevation of \n\nbilirubin >1.5 to 3 x ULN regardless of the ALT value) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Pazopanib is not \n\nrecommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 x ULN regardless of the \n\nALT value) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Exposure at a 200 mg dose is markedly reduced, though highly \n\nvariable, in these patients, with values considered insufficient to obtain a clinically relevant effect. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies with pazopanib, increase in serum transaminases (ALT, aspartate aminotransferase \n\n[AST]) and bilirubin were observed (see section 4.8). In the majority of the cases, isolated increases in \n\nALT and AST have been reported, without concomitant elevations of alkaline phosphatase or \n\nbilirubin. Patients over 60 years of age may be at greater risk for mild (>3 x ULN) to severe \n\n(>8 x ULN) elevation of ALT. Patients who carry the HLA-B*57:01 allele have an increased risk of \n\npazopanib-associated ALT elevations. Liver function should be monitored in all subjects receiving \n\npazopanib, regardless of genotype or age (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nSerum liver tests should be performed before initiation of treatment with pazopanib, at weeks 3, 5, 7 \n\nand 9, then at months 3 and 4, with additional tests as clinically indicated. Periodic testing should then \n\ncontinue after month 4. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nSee Table 1 for dose modification guidance for patients with baseline values of total bilirubin \n\n1.5 x ULN and AST and ALT 2 x ULN: \n\n \n\nTable 1 Dose modifications for drug-induced hepatotoxicity \n\n \n\nLiver test values Dose modification \n\nTransaminase elevation \n\nbetween 3 and 8 x ULN \n\nContinue on pazopanib with weekly monitoring of liver function \n\nuntil transaminases return to Grade 1 or baseline. \n\nTransaminase elevation of \n\n>8 x ULN \n\nInterrupt pazopanib until transaminases return to Grade 1 or \n\nbaseline. \n\nIf the potential benefit of reinitiating pazopanib treatment is \n\nconsidered to outweigh the risk for hepatotoxicity, then \n\nreintroduce pazopanib at a reduced dose of 400 mg daily and \n\nperform serum liver tests weekly for 8 weeks. Following \n\nreintroduction of pazopanib, if transaminase elevations >3 x ULN \n\nrecur, then pazopanib should be permanently discontinued. \n\nTransaminase elevations \n\n>3 x ULN concurrently with \n\nbilirubin elevations >2 x ULN \n\nPermanently discontinue pazopanib. \n\nPatients should be monitored until return to Grade 1 or baseline. \n\nPazopanib is a UGT1A1 inhibitor. Mild, indirect (unconjugated) \n\nhyperbilirubinaemia may occur in patients with Gilbert’s \n\nsyndrome. Patients with only a mild indirect hyperbilirubinaemia, \n\nknown or suspected Gilbert’s syndrome, and elevation in ALT \n\n>3 x ULN should be managed as per the recommendations \n\noutlined for isolated ALT elevations. \n\n \n\nConcomitant use of pazopanib and simvastatin increases the risk of ALT elevations (see section 4.5) \n\nand should be undertaken with caution and close monitoring. \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies with pazopanib, events of hypertension including newly diagnosed symptomatic \n\nepisodes of elevated blood pressure (hypertensive crisis) have occurred. Blood pressure should be well \n\ncontrolled prior to initiating pazopanib. Patients should be monitored for hypertension early after \n\nstarting treatment (no longer than one week after starting pazopanib) and frequently thereafter to \n\nensure blood pressure control. Elevated blood pressure levels (systolic blood pressure ≥150 mm Hg or \n\ndiastolic blood pressure ≥100 mm Hg) occurred early in the course of treatment (approximately 40% \n\nof cases occurred by day 9 and approximately 90% of cases occurred in the first 18 weeks). Blood \n\npressure should be monitored and managed promptly using a combination of anti-hypertensive therapy \n\nand dose modification of pazopanib (interruption and re-initiation at a reduced dose based on clinical \n\njudgement) (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Pazopanib should be discontinued if there is evidence of \n\nhypertensive crisis or if hypertension is severe and persists despite anti-hypertensive therapy and \n\npazopanib dose reduction. \n\n \n\nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)/Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy \n\nsyndrome (RPLS) \n\n \n\nPRES/RPLS has been reported in association with pazopanib. PRES/RPLS can present with headache, \n\nhypertension, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness and other visual and neurological disturbances, \n\nand can be fatal. Patients developing PRES/RPLS should permanently discontinue treatment with \n\npazopanib. \n\n \n\nInterstitial lung disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis \n\n \n\nILD, which can be fatal, has been reported in association with pazopanib (see section 4.8). Monitor \n\npatients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis and discontinue pazopanib in patients \n\ndeveloping ILD or pneumonitis. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nCardiac dysfunction/Heart failure \n\n \n\nThe risks and benefits of pazopanib should be considered before beginning therapy in patients who \n\nhave pre-existing cardiac dysfunction. The safety and pharmacokinetics of pazopanib in patients with \n\nmoderate to severe heart failure or those with a below normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \n\nhave not been studied. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies with pazopanib, events of cardiac dysfunction such as congestive heart failure and \n\ndecreased LVEF have occurred (see section 4.8). In a randomised study comparing pazopanib and \n\nsunitinib in RCC (VEG108844), subjects had baseline and follow up LVEF measurements. \n\nMyocardial dysfunction occurred in 13% (47/362) of subjects in the pazopanib arm compared to 11% \n\n(42/369) of subjects in the sunitinib arm. Congestive heart failure was observed in 0.5% of subjects in \n\neach treatment arm. Congestive heart failure was reported in 3 out of 240 subjects (1%) in the Phase \n\nIII VEG110727 STS study. Decreases in LVEF in subjects who had post-baseline and follow-up \n\nLVEF measurement were detected in 11% (15/140) in the pazopanib arm, compared with 3% (1/39) in \n\nthe placebo arm. \n\n \n\nRisk factors \n\nThirteen of the 15 subjects in the pazopanib arm of the STS Phase III study had concurrent \n\nhypertension which may have exacerbated cardiac dysfunction in patients at risk by increasing cardiac \n\nafter-load. 99% of patients (243/246) enrolled in the STS Phase III study, including the 15 subjects, \n\nreceived anthracycline. Prior anthracycline therapy may be a risk factor for cardiac dysfunction. \n\n \n\nOutcome \n\nFour of the 15 subjects had full recovery (within 5% of baseline) and 5 had partial recovery (within the \n\nnormal range, but >5% below baseline). One subject did not recover and follow-up data were not \n\navailable for the other 5 subjects. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\nInterruption of pazopanib and/or dose reduction should be combined with treatment of hypertension (if \n\npresent, refer to hypertension warning section above) in patients with significant reductions in LVEF, \n\nas clinically indicated. \n\n \n\nPatients should be carefully monitored for clinical signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure. \n\nBaseline and periodic evaluation of LVEF is recommended in patients at risk of cardiac dysfunction. \n\n \n\nQT prolongation and torsade de pointes \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies with pazopanib, events of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes have occurred \n\n(see section 4.8). Pazopanib should be used with caution in patients with a history of QT interval \n\nprolongation, in patients taking antiarrhythmics or other medicinal products that may prolong QT \n\ninterval and in patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease. When using pazopanib, baseline and \n\nperiodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and maintenance of electrolytes (e.g. calcium, magnesium, \n\npotassium) within normal range is recommended. \n\n \n\nArterial thrombotic events \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies with pazopanib, myocardial infarction, myocardial ischaemia, ischaemic stroke and \n\ntransient ischaemic attack were observed (see section 4.8). Fatal events have been observed. \n\nPazopanib should be used with caution in patients who are at increased risk of thrombotic events or \n\nwho have had a history of thrombotic events. Pazopanib has not been studied in patients who have had \n\nan event within the previous 6 months. A treatment decision should be made based on the assessment \n\nof individual patient’s benefit/risk. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nVenous thromboembolic events \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies with pazopanib, venous thromboembolic events including venous thrombosis and \n\nfatal pulmonary embolus have occurred. While observed in both RCC and STS studies, the incidence \n\nwas higher in the STS population (5%) than in the RCC population (2%). \n\n \n\nThrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) \n\n \n\nTMA has been reported in clinical studies of pazopanib as monotherapy, in combination with \n\nbevacizumab, and in combination with topotecan (see section 4.8). Patients developing TMA should \n\npermanently discontinue treatment with pazopanib. Reversal of effects of TMA has been observed \n\nafter treatment was discontinued. Pazopanib is not indicated for use in combination with other agents. \n\n \n\nHaemorrhagic events \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies with pazopanib haemorrhagic events have been reported (see section 4.8). Fatal \n\nhaemorragic events have occurred. Pazopanib has not been studied in patients who had a history of \n\nhaemoptysis, cerebral haemorrhage or clinically significant gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhage in the \n\npast 6 months. Pazopanib should be used with caution in patients with significant risk of haemorrhage. \n\n \n\nAneurysms and artery dissections \n\n \n\nThe use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the \n\nformation of aneurysm and/or artery dissections. Before initiating pazopanib, this risk should be \n\ncarefully considered in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal (GI) perforations and fistula \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies with pazopanib, events of GI perforation or fistula have occurred (see section 4.8). \n\nFatal perforation events have occurred. Pazopanib should be used with caution in patients at risk for \n\nGI perforation or fistula. \n\n \n\nWound healing \n\n \n\nNo formal studies of the effect of pazopanib on wound healing have been conducted. Since vascular \n\nendothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors may impair wound healing, treatment with pazopanib \n\nshould be stopped at least 7 days prior to scheduled surgery. The decision to resume pazopanib after \n\nsurgery should be based on clinical judgement of adequate wound healing. Pazopanib should be \n\ndiscontinued in patients with wound dehiscence. \n\n \n\nHypothyroidism \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies with pazopanib, events of hypothyroidism have occurred (see section 4.8). Baseline \n\nlaboratory measurement of thyroid function is recommended and patients with hypothyroidism should \n\nbe treated as per standard medical practice prior to the start of pazopanib treatment. All patients should \n\nbe observed closely for signs and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction on pazopanib treatment. \n\nLaboratory monitoring of thyroid function should be performed periodically and managed as per \n\nstandard medical practice. \n\n \n\nProteinuria \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies with pazopanib, proteinuria has been reported. Baseline and periodic urinanalysis \n\nduring treatment is recommended and patients should be monitored for worsening proteinuria. \n\nPazopanib should be discontinued if the patient develops nephrotic syndrome. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nTumour lysis syndrome (TLS) \n\n \n\nThe occurrence of TLS, including fatal TLS, has been associated with the use of pazopanib (see \n\nsection 4.8). Patients at increased risk of TLS are those with rapidly growing tumours, a high tumour \n\nburden, renal dysfunction, or dehydration. Preventative measures, such as treatment of high uric acid \n\nlevels and intravenous hydration, should be considered prior to initiation of Votrient. Patients at risk \n\nshould be closely monitored and treated as clinically indicated. \n\n \n\nPneumothorax \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies with pazopanib in advanced soft tissue sarcoma, events of pneumothorax have \n\noccurred (see section 4.8). Patients on pazopanib treatment should be observed closely for signs and \n\nsymptoms of pneumothorax. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nBecause the mechanism of action of pazopanib can severely affect organ growth and maturation \n\nduring early post-natal development in rodents (see section 5.3), pazopanib should not be given to \n\npaediatric patients younger than 2 years of age. \n\n \n\nInfections \n\n \n\nCases of serious infections (with or without neutropenia), in some cases with fatal outcome, have been \n\nreported. \n\n \n\nCombination with other systemic anti-cancer therapies \n\n \n\nClinical studies of pazopanib in combination with pemetrexed (non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]) \n\nand lapatinib (cervical cancer) were terminated early due to concerns over increased toxicity and/or \n\nmortality, and a safe and effective combination dose has not been established with these regimens. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nPre-clinical studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). If pazopanib is used \n\nduring pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant whilst receiving pazopanib, the potential hazard \n\nto the foetus should be explained to the patient. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to \n\navoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with pazopanib (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\nInteractions \n\n \n\nConcomitant treatment with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or breast cancer \n\nresistance protein (BCRP) should be avoided due to risk of increased exposure to pazopanib (see \n\nsection 4.5). Selection of alternative concomitant medicinal products with no or minimal potential to \n\ninhibit CYP3A4, P-gp or BCRP should be considered. \n\n \n\nConcomitant treatment with inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided due to risk of decreased exposure \n\nto pazopanib (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nCases of hyperglycaemia have been observed during concomitant treatment with ketoconazole. \n\n \n\nConcomitant administration of pazopanib with uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 \n\n(UGT1A1) substrates (e.g. irinotecan) should be undertaken with caution since pazopanib is an \n\ninhibitor of UGT1A1 (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nGrapefruit juice should be avoided during treatment with pazopanib (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nEffects of other medicinal products on pazopanib \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies suggested that the oxidative metabolism of pazopanib in human liver microsomes is \n\nmediated primarily by CYP3A4, with minor contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP2C8. Therefore, \n\ninhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 may alter the metabolism of pazopanib. \n\n \n\nCYP3A4, P-gp, BCRP inhibitors \n\nPazopanib is a substrate for CYP3A4, P-gp and BCRP. \n\n \n\nConcurrent administration of pazopanib (400 mg once daily) with the strong CYP3A4 and P-gp \n\ninhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) for 5 consecutive days resulted in a 66% and 45% increase \n\nin mean pazopanib AUC(0-24) and Cmax, respectively, relative to administration of pazopanib alone \n\n(400 mg once daily for 7 days). Pharmacokinetic parameter comparisons of pazopanib Cmax (range of \n\nmeans 27.5 to 58.1 µg/ml) and AUC(0-24) (range of means 48.7 to 1040 µg*h/ml) after administration \n\nof pazopanib 800 mg alone and after administration of pazopanib 400 mg plus ketoconazole 400 mg \n\n(mean Cmax 59.2 µg/ml, mean AUC(0-24)1300 µg*h/ml) indicated that, in the presence of a strong \n\nCYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor a dose reduction to pazopanib 400 mg once daily will, in the majority of \n\npatients, result in systemic exposure similar to that observed after administration of 800 mg pazopanib \n\nonce daily alone. Some patients however may have systemic pazopanib exposure greater than what \n\nhas been observed after administration of 800 mg pazopanib alone. \n\n \n\nCo-administration of pazopanib with other strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g. itraconazole, \n\nclarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, \n\nvoriconazole) may increase pazopanib concentrations. Grapefruit juice contains an inhibitor of \n\nCYP3A4 and may also increase plasma concentrations of pazopanib. \n\n \n\nAdministration of 1500 mg lapatinib (a substrate for and weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp and a \n\npotent inhibitor of BCRP) with 800 mg pazopanib resulted in an approximately 50% to 60% increase \n\nin mean pazopanib AUC(0-24) and Cmax compared to administration of 800 mg pazopanib alone. \n\nInhibition of P-gp and/or BCRP by lapatinib likely contributed to the increased exposure to pazopanib. \n\n \n\nCo-administration of pazopanib with a CYP3A4, P-gp, and BCRP inhibitor, such as lapatinib, will \n\nresult in an increase in plasma pazopanib concentrations. Co-administration with potent P-gp or BCRP \n\ninhibitors may also alter the exposure and distribution of pazopanib, including distribution into the \n\ncentral nervous systems (CNS). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use of pazopanib with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor should be avoided (see section 4.4). If \n\nno medically acceptable alternative to a strong CYP34A inhibitor is available, the dose of pazopanib \n\nshould be reduced to 400 mg daily during concomitant administration. In such cases there should be \n\nclose attention to adverse drug reaction, and further dose reduction may be considered if possible \n\ndrug-related adverse events are observed. \n\n \n\nCombination with strong P-gp or BCRP inhibitors should be avoided, or selection of an alternate \n\nconcomitant medicinal product with no or minimal potential to inhibit P-gp or BCRP is recommended. \n\n \n\nCYP3A4, P-gp, BCRP inducers \n\nCYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin may decrease plasma pazopanib concentrations. Co-administration \n\nof pazopanib with potent P-gp or BCRP inducers may alter the exposure and distribution of pazopanib, \n\nincluding distribution into the CNS. Selection of an alternative concomitant medication with no or \n\nminimal enzyme or transporter induction potential is recommended. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nEffects of pazopanib on other medicinal products \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that pazopanib inhibited CYP enzymes 1A2, \n\n3A4, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2E1. Potential induction of human CYP3A4 was demonstrated in an \n\nin vitro human PXR assay. Clinical pharmacology studies, using pazopanib 800 mg once daily, have \n\ndemonstrated that pazopanib does not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of \n\ncaffeine (CYP1A2 probe substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 probe substrate), or omeprazole (CYP2C19 \n\nprobe substrate) in cancer patients. Pazopanib resulted in an increase of approximately 30% in the \n\nmean AUC and Cmax of midazolam (CYP3A4 probe substrate) and increases of 33% to 64% in the \n\nratio of dextrometrophan to dextrophan concentrations in the urine after oral administration of \n\ndextromethorphan (CYP2D6 probe substrate). Co-administration of pazopanib 800 mg once daily and \n\npaclitaxel 80 mg/m2 (CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 substrate) once weekly resulted in a mean increase of \n\n26% and 31% in paclitaxel AUC and Cmax, respectively. \n\n \n\nBased on in vitro IC50 and in vivo plasma Cmax values, pazopanib metabolites GSK1268992 and \n\nGSK1268997 may contribute to the net inhibitory effect of pazopanib towards BCRP. Furthermore, \n\ninhibition of BCRP and P-gp by pazopanib in the gastrointestinal tract cannot be excluded. Care \n\nshould be taken when pazopanib is co-administered with other oral BCRP and P-gp substrates. \n\n \n\nIn vitro, pazopanib inhibited human organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1). It cannot be \n\nexcluded that pazopanib will affect the pharmacokinetics of substrates of OATP1B1 (e.g. statins, see \n\n“Effect of concomitant use of pazopanib and simvastatin” below). \n\n \n\nPazopanib is an inhibitor of the uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl-transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) enzyme in \n\nvitro. The active metabolite of irinotecan, SN-38, is a substrate for OATP1B1 and UGT1A1. \n\nCo-administration of pazopanib 400 mg once daily with cetuximab 250 mg/m2 and irinotecan \n\n150 mg/m2 resulted in an approximately 20% increase in systemic exposure to SN-38. Pazopanib may \n\nhave a greater impact on SN-38 disposition in subjects with the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism relative to \n\nsubjects with the wild-type allele. However, the UGT1A1 genotype was not always predictive of the \n\neffect of pazopanib on SN-38 disposition. Care should be taken when pazopanib is co-administered \n\nwith substrates of UGT1A1. \n\n \n\nEffect of concomitant use of pazopanib and simvastatin \n\n \n\nConcomitant use of pazopanib and simvastatin increases the incidence of ALT elevations. Results \n\nfrom a meta-analysis using pooled data from clinical studies with pazopanib show that ALT >3x ULN \n\nwas reported in 126/895 (14%) of patients who did not use statins, compared with 11/41 (27%) of \n\npatients who had concomitant use of simvastatin (p = 0.038). If a patient receiving concomitant \n\nsimvastatin develops ALT elevations, follow guidelines for pazopanib posology and discontinue \n\nsimvastatin (see section 4.4). In addition, concomitant use of pazopanib and other statins should be \n\nundertaken with caution as there are insufficient data available to assess their impact on ALT levels. It \n\ncannot be excluded that pazopanib will affect the pharmacokinetics of other statins (e.g. atorvastatin, \n\nfluvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin). \n\n \n\nEffect of food on pazopanib \n\n \n\nAdministration of pazopanib with a high-fat or low-fat meal results in an approximately 2-fold \n\nincrease in AUC and Cmax. Therefore, pazopanib should be administered at least 1 hour before or \n\n2 hours after a meal. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nMedicinal products that raise gastric pH \n\n \n\nConcomitant administration of pazopanib with esomeprazole decreases the bioavailability of \n\npazopanib by approximately 40% (AUC and Cmax), and co-administration of pazopanib with medicines \n\nthat increase gastric pH should be avoided. If the concomitant use of a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) is \n\nmedically necessary, it is recommended that the dose of pazopanib be taken without food once daily in \n\nthe evening concomitantly with the PPI. If the concomitant administration of an H2-receptor \n\nantagonist is medically necessary, pazopanib should be taken without food at least 2 hours before or at \n\nleast 10 hours after a dose of an H2-receptor antagonist. Pazopanib should be administered at least \n\n1 hour before or 2 hours after administration of short-acting antacids. The recommendations for how \n\nPPIs and H2-receptor antagonists are co-administered are based on physiological considerations. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy/ Contraception in males and females \n\n \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of pazopanib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \n\nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n\n \n\nPazopanib should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires \n\ntreatment with pazopanib. If pazopanib is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant \n\nwhile receiving pazopanib, the potential hazard to the foetus should be explained to the patient. \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use adequate contraception during treatment \n\nand for at least 2 weeks after the last dose of pazopanib and to avoid becoming pregnant while \n\nreceiving treatment with pazopanib. \n\n \n\nMale patients (including those who have had vasectomies) should use condoms during sexual \n\nintercourse while taking pazopanib and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose of pazopanib to avoid \n\npotential exposure to the medicinal product for pregnant partners and female partners of reproductive \n\npotential. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nThe safe use of pazopanib during breast-feeding has not been established. It is not known whether \n\npazopanib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. There are no animal data on the excretion of \n\npazopanib in animal milk. A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be \n\ndiscontinued during treatment with pazopanib.  \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nAnimal studies indicate that male and female fertility may be affected by treatment with pazopanib \n\n(see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nVotrient has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. A detrimental effect \n\non such activities cannot be predicted from the pharmacology of pazopanib. The clinical status of the \n\npatient and the adverse event profile of pazopanib should be borne in mind when considering the \n\npatient’s ability to perform tasks that require judgement, motor or cognitive skills. Patients should \n\navoid driving or using machines if they feel dizzy, tired or weak. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nPooled data from the pivotal RCC study (VEG105192, n=290), the extension study (VEG107769, \n\nn=71), the supportive Phase II study (VEG102616, n=225) and the randomised, open-label, parallel \n\ngroup Phase III non-inferiority study (VEG108844, n=557) were evaluated in the overall evaluation of \n\nsafety and tolerability of pazopanib (total n=1149) in subjects with RCC (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nPooled data from the pivotal STS study (VEG110727, n=369) and the supportive Phase II study \n\n(VEG20002, n=142) was evaluated in the overall evaluation of safety and tolerability of pazopanib \n\n(total safety population n=382) in subjects with STS (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nThe most important serious adverse reactions identified in the RCC or STS studies were transient \n\nischaemic attack, ischaemic stroke, myocardial ischaemia, myocardial and cerebral infarction, cardiac \n\ndysfunction, gastrointestinal perforation and fistula, QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes and \n\npulmonary, gastrointestinal and cerebral haemorrhage, all adverse reactions being reported in <1% of \n\ntreated patients. Other important serious adverse reactions identified in STS studies included venous \n\nthromboembolic events, left ventricular dysfunction and pneumothorax. \n\n \n\nFatal events that were considered possibly related to pazopanib included gastrointestinal haemorrhage, \n\npulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis, abnormal hepatic function, intestinal perforation and ischaemic \n\nstroke. \n\n \n\nThe most common adverse reactions (experienced by at least 10% of the patients) of any grade in the \n\nRCC and STS trials included: diarrhoea, hair colour change, skin hypopigmentation, exfoliative rash, \n\nhypertension, nausea, headache, fatigue, anorexia, vomiting, dysgeusia, stomatitis, weight decreased, \n\npain, elevated alanine aminotransferase and elevated aspartate aminotransferase. \n\n \n\nAdverse drug reactions, all grades, which were reported in RCC and STS subjects or during the \n\npost-marketing period are listed below by MedDRA body system organ class, frequency and grade of \n\nseverity. The following convention has been utilised for the classification of frequency: very common \n\n(≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); \n\nvery rare (<1/10,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nCategories have been assigned based on absolute frequencies in the clinical trial data. Post-marketing \n\ndata on safety and tolerability across all pazopanib clinical studies and from spontaneous reports have \n\nalso been evaluated. Within each system organ class, adverse reactions with the same frequency are \n\npresented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, protein kinase \n\ninhibitors, ATC code: L01XE11 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nPazopanib is an orally administered, potent multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of vascular \n\nendothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) -1, -2, and -3, platelet-derived growth factor \n\n(PDGFR) -α and –β, and stem cell factor receptor (c-KIT), with IC50 values of 10, 30, 47, 71, 84 and \n\n74 nM, respectively. In preclinical experiments, pazopanib dose-dependently inhibited ligand-induced \n\nauto-phosphorylation of VEGFR-2, c-Kit and PDGFR- receptors in cells. In vivo, pazopanib \n\ninhibited VEGF-induced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in mouse lungs, angiogenesis in various animal \n\nmodels, and the growth of multiple human tumour xenografts in mice. \n\n \n\nPharmacogenomics \n\n \n\nIn a pharmacogenetic meta-analysis of data from 31 clinical studies of pazopanib administered either \n\nas monotherapy or in combination with other agents, ALT >5 x ULN (NCI CTC Grade 3) occurred in \n\n19% of HLA-B*57:01 allele carriers and in 10% of non-carriers. In this dataset, 133/2235 (6%) of the \n\npatients carried the HLA-B*57:01 allele (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nClinical studies \n\n \n\nRenal cell carcinoma (RCC) \n\nThe safety and efficacy of pazopanib in RCC were evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, \n\nplacebo-controlled multicentre study. Patients (N = 435) with locally advanced and/or metastatic RCC \n\nwere randomised to receive pazopanib 800 mg once daily or placebo. The primary objective of the \n\nstudy was to evaluate and compare the two treatment arms for progression-free survival (PFS) and the \n\nprinciple secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). The other objectives were to evaluate the \n\noverall response rate and duration of response. \n\n \n\nFrom the total of 435 patients in this study, 233 patients were treatment-naïve and 202 were \n\nsecond-line patients who had received one prior IL-2 or INF-based therapy. The performance status \n\n(ECOG) was similar between the pazopanib and placebo groups (ECOG 0: 42% vs. 41%, ECOG 1: \n\n58% vs. 59%). The majority of patients had either favourable (39%) or intermediate (54%), MSKCC \n\n(Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre) / Motzer prognostic factors. All patients had clear cell \n\nhistology or predominantly clear cell histology. Approximately half of all patients had 3 or more \n\norgans involved in their disease and most patients had the lung (74%), and/or lymph nodes (54%) as a \n\nmetastatic location for disease at baseline. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\nA similar proportion of patients in each arm were treatment-naïve and cytokine pre-treated (53% and \n\n47% in pazopanib arm, 54% and 46% in placebo arm). In the cytokine pre-treated subgroup, the \n\nmajority (75%) had received interferon-based treatment. \n\n \n\nSimilar proportions of patients in each arm had prior nephrectomy (89% and 88% in the pazopanib \n\nand placebo arms, respectively) and/or prior radiotherapy (22% and 15% in the pazopanib and placebo \n\narms, respectively. \n\n \n\nThe primary analysis of the primary endpoint PFS is based on disease assessment by independent \n\nradiological review in the entire study population (treatment-naïve and cytokine pre-treated). \n\n \n\nTable 4 Overall efficacy results in RCC by independent assessment (VEG105192) \n\n \n\nEndpoints/Study population Pazopanib Placebo HR (95% CI) \n\nP value \n\n(one-sided) \n\nPFS     \n\nOverall* ITT N = 290 N = 145   \n\n Median (months) 9.2 4.2 0.46 (0.34, 0.62) <0.0000001 \n\nResponse rate N = 290 N = 145   \n\n % (95% CI) 30 (25.1,35.6) 3 (0.5, 6.4) – <0.001 \nHR = hazard ratio; ITT = intent to treat; PFS = progression-free survival. * - treatment-naïve and cytokine \n\npre-treated populations \n\n \n\nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier curve for progression-free survival by independent assessment for the \n\noverall population (treatment-naïve and cytokine pre-treated populations) \n\n(VEG105192) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nx axis; Months, y axis; Proportion Progression Free, Pazopanib —―— (N = 290) Median 9.2 months; Placebo --\n\n------ (N = 145) Median 4.2 months; Hazard Ratio = 0.46, 95% CI (0.34, 0.62), P <0.0000001 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\nFigure 2 Kaplan-Meier curve for progression-free survival by independent assessment for the \n\ntreatment-naïve population (VEG105192) \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nx axis; Months, y axis; Proportion Progression Free, Pazopanib —―— (N = 155) Median 11.1 months; Placebo \n\n-------- (N = 78) Median 2.8 months; Hazard Ratio = 0.40, 95% CI (0.27, 0.60), P <0.0000001 \n\n \n\nFigure 3 Kaplan-Meier Curve for progression-free survival by independent assessment for \n\nthe cytokine pre-treated population (VEG105192) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nx axis; Months, y \n\naxis; Proportion Progression Free, Pazopanib —―— (N = 135) Median 7.4 months; Placebo -------- (N = 67) \n\nMedian 4.2 months; Hazard Ratio = 0.54, 95% CI (0.35, 0.84), P <0.001 \n\n \n\nFor patients who responded to treatment, the median time to response was 11.9 weeks and the median \n\nduration of response was 58.7 weeks as per independent review (VEG105192). \n\n \n\nThe median overall survival (OS) data at the protocol-specified final survival analysis were \n\n22.9 months and 20.5 months [HR = 0.91 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.16; p = 0.224)] for patients randomised to \n\nthe pazopanib and placebo arms, respectively. The OS results are subject to potential bias as 54% of \n\npatients in the placebo arm also received pazopanib in the extension part of this study following \n\ndisease progression. Sixty-six per cent of placebo patients received post-study therapy compared to \n\n30% of pazopanib patients. \n\n \n\nNo statistical differences were observed between treatment groups for Global Quality of Life using \n\nEORTC QLQ-C30 and EuroQoL EQ-5D. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\nIn a Phase II study of 225 patients with locally recurrent or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma, \n\nobjective response rate was 35% and median duration of response was 68 weeks, as per independent \n\nreview. Median PFS was 11.9 months. \n\n \n\nThe safety, efficacy and quality of life of pazopanib versus sunitinib was evaluated in a randomised, \n\nopen-label, parallel group Phase III non-inferiority study (VEG108844). \n\n \n\nIn VEG108844, patients (N = 1110) with locally advanced and/or metastatic RCC who had not \n\nreceived prior systemic therapy, were randomised to receive either pazopanib 800 mg once daily \n\ncontinuously or sunitinib 50 mg once daily in 6-week cycles of dosing with 4 weeks on treatment \n\nfollowed by 2 weeks without treatment. \n\n \n\nThe primary objective of this study was to evaluate and compare PFS in patients treated with \n\npazopanib to those treated with sunitinib. Demographic characteristics were similar between the \n\ntreatment arms. Disease characteristics at initial diagnosis and at screening were balanced between the \n\ntreatment arms with the majority of patients having clear cell histology and Stage IV disease. \n\n \n\nVEG108844 achieved its primary endpoint of PFS and demonstrated that pazopanib was non-inferior \n\nto sunitinib, as the upper bound of the 95% CI for the hazard ratio was less than the protocol-specified \n\nnon-inferiority margin of 1.25.

In the three smallest of these \n\n20 subgroups, the point estimate of the hazard ratio exceeded 1.25; i.e. in subjects with no prior \n\nnephrectomy (n=186, HR=1.403, 95% CI (0.955, 2.061)), baseline LDH >1.5 x ULN (n=68, HR=1.72, \n\n95% CI (0.943, 3.139)), and MSKCC: poor risk (n=119, HR=1.472, 95% CI (0.937, 2.313)). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\nSoft-tissue sarcoma (STS) \n\nThe efficacy and safety of pazopanib in STS were evaluated in a pivotal Phase III randomised, \n\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study (VEG110727). A total of 369 patients with \n\nadvanced STS were randomised to receive pazopanib 800 mg once daily or placebo. Importantly, only \n\npatients with selective histological subtypes of STS were allowed to participate to the study, therefore \n\nefficacy and safety of pazopanib can only be considered established for those subgroups of STS and \n\ntreatment with pazopanib should be restricted to such STS subtypes. \n\n \n\nThe following tumour types were eligible: \n\nFibroblastic (adult fibrosarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma, sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma, malignant \n\nsolitary fibrous tumours), so-called fibrohistiocytic (pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma \n\n[MFH], giant cell MFH, inflammatory MFH), leiomyosarcoma, malignant glomus tumours, skeletal \n\nmuscles (pleomorphic and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma), vascular (epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, \n\nangiosarcoma), uncertain differentiation (synovial, epithelioid, alveolar soft part, clear cell, \n\ndesmoplastic small round cell, extra-renal rhabdoid, malignant mesenchymoma, PEComa, intimal \n\nsarcoma), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours, undifferentiated soft tissue sarcomas not \n\notherwise specified (NOS) and other types of sarcoma (not listed as ineligible). \n\n \n\nThe following tumour types were not eligible: \n\nAdipocytic sarcoma (all subtypes), all rhabdomyosarcoma that were not alveolar or pleomorphic, \n\nchondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing tumours/primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNET), GIST, \n\ndermofibromatosis sarcoma protuberans, inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma, malignant \n\nmesothelioma and mixed mesodermal tumours of the uterus. \n\nOf note, patients with adipocytic sarcoma were excluded from the pivotal Phase III study as in a \n\npreliminary Phase II study (VEG20002) activity (PFS at week 12) observed with pazopanib in \n\nadipocytic did not meet the prerequisite rate to allow further clinical testing. \n\n \n\nOther key eligibility criteria of the VEG110727 study were: histological evidence of high or \n\nintermediate grade malignant STS and disease progression within 6 months of therapy for metastatic \n\ndisease, or recurrence within 12 months of (neo) -/adjuvant therapy. \n\n \n\nNinety-eight percent (98%) of subjects received prior doxorubicin, 70% prior ifosfamide, and 65% of \n\nsubjects had received at least three or more chemotherapeutic agents prior to study enrolment. \n\n \n\nPatients were stratified by the factors of WHO performance status (WHO PS) (0 or 1) at baseline and \n\nthe number of lines of prior systemic therapy for advanced disease (0 or 1 vs. 2+). In each treatment \n\ngroup, there was a slightly greater percentage of subjects in the 2+ lines of prior systemic therapy for \n\nadvanced disease (58% and 55%, respectively, for placebo and pazopanib treatment arms) compared \n\nwith 0 or 1 lines of prior systemic therapy (42% and 45%, respectively, for placebo and pazopanib \n\ntreatment arms). The median duration of follow-up of subjects (defined as date of randomisation to \n\ndate of last contact or death) was similar for both treatment arms (9.36 months for placebo [range 0.69 \n\nto 23.0 months] and 10.04 months for pazopanib [range 0.2 to 24.3 months]. \n\n \n\nThe primary objective of the study was progression-free survival (PFS assessed by independent \n\nradiological review); the secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), overall response rate and \n\nduration of response. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\nTable 6 Overall efficacy results in STS by independent assessment (VEG110727) \n\n \n\nEndpoints / study \n\npopulation \n\nPazopanib Placebo HR (95% CI) P value \n\n(two-sided) \n\nPFS     \n\nOverall ITT N = 246 N = 123   \n\nMedian (weeks) 20.0 7.0 0.35 (0.26, 0.48) <0.001 \n\n     \n\nLeiomyosarcoma N = 109 N = 49   \n\nMedian (weeks) 20.1 8.1 0.37 (0.23, 0.60) <0.001 \n\n     \n\nSynovial sarcoma subgroups N = 25 N = 13   \n\nMedian (weeks) 17.9 4.1 0.43 (0.19, 0.98) 0.005 \n\n     \n\n‘Other STS’ subgroups N = 112 N = 61   \n\nMedian (weeks) 20.1 4.3 0.39 (0.25, 0.60) <0.001 \n\n     \n\nOS     \n\nOverall ITT N = 246 N = 123   \n\nMedian (months) 12.6 10.7 0.87 (0.67, 1.12) 0.256 \n\n     \n\nLeiomyosarcoma* N = 109 N = 49   \n\nMedian (months) 16.7 14.1 0.84 (0.56, 1.26) 0.363 \n\n     \n\nSynovial sarcoma subgroups* N = 25 N = 13   \n\nMedian (months) 8.7 21.6 1.62 (0.79, 3.33) 0.115 \n\n     \n\n“Other STS” subgroups* N = 112 N = 61   \n\nMedian (months) 10.3 9.5 0.84 (0.59, 1.21) 0.325 \n\n     \n\nResponse rate (CR+PR)     \n\n% (95% CI) 4 (2.3, 7.9) 0 (0.0, 3.0)   \n\nDuration of response     \n\nMedian (weeks) (95% CI) \n\n \n\n38.9 (16.7, 40.0) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nHR = hazard ratio; ITT = intent to treat; PFS = progression-free survival; CR = complete response; PR = \n\npartial response.

Daily dosing \n\nresults in 1.23- to 4-fold increase in AUC0-T. \n\n \n\nThere was no consistent increase in AUC or Cmax at pazopanib doses above 800 mg. \n\n \n\nSystemic exposure to pazopanib is increased when administered with food. Administration of \n\npazopanib with a high-fat or low-fat meal results in an approximately 2-fold increase in AUC and \n\nCmax. Therefore, pazopanib should be administered at least two hours after food or at least one hour \n\nbefore food (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\nAdministration of a pazopanib 400 mg crushed tablet increased AUC(0-72) by 46% and Cmax by \n\napproximately 2 fold and decreased tmax by approximately 2 hours compared to administration of the \n\nwhole tablet. These results indicate that the bioavailability and the rate of pazopanib oral absorption \n\nare increased after administration of the crushed tablet relative to administration of the whole tablet \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nBinding of pazopanib to human plasma protein in vivo was greater than 99% with no concentration \n\ndependence over the range of 10-100 g/ml. In vitro studies suggest that pazopanib is a substrate for \n\nP-gp and BCRP. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nResults from in vitro studies demonstrated that metabolism of pazopanib is mediated primarily by \n\nCYP3A4, with minor contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP2C8. The four principle pazopanib \n\nmetabolites account for only 6% of the exposure in plasma. One of these metabolites inhibits the \n\nproliferation of VEGF-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells with a similar potency to that \n\nof pazopanib, the others are 10- to 20-fold less active. Therefore, activity of pazopanib is mainly \n\ndependent on parent pazopanib exposure. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nPazopanib is eliminated slowly with a mean half-life of 30.9 hours after administration of the \n\nrecommended dose of 800 mg. Elimination is primarily via faeces with renal elimination accounting \n\nfor <4% of the administered dose. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nResults indicate that less than 4% of an orally administered pazopanib dose is excreted in the urine as \n\npazopanib and metabolites. Results from population pharmacokinetic modelling (data from subjects \n\nwith baseline CLCR values ranging from 30.8 ml/min to 150 ml/min) indicated that renal impairment \n\nis unlikely to have clinically relevant effect on pazopanib pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is \n\nrequired in patients with creatinine clearance above 30 ml/min. Caution is advised in patients with \n\ncreatinine clearance below 30 ml/min as there is no experience of pazopanib in this patient population \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nMild \n\nThe median steady-state pazopanib Cmax and AUC(0-24) in patients with mild abnormalities in hepatic \n\nparameters (defined as either normal bilirubin and any degree of ALT elevation or as an elevation of \n\nbilirubin up to 1.5 x ULN regardless of the ALT value) after administration of 800 mg once daily are \n\nsimilar to the median in patients with normal hepatic function (see Table 7). 800 mg pazopanib once \n\ndaily is the recommended dose in patients with mild abnormalities of serum liver tests (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nModerate \n\nThe maximally tolerated pazopanib dose (MTD) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment \n\n(defined as an elevation of bilirubin >1.5 x to 3 x ULN regardless of the ALT values) was 200 mg \n\nonce daily. The median steady-state Cmax and AUC(0-24) values after administration of 200 mg \n\npazopanib once daily in patients with moderate hepatic impairment were approximately 44% and 39%, \n\nof the corresponding median values after administration of 800 mg once daily in patients with normal \n\nhepatic function, respectively (see Table 7). \n\n \n\nBased on safety and tolerability data, the dose of pazopanib should be reduced to 200 mg once daily in \n\nsubjects with moderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\nSevere \n\nThe median steady-state Cmax and AUC(0-24) values after administration of 200 mg pazopanib once \n\ndaily in patients with severe hepatic impairment were approximately 18% and 15%, of the \n\ncorresponding median values after administration of 800 mg once daily in patients with normal hepatic \n\nfunction. Based on the diminished exposure and limited hepatic reserve pazopanib is not \n\nrecommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (defined as total bilirubin >3 X ULN \n\nregardless of any level of ALT) (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nTable 7 Median steady-state pazopanib pharmacokinetics measured in subjects with hepatic \n\nimpairment. \n\n \n\nGroup Investigated \n\ndose \n\nCmax (µg/ml) AUC (0-24) \n\n(µg x hr/ml) \n\nRecommended \n\ndose \n\nNormal hepatic \n\nfunction \n\n800 mg OD 52.0 \n\n(17.1-85.7) \n\n888.2 \n\n(345.5-1482) \n\n800 mg OD \n\nMild HI 800 mg OD 33.5 \n\n(11.3-104.2) \n\n774.2 \n\n(214.7-2034.4) \n\n800 mg OD \n\nModerate HI 200 mg OD 22.2 \n\n(4.2-32.9) \n\n256.8 \n\n(65.7-487.7) \n\n200 mg OD \n\nSevere HI 200 mg OD 9.4 \n\n(2.4-24.3) \n\n130.6 \n\n(46.9-473.2) \n\nNot recommended \n\nOD – once daily \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nThe preclinical safety profile of pazopanib was assessed in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys. In repeat \n\ndose studies in rodents, effects in a variety of tissues (bone, teeth, nail beds, reproductive organs, \n\nhaematological tissues, kidney and pancreas) appear related to the pharmacology of VEGFR inhibition \n\nand/or disruption of VEGF signalling pathways, with most effects occurring at plasma exposure levels \n\nbelow those observed in the clinic. Other observed effects include body weight loss, diarrhoea and/or \n\nmorbidity that were either secondary to local gastrointestinal effects caused by high local mucosal \n\nmedicinal product exposure (monkeys) or pharmacological effects (rodents). Proliferative hepatic \n\nlesions (eosinophilic foci and adenoma) were seen in female mice at exposures 2.5 times human \n\nexposure based on AUC. \n\n \n\nIn juvenile toxicity studies, when pre-weaning rats were dosed from day 9 post partum through to \n\nday 14 post partum, pazopanib caused mortalities and abnormal organ growth/maturation in kidney, \n\nlung, liver and heart, at a dose approximately 0.1 times the clinical exposure based on AUC in adult \n\nhumans. When post-weaning rats were dosed from day 21 post partum to day 62 post partum, \n\ntoxicological findings were similar to adult rats at comparable exposures. Human paediatric patients \n\nare at increased risk for bone and teeth effects as compared to adults, as these changes, including \n\ninhibition of growth (shortened limbs), fragile bones and remodelling of teeth, were present in juvenile \n\nrats at ≥10 mg/kg/day (equal to approximately 0.1-0.2 times the clinical exposure based on AUC in \n\nadult humans) (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nReproductive, fertility and teratogenic effects \n\n \n\nPazopanib has been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic when administered to rats and rabbits at \n\nexposures more than 300-fold lower than the human exposure (based on AUC). Effects included \n\nreduced female fertility, increased pre- and post-implantation loss, early resorptions, embryo lethality, \n\ndecreased foetal body weight and cardiovascular malformation. Decreased corpora lutea, increased \n\ncysts and ovarian atrophy have also been noted in rodents. In a rat male fertility study, there was no \n\neffect on mating or fertility, but decreased testicular and epididymal weights were noted with \n\nreductions in sperm production rates, sperm motility, and epididymal and testicular sperm \n\nconcentrations observed at exposures 0.3 times human exposure based on AUC. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\nGenotoxicity \n\n \n\nPazopanib did not cause genetic damage when tested in genotoxicity assays (Ames assay, human \n\nperipheral lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay and rat in vivo micronucleus). A synthetic \n\nintermediate in manufacture of pazopanib, which is also present in the final drug substance in low \n\namounts, was not mutagenic in the Ames assay but genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay and in \n\nvivo mouse micronucleus assay. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenicity \n\n \n\nIn two-year carcinogenicity studies with pazopanib, there were increased numbers of liver adenomas \n\nnoted in mice and duodenal adenocarcinomas noted in rats. Based on the rodent-specific pathogenesis \n\nand mechanism for these findings, they are not considered to represent an increased carcinogenic risk \n\nfor patients taking pazopanib. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

It can occur in muscles, blood vessels, fat tissue or other tissues that support, \n\nsurround and protect the organs. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Votrient \n\n \n\nDo not take Votrient \n\n- if you are allergic to pazopanib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\nCheck with your doctor if you think this applies to you. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Votrient: \n\n- if you have heart disease. \n\n- if you have liver disease. \n\n- if you have had heart failure or a heart attack. \n\n- if you have had prior collapse of a lung. \n\n- if you have had problems with bleeding, blood clots or narrowing of the arteries. \n\n- if you have had stomach or bowel problems such as perforation (hole) or fistula (abnormal \n\npassages forming between parts of the intestine). \n\n- if you have thyroid problems. \n\n- if you have problems with your kidney function. \n\n- if you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a \n\ntear in a blood vessel wall. \n\nTell your doctor if any of these apply to you. Your doctor will decide whether Votrient is suitable for \n\nyou. You may need extra tests to check that your kidneys, heart and liver are working properly. \n\n \n\nHigh blood pressure and Votrient \n\nVotrient can raise your blood pressure. Your blood pressure will be checked before you take Votrient \n\nand while you are taking it.

This includes herbal medicines and other medicines you’ve bought without a prescription. \n\n \n\nSome medicines may affect how Votrient works or make it more likely that you’ll have side effects. \n\nVotrient can also affect how some other medicines work. These include: \n\n- clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, rifamicin, telithromycin, voriconazzole (used to \n\ntreat infection). \n\n- atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir (used to treat HIV). \n\n- nefazodone (used to treat depression). \n\n- simvastatin and possibly other statins (used to treat high cholesterol levels). \n\n- medicines that reduce stomach acid. The type of medicine that you are taking to reduce your \n\nstomach acid (e.g. proton pump inhibitor, H2 antagonists or antacids) may affect how Votrient is \n\ntaken.
