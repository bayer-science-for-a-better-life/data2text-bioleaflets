NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nCellCept 250 mg capsules. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach capsule contains 250 mg mycophenolate mofetil. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect \n \nSodium less than 1 mmol (23 mg) per dose \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nCapsules, hard (capsules). \n \nCellCept capsules: oblong, blue/brown, branded with black \"CellCept 250\" on the capsule cap and \n\"Roche\" on the capsule body.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCellCept is indicated in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids for the prophylaxis of acute \ntransplant rejection in patients receiving allogeneic renal, cardiac or hepatic transplants. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with CellCept should be initiated and maintained by appropriately qualified transplant \nspecialists. \n \nPosology \n \nUse in renal transplant  \n \nAdults \nOral CellCept should be initiated within 72 hours following transplantation. The recommended dose in \nrenal transplant patients is 1 g administered twice daily (2 g daily dose).  \nPaediatric population aged 2 to 18 years \nThe recommended dose of mycophenolate mofetil is 600 mg/m2 administered orally twice daily (up to \na maximum of 2 g daily). CellCept capsules should only be prescribed to patients with a body surface \narea of at least 1.25 m2. Patients with a body surface area of 1.25 to 1.5 m2 may be prescribed CellCept \ncapsules at a dose of 750 mg twice daily (1.5 g daily dose). Patients with a body surface area greater \nthan 1.5 m2 may be prescribed CellCept capsules at a dose of 1 g twice daily (2 g daily dose). As some \nadverse reactions occur with greater frequency in this age group (see section 4.8) compared with \nadults, temporary dose reduction or interruption may be required; these will need to take into account \nrelevant clinical factors including severity of reaction. \n \nPaediatric population < 2 years \nThere are limited safety and efficacy data in children below the age of 2 years. These are insufficient \nto make dosage recommendations and therefore use in this age group is not recommended. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nUse in cardiac transplant  \n \nAdults  \nOral CellCept should be initiated within 5 days following transplantation. The recommended dose in \ncardiac transplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily (3 g daily dose).  \n \nPaediatric population \nNo data are available for paediatric cardiac transplant patients. \n \nUse in hepatic transplant \n \nAdults \nIV CellCept should be administered for the first 4 days following hepatic transplant, with oral \nCellCept initiated as soon after this as it can be tolerated. The recommended oral dose in hepatic \ntransplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily (3 g daily dose). \n \nPaediatric population \nNo data are available for paediatric hepatic transplant patients. \n \nUse in special populations \n \nElderly \nThe recommended dose of 1 g administered twice a day for renal transplant patients and 1.5 g twice a \nday for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients is appropriate for the elderly.  \n \nRenal impairment \nIn renal transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n< 25 ml/min/1.73 m2), outside the immediate post-transplant period, doses greater than 1 g \nadministered twice a day should be avoided. These patients should also be carefully observed. No dose \nadjustments are needed in patients experiencing delayed renal graft function post-operatively (see \nsection 5.2). No data are available for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients with severe chronic renal \nimpairment. \n \nSevere hepatic impairment  \nNo dose adjustments are needed for renal transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease. \nNo data are available for cardiac transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease. \n \nTreatment during rejection episodes \nMycophenolic acid (MPA) is the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil. Renal transplant \nrejection does not lead to changes in MPA pharmacokinetics; dosage reduction or interruption of \nCellCept is not required. There is no basis for CellCept dose adjustment following cardiac transplant \nrejection. No pharmacokinetic data are available during hepatic transplant rejection.   \n \nPaediatric population \nNo data are available for treatment of first or refractory rejection in paediatric transplant patients \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral administration \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product. \nBecause mycophenolate mofetil has demonstrated teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits, CellCept \ncapsules should not be opened or crushed to avoid inhalation or direct contact with skin or mucous \nmembranes of the powder contained in CellCept capsules. If such contact occurs, wash thoroughly \nwith soap and water; rinse eyes with plain water. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• CellCept should not be given to patients with hypersensitivity to mycophenolate mofetil, \n\nmycophenolic acid or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Hypersensitivity reactions to \nCellCept have been observed (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n• CellCept should not be given to women of childbearing potential who are not using highly \n\neffective contraception (see section 4.6).  \n \n\n• CellCept treatment should not be initiated in women of childbearing potential without providing \na pregnancy test result to rule out unintended use in pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\n \n• CellCept should not be used in pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment to \n\nprevent transplant rejection (see section 4.6). \n \n\n• CellCept should not be given to women who are breastfeeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nNeoplasms \n \nPatients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, \nincluding CellCept, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, \nparticularly of the skin (see section 4.8). The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of \nimmunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent.  \nAs general advice to minimise the risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be \nlimited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. \n \nInfections \n \nPatients treated with immunosuppressants, including CellCept, are at increased risk for opportunistic \ninfections (bacterial, fungal, viral and protozoal), fatal infections and sepsis (see section 4.8). Such \ninfections include latent viral reactivation, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C reactivation and infections \ncaused by polyomaviruses (BK virus associated nephropathy, JC virus associated progressive \nmultifocal leukoencephalopathy PML). Cases of hepatitis due to reactivation of hepatitis B or hepatitis \nC have been reported in carrier patients treated with immunosuppressants. These infections are often \nrelated to a high total immunosuppressive burden and may lead to serious or fatal conditions that \nphysicians should consider in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients with \ndeteriorating renal function or neurological symptoms. \n \nThere have been reports of hypogammaglobulinaemia in association with recurrent infections in \npatients receiving CellCept in combination with other immunosuppressants. In some of these cases, \nswitching CellCept to an alternative immunosuppressant resulted in serum IgG levels returning to \nnormal. Patients on CellCept who develop recurrent infections should have their serum \nimmunoglobulins measured. In cases of sustained, clinically relevant hypogammaglobulinaemia, \nappropriate clinical action should be considered taking into account the potent cytostatic effects that \nmycophenolic acid has on T- and B-lymphocytes. \n \nThere have been published reports of bronchiectasis in adults and children who received CellCept in \ncombination with other immunosuppressants. In some of these cases, switching CellCept to another \nimmunosuppressant resulted in improvement in respiratory symptoms. The risk of bronchiectasis may \nbe linked to hypogammaglobulinaemia or to a direct effect on the lung. There have also been isolated \nreports of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis, some of which were fatal (see section 4.8). \nIt is recommended that patients who develop persistent pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and \ndyspnoea, are investigated. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nBlood and immune system \n \nPatients receiving CellCept should be monitored for neutropenia, which may be related to CellCept \nitself, concomitant medications, viral infections, or some combination of these causes. Patients taking \nCellCept should have complete blood counts weekly during the first month, twice monthly for the \nsecond and third months of treatment, then monthly through the first year. If neutropenia develops \n(absolute neutrophil count < 1.3 x 103/µl), it may be appropriate to interrupt or discontinue CellCept. \n \nCases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with CellCept in \ncombination with other immunosuppressants. The mechanism for mycophenolate mofetil induced \nPRCA is unknown. PRCA may resolve with dose reduction or cessation of CellCept therapy. Changes \nto CellCept therapy should only be undertaken under appropriate supervision in transplant recipients \nin order to minimise the risk of graft rejection (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients receiving CellCept should be instructed to report immediately any evidence of infection, \nunexpected bruising, bleeding or any other manifestation of bone marrow failure. \n \nPatients should be advised that, during treatment with CellCept, vaccinations may be less effective and \nthe use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided (see section 4.5). Influenza vaccination may be \nof value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination. \n \nGastro-intestinal \n \nCellCept has been associated with an increased incidence of digestive system adverse events, \nincluding infrequent cases of gastrointestinal tract ulceration, haemorrhage and perforation. CellCept \nshould be administered with caution in patients with active serious digestive system disease.  \n \nCellCept is an IMPDH (inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase) inhibitor. Therefore, it should be \navoided in patients with rare hereditary deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-\ntransferase (HGPRT) such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome. \n \nInteractions \n \nCaution should be exercised when switching combination therapy from regimens containing \nimmunosuppressants, which interfere with MPA enterohepatic recirculation, e.g. ciclosporin, to others \ndevoid of this effect, e.g. tacrolimus, sirolimus, belatacept, or vice versa, as this might result in \nchanges of MPA exposure. Drugs which interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle (e.g. \ncholestyramine, antibiotics) should be used with caution due to their potential to reduce the plasma \nlevels and efficacy of CellCept (see also section 4.5). Therapeutic drug monitoring of MPA may be \nappropriate when switching combination therapy (e.g. from ciclosporin to tacrolimus or vice versa) or \nto ensure adequate immunosuppression in patients with high immunological risk (e.g. risk of rejection, \ntreatment with antibiotics, addition or removal of an interacting medication). \n \nIt is recommended that CellCept should not be administered concomitantly with azathioprine because \nsuch concomitant administration has not been studied. \n \nThe risk/benefit ratio of mycophenolate mofetil in combination with sirolimus has not been \nestablished (see also section 4.5). \n \nSpecial populations  \n \nElderly patients may be at an increased risk of adverse events such as certain infections (including \ncytomegalovirus tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary \noedema, compared with younger individuals (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nTeratogenic effects \n \nMycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen. Spontaneous abortion (rate of 45% to 49%) and \ncongenital malformations (estimated rate of 23% to 27%) have been reported following MMF \nexposure during pregnancy. Therefore, CellCept is contraindicated in pregnancy unless there are no \nsuitable alternative treatments to prevent transplant rejection. Female patients of childbearing potential \nshould be made aware of the risks and follow the recommendations provided in section 4.6 (e.g. \ncontraceptive methods, pregnancy testing) prior to, during, and after therapy with CellCept. Physicians \nshould ensure that women taking mycophenolate understand the risk of harm to the baby, the need for \neffective contraception, and the need to immediately consult their physician if there is a possibility of \npregnancy. \n \nContraception (see section 4.6) \n \nBecause of robust clinical evidence showing a high risk of abortion and congenital malformations \nwhen mycophenolate mofetil is used in pregnancy, every effort to avoid pregnancy during treatment \nshould be taken. Therefore, women with childbearing potential must use at least one form of reliable \ncontraception (see section 4.3) before starting CellCept therapy, during therapy, and for six weeks \nafter stopping the therapy; unless abstinence is the chosen method of contraception. Two \ncomplementary forms of contraception simultaneously are preferred to minimise the potential for \ncontraceptive failure and unintended pregnancy. \n \nFor contraception advice for men see section 4.6. \n \nEducational materials \nIn order to assist patients in avoiding foetal exposure to mycophenolate and to provide additional \nimportant safety information, the Marketing Authorisation Holder will provide educational materials \nto healthcare professionals. The educational materials will reinforce the warnings about the \nteratogenicity of mycophenolate, provide advice on contraception before therapy is started and \nguidance on the need for pregnancy testing. Full patient information about the teratogenic risk and the \npregnancy prevention measures should be given by the physician to women of childbearing potential \nand, as appropriate, to male patients.  \n \nAdditional precautions \nPatients should not donate blood during therapy or for at least 6 weeks following discontinuation of \nmycophenolate. Men should not donate semen during therapy or for 90 days following discontinuation \nof mycophenolate. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAciclovir \nHigher aciclovir plasma concentrations were observed when mycophenolate mofetil was administered \nwith aciclovir in comparison to the administration of aciclovir alone. The changes in MPAG (the \nphenolic glucuronide of MPA) pharmacokinetics (MPAG increased by 8%) were minimal and are not \nconsidered clinically significant. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence \nof renal impairment, as are aciclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate mofetil and \naciclovir, or its prodrugs, e.g. valaciclovir, to compete for tubular secretion and further increases in \nconcentrations of both substances may occur. \n \nAntacids and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)  \nDecreased MPA exposure has been observed when antacids, such as magnesium and aluminium \nhydroxides, and PPIs, including lansoprazole and pantoprazole, were administered with CellCept. \nWhen comparing rates of transplant rejection or rates of graft loss between CellCept patients taking \nPPIs vs. CellCept patients not taking PPIs, no significant differences were seen. Theses data support \nextrapolation of this finding to all antacids because the reduction in exposure when CellCept was co-\nadministered with magnesium and aluminium hydroxides is considerably less than when CellCept was \nco-administered with PPIs. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nMedicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation (e.g. cholestyramine, ciclosporin A,  \nantibiotics) \nCaution should be used with medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation because \nof their potential to reduce the efficacy of CellCept. \n \nCholestyramine \nFollowing single dose administration of 1.5 g of mycophenolate mofetil to normal healthy subjects \npre-treated with 4 g TID of cholestyramine for 4 days, there was a 40% reduction in the AUC of MPA \n(see section 4.4 and section 5.2). Caution should be used during concomitant administration because \nof the potential to reduce efficacy of CellCept. \n \nCiclosporin A \nCiclosporin A (CsA) pharmacokinetics are unaffected by mycophenolate mofetil. \nIn contrast, if concomitant CsA treatment is stopped, an increase in MPA AUC of around 30% should \nbe expected. CsA interferes with MPA enterohepatic recycling, resulting in reduced MPA exposures \nby 30-50% in renal transplant patients treated with CellCept and CsA compared with patients \nreceiving sirolimus or belatacept and similar doses of CellCept (see also section 4.4). Conversely, \nchanges of MPA exposure should be expected when switching patients from CsA to one of the \nimmunosuppressants which does not interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle. \n \nAntibiotics eliminating β-glucuronidase-producing bacteria in the intestine (e.g. aminoglycoside, \ncephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, and penicillin classes of antibiotics) may interfere with MPAG/MPA \nenterohepatic recirculation, thus leading to reduced systemic MPA exposure. Information concerning \nthe following antibiotics is available: \n \nCiprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid \nReductions in pre-dose (trough) MPA concentrations of about 50% have been reported in renal \ntransplant recipients in the days immediately following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or \namoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. This effect tended to diminish with continued antibiotic use and to \ncease within a few days of antibiotic discontinuation. The change in pre-dose level may not accurately \nrepresent changes in overall MPA exposure. Therefore, a change in the dose of CellCept should not \nnormally be necessary in the absence of clinical evidence of graft dysfunction. However, close clinical \nmonitoring should be performed during the combination and shortly after antibiotic treatment. \n \nNorfloxacin and metronidazole \nIn healthy volunteers, no significant interaction was observed when CellCept was concomitantly \nadministered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. However, norfloxacin and metronidazole \ncombined reduced the MPA exposure by approximately 30% following a single dose of CellCept. \n \nTrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole \nNo effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed.  \n \nMedicinal products that affect glucuronidation (e.g. isavuconazole, telmisartan) \nConcomitant administration of drugs affecting glucuronidation of MPA may change MPA exposure. \nCaution is therefore recommended when administering these drugs concomitantly with CellCept.  \n \nIsavuconazole \nAn increase of MPA AUC0-∞ by 35% was observed with concomitant administration of \nisavuconazole. \n \nTelmisartan \nConcomitant administration of telmisartan and CellCept resulted in an approximately 30% decrease of \nMPA concentrations. Telmisartan changes MPA’s elimination by enhancing PPAR gamma \n(peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) expression, which in turn results in an enhanced \nUGT1A9 expression and activity. When comparing rates of transplant rejection, rates of graft loss or \n\n\n\n8 \n\nadverse event profiles between CellCept patients with and without concomitant telmisartan \nmedication, no clinical consequences of the pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction were seen. \n \nGanciclovir  \nBased on the results of a single dose administration study of recommended doses of oral \nmycophenolate and IV ganciclovir and the known effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics \nof CellCept (see section 4.2) and ganciclovir, it is anticipated that co-administration of these agents \n(which compete for mechanisms of renal tubular secretion) will result in increases in MPAG and \nganciclovir concentration. No substantial alteration of MPA pharmacokinetics is anticipated and \nCellCept dose adjustment is not required. In patients with renal impairment in whom CellCept and \nganciclovir or its prodrugs, e.g. valganciclovir, are co-administered, the dose recommendations for \nganciclovir should be observed and patients should be monitored carefully. \n \nOral contraceptives \nThe pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral contraceptives were unaffected by co-\nadministration of CellCept (see also section 5.2). \n \nRifampicin \nIn patients not also taking ciclosporin, concomitant administration of CellCept and rifampicin resulted \nin a decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) of 18% to 70%. It is recommended to monitor MPA \nexposure levels and to adjust CellCept doses accordingly to maintain clinical efficacy when rifampicin \nis administered concomitantly. \n \nSevelamer \nDecrease in MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 30% and 25%, respectively, were observed when CellCept \nwas concomitantly administered with sevelamer without any clinical consequences (i.e. graft \nrejection). It is recommended, however, to administer CellCept at least one hour before or three hours \nafter sevelamer intake to minimise the impact on the absorption of MPA. There are no data on \nCellCept with phosphate binders other than sevelamer. \n \nTacrolimus \nIn hepatic transplant patients initiated on CellCept and tacrolimus, the AUC and Cmax of MPA, the \nactive metabolite of CellCept, were not significantly affected by co-administration with tacrolimus. In \ncontrast, there was an increase of approximately 20% in tacrolimus AUC when multiple doses of \nCellCept (1.5 g BID) were administered to hepatic transplant patients taking tacrolimus. However, in \nrenal transplant patients, tacrolimus concentration did not appear to be altered by CellCept (see also \nsection 4.4). \n \nLive vaccines \nLive vaccines should not be given to patients with an impaired immune response. The antibody \nresponse to other vaccines may be diminished (see also section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nPotential interaction \nCo-administration of probenecid with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys raises plasma AUC of \nMPAG by 3-fold. Thus, other substances known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with \nMPAG, and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other substance undergoing tubular \nsecretion.  \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nPregnancy whilst taking mycophenolate must be avoided. Therefore, women of childbearing potential \nmust use at least one form of reliable contraception (see section 4.3) before starting CellCept therapy, \n\n\n\n9 \n\nduring therapy, and for six weeks after stopping the therapy, unless abstinence is the chosen method of \ncontraception. Two complementary forms of contraception simultaneously are preferred. \n \nPregnancy \n \nCellCept is contraindicated during pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment to \nprevent transplant rejection. Treatment should not be initiated without providing a negative pregnancy \ntest result to rule out unintended use in pregnancy.  \n \nFemale patients of reproductive potential must be made aware of the increased risk of pregnancy loss \nand congenital malformations at the beginning of the treatment and must be counselled regarding \npregnancy prevention and planning. \n \nBefore starting CellCept treatment, women of childbearing potential should have two negative serum \nor urine pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/ml in order to exclude unintended \nexposure of the embryo to mycophenolate. It is recommended that the second test should be performed \n8 - 10 days after the first test. For transplants from deceased donors, if it is not possible to perform two \ntests 8 - 10 days apart before treatment starts (because of the timing of transplant organ availability), a \npregnancy test must be performed immediately before starting treatment and a further test performed 8 \n- 10 days later. Pregnancy tests should be repeated as clinically required (e.g. after any gap in \ncontraception is reported). Results of all pregnancy tests should be discussed with the patient. Patients \nshould be instructed to consult their physician immediately should pregnancy occur. \n \nMycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen, with an increased risk of spontaneous abortions and \ncongenital malformations in case of exposure during pregnancy; \n• Spontaneous abortions have been reported in 45 to 49% of pregnant women exposed to \n\nmycophenolate mofetil, compared to a reported rate of between 12 and 33% in solid organ \ntransplant patients treated with immunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil. \n\n• Based on literature reports, malformations occurred in 23 to 27% of live births in women \nexposed to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (compared to 2 to 3% of live births in the \noverall population and approximately 4 to 5% of live births in solid organ transplant recipients \ntreated with immunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil). \n\n \nCongenital malformations, including reports of multiple malformations, have been observed post-\nmarketing in children of patients exposed to CellCept in combination with other immunosuppressants \nduring pregnancy. The following malformations were most frequently reported:  \n \n• Abnormalities of the ear (e.g. abnormally formed or absent external ear), external auditory canal \n\natresia (middle ear); \n• Facial malformations such as cleft lip, cleft palate, micrognathia and hypertelorism of the orbits; \n• Abnormalities of the eye (e.g. coloboma); \n• Congenital heart disease such as atrial and ventricular septal defects; \n• Malformations of the fingers (e.g. polydactyly, syndactyly); \n• Tracheo-oesophageal malformations (e.g. oesophageal atresia); \n• Nervous system malformations such as spina bifida;  \n• Renal abnormalities. \n\n \nIn addition, there have been isolated reports of the following malformations: \n• Microphthalmia; \n• Congenital choroid plexus cyst; \n• Septum pellucidum agenesis; \n• Olfactory nerve agenesis. \n \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nBreast-feeding \n \nMycophenolate mofetil has been shown to be excreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known \nwhether this substance is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse \nreactions to mycophenolate mofetil in breast-fed infants, CellCept is contraindicated in nursing \nmothers (see section 4.3). \n \nMen \n \nLimited clinical evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage \nfollowing paternal exposure to mycophenolate mofetil.  \n \nMPA is a powerful teratogen. It is not known if MPA is present in semen. Calculations based on \nanimal data show that the maximum amount of MPA that could potentially be transferred to woman is \nso low that it would be unlikely to have an effect. Mycophenolate has been shown to be genotoxic in \nanimal studies at concentrations exceeding the human therapeutic exposures only by small margins, \nsuch that the risk of genotoxic effects on sperm cells cannot completely be excluded. \n \nTherefore, the following precautionary measures are recommended: sexually active male patients or \ntheir female partners are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment of the male \npatient and for at least 90 days after cessation of mycophenolate mofetil. Male patients of reproductive \npotential should be made aware of and discuss with a qualified healthcare professional the potential \nrisks of fathering a child. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCellCept has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \nCellCept may cause somnolence, confusion, dizziness, tremor or hypotension, and therefore patients \nare advised to use caution when driving or using machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \nAn estimated total of 1557 patients received CellCept during five clinical trials in the prevention of \nacute organ rejection. Of these, 991 were included in the three renal studies, 277 were included in one \nhepatic study, and 289 were included in one cardiac study. Azathioprine was the comparator used in \nthe hepatic and cardiac studies and in two of the renal studies whilst the other renal study was placebo-\ncontrolled. Patients in all study arms also received cyclosporine and corticosteroids. The types of \nadverse reactions reported during post-marketing with CellCept are similar to those seen in the \ncontrolled renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant studies. \nDiarrhoea, leukopenia, sepsis and vomiting were among the most common and/or serious adverse drug \nreactions associated with the administration of CellCept in combination with ciclosporin and \ncorticosteroids. There is also evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections (see section \n4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from clinical trials and post-marketing experience are listed in \nTable 1, by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) along with their frequencies. The corresponding \nfrequency category for each adverse drug reaction is based on the following convention: very common \n(≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nand very rare (<1/10,000). Due to the large differences observed in the frequency of certain ADRs \nacross the different transplant indications, the frequency is presented separately for renal, hepatic and \ncardiac transplant patients. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nTable 1 Summary of adverse drug reactions occurring in patients treated with CellCept reported \nfrom clinical trials and post-marketing experience \n \n\nAdverse drug

(2 g IV / 3 g oral CellCept daily) patients were treated \nin Phase III studies for the prevention of rejection in renal, cardiac and hepatic transplantation, respectively. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nMalignancies \nPatients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, \nincluding CellCept, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, \nparticularly of the skin (see section 4.4). Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients \ndid not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. \nHepatic transplant patients were followed for at least 1 year, but less than 3 years.  \n \nInfections \nAll patients treated with immunosuppressants are at increased risk of bacterial, viral and fungal \ninfections (some of which may lead to a fatal outcome), including those caused by opportunistic \nagents and latent viral reactivation. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see section \n4.4). The most serious infections were sepsis, peritonitis, meningitis, endocarditis, tuberculosis and \natypical mycobacterial infection. The most common opportunistic infections in patients receiving \nCellCept (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressants in controlled clinical trials in renal, cardiac \nand hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year were candida mucocutaneous, CMV \nviraemia/syndrome and Herpes simplex. The proportion of patients with CMV viraemia/syndrome was \n13.5%. Cases of BK virus associated nephropathy, as well as cases of JC virus associated progressive \nmultifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), have been reported in patients treated with \nimmunosuppressants, including CellCept.  \n \nBlood and lymphatic disorders  \nCytopenias, including leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia, are known risks \nassociated with mycophenolate mofetil and may lead or contribute to the occurrence of infections and \nhemorrhages (see section 4.4). Agranulocytosis and neutropenia have been reported; therefore, regular \nmonitoring of patients taking CellCept is advised (see section 4.4). There have been reports of aplastic \nanaemia and bone marrow failure in patients treated with CellCept, some of which have been fatal. \nCases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with CellCept (see \nsection 4.4). \nIsolated cases of abnormal neutrophil morphology, including the acquired Pelger-Huet anomaly, have \nbeen observed in patients treated with CellCept. These changes are not associated with impaired \nneutrophil function. These changes may suggest a ‘left shift’ in the maturity of neutrophils in \nhaematological investigations, which may be mistakenly interpreted as a sign of infection in \nimmunosuppressed patients such as those that receive CellCept. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nThe most serious gastrointestinal disorders were ulceration and hemorrhage which are known risks \nassociated with mycophenolate mofetil. Mouth, esophageal, gastric, duodenal, and intestinal ulcers \noften complicated by hemorrhage, as well as hematemesis, melena, and hemorrhagic forms of gastritis \nand colitis were commonly reported during the pivotal clinical trials. The most common \ngastrointestinal disorders, however, were diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Endoscopic investigation of \npatients with CellCept-related diarrhea have revealed isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nHypersensitivity  \nHypersensitivity reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylactic reaction, have been \nreported.  \n \nPregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions \nCases of spontaneous abortion have been reported in patients exposed to mycophenolate mofetil, \nmainly in the first trimester, see section 4.6. \n \nCongenital disorders \nCongenital malformations have been observed post-marketing in children of patients exposed to \nCellCept in combination with other immunosuppressants, see section 4.6. \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nThere have been isolated reports of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis in patients treated \nwith CellCept in combination with other immunosuppressants, some of which have been fatal. There \nhave also been reports of bronchiectasis in children and adults. \n \nImmune system disorders \nHypogammaglobulinaemia has been reported in patients receiving CellCept in combination with other \nimmunosuppressants. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nEdema, including peripheral, face and scrotal edema, was reported very commonly during the pivotal \ntrials. Musculoskeletal pain such as myalgia, and neck and back pain were also very commonly \nreported. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \nThe type and frequency of adverse reactions in a clinical study, which recruited 92 paediatric patients \naged 2 to 18 years who were given 600 mg/m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily, were \ngenerally similar to those observed in adult patients given 1 g CellCept twice daily. However, the \nfollowing treatment-related adverse events were more frequent in the paediatric population, \nparticularly in children under 6 years of age, when compared to adults: diarrhoea, sepsis, leucopenia, \nanaemia and infection.  \n \nElderly \nElderly patients (≥ 65 years) may generally be at increased risk of adverse reactions due to \nimmunosuppression. Elderly patients receiving CellCept as part of a combination immunosuppressive \nregimen may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus tissue invasive \ndisease) and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary oedema, compared to younger \nindividuals.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n16 \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nReports of overdoses with mycophenolate mofetil have been received from clinical trials and during \npost-marketing experience. In many of these cases, no adverse events were reported. In those overdose \ncases in which adverse events were reported, the events fall within the known safety profile of the \nmedicinal product. \n \nIt is expected that an overdose of mycophenolate mofetil could possibly result in oversuppression of \nthe immune system and increase susceptibility to infections and bone marrow suppression (see section \n4.4). If neutropenia develops, dosing with CellCept should be interrupted or the dose reduced (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nHaemodialysis would not be expected to remove clinically significant amounts of MPA or MPAG. \nBile acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine, can remove MPA by decreasing the enterohepatic \nrecirculation of the drug (see section 5.2). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: immunosuppressive agents ATC code L04AA06 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nMycophenolate mofetil is the 2-morpholinoethyl ester of MPA. MPA is a potent, selective, \nuncompetitive and reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, and therefore \ninhibits the de novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into DNA. \nBecause T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for their proliferation on de novo synthesis of \npurines whereas other cell types can utilise salvage pathways, MPA has more potent cytostatic effects \non lymphocytes than on other cells.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing oral administration, mycophenolate mofetil undergoes rapid and extensive absorption and \ncomplete presystemic metabolism to the active metabolite, MPA. As evidenced by suppression of \nacute rejection following renal transplantation, the immunosuppressant activity of CellCept is \ncorrelated with MPA concentration. The mean bioavailability of oral mycophenolate mofetil, based on \nMPA AUC, is 94% relative to IV mycophenolate mofetil. Food had no effect on the extent of \nabsorption (MPA AUC) of mycophenolate mofetil when administered at doses of 1.5 g BID to renal \ntransplant patients. However, MPA Cmax was decreased by 40% in the presence of food. \nMycophenolate mofetil is not measurable systemically in plasma following oral administration.  \n \nDistribution \n \nAs a result of enterohepatic recirculation, secondary increases in plasma MPA concentration are \nusually observed at approximately 6 - 12 hours post-dose. A reduction in the AUC of MPA of \napproximately 40% is associated with the co-administration of cholestyramine (4 g TID), indicating \nthat there is a significant amount of enterohepatic recirculation.  \nMPA at clinically relevant concentrations is 97% bound to plasma albumin. \n \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n17 \n\nBiotransformation \n \nMPA is metabolised principally by glucuronyl transferase (isoform UGT1A9) to form the inactive \nphenolic glucuronide of MPA (MPAG). In vivo, MPAG is converted back to free MPA via \nenterohepatic recirculation. A minor acylglucuronide (AcMPAG) is also formed. AcMPAG is \npharmacologically active and is suspected to be responsible for some of MMF’s side effects \n(diarrhoea, leukopenia). \n \nElimination \nA negligible amount of substance is excreted as MPA (< 1% of the dose) in the urine. Oral \nadministration of radiolabelled mycophenolate mofetil results in complete recovery of the \nadministered dose with 93% of the administered dose recovered in the urine and 6% recovered in the \nfaeces. Most (about 87%) of the administered dose is excreted in the urine as MPAG. \n \nAt clinically encountered concentrations, MPA and MPAG are not removed by haemodialysis. \nHowever, at high MPAG plasma concentrations (> 100 µg/ml), small amounts of MPAG are removed. \nBy interfering with enterohepatic recirculation of the drug, bile acid sequestrants such as \ncholestyramine reduce MPA AUC (see section 4.9). \nMPA’s disposition depends on several transporters. Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) \nand multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) are involved in MPA’s disposition; OATP \nisoforms, MRP2 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) are transporters associated with the \nglucuronides’ biliary excretion. Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) is also able to transport MPA, \nbut its contribution seems to be confined to the absorption process. In the kidney, MPA and its \nmetabolites potently interact with renal organic anion transporters. \n \nIn the early post-transplant period (< 40 days post-transplant), renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant \npatients had mean MPA AUCs approximately 30% lower and Cmax approximately 40% lower \ncompared to the late post-transplant period (3 - 6 months post-transplant). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nIn a single dose study (6 subjects/group), mean plasma MPA AUC observed in subjects with severe \nchronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate < 25 ml/min/1.73 m2) were 28 – 75% higher \nrelative to the means observed in normal healthy subjects or subjects with lesser degrees of renal \nimpairment. The mean single dose MPAG AUC was 3 – 6-fold higher in subjects with severe renal \nimpairment than in subjects with mild renal impairment or normal healthy subjects, consistent with the \nknown renal elimination of MPAG. Multiple dosing of mycophenolate mofetil in patients with severe \nchronic renal impairment has not been studied. No data are available for cardiac or hepatic transplant \npatients with severe chronic renal impairment. \n \nDelayed renal graft function \nIn patients with delayed renal graft function post-transplant, mean MPA AUC0-12h was comparable to \nthat seen in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. Mean plasma MPAG AUC0-12h was \n2 – 3-fold higher than in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. There may be a \ntransient increase in the free fraction and concentration of plasma MPA in patients with delayed renal \ngraft function. Dose adjustment of CellCept does not appear to be necessary. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn volunteers with alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatic MPA glucuronidation processes were relatively \nunaffected by hepatic parenchymal disease. Effects of hepatic disease on this process probably depend \non the particular disease. However, hepatic disease with predominantly biliary damage, such as \nprimary biliary cirrhosis, may show a different effect.  \n \nPaediatric population \nPharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in 49 paediatric renal transplant patients (aged 2 to 18 \nyears) given 600 mg/m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily. This dose achieved MPA AUC \n\n\n\n18 \n\nvalues similar to those seen in adult renal transplant patients receiving CellCept at a dose of 1 g BID in \nthe early and late post-transplant period. MPA AUC values across age groups were similar in the early \nand late post-transplant period. \n \nElderly \nThe pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil and its metabolites have not been found to be altered \nin the elderly patients (≥ 65 years) when compared to younger transplant patients. \n \nPatients taking oral contraceptives \nA study of the co-administration of CellCept (1 g BID) and combined oral contraceptives containing \nethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.15 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) \nor gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) conducted in 18 non-transplant women (not taking other \nimmunosuppressants) over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles showed no clinically relevant influence of \nCellCept on the ovulation suppressing action of the oral contraceptives. Serum levels of LH, FSH and \nprogesterone were not significantly affected. The pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives were \nunaffected by co-administration of CellCept (see also section 4.5). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn experimental models, mycophenolate mofetil was not tumourigenic. The highest dose tested in the \nanimal carcinogenicity studies resulted in approximately 2 – 3 times the systemic exposure (AUC or \nCmax) observed in renal transplant patients at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g/day and 1.3 – 2 \ntimes the systemic exposure (AUC or Cmax) observed in cardiac transplant patients at the recommended \nclinical dose of 3 g/day. \n \nTwo genotoxicity assays (in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and in vivo mouse bone marrow \nmicronucleus test) showed a potential of mycophenolate mofetil to cause chromosomal aberrations. \nThese effects can be related to the pharmacodynamic mode of action, i.e. inhibition of nucleotide \nsynthesis in sensitive cells. Other in vitro tests for detection of gene mutation did not demonstrate \ngenotoxic activity. \n \nMycophenolate mofetil had no effect on fertility of male rats at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day. The \nsystemic exposure at this dose represents 2 – 3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical \ndose of 2 g/day in renal transplant patients and 1.3 – 2 times the clinical exposure at the recommended \nclinical dose of 3 g/day in cardiac transplant patients. In a female fertility and reproduction study \nconducted in rats, oral doses of 4.5 mg/kg/day caused malformations (including anophthalmia, \nagnathia, and hydrocephaly) in the first generation offspring in the absence of maternal toxicity. The \nsystemic exposure at this dose was approximately 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the recommended \nclinical dose of 2 g/day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the clinical exposure \nat the recommended clinical dose of 3 g/day for cardiac transplant patients. No effects on fertility or \nreproductive parameters were evident in the dams or in the subsequent generation.  \n \nIn teratology studies in rats and rabbits, foetal resorptions and malformations occurred in rats at \n6 mg/kg/day (including anophthalmia, agnathia, and hydrocephaly) and in rabbits at 90 mg/kg/day \n(including cardiovascular and renal anomalies, such as ectopia cordis and ectopic kidneys, and \ndiaphragmatic and umbilical hernia), in the absence of maternal toxicity. The systemic exposure at \nthese levels is approximately equivalent to or less than 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the \nrecommended clinical dose of 2 g/day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the \nclinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g/day for cardiac transplant patients (see \nsection 4.6). \n \nThe haematopoietic and lymphoid systems were the primary organs affected in toxicology studies \nconducted with mycophenolate mofetil in the rat, mouse, dog and monkey. These effects occurred at \nsystemic exposure levels that are equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended \ndose of 2 g/day for renal transplant recipients. Gastrointestinal effects were observed in the dog at \nsystemic exposure levels equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended dose. \nGastrointestinal and renal effects consistent with dehydration were also observed in the monkey at the \n\n\n\n19 \n\nhighest dose (systemic exposure levels equivalent to or greater than clinical exposure). The nonclinical \ntoxicity profile of mycophenolate mofetil appears to be consistent with adverse events observed in \nhuman clinical trials, which now provide safety data of more relevance to the patient population (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nCellCept 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains the equivalent of 500 mg mycophenolate mofetil (as hydrochloride salt). \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect \n \nSodium less than 1 mmol (23 mg) per dose \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nCellCept 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion must be reconstituted and further \ndiluted with glucose intravenous infusion 5% prior to administration to the patient (see section 6.6). \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCellCept 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion is indicated in combination with \nciclosporin and corticosteroids for the prophylaxis of acute transplant rejection in patients receiving \nallogeneic renal or hepatic transplants. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with CellCept should be initiated and maintained by appropriately qualified transplant \nspecialists. \n \nCAUTION: CELLCEPT I.V. SOLUTION MUST NOT BE ADMINISTERED BY RAPID OR \nBOLUS INTRAVENOUS INJECTION.  \n \nPosology  \n \nCellCept 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion is an alternative dosage form to \nCellCept oral forms (capsules, tablets and powder for oral suspension) that may be administered for up \nto 14 days. The initial dose of CellCept 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nshould be given within 24 hours following transplantation. \n \nRenal transplant \nThe recommended dose in renal transplant patients is 1 g administered twice daily (2 g daily dose).  \n \nHepatic transplant \nThe recommended dose of CellCept for infusion in hepatic transplant patients is 1 g administered \ntwice daily (2 g daily dose). IV CellCept should continue for the first 4 days following hepatic \ntransplant, with oral CellCept initiated as soon after this as it can be tolerated. The recommended dose \nof oral CellCept in hepatic transplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily (3 g daily dose). \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nUse in special populations \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of CellCept for infusion in paediatric patients have not been established. No \npharmacokinetic data with CellCept for infusion are available for paediatric renal transplant patients. \nNo pharmacokinetic data are available for paediatric patients following hepatic transplants. \n \nElderly \nThe recommended dose of 1 g administered twice a day for renal or hepatic transplant patients is \nappropriate for the elderly.  \n \nRenal impairment \nIn renal transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n< 25 ml/min/1.73 m2), outside the immediate post-transplant period, doses greater than 1 g \nadministered twice a day should be avoided. These patients should also be carefully observed. No dose \nadjustments are needed in patients experiencing delayed renal graft function post-operatively (see \nsection 5.2). No data are available for hepatic transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment. \n \nSevere hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustments are needed for renal transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease.  \n \nTreatment during rejection episodes \nMycophenolic acid (MPA) is the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil. Renal transplant \nrejection does not lead to changes in MPA pharmacokinetics; dosage reduction or interruption of \nCellCept is not required. No pharmacokinetic data are available during hepatic transplant rejection. \n \nPaediatric population \nNo data are available for treatment of first or refractory rejection in paediatric transplant patients. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFollowing reconstitution to a concentration of 6 mg/ml, CellCept 500 mg powder for concentrate for \nsolution for infusion must be administered by slow intravenous infusion over a period of 2 hours by \neither a peripheral or a central vein (see section 6.6). \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \nBecause mycophenolate mofetil has demonstrated teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits, avoid direct \ncontact of the dry powder or prepared solutions of CellCept 500 mg powder for concentrate for \nsolution for infusion with skin or mucous membranes. If such contact occurs, wash thoroughly with \nsoap and water; rinse eyes with plain water. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• CellCept should not be given to patients with hypersensitivity to mycophenolate mofetil, \n\nmycophenolic acid or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Hypersensitivity reactions to \nCellCept have been observed (see section 4.8). CellCept 500 mg powder for concentrate for \nsolution for infusion is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to polysorbate 80.  \n\n \n• CellCept should not be given to women of childbearing potential who are not using highly \n\neffective contraception (see section 4.6).  \n \n\n• CellCept treatment should not be initiated in women of childbearing potential without providing \na pregnancy test result to rule out unintended use in pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\n• CellCept should not to be used in pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment to \nprevent transplant rejection (see section 4.6).  \n\n \n• CellCept should not be given to women who are breastfeeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nNeoplasms \n \nPatients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, \nincluding CellCept, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, \nparticularly of the skin (see section 4.8). The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of \nimmunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent.  \nAs general advice to minimise the risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be \nlimited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. \n \nInfections \n \nPatients treated with immunosuppressants, including CellCept, are at increased risk for opportunistic \ninfections (bacterial, fungal, viral and protozoal), fatal infections and sepsis (see section 4.8). Such \ninfections include latent viral reactivation, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C reactivation and infections \ncaused by polyomaviruses (BK virus-associated nephropathy, JC virus-associated progressive \nmultifocal leukoencephalopathy PML). Cases of hepatitis due to reactivation of hepatitis B or hepatitis \nC have been reported in carrier patients treated with immunosuppressants. These infections are often \nrelated to a high total immunosuppressive burden and may lead to serious or fatal conditions that \nphysicians should consider in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients with \ndeteriorating renal function or neurological symptoms. \n \nThere have been reports of hypogammaglobulinaemia in association with recurrent infections in \npatients receiving CellCept in combination with other immunosuppressants. In some of these cases, \nswitching CellCept to an alternative immunosuppressant resulted in serum IgG levels returning to \nnormal. Patients on CellCept who develop recurrent infections should have their serum \nimmunoglobulins measured. In cases of sustained, clinically relevant hypogammaglobulinaemia, \nappropriate clinical action should be considered taking into account the potent cytostatic effects that \nmycophenolic acid has on T- and B-lymphocytes. \n \nThere have been published reports of bronchiectasis in adults and children who received CellCept in \ncombination with other immunosuppressants. In some of these cases, switching CellCept to another \nimmunosuppressant resulted in improvement in respiratory symptoms. The risk of bronchiectasis may \nbe linked to hypogammaglobulinaemia or to a direct effect on the lung. There have also been isolated \nreports of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis, some of which were fatal (see section 4.8). \nIt is recommended that patients who develop persistent pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and \ndyspnoea, are investigated. \n \nBlood and immune system \n \nPatients receiving CellCept should be monitored for neutropenia, which may be related to CellCept \nitself, concomitant medications, viral infections, or some combination of these causes. Patients taking \nCellCept should have complete blood counts weekly during the first month, twice monthly for the \nsecond and third months of treatment, then monthly through the first year. If neutropenia develops \n(absolute neutrophil count < 1.3 x 103/µl) it may be appropriate to interrupt or discontinue CellCept. \n \nCases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with CellCept in \ncombination with other immunosuppressants. The mechanism for mycophenolate mofetil induced \nPRCA is unknown. PRCA may resolve with dose reduction or cessation of CellCept therapy. Changes \nto CellCept therapy should only be undertaken under appropriate supervision in transplant recipients \nin order to minimise the risk of graft rejection (see section 4.8). \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \nPatients receiving CellCept should be instructed to report immediately any evidence of infection, \nunexpected bruising, bleeding or any other manifestation of bone marrow failure. \n \nPatients should be advised that, during treatment with CellCept, vaccinations may be less effective, \nand the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided (see section 4.5). Influenza vaccination may \nbe of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination. \n \nGastro-intestinal \n \nCellCept has been associated with an increased incidence of digestive system adverse events, \nincluding infrequent cases of gastrointestinal tract ulceration, haemorrhage and perforation. CellCept \nshould be administered with caution in patients with active serious digestive system disease.  \n \nCellCept is an IMPDH (inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase) inhibitor. Therefore, it should be \navoided in patients with rare hereditary deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase \n(HGPRT) such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome. \n \nInteractions \n \nCaution should be exercised when switching combination therapy from regimens containing \nimmunosuppressants, which interfere with MPA enterohepatic recirculation, e.g. ciclosporin, to others \ndevoid of this effect, e.g. tacrolimus, sirolimus, belatacept, or vice versa, as this might result in \nchanges of MPA exposure. Drugs which interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle (e.g. \ncholesterolamine, antibiotics) should be used with caution due to their potential to reduce the plasma \nlevels and efficacy of CellCept (see also section 4.5). Some degree of enterohepatic recirculation is \nanticipated following intravenous administration of CellCept. Therapeutic drug monitoring of MPA \nmay be appropriate when switching combination therapy (e.g. from ciclosporin to tacrolimus or vice \nversa) or to ensure adequate immunosuppression in patients with high immunological risk (e.g. risk of \nrejection, treatment with antibiotics, addition or removal of an interacting medication). \n \nIt is recommended that CellCept should not be administered concomitantly with azathioprine because \nsuch concomitant administration has not been studied. \n \nThe risk/benefit ratio of mycophenolate mofetil in combination with sirolimus has not been \nestablished (see also section 4.5). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients may be at an increased risk of adverse events such as certain infections (including \ncytomegalovirus tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary \noedema, compared with younger individuals (see section 4.8). \n \nTeratogenic effects \n \nMycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen. Spontaneous abortion (rate of 45% to 49%) and \ncongenital malformations (estimated rate of 23% to 27%) have been reported following MMF \nexposure during pregnancy. Therefore, CellCept is contraindicated in pregnancy unless there are no \nsuitable alternative treatments to prevent transplant rejection. Female patients of childbearing potential \nshould be made aware of the risks and follow the recommendations provided in section 4.6 (e.g. \ncontraceptive methods, pregnancy testing) prior to, during, and after therapy with CellCept. Physicians \nshould ensure that women taking mycophenolate understand the risk of harm to the baby, the need for \neffective contraception, and the need to immediately consult their physician if there is a possibility of \npregnancy. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nContraception (see section 4.6) \n \nBecause of robust clinical evidence showing a high risk of abortion and congenital malformations \nwhen mycophenolate mofetil is used in pregnancy, every effort to avoid pregnancy during treatment \nshould be taken. Therefore, women with childbearing potential must use at least one form of reliable \ncontraception (see section 4.3) before starting CellCept therapy, during therapy, and for six weeks \nafter stopping the therapy, unless abstinence is the chosen method of contraception. Two \ncomplementary forms of contraception simultaneously are preferred to minimise the potential for \ncontraceptive failure and unintended pregnancy. \n \nFor contraception advice for men see section 4.6. \n \nEducational materials \n \nIn order to assist patients in avoiding foetal exposure to mycophenolate and to provide additional \nimportant safety information, the Marketing Authorisation Holder will provide educational materials \nto healthcare professionals. The educational materials will reinforce the warnings about the \nteratogenicity of mycophenolate, provide advice on contraception before therapy is started and \nguidance on the need for pregnancy testing. Full patient information about the teratogenic risk and the \npregnancy prevention measures should be given by the physician to women of childbearing potential \nand, as appropriate, to male patients. \n \nAdditional precautions \nPatients should not donate blood during therapy or for at least 6 weeks following discontinuation of \nmycophenolate. Men should not donate semen during therapy or for 90 days following discontinuation \nof mycophenolate. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAciclovir  \nHigher aciclovir plasma concentrations were observed when mycophenolate mofetil was administered \nwith aciclovir in comparison to the administration of aciclovir alone. The changes in MPAG (the \nphenolic glucuronide of MPA) pharmacokinetics (MPAG increased by 8%) were minimal and are not \nconsidered clinically significant. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence \nof renal impairment, as are aciclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate mofetil and \naciclovir, or its prodrugs, e.g. valaciclovir, to compete for tubular secretion, and further increases in \nconcentrations of both substances may occur. \n \nMedicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation (e.g. cholestyramine, ciclosporin A, \nantibiotics) \nCaution should be used with medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation because \nof their potential to reduce the efficacy of CellCept. \n \nCholestyramine \nFollowing single dose, oral administration of 1.5 g of mycophenolate mofetil to normal healthy \nsubjects pre-treated with 4 g TID of cholestyramine for 4 days, there was a 40% reduction in the AUC \nof MPA (see section 4.4, and section 5.2). Caution should be used during concomitant administration \nbecause of the potential to reduce efficacy of CellCept. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nCiclosporin A \nCiclosporin A (CsA) pharmacokinetics are unaffected by mycophenolate mofetil. \nIn contrast, if concomitant CsA treatment is stopped, an increase in MPA AUC of around 30% should \nbe expected. CsA interferes with MPA enterohepatic recycling, resulting in reduced MPA exposures \nby 30 - 50% in renal transplant patients treated with CellCept and CsA compared with patients \nreceiving sirolimus or belatacept and similar doses of CellCept (see also section 4.4). Conversely, \nchanges of MPA exposure should be expected when switching patients from CsA to one of the \nimmunosuppressants which does not interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle. \n \nAntibiotics eliminating -glucuronidase-producing bacteria in the intestine (e.g. aminoglycoside, \ncephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, and penicillin classes of antibiotics) may interfere with MPAG/MPA \nenterohepatic recirculation, thus leading to reduced systemic MPA exposure. Information concerning \nthe following antibiotics is available: \n \nCiprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid  \nReductions in pre-dose (trough) MPA concentrations of about 50% have been reported in renal \ntransplant recipients in the days immediately following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or \namoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. This effect tended to diminish with continued antibiotic use and to \ncease within a few days of antibiotic discontinuation. The change in pre-dose level may not accurately \nrepresent changes in overall MPA exposure. Therefore, a change in the dose of CellCept should not \nnormally be necessary in the absence of clinical evidence of graft dysfunction. However, close clinical \nmonitoring should be performed during the combination and shortly after antibiotic treatment. \n \nNorfloxacin and metronidazole \nIn healthy volunteers, no significant interaction was observed when CellCept was concomitantly \nadministered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. However, norfloxacin and metronidazole \ncombined reduced the MPA exposure by approximately 30% following a single dose of CellCept. \n \nTrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole \nNo effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. \n \nMedicinal products that affect glucuronidation (e.g. isavuconazole, telmisartan) \nConcomitant administration of drugs affecting glucuronidation of MPA may change MPA exposure. \nCaution is therefore recommended when administering these drugs concomitantly with CellCept.  \n \nIsavuconazole \nAn increase of MPA AUC0-∞ by 35% was observed with concomitant administration of \nisavuconazole. \n \nTelmisartan \nConcomitant administration of telmisartan and CellCept resulted in an approximately 30% decrease of \nMPA concentrations. Telmisartan changes MPA’s elimination by enhancing PPAR gamma \n(peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) expression, which in turn results in an enhanced \nUGT1A9 expression and activity. When comparing rates of transplant rejection, rates of graft loss or \nadverse event profiles between CellCept patients with and without concomitant telmisartan \nmedication, no clinical consequences of the pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction were seen. \n \nGanciclovir \nBased on the results of a single dose administration study of recommended doses of oral \nmycophenolate and IV ganciclovir and the known effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics \nof CellCept (see section 4.2) and ganciclovir, it is anticipated that co-administration of these agents \n(which compete for mechanisms of renal tubular secretion) will result in increases in MPAG and \nganciclovir concentration. No substantial alteration of MPA pharmacokinetics is anticipated and \nCellCept dose adjustment is not required. In patients with renal impairment in whom CellCept and \nganciclovir or its prodrugs, e.g. valganciclovir, are co-administered, the dose recommendations for \nganciclovir should be observed and patients should be monitored carefully. \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nOral contraceptives \nThe pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral contraceptives were unaffected by co-\nadministration of CellCept (see also section 5.2). \n \nRifampicin \nIn patients not also taking ciclosporin, concomitant administration of CellCept and rifampicin resulted \nin a decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) of 18% to 70%. It is recommended to monitor MPA \nexposure levels and to adjust CellCept doses accordingly to maintain clinical efficacy when rifampicin \nis administered concomitantly. \n \nSevelamer \nDecrease in MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 30% and 25%, respectively, were observed when CellCept \nwas concomitantly administered with sevelamer without any clinical consequences (i.e. graft \nrejection). It is recommended, however, to administer CellCept at least one hour before or three hours \nafter sevelamer intake to minimise the impact on the absorption of MPA. There are no data on \nCellCept with phosphate binders other than sevelamer. \n \nTacrolimus \nIn hepatic transplant patients initiated on CellCept and tacrolimus, the AUC and Cmax of MPA, the \nactive metabolite of CellCept, were not significantly affected by co-administration with tacrolimus. In \ncontrast, there was an increase of approximately 20% in tacrolimus AUC when multiple doses of \nCellCept (1.5 g BID) were administered to hepatic transplant patients taking tacrolimus. However, in \nrenal transplant patients, tacrolimus concentration did not appear to be altered by CellCept (see also \nsection 4.4). \n \nLive vaccines \nLive vaccines should not be given to patients with an impaired immune response. The antibody \nresponse to other vaccines may be diminished (see also section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nPotential interaction \nCo-administration of probenecid with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys raises plasma AUC of \nMPAG by 3-fold. Thus, other substances known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with \nMPAG, and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other substance undergoing tubular \nsecretion.  \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nPregnancy whilst taking mycophenolate must be avoided. Therefore, women of childbearing potential \nmust use at least one form of reliable contraception (see section 4.3) before starting CellCept therapy, \nduring therapy, and for six weeks after stopping the therapy, unless abstinence is the chosen method of \ncontraception. Two complementary forms of contraception simultaneously are preferred. \n \nPregnancy \n \nCellCept is contraindicated during pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment to \nprevent transplant rejection. Treatment should not be initiated without providing a negative pregnancy \ntest result to rule out unintended use in pregnancy.   \n \nFemale patients of reproductive potential must be made aware of the increased risk of pregnancy loss \nand congenital malformations at the beginning of the treatment and must be counselled regarding \npregnancy prevention, and planning. \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nBefore starting CellCept treatment, women of childbearing potential should have two negative serum \nor urine pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/ml in order to exclude unintended \nexposure of the embryo to mycophenolate. It is recommended that the second test should be performed \n8 - 10 days after the first test. For transplants from deceased donors, if it is not possible to perform two \ntests 8 - 10 days apart before treatment starts (because of the timing of transplant organ availability), a \npregnancy test must be performed immediately before starting treatment and a further test performed 8 \n- 10 days later. Pregnancy tests should be repeated as clinically required (e.g. after any gap in \ncontraception is reported). Results of all pregnancy tests should be discussed with the patient. Patients \nshould be instructed to consult their physician immediately should pregnancy occur. \n \nMycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen, with an increased risk of spontaneous abortions and \ncongenital malformations in case of exposure during pregnancy; \n• Spontaneous abortions have been reported in 45 to 49% of pregnant women exposed to \n\nmycophenolate mofetil, compared to a reported rate of between 12 and 33% in solid organ \ntransplant patients treated with immunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil. \n\n• Based on literature reports, malformations occurred in 23 to 27% of live births in women \nexposed to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (compared to 2 to 3% of live births in the \noverall population and approximately 4 to 5% of live births in solid organ transplant recipients \ntreated with immunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil). \n\n \nCongenital malformations, including reports of multiple malformations, have been observed post-\nmarketing in children of patients exposed to CellCept during pregnancy in combination with other \nimmunosuppressants. The following malformations were most frequently reported:  \n \n\n• Abnormalities of the ear (e.g. abnormally formed or absent external ear), external auditory \ncanal atresia (middle ear); \n\n• Facial malformations such as cleft lip, cleft palate, micrognathia and hypertelorism of the \norbits; \n\n• Abnormalities of the eye (e.g. coloboma); \n• Congenital heart disease such as atrial and ventricular septal defects; \n• Malformations of the fingers (e.g. polydactyly, syndactyly); \n• Tracheo-oesophageal malformations (e.g. oesophageal atresia);  \n• Nervous system malformations such as spina bifida; \n• Renal abnormalities. \n \nIn addition, there have been isolated reports of the following malformations: \n• Microphthalmia; \n• Congenital choroid plexus cyst; \n• Septum pellucidum agenesis; \n• Olfactory nerve agenesis. \n \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nMycophenolate mofetil has been shown to be excreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known \nwhether this substance is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse \nreactions to mycophenolate mofetil in breast-fed infants, CellCept is contraindicated in nursing \nmothers (see section 4.3). \n \nMen \n \nLimited clinical evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage \nfollowing paternal exposure to mycophenolate mofetil.  \n \nMPA is a powerful teratogen. It is not known if MPA is present in semen. Calculations based on \nanimal data show that the maximum amount of MPA that could potentially be transferred to woman is \n\n\n\n29 \n\nso low that it would be unlikely to have an effect. Mycophenolate has been shown to be genotoxic in \nanimal studies at concentrations exceeding the human therapeutic exposures only by small margins \nsuch that the risk of genotoxic effects on sperm cells cannot completely be excluded. \n \nTherefore, the following precautionary measures are recommended: sexually active male patients or \ntheir female partners are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment of the male \npatient and for at least 90 days after cessation of mycophenolate mofetil. Male patients of reproductive \npotential should be made aware of and discuss with a qualified healthcare professional the potential \nrisks of fathering a child. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCellCept has a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \nCellCept may cause somnolence, confusion, dizziness, tremor or hypotension, and therefore patients \nare advised to use caution when driving or using machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \nAn estimated total of 1268 patients received CellCept during four clinical trials in the prevention of \nacute organ rejection. Of these, 991 were included in the three renal studies and 277 were included in \none hepatic study. Azathioprine was the comparator used in the hepatic study and in two of the renal \nstudies whilst the other renal study was placebo-controlled. Patients in all study arms also received \ncyclosporine and corticosteroids. The types of adverse reactions reported during post-marketing with \nCellCept are similar to those seen in the controlled renal and hepatic transplant studies. \n \nDiarrhoea, leukopenia, sepsis and vomiting were among the most common and/or serious adverse \ndrugs reactions associated with the administration of CellCept in combination with ciclosporin and \ncorticosteroids. There is also evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections (see section \n4.4).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from clinical trials and post-marketing experience are listed in \nTable 1, by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) along with their frequencies. The corresponding \nfrequency category for each adverse drug reaction is based on the following convention: very common \n(≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nand very rare (<1/10,000). Due to the large differences observed in the frequency of certain ADRs \nacross the different transplant indications, the frequency is presented separately for renal and hepatic \ntransplant patients.

CellCept daily) patients were treated in Phase III studies for the \nprevention of rejection in renal and hepatic transplantation, respectively \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \nAdverse reactions attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both \nobserved at 4% in patients treated with CellCept 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution for \ninfusion. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nMalignancies \nPatients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, \nincluding CellCept, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, \nparticularly of the skin (see section 4.4). Three-year safety data in renal transplant patients did not \nreveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. Hepatic \ntransplant patients were followed for at least 1 year, but less than 3 years.  \n \nInfections \nAll patients treated with immunosuppressants are at increased risk of bacterial, viral and fungal \ninfections (some of which may lead to a fatal outcome), including those caused by opportunistic \nagents and latent viral reactivation. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see section \n4.4). The most serious infections were sepsis, peritonitis, meningitis, endocarditis tuberculosis and \natypical mycobacterial infection. The most common opportunistic infections in patients receiving \nCellCept (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressants in controlled clinical trials in renal and \nhepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year were candida mucocutaneous, CMV \nviraemia/syndrome and Herpes simplex. The proportion of patients with CMV viraemia/syndrome was \n13.5%. Cases of BK virus associated nephropathy, as well as cases of JC virus associated progressive \nmultifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), have been reported in patients treated with \nimmunosuppressants, including CellCept.  \n \nBlood and lymphatic disorders  \nCytopenias, including leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia, are known risks \nassociated with mycophenolate mofetil and may lead or contribute to the occurrence of infections and \nhemorrhages (see section 4.4). Agranulocytosis and neutropenia have been reported; therefore, regular \nmonitoring of patients taking CellCept is advised (see section 4.4). There have been reports of aplastic \nanaemia and bone marrow failure in patients treated with CellCept, some of which have been fatal.  \nCases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with CellCept (see \nsection 4.4). \nIsolated cases of abnormal neutrophil morphology, including the acquired Pelger-Huet anomaly, have \nbeen observed in patients treated with CellCept. These changes are not associated with impaired \nneutrophil function. These changes may suggest a ‘left shift’ in the maturity of neutrophils in \nhaematological investigations, which may be mistakenly interpreted as a sign of infection in \nimmunosuppressed patients such as those that receive CellCept. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nThe most serious gastrointestinal disorders were ulceration and hemorrhage which are known risks \nassociated with mycophenolate mofetil. Mouth, esophageal, gastric, duodenal, and intestinal ulcers \noften complicated by hemorrhage, as well as hematemesis, melena, and hemorrhagic forms of gastritis \nand colitis were commonly reported during the pivotal clinical trials. The most common \ngastrointestinal disorders, however, were diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Endoscopic investigation of \npatients with CellCept-related diarrhea have revealed isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nHypersensitivity  \nHypersensitivity reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylactic reaction, have been \nreported. \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nPregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions \nCases of spontaneous abortion have been reported in patients exposed to mycophenolate mofetil, \nmainly in the first trimester, see section 4.6. \n \nCongenital disorders \nCongenital malformations have been observed post-marketing in children of patients exposed to \nCellCept in combination with other immunosuppressants, see section 4.6. \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nThere have been isolated reports of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis in patients treated \nwith CellCept in combination with other immunosuppressants, some of which have been fatal. There \nhave also been reports of bronchiectasis in children and adults. \n \nImmune system disorders \nHypogammaglobulinaemia has been reported in patients receiving CellCept in combination with other \nimmunosuppressants. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nEdema, including peripheral, face and scrotal edema, was reported very commonly during the pivotal \ntrials. Musculoskeletal pain such as myalgia, and neck and back pain were also very commonly \nreported. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nElderly patients (≥ 65 years) may generally be at increased risk of adverse reactions due to \nimmunosuppression. Elderly patients receiving CellCept as part of a combination immunosuppressive \nregimen may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus tissue invasive \ndisease) and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary oedema, compared to younger \nindividuals.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nReports of overdoses with mycophenolate mofetil have been received from clinical trials and during \npost-marketing experience. In many of these cases, no adverse events were reported. In those overdose \ncases in which adverse events were reported, the events fall within the known safety profile of the \nmedicinal product. \n \nIt is expected that an overdose of mycophenolate mofetil could possibly result in oversuppression of \nthe immune system and increase susceptibility to infections and bone marrow suppression (see section \n4.4). If neutropenia develops, dosing with CellCept should be interrupted or the dose reduced (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nHaemodialysis would not be expected to remove clinically significant amounts of MPA or MPAG. \nBile acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine, can remove MPA by decreasing the enterohepatic \nrecirculation of the drug (see section 5.2). \n \n \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n35 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: immunosuppressive agents ATC code L04AA06 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nMycophenolate mofetil is the 2-morpholinoethyl ester of MPA. MPA is a potent, selective, \nuncompetitive and reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, and therefore \ninhibits the de novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into DNA. \nBecause T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for their proliferation on de novo synthesis of \npurines whereas other cell types can utilise salvage pathways, MPA has more potent cytostatic effects \non lymphocytes than on other cells.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing intravenous administration, mycophenolate mofetil undergoes rapid and complete \nmetabolism to the active metabolite, MPA. The parent substance mycophenolate mofetil can be \nmeasured systemically during intravenous infusion. MPA at clinically relevant concentrations is 97% \nbound to plasma albumin. \nAs a result of enterohepatic recirculation, secondary increases in plasma MPA concentration are \nusually observed at approximately 6 – 12 hours post-dose. A reduction in the AUC of MPA of \napproximately 40% is associated with the co-administration of cholestyramine (4 g TID), indicating \nthat there is a significant amount of enterohepatic recirculation.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nMPA is metabolised principally by glucuronyl transferase (isoform UGT1A9) to form the inactive \nphenolic glucuronide of MPA (MPAG). In vivo, MPAG is converted back to free MPA via \nenterohepatic recirculation. A minor acylglucuronide (AcMPAG) is also formed. AcMPAG is \npharmacologically active and is suspected to be responsible for some of MMF’s side effects \n(diarrhoea, leukopenia). \n \nElimination \n \nA negligible amount of substance is excreted as MPA (< 1% of the dose) in the urine. Oral \nadministration of radiolabelled mycophenolate mofetil results in complete recovery of the \nadministered dose, with 93% of the administered dose recovered in the urine and 6% recovered in \nfaeces. Most (about 87%) of the administered dose is excreted in the urine as MPAG. \n \nAt clinically encountered concentrations, MPA and MPAG are not removed by haemodialysis. \nHowever, at high MPAG plasma concentrations (> 100 µg/ml), small amounts of MPAG are removed. \nBy interfering with enterohepatic recirculation of the drug, bile acid sequestrants such as \ncholestyramine, reduce MPA AUC (see section 4.9). \nMPA’s disposition depends on several transporters. Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) \nand multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) are involved in MPA’s disposition; OATP \nisoforms, MRP2 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) are transporters associated with the \nglucuronides’ biliary excretion. Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) is also able to transport MPA, \nbut its contribution seems to be confined to the absorption process. In the kidney, MPA and its \nmetabolites potently interact with renal organic anion transporters. \n \nIn the early post-transplant period (< 40 days post-transplant), renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant \npatients had mean MPA AUCs approximately 30% lower and Cmax approximately 40% lower \ncompared to the late post-transplant period (3 – 6 months post-transplant).  \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \nEquivalence with oral dosage forms \n \nMPA AUC values obtained following administration of 1 g BID intravenous CellCept to renal \ntransplant patients in the early post-transplant phase are comparable to those observed following 1 g \nBID oral CellCept. In hepatic transplant patients, administration of 1 g BID intravenous CellCept \nfollowed by 1.5 g BID oral CellCept resulted in MPA AUC values similar to those found in renal \ntransplant patients administered 1 g CellCept BID. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nIn a single dose study (6 subjects/group), mean plasma MPA AUC observed in subjects with severe \nchronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate < 25 ml/min/1.73 m2) were 28 – 75% higher \nrelative to the means observed in normal healthy subjects or subjects with lesser degrees of renal \nimpairment. The mean single dose MPAG AUC was 3 – 6 fold higher in subjects with severe renal \nimpairment than in subjects with mild renal impairment or normal healthy subjects, consistent with the \nknown renal elimination of MPAG. Multiple dosing of mycophenolate mofetil in patients with severe \nchronic renal impairment has not been studied. No data are available for hepatic transplant patients \nwith severe chronic renal impairment. \n \nDelayed renal graft function \nIn patients with delayed renal graft function post-transplant, mean MPA AUC0–12h was comparable to \nthat seen in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. Mean plasma MPAG AUC0-12h was \n2 – 3-fold higher than in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. There may be a \ntransient increase in the free fraction and concentration of plasma MPA in patients with delayed renal \ngraft function. Dose adjustment of CellCept does not appear to be necessary. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn volunteers with alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatic MPA glucuronidation processes were relatively \nunaffected by hepatic parenchymal disease. Effects of hepatic disease on this process probably depend \non the particular disease. However, hepatic disease with predominantly biliary damage, such as \nprimary biliary cirrhosis, may show a different effect.  \n \nElderly \nThe pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil and its metabolites have not been found to be altered \nin the elderly patients (≥ 65 years) when compared to younger transplant patients. \n \nPatients taking oral contraceptives \nA study of the co-administration of CellCept (1 g BID) and combined oral contraceptives containing \nethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.15 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) \nor gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) conducted in 18 non-transplant women (not taking other \nimmunosuppressants) over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles showed no clinically relevant influence of \nCellCept on the ovulation suppressing action of the oral contraceptives. Serum levels of LH, FSH and \nprogesterone were not significantly affected. The pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives were \nunaffected by co-administration of CellCept (see also section 4.5). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn experimental models, mycophenolate mofetil was not tumourigenic. The highest dose tested in the \nanimal carcinogenicity studies resulted in approximately 2 – 3 times the systemic exposure (AUC or \nCmax) observed in renal transplant patients at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g/day. \n \nTwo genotoxicity assays (in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and in vivo mouse bone marrow \nmicronucleus test) showed a potential of mycophenolate mofetil to cause chromosomal aberrations. \nThese effects can be related to the pharmacodynamic mode of action, i.e. inhibition of nucleotide \n\n\n\n37 \n\nsynthesis in sensitive cells. Other in vitro tests for detection of gene mutation did not demonstrate \ngenotoxic activity. \n \nMycophenolate mofetil had no effect on fertility of male rats at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day. The \nsystemic exposure at this dose represents 2 – 3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical \ndose of 2 g/day. In a female fertility and reproduction study conducted in rats, oral doses of \n4.5 mg/kg/day caused malformations (including anophthalmia, agnathia, and hydrocephaly) in the first \ngeneration offspring in the absence of maternal toxicity. The systemic exposure at this dose was \napproximately 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g/day. No effects \non fertility or reproductive parameters were evident in the dams or in the subsequent generation.  \n \nIn teratology studies in rats and rabbits, foetal resorptions and malformations occurred in rats at  \n6 mg/kg/day (including anophthalmia, agnathia, and hydrocephaly) and in rabbits at 90 mg/kg/day \n(including cardiovascular and renal anomalies, such as ectopia cordis and ectopic kidneys, and \ndiaphragmatic and umbilical hernia), in the absence of maternal toxicity. The systemic exposure at \nthese levels is approximately equivalent to or less than 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the \nrecommended clinical dose of 2 g/day (see section 4.6). \n \nThe haematopoietic and lymphoid systems were the primary organs affected in toxicology studies \nconducted with mycophenolate mofetil in the rat, mouse, dog and monkey. These effects occurred at \nsystemic exposure levels that are equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended \ndose of 2 g/day. Gastrointestinal effects were observed in the dog at systemic exposure levels \nequivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended dose. Gastrointestinal and renal \neffects consistent with dehydration were also observed in the monkey at the highest dose (systemic \nexposure levels equivalent to or greater than clinical exposure). The nonclinical toxicity profile of \nmycophenolate mofetil appears to be consistent with adverse events observed in human clinical trials, \nwhich now provide safety data of more relevance to the patient population (see section 4.8). \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCellCept 1 g/5 ml powder for oral suspension is indicated in combination with ciclosporin and \ncorticosteroids for the prophylaxis of acute transplant rejection in patients receiving allogeneic renal, \ncardiac or hepatic transplants. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with CellCept should be initiated and maintained by appropriately qualified transplant \nspecialists. \n \nPosology \n \nUse in renal transplant \n \nAdults \nOral CellCept 1 g/5 ml powder for oral suspension should be initiated within 72 hours following \ntransplantation. The recommended dose in renal transplant patients is 1 g administered twice daily (2 g \ndaily dose), i.e. 5 ml oral suspension twice daily. \n \nPaediatric population aged 2 to 18 years \nThe recommended dose of CellCept 1 g/5 ml powder for oral suspension is 600 mg/m2 administered \ntwice daily (up to a maximum of 2 g/10 ml oral suspension daily). As some adverse reactions occur \nwith greater frequency in this age group (see section 4.8) compared with adults, temporary dose \nreduction or interruption may be required; these will need to take into account relevant clinical factors \nincluding severity of reaction. \n \nPaediatric population < 2 years \nThere are limited safety and efficacy data in children below the age of 2 years. These are insufficient \nto make dosage recommendations, and therefore use in this age group is not recommended. \n \n\n\n\n41 \n\nUse in cardiac transplant \n \nAdults \nOral CellCept should be initiated within 5 days following transplantation. The recommended dose in \ncardiac transplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily (3 g daily dose). \n \nPaediatric population \nNo data are available for paediatric cardiac transplant patients. \n \nUse in hepatic transplant \n \nAdults \nIV CellCept should be administered for the first 4 days following hepatic transplant, with oral \nCellCept initiated as soon after this as it can be tolerated. The recommended oral dose in hepatic \ntransplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily (3 g daily dose). \n \nPaediatric population \nNo data are available for paediatric hepatic transplant patients. \n \nUse in special populations \n \nElderly \nThe recommended dose of 1 g administered twice a day for renal transplant patients and 1.5 g twice a \nday for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients is appropriate for the elderly.  \n \nRenal impairment \nIn renal transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n< 25 ml/min/1.73 m2), outside the immediate post-transplant period, doses greater than 1 g \nadministered twice a day should be avoided. These patients should also be carefully observed. No dose \nadjustments are needed in patients experiencing delayed renal graft function post-operatively. (see \nsection 5.2). No data are available for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients with severe chronic renal \nimpairment. \n \nSevere hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustments are needed for renal transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease. \nNo data are available for cardiac transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease. \n \nTreatment during rejection episodes \nMycophenolic acid (MPA) is the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil. Renal transplant \nrejection does not lead to changes in MPA pharmacokinetics; dosage reduction or interruption of \nCellCept is not required. There is no basis for CellCept dose adjustment following cardiac transplant \nrejection. No pharmacokinetic data are available during hepatic transplant rejection.  \n \nPaediatric population \nNo data are available for treatment of first or refractory rejection in paediatric transplant patients. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral administration. \nNote: If required, CellCept 1 g/5 ml powder for oral suspension can be administered via a nasogastric \ntube with a minimum size of 8 French (minimum 1.7 mm interior diameter). \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product. \nBecause mycophenolate mofetil has demonstrated teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits, avoid \ninhalation or direct contact with skin or mucous membranes of the dry powder as well as direct contact \nof the reconstituted suspension with the skin. If such contact occurs, wash thoroughly with soap and \nwater; rinse eyes with plain water. \n \nFor instruction on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• CellCept should not be given to patients with hypersensitivity to mycophenolate mofetil, \n\nmycophenolic acid or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Hypersensitivity reactions to \nCellCept have been observed (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n• CellCept should not be given to women of childbearing potential who are not using highly \n\neffective contraception (see section 4.6).  \n \n• CellCept treatment should not be initiated in women of childbearing potential without providing \n\na pregnancy test result to rule out unintended use in pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \n• CellCept should not be used in pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment to \n\nprevent transplant rejection (see section 4.6). \n \n• CellCept should not be given to women who are breastfeeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nNeoplasms \n \nPatients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, \nincluding CellCept, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, \nparticularly of the skin (see section 4.8). The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of \nimmunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. As general advice to minimise the risk \nfor skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing \nand using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. \n \nInfections \n \nPatients treated with immunosuppressants, including CellCept, are at increased risk for opportunistic \ninfections (bacterial, fungal, viral and protozoal), fatal infections and sepsis (see section 4.8). Such \ninfections include latent viral reactivation, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C reactivation and infections \ncaused by polyomaviruses (BK virus-associated nephropathy, JC virus-associated progressive \nmultifocal leukoencephalopathy PML). Cases of hepatitis due to reactivation of hepatitis B or hepatitis \nC have been reported in carrier patients treated with immunosuppressants. These infections are often \nrelated to a high total immunosuppressive burden and may lead to serious or fatal conditions that \nphysicians should consider in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients with \ndeteriorating renal function or neurological symptoms. \n \nThere have been reports of hypogammaglobulinaemia in association with recurrent infections in \npatients receiving CellCept in combination with other immunosuppressants. In some of these cases \nswitching CellCept to an alternative immunosuppressant resulted in serum IgG levels returning to \nnormal. Patients on CellCept who develop recurrent infections should have their serum \nimmunoglobulins measured. In cases of sustained, clinically relevant hypogammaglobulinaemia, \nappropriate clinical action should be considered taking into account the potent cytostatic effects that \nmycophenolic acid has on T- and B-lymphocytes. \n \n\n\n\n43 \n\nThere have been published reports of bronchiectasis in adults and children who received CellCept in \ncombination with other immunosuppressants. In some of these cases switching CellCept to another \nimmunosuppressant resulted in improvement in respiratory symptoms. The risk of bronchiectasis may \nbe linked to hypogammaglobulinaemia or to a direct effect on the lung. There have also been isolated \nreports of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis, some of which were fatal (see section 4.8). \nIt is recommended that patients who develop persistent pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and \ndyspnoea, are investigated. \n \nBlood and immune system \n \nPatients receiving CellCept should be monitored for neutropenia, which may be related to CellCept \nitself, concomitant medications, viral infections, or some combination of these causes. Patients taking \nCellCept should have complete blood counts weekly during the first month, twice monthly for the \nsecond and third months of treatment, then monthly through the first year. If neutropenia develops \n(absolute neutrophil count < 1.3 x 103/µl), it may be appropriate to interrupt or discontinue CellCept. \n \nCases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with CellCept in \ncombination with other immunosuppressants. The mechanism for mycophenolate mofetil induced \nPRCA is unknown. PRCA may resolve with dose reduction or cessation of CellCept therapy. Changes \nto CellCept therapy should only be undertaken under appropriate supervision in transplant recipients \nin order to minimise the risk of graft rejection (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients receiving CellCept should be instructed to report immediately any evidence of infection, \nunexpected bruising, bleeding or any other manifestation of bone marrow failure. \n \nPatients should be advised, that during treatment with CellCept, vaccinations may be less effective, \nand the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided (see section 4.5). Influenza vaccination may \nbe of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination. \n \nGastro-intestinal \n \nCellCept has been associated with an increased incidence of digestive system adverse events, \nincluding infrequent cases of gastrointestinal tract ulceration, haemorrhage and perforation. CellCept \nshould be administered with caution in patients with active serious digestive system disease. \n \nCellCept is an IMPDH (inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase) inhibitor. Therefore, it should be \navoided in patients with rare hereditary deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-\ntransferase (HGPRT) such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome. \n \nInteractions \n \nCaution should be exercised when switching combination therapy from regimens containing \nimmunosuppressants, which interfere with MPA enterohepatic recirculation, e.g. ciclosporin, to others \ndevoid of this effect, e.g. tacrolimus, sirolimus, belatacept, or vice versa, as this might result in \nchanges of MPA exposure. Drugs which interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle (e.g. \ncholestyramine, antibiotics) should be used with caution due to their potential to reduce plasma levels \nand efficacy of CellCept (see also section 4.5). Therapeutic drug monitoring of MPA may be \nappropriate when switching combination therapy (e.g. from ciclosporin to tacrolimus or vice versa) or \nto ensure adequate immunosuppression in patients with high immunological risk (e.g. risk of rejection, \ntreatment with antibiotics, addition or removal of an interacting medication). \n \nIt is recommended that CellCept should not be administered concomitantly with azathioprine because \nsuch concomitant administration has not been studied. \n \nCellCept 1 g/5 ml powder for oral suspension contains aspartame. Therefore, care should be taken if \nCellCept 1 g/5 ml powder for oral suspension is administered to patients with phenylketonuria (see \nsection 6.1) \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \nThe risk/benefit ratio of mycophenolate mofetil in combination with sirolimus has not been \nestablished (see also section 4.5). \n \nThis medicinal product contains sorbitol. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance \nshould not take this medicine. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients may be at an increased risk of adverse events such as certain infections (including \ncytomegalovirus tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary \noedema, compared with younger individuals (see section 4.8). \n \nTeratogenic effects \n \nMycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen. Spontaneous abortion (rate of 45% to 49%) and \ncongenital malformations (estimated rate of 23% to 27%) have been reported following MMF \nexposure during pregnancy. Therefore, CellCept is contraindicated in pregnancy unless there are no \nsuitable alternative treatments to prevent transplant rejection. Female patients of childbearing potential \nshould be made aware of the risks and follow the recommendations provided in section 4.6 (e.g. \ncontraceptive methods, pregnancy testing) prior to, during, and after therapy with CellCept. Physicians \nshould ensure that women taking mycophenolate understand the risk of harm to the baby, the need for \neffective contraception, and the need to immediately consult their physician if there is a possibility of \npregnancy. \n \nContraception (see section 4.6) \n \nBecause of robust clinical evidence showing a high risk of abortion and congenital malformations \nwhen mycophenolate mofetil is used in pregnancy, every effort to avoid pregnancy during treatment \nshould be taken. Therefore, women with childbearing potential must use at least one form of reliable \ncontraception (see section 4.3) before starting CellCept therapy, during therapy, and for six weeks \nafter stopping the therapy, unless abstinence is the chosen method of contraception. Two \ncomplementary forms of contraception simultaneously are preferred to minimise the potential for \ncontraceptive failure and unintended pregnancy. \n \nFor contraception advice for men see section 4.6. \n \nEducational materials \n \nIn order to assist patients in avoiding foetal exposure to mycophenolate and to provide additional \nimportant safety information, the Marketing Authorisation Holder will provide educational materials \nto healthcare professionals. The educational materials will reinforce the warnings about the \nteratogenicity of mycophenolate, provide advice on contraception before therapy is started and \nguidance on the need for pregnancy testing. Full patient information about the teratogenic risk and the \npregnancy prevention measures should be given by the physician to women of childbearing potential \nand, as appropriate, to male patients.  \n \nAdditional precautions \nPatients should not donate blood during therapy or for at least 6 weeks following discontinuation of \nmycophenolate. Men should not donate semen during therapy or for 90 days following discontinuation \nof mycophenolate. \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAciclovir  \nHigher aciclovir plasma concentrations were observed when mycophenolate mofetil was administered \nwith aciclovir in comparison to the administration of aciclovir alone. The changes in MPAG (the \nphenolic glucuronide of MPA) pharmacokinetics (MPAG increased by 8%) were minimal and are not \nconsidered clinically significant. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence \nof renal impairment, as are aciclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate mofetil and \naciclovir, or its prodrugs, e.g. valaciclovir, to compete for tubular secretion and further increases in \nconcentrations of both substances may occur. \n \nAntacids and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) \nDecreased MPA exposure has been observed when antacids, such as magnesium and aluminium \nhydroxides, and PPIs, including lansoprazole and pantoprazole, were administered with CellCept. \nWhen comparing rates of transplant rejection or rates of graft loss between CellCept patients taking \nPPIs vs. CellCept patients not taking PPIs, no significant differences were seen. These data support \nextrapolation of this finding to all antacids because the reduction in exposure when CellCept was co- \nadministered with magnesium and aluminium hydroxides is considerably less than when CellCept was \nco-administered with PPIs. \n \nMedicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation (e.g. cholestyramine, ciclosporin A,  \nantibiotics) \nCaution should be used with medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation because \nof their potential to reduce the efficacy of CellCept. \n \nCholestyramine \nFollowing single dose administration of 1.5 g of mycophenolate mofetil to normal healthy subjects \npre-treated with 4 g TID of cholestyramine for 4 days, there was a 40% reduction in the AUC of MPA. \n(see section 4.4, and section 5.2). Caution should be used during concomitant administration because \nof the potential to reduce efficacy of CellCept. \n \nCiclosporin A \nCiclosporin A (CsA) pharmacokinetics are unaffected by mycophenolate mofetil. \nIn contrast, if concomitant CsA treatment is stopped, an increase in MPA AUC of around 30% should \nbe expected. CsA interferes with MPA enterohepatic recycling, resulting in reduced MPA exposures \nby 30 - 50% in renal transplant patients treated with CellCept and CsA compared with patients \nreceiving sirolimus or belatacept and similar doses of CellCept (see also section 4.4). Conversely, \nchanges of MPA exposure should be expected when switching patients from CsA to one of the \nimmunosuppressants which does not interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle. \n \nAntibiotics eliminating β-glucuronidase-producing bacteria in the intestine (e.g. aminoglycoside, \ncephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, and penicillin classes of antibiotics) may interfere with MPAG/MPA \nenterohepatic recirculation, thus leading to reduced systemic MPA exposure. Information concerning \nthe following antibiotics is available: \n \nCiprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid \nReductions in pre-dose (trough) MPA concentrations of about 50% have been reported in renal \ntransplant recipients in the days immediately following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or \namoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. This effect tended to diminish with continued antibiotic use and to \ncease within a few days of antibiotic discontinuation. The change in pre-dose level may not accurately \nrepresent changes in overall MPA exposure. Therefore, a change in the dose of CellCept should not \nnormally be necessary in the absence of clinical evidence of graft dysfunction. However, close clinical \nmonitoring should be performed during the combination and shortly after antibiotic treatment. \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nNorfloxacin and metronidazole \nIn healthy volunteers, no significant interaction was observed when CellCept was concomitantly \nadministered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. However, norfloxacin and metronidazole \ncombined reduced the MPA exposure by approximately 30% following a single dose of CellCept. \n \nTrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole \nNo effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed.  \n \nMedicinal products that affect glucuronidation (e.g. isavuconazole, telmisartan) \nConcomitant administration of drugs affecting glucuronidation of MPA may change MPA exposure. \nCaution is therefore recommended when administering these drugs concomitantly with CellCept.  \nIsavuconazole \nAn increase of MPA AUC0-∞ by 35% was observed with concomitant administration of \nisavuconazole. \n \nTelmisartan \nConcomitant administration of telmisartan and CellCept resulted in an approximately 30% decrease of \nMPA concentrations. Telmisartan changes MPA’s elimination by enhancing PPAR gamma \n(peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) expression, which in turn results in an enhanced \nUGT1A9 expression and activity. When comparing rates of transplant rejection, rates of graft loss or \nadverse event profiles between CellCept patients with and without concomitant telmisartan \nmedication, no clinical consequences of the pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction were seen. \n \nGanciclovir \nBased on the results of a single dose administration study of recommended doses of oral \nmycophenolate and IV ganciclovir and the known effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics \nof CellCept (see section 4.2) and ganciclovir, it is anticipated that co-administration of these agents \n(which compete for mechanisms of renal tubular secretion) will result in increases in MPAG and \nganciclovir concentration. No substantial alteration of MPA pharmacokinetics is anticipated and \nCellCept dose adjustment is not required. In patients with renal impairment in whom CellCept and \nganciclovir or its prodrugs, e.g. valganciclovir, are co-administered, the dose recommendations for \nganciclovir should be observed and patients should be monitored carefully. \n \nOral contraceptives \nThe pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral contraceptives were unaffected by co-\nadministration of CellCept (see also section 5.2). \n \nRifampicin \nIn patients not also taking ciclosporin, concomitant administration of CellCept and rifampicin resulted \nin a decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) of 18% to 70%. It is recommended to monitor MPA \nexposure levels and to adjust CellCept doses accordingly to maintain clinical efficacy when rifampicin \nis administered concomitantly. \n \nSevelamer \nDecrease in MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 30% and 25%, respectively, were observed when CellCept \nwas concomitantly administered with sevelamer without any clinical consequences (i.e. graft \nrejection). It is recommended, however, to administer CellCept at least one hour before or three hours \nafter sevelamer intake to minimise the impact on the absorption of MPA. There are no data on \nCellCept with phosphate binders other than sevelamer. \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nTacrolimus \nIn hepatic transplant patients initiated on CellCept and tacrolimus, the AUC and Cmax of MPA, the \nactive metabolite of CellCept, were not significantly affected by co-administration with tacrolimus. In \ncontrast, there was an increase of approximately 20% in tacrolimus AUC when multiple doses of \nCellCept (1.5 g BID) were administered to hepatic transplant patients taking tacrolimus. However, in \nrenal transplant patients, tacrolimus concentration did not appear to be altered by CellCept (see also \nsection 4.4). \n \nLive vaccines \nLive vaccines should not be given to patients with an impaired immune response. The antibody \nresponse to other vaccines may be diminished (see also section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nPotential interaction \nCo-administration of probenecid with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys raises plasma AUC of \nMPAG by 3-fold. Thus, other substances known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with \nMPAG, and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other substance undergoing tubular \nsecretion. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nPregnancy whilst taking mycophenolate must be avoided. Therefore, women of childbearing potential \nmust use at least one form of reliable contraception (see section 4.3) before starting CellCept therapy, \nduring therapy, and for six weeks after stopping the therapy, unless abstinence is the chosen method of \ncontraception. Two complementary forms of contraception simultaneously are preferred. \n \nPregnancy \n \nCellCept is contraindicated during pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment to \nprevent transplant rejection. Treatment should not be initiated without providing a negative pregnancy \ntest result to rule out unintended use in pregnancy. \n \nFemale patients of reproductive potential must be made aware of the increased risk of pregnancy loss \nand congenital malformations at the beginning of the treatment and must be counselled regarding \npregnancy prevention and planning.  \n \nBefore starting CellCept treatment, women of childbearing potential should have two negative serum \nor urine pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/ml in order to exclude unintended \nexposure of the embryo to mycophenolate. It is recommended that the second test should be performed \n8 - 10 days after the first test. For transplants from deceased donors, if it is not possible to perform two \ntests 8 - 10 days apart before treatment starts (because of the timing of transplant organ availability), a \npregnancy test must be performed immediately before starting treatment and a further test performed 8 \n- 10 days later. Pregnancy tests should be repeated as clinically required (e.g. after any gap in \ncontraception is reported). Results of all pregnancy tests should be discussed with the patient. Patients \nshould be instructed to consult their physician immediately should pregnancy occur.  \n \nMycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen, with an increased risk of spontaneous abortions and \ncongenital malformations in case of exposure during pregnancy; \n• Spontaneous abortions have been reported in 45 to 49% of pregnant women exposed to \n\nmycophenolate mofetil, compared to a reported rate of between 12 and 33% in solid organ \ntransplant patients treated with immunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil. \n\n\n\n48 \n\n• Based on literature reports, malformations occurred in 23 to 27% of live births in women \nexposed to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (compared to 2 to 3 % of live births in the \noverall population and approximately 4 to 5% of live births in solid organ transplant recipients \ntreated with immunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil). \n\n \nCongenital malformations, including reports of multiple malformations, have been observed post-\nmarketing in children of patients exposed to CellCept during pregnancy in combination with other \nimmunosuppressants. The following malformations were most frequently reported:  \n \n• Abnormalities of the ear (e.g. abnormally formed or absent external ear), external auditory canal \n\natresia (middle ear); \n• Facial malformations such as cleft lip, cleft palate, micrognathia and hypertelorism of the orbits; \n• Abnormalities of the eye (e.g. coloboma); \n• Congenital heart disease such as atrial and ventricular septal defects; \n• Malformations of the fingers (e.g. polydactyly, syndactyly); \n• Tracheo-oesophageal malformations (e.g. oesophageal atresia);  \n• Nervous system malformations such as spina bifida;  \n• Renal abnormalities. \n \nIn addition, there have been isolated reports of the following malformations: \n• Microphthalmia; \n• Congenital choroid plexus cyst; \n• Septum pellucidum agenesis; \n• Olfactory nerve agenesis. \n \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nMycophenolate mofetil has been shown to be excreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known \nwhether this substance is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse \nreactions to mycophenolate mofetil in breast-fed infants, CellCept is contraindicated in nursing \nmothers (see section 4.3). \n \nMen \n \nLimited clinical evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage \nfollowing paternal exposure to mycophenolate mofetil.  \n \nMPA is a powerful teratogen. It is not known if MPA is present in semen. Calculations based on \nanimal data show that the maximum amount of MPA that could potentially be transferred to woman is \nso low that it would be unlikely to have an effect. Mycophenolate has been shown to be genotoxic in \nanimal studies at concentrations exceeding the human therapeutic exposures only by small margins \nsuch that the risk of genotoxic effects on sperm cells cannot completely be excluded. \n \nTherefore, the following precautionary measures are recommended: sexually active male patients or \ntheir female partners are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment of the male \npatient and for at least 90 days after cessation of mycophenolate mofetil. Male patients of reproductive \npotential should be made aware of and discuss with a qualified healthcare professional the potential \nrisks of fathering a child. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCellCept has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \nCellCept may cause somnolence, confusion, dizziness, tremor or hypotension, and therefore patients \nare advised to use caution when driving or using machines. \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \nAn estimated total of 1557 patients received CellCept during five clinical trials in the prevention of \nacute organ rejection. Of these, 991 were included in the three renal studies, 277 were included in one \nhepatic study, and 289 were included in one cardiac study. Azathioprine was the comparator used in \nthe hepatic and cardiac studies and in two of the renal studies whilst the other renal study was placebo-\ncontrolled. Patients in all study arms also received cyclosporine and corticosteroids. The types of \nadverse reactions reported during post-marketing with CellCept are similar to those seen in the \ncontrolled renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant studies. \n \nDiarrhoea, leukopenia, sepsis and vomiting were among the most common and/or serious adverse drug \nreactions associated with the administration of CellCept in combination with ciclosporin and \ncorticosteroids. There is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from clinical trials and post-marketing experience are listed in \nTable 1, by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) along with their frequencies. The corresponding \nfrequency category for each adverse drug reaction is based on the following convention: very common \n(≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nand very rare (<1/10,000). Due to the large differences observed in the frequency of certain ADRs \nacross the different transplant indications, the frequency is presented separately for renal, hepatic and \ncardiac transplant patients.  \n \nTable 1 Summary of adverse drug reactions occurring in patients treated with CellCept reported \nfrom clinical trials and post-marketing experience \n \n\nAdverse drug reaction \n

daily) patients were treated \nin Phase III studies for the prevention of rejection in renal, cardiac and hepatic transplantation, respectively. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nMalignancies \nPatients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, \nincluding CellCept, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, \nparticularly of the skin (see section 4.4). Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients \ndid not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. \nHepatic transplant patients were followed for at least 1 year, but less than 3 years.  \n \nInfections \nAll patients treated with immunosuppressants are at increased risk of bacterial, viral and fungal \ninfections (some of which may lead to a fatal outcome), including those caused by opportunistic \nagents and latent viral reactivation. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see section \n4.4). The most serious infections were sepsis, peritonitis, meningitis, endocarditis, tuberculosis and \n\n\n\n53 \n\natypical mycobacterial infection. The most common opportunistic infections in patients receiving \nCellCept (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressants in controlled clinical trials in renal, cardiac \nand hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year were candida mucocutaneous, CMV \nviraemia/syndrome and Herpes simplex. The proportion of patients with CMV viraemia/syndrome was \n13.5%. Cases of BK virus associated nephropathy, as well as cases of JC virus associated progressive \nmultifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), have been reported in patients treated with \nimmunosuppressants, including CellCept. \n \nBlood and lymphatic disorders  \nCytopenias, including leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia, are known risks \nassociated with mycophenolate mofetil and may lead or contribute to the occurrence of infections and \nhemorrhages (see section 4.4). Agranulocytosis and neutropenia have been reported; therefore, regular \nmonitoring of patients taking CellCept is advised (see section 4.4). There have been reports of aplastic \nanaemia and bone marrow failure in patients treated with CellCept, some of which have been fatal.  \nCases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with CellCept (see \nsection 4.4). \nIsolated cases of abnormal neutrophil morphology, including the acquired Pelger-Huet anomaly, have \nbeen observed in patients treated with CellCept. These changes are not associated with impaired \nneutrophil function. These changes may suggest a ‘left shift’ in the maturity of neutrophils in \nhaematological investigations, which may be mistakenly interpreted as a sign of infection in \nimmunosuppressed patients such as those that receive CellCept. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nThe most serious gastrointestinal disorders were ulceration and hemorrhage which are known risks \nassociated with mycophenolate mofetil. Mouth, esophageal, gastric, duodenal, and intestinal ulcers \noften complicated by hemorrhage, as well as hematemesis, melena, and hemorrhagic forms of gastritis \nand colitis were commonly reported during the pivotal clinical trials. The most common \ngastrointestinal disorders, however, were diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Endoscopic investigation of \npatients with CellCept-related diarrhea have revealed isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nHypersensitivity \nHypersensitivity reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylactic reaction have been \nreported.  \n \nPregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions \nCases of spontaneous abortion have been reported in patients exposed to mycophenolate mofetil, \nmainly in the first trimester, see section 4.6. \n \nCongenital disorders \nCongenital malformations have been observed post-marketing in children of patients exposed to \nCellCept in combination with other immunosuppressants, see section 4.6. \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nThere have been isolated reports of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis in patients treated \nwith CellCept in combination with other immunosuppressants, some of which have been fatal. There \nhave also been reports of bronchiectasis in children and adults. \n \nImmune system disorders \nHypogammaglobulinaemia has been reported in patients receiving CellCept in combination with other \nimmunosuppressants. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nEdema, including peripheral, face and scrotal edema, was reported very commonly during the pivotal \ntrials. Musculoskeletal pain such as myalgia, and neck and back pain were also very commonly \nreported. \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \nThe type and frequency of adverse reactions in a clinical study, which recruited 92 paediatric patients \naged 2 to 18 years who were given 600 mg/m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily, were \ngenerally similar to those observed in adult patients given 1 g CellCept twice daily. However, the \nfollowing treatment-related adverse events were more frequent in the paediatric population, \nparticularly in children under 6 years of age, when compared to adults: diarrhoea, sepsis, leukopenia, \nanaemia and infection.  \n \nElderly  \nElderly patients (≥ 65 years) may generally be at increased risk of adverse reactions due to \nimmunosuppression. Elderly patients receiving CellCept as part of a combination immunosuppressive \nregimen may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus tissue invasive \ndisease) and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary oedema, compared to younger \nindividuals.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nReports of overdoses with mycophenolate mofetil have been received from clinical trials and during \npost-marketing experience. In many of these cases, no adverse events were reported. In those overdose \ncases in which adverse events were reported, the events fall within the known safety profile of the \nmedicinal product. \n \nIt is expected that an overdose of mycophenolate mofetil could possibly result in oversuppression of \nthe immune system and increase susceptibility to infections and bone marrow suppression (see section \n4.4). If neutropenia develops, dosing with CellCept should be interrupted or the dose reduced (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nHaemodialysis would not be expected to remove clinically significant amounts of MPA or MPAG. \nBile acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine, can remove MPA by decreasing the enterohepatic \nrecirculation of the drug (see section 5.2). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: immunosuppressive agents ATC code L04AA06 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nMycophenolate mofetil is the 2-morpholinoethyl ester of MPA. MPA is a potent, selective, \nuncompetitive and reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, and therefore \ninhibits the de novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into DNA. \nBecause T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for their proliferation on de novo synthesis of \npurines whereas other cell types can utilise salvage pathways, MPA has more potent cytostatic effects \non lymphocytes than on other cells.  \n \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n55 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing oral administration, mycophenolate mofetil undergoes rapid and extensive absorption and \ncomplete presystemic metabolism to the active metabolite, MPA. As evidenced by suppression of \nacute rejection following renal transplantation, the immunosuppressant activity of CellCept is \ncorrelated with MPA concentration. The mean bioavailability of oral mycophenolate mofetil, based on \nMPA AUC, is 94% relative to IV mycophenolate mofetil. Food had no effect on the extent of \nabsorption (MPA AUC) of mycophenolate mofetil when administered at doses of 1.5 g BID to renal \ntransplant patients. However, MPA Cmax was decreased by 40% in the presence of food. \nMycophenolate mofetil is not measurable systemically in plasma following oral administration.  \n \nDistribution \n \nAs a result of enterohepatic recirculation, secondary increases in plasma MPA concentration are \nusually observed at approximately 6 – 12 hours post-dose. A reduction in the AUC of MPA of \napproximately 40% is associated with the co-administration of cholestyramine (4 g TID), indicating \nthat there is a significant amount of enterohepatic recirculation. \nMPA at clinically relevant concentrations is 97% bound to plasma albumin. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nMPA is metabolised principally by glucuronyl transferase (isoform UGT1A9) to form the inactive \nphenolic glucuronide of MPA (MPAG). In vivo, MPAG is converted back to free MPA via \nenterohepatic recirculation. A minor acylglucuronide (AcMPAG) is also formed. AcMPAG is \npharmacologically active and is suspected to be responsible for some of MMF’´s side effects \n(diarrhoea, leukopenia). \n \nElimination \n \nA negligible amount of substance is excreted as MPA (< 1% of the dose) in the urine. Oral \nadministration of radiolabelled mycophenolate mofetil results in complete recovery of the \nadministered dose, with 93% of the administered dose recovered in the urine and 6% recovered in the \nfaeces. Most (about 87%) of the administered dose is excreted in the urine as MPAG. \n \nAt clinically encountered concentrations, MPA and MPAG are not removed by haemodialysis. \nHowever, at high MPAG plasma concentrations (> 100 µg/ml), small amounts of MPAG are removed. \nBy interfering with enterohepatic recirculation of the drug, bile acid sequestrants such as \ncholestyramine, reduce MPA AUC (see section 4.9). \nMPA’s disposition depends on several transporters. Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) \nand multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) are involved in MPA’s disposition; OATP \nisoforms, MRP2 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) are transporters associated with the \nglucuronides’ biliary excretion. Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) is also able to transport MPA, \nbut its contribution seems to be confined to the absorption process. In the kidney, MPA and its \nmetabolites potently interact with renal organic anion transporters. \n \nIn the early post-transplant period (< 40 days post-transplant), renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant \npatients had mean MPA AUCs approximately 30% lower and Cmax approximately 40% lower \ncompared to the late post-transplant period (3 – 6 months post-transplant). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nIn a single dose study (6 subjects/group), mean plasma MPA AUC observed in subjects with severe \nchronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate < 25 ml/min/1.73 m2) were 28 – 75% higher \nrelative to the means observed in normal healthy subjects or subjects with lesser degrees of renal \n\n\n\n56 \n\nimpairment. The mean single dose MPAG AUC was 3 – 6-fold higher in subjects with severe renal \nimpairment than in subjects with mild renal impairment or normal healthy subjects, consistent with the \nknown renal elimination of MPAG. Multiple dosing of mycophenolate mofetil in patients with severe \nchronic renal impairment has not been studied. No data are available for cardiac or hepatic transplant \npatients with severe chronic renal impairment. \n \nDelayed renal graft function \nIn patients with delayed renal graft function post-transplant, mean MPA AUC0-12h was comparable to \nthat seen in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. Mean plasma MPAG AUC0-12h was \n2 – 3-fold higher than in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. There may be a \ntransient increase in the free fraction and concentration of plasma MPA in patients with delayed renal \ngraft function. Dose adjustment of CellCept does not appear to be necessary. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn volunteers with alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatic MPA glucuronidation processes were relatively \nunaffected by hepatic parenchymal disease. Effects of hepatic disease on this process probably depend \non the particular disease. However, hepatic disease with predominantly biliary damage, such as \nprimary biliary cirrhosis, may show a different effect. \n \nPaediatric population \nPharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in 49 paediatric renal transplant patients (aged 2 to 18 \nyears) given 600 mg/m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily. This dose achieved MPA AUC \nvalues similar to those seen in adult renal transplant patients receiving CellCept at a dose of 1 g BID in \nthe early and late post-transplant period. MPA AUC values across age groups were similar in the early \nand late post-transplant period. \n \nElderly  \nThe pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil and its metabolites have not been found to be altered \nin the elderly patients (≥ 65 years) when compared to younger patients. \n \nPatients taking oral contraceptives \nA study of the co-administration of CellCept (1 g BID) and combined oral contraceptives containing \nethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.15 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) \nor gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) conducted in 18 non-transplant women (not taking other \nimmunosuppressants) over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles showed no clinically relevant influence of \nCellCept on the ovulation suppressing action of the oral contraceptives. Serum levels of LH, FSH and \nprogesterone were not significantly affected. The pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives were \nunaffected by co-administration of CellCept (see also section 4.5). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn experimental models, mycophenolate mofetil was not tumourigenic. The highest dose tested in the \nanimal carcinogenicity studies resulted in approximately 2 – 3 times the systemic exposure (AUC or \nCmax) observed in renal transplant patients at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g/day and 1.3 – 2 \ntimes the systemic exposure (AUC or Cmax) observed in cardiac transplant patients at the recommended \nclinical dose of 3 g/day. \n \nTwo genotoxicity assays (in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and in vivo mouse bone marrow \nmicronucleus test) showed a potential of mycophenolate mofetil to cause chromosomal aberrations. \nThese effects can be related to the pharmacodynamic mode of action, i.e. inhibition of nucleotide \nsynthesis in sensitive cells. Other in vitro tests for detection of gene mutation did not demonstrate \ngenotoxic activity. \n \nMycophenolate mofetil had no effect on fertility of male rats at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day. The \nsystemic exposure at this dose represents 2 – 3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical \ndose of 2 g/day in renal transplant patients and 1.3 – 2 times the clinical exposure at the recommended \nclinical dose of 3 g/day in cardiac transplant patients. In a female fertility and reproduction study \n\n\n\n57 \n\nconducted in rats, oral doses of 4.5 mg/kg/day caused malformations (including anophthalmia, \nagnathia, and hydrocephaly) in the first generation offspring in the absence of maternal toxicity. The \nsystemic exposure at this dose was approximately 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the recommended \nclinical dose of 2 g/day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the clinical exposure \nat the recommended clinical dose of 3 g/day for cardiac transplant patients. No effects on fertility or \nreproductive parameters were evident in the dams or in the subsequent generation. \n \nIn teratology studies in rats and rabbits, foetal resorptions and malformations occurred in rats at \n6 mg/kg/day (including anophthalmia, agnathia, and hydrocephaly) and in rabbits at 90 mg/kg/day \n(including cardiovascular and renal anomalies, such as ectopia cordis and ectopic kidneys, and \ndiaphragmatic and umbilical hernia), in the absence of maternal toxicity. The systemic exposure at \nthese levels is approximately equivalent to or less than 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the \nrecommended clinical dose of 2 g/day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the \nclinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g/day for cardiac transplant patients (see \nsection 4.6). \n \nThe haematopoietic and lymphoid systems were the primary organs affected in toxicology studies \nconducted with mycophenolate mofetil in the rat, mouse, dog and monkey. These effects occurred at \nsystemic exposure levels that are equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended \ndose of 2 g/day for renal transplant recipients. Gastrointestinal effects were observed in the dog at \nsystemic exposure levels equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended dose. \nGastrointestinal and renal effects consistent with dehydration were also observed in the monkey at the \nhighest dose (systemic exposure levels equivalent to or greater than clinical exposure). The nonclinical \ntoxicity profile of mycophenolate mofetil appears to be consistent with adverse events observed in \nhuman clinical trials, which now provide safety data of more relevance to the patient population (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n \n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 500 mg mycophenolate mofetil. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect \n \nSodium less than 1 mmol (23 mg) per dose \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablets (tablets). \n \nCellCept tablets: lavender-coloured caplet-shaped tablet, engraved with \"CellCept 500\" on one side \nand \"ROCHE\" on the other.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCellCept is indicated in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids for the prophylaxis of acute \ntransplant rejection in patients receiving allogeneic renal, cardiac or hepatic transplants. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with CellCept should be initiated and maintained by appropriately qualified transplant \nspecialists. \n \nPosology \n \nUse in renal transplant \n \nAdults \nOral CellCept should be initiated within 72 hours following transplantation. The recommended dose in \nrenal transplant patients is 1 g administered twice daily (2 g daily dose). \n \nPaediatric population aged 2 to 18 years \nThe recommended dose of mycophenolate mofetil is 600 mg/m2 administered orally twice daily (up to \na maximum of 2 g daily). CellCept tablets should only be prescribed to patients with a body surface \narea greater than 1.5 m2, at a dose of 1 g twice daily (2 g daily dose). As some adverse reactions occur \nwith greater frequency in this age group (see section 4.8) compared with adults, temporary dose \nreduction or interruption may be required; these will need to take into account relevant clinical factors \nincluding severity of reaction. \n \nPaediatric population < 2 years \nThere are limited safety and efficacy data in children below the age of 2 years. These are insufficient \nto make dosage recommendations and therefore use in this age group is not recommended. \n \n\n\n\n60 \n\nUse in cardiac transplant  \n \nAdults \nOral CellCept should be initiated within 5 days following transplantation. The recommended dose in \ncardiac transplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily (3 g daily dose).  \n \nPaediatric population \nNo data are available for paediatric cardiac transplant patients. \n \nUse in hepatic transplant \n \nAdults \nIV CellCept should be administered for the first 4 days following hepatic transplant, with oral \nCellCept initiated as soon after this as it can be tolerated. The recommended oral dose in hepatic \ntransplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily (3 g daily dose). \n \nPaediatric population  \nNo data are available for paediatric hepatic transplant patients. \n \nUse in special populations \n \nElderly  \nThe recommended dose of 1 g administered twice a day for renal transplant patients and 1.5 g twice a \nday for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients is appropriate for the elderly. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn renal transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \n< 25 ml/min/1.73 m2), outside the immediate post-transplant period, doses greater than 1 g \nadministered twice a day should be avoided. These patients should also be carefully observed. No dose \nadjustments are needed in patients experiencing delayed renal graft function post-operatively (see \nsection 5.2). No data are available for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients with severe chronic renal \nimpairment. \n \nSevere hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustments are needed for renal transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease. \nNo data are available for cardiac transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease. \n \nTreatment during rejection episodes \nMycophenolic acid (MPA) is the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil. Renal transplant \nrejection does not lead to changes in MPA pharmacokinetics; dosage reduction or interruption of \nCellCept is not required. There is no basis for CellCept dose adjustment following cardiac transplant \nrejection. No pharmacokinetic data are available during hepatic transplant rejection. \n \nPaediatric population \nNo data are available for treatment of first or refractory rejection in paediatric transplant patients. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral administration. \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product. \nBecause mycophenolate mofetil has demonstrated teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits, CellCept \ntablets should not be crushed. \n \n\n\n\n61 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• CellCept should not be given to patients with hypersensitivity to mycophenolate mofetil, \n\nmycophenolic acid or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Hypersensitivity reactions to \nCellCept have been observed (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n• CellCept should not be given to women of childbearing potential who are not using highly \n\neffective contraception (see section 4.6).  \n \n\n• CellCept treatment should not be initiated in women of childbearing potential without providing \na pregnancy test result to rule out unintended use in pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\n \n• CellCept should not be used during pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment to \n\nprevent transplant rejection (see section 4.6). \n \n\n• CellCept should not be given to women who are breastfeeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nNeoplasms \n \nPatients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, \nincluding CellCept, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, \nparticularly of the skin (see section 4.8). The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of \nimmunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. As general advice to minimise the risk \nfor skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing \nand using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. \n \nInfections \n \nPatients treated with immunosuppressants, including CellCept, are at increased risk for opportunistic \ninfections (bacterial, fungal, viral and protozoal), fatal infections and sepsis (see section 4.8). Such \ninfections include latent viral reactivation, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C reactivation and infections \ncaused by polyomaviruses (BK virus-associated nephropathy, JC virus-associated progressive \nmultifocal leukoencephalopathy PML). Cases of hepatitis due to reactivation of hepatitis B or hepatitis \nC have been reported in carrier patients treated with immunosuppressants. These infections are often \nrelated to a high total immunosuppressive burden and may lead to serious or fatal conditions that \nphysicians should consider in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients with \ndeteriorating renal function or neurological symptoms. \n \nThere have been reports of hypogammaglobulinaemia in association with recurrent infections in \npatients receiving CellCept in combination with other immunosuppressants. In some of these cases \nswitching CellCept to an alternative immunosuppressant resulted in serum IgG levels returning to \nnormal. Patients on CellCept who develop recurrent infections should have their serum \nimmunoglobulins measured. In cases of sustained, clinically relevant hypogammaglobulinaemia, \nappropriate clinical action should be considered taking into account the potent cytostatic effects that \nmycophenolic acid has on T- and B-lymphocytes. \n \nThere have been published reports of bronchiectasis in adults and children who received CellCept in \ncombination with other immunosuppressants. In some of these cases switching CellCept to another \nimmunosuppressant resulted in improvement in respiratory symptoms. The risk of bronchiectasis may \nbe linked to hypogammaglobulinaemia or to a direct effect on the lung. There have also been isolated \nreports of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis, some of which were fatal (see section 4.8). \nIt is recommended that patients who develop persistent pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and \ndyspnoea, are investigated. \n \n\n\n\n62 \n\nBlood and immune system \n \nPatients receiving CellCept should be monitored for neutropenia, which may be related to CellCept \nitself, concomitant medications, viral infections, or some combination of these causes. Patients taking \nCellCept should have complete blood counts weekly during the first month, twice monthly for the \nsecond and third months of treatment, then monthly through the first year. If neutropenia develops \n(absolute neutrophil count < 1.3 x 103/µl), it may be appropriate to interrupt or discontinue CellCept. \n \nCases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with CellCept in \ncombination with other immunosuppressants. The mechanism for mycophenolate mofetil induced \nPRCA is unknown. PRCA may resolve with dose reduction or cessation of CellCept therapy. Changes \nto CellCept therapy should only be undertaken under appropriate supervision in transplant recipients \nin order to minimise the risk of graft rejection (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients receiving CellCept should be instructed to report immediately any evidence of infection, \nunexpected bruising, bleeding or any other manifestation of bone marrow failure. \n \nPatients should be advised that, during treatment with CellCept, vaccinations may be less effective, \nand the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided (see section 4.5). Influenza vaccination may \nbe of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination. \n \nGastro-intestinal \n \nCellCept has been associated with an increased incidence of digestive system adverse events, \nincluding infrequent cases of gastrointestinal tract ulceration, haemorrhage and perforation. CellCept \nshould be administered with caution in patients with active serious digestive system disease.  \n \nCellCept is an IMPDH (inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase) inhibitor. Therefore, it should be \navoided in patients with rare hereditary deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-\ntransferase (HGPRT) such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome. \n \nInteractions \n \nCaution should be exercised when switching combination therapy from regimens containing \nimmunosuppressants, which interfere with MPA enterohepatic recirculation, e.g. ciclosporin, to others \ndevoid of this effect, e.g. tacrolimus, sirolimus, belatacept, or vice versa, as this might result in \nchanges of MPA exposure. Drugs which interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle (e.g. \ncholestyramine, antibiotics) should be used with caution due to their potential to reduce the plasma \nlevel and efficacy of CellCept (see also section 4.5). Therapeutic drug monitoring of MPA may be \nappropriate when switching combination therapy (e.g. from ciclosporin to tacrolimus or vice versa) or \nto ensure adequate immunosuppression in patients with high immunological risk (e.g. risk of rejection, \ntreatment with antibiotics, addition or removal of an interacting medication). \n \nIt is recommended that CellCept should not be administered concomitantly with azathioprine because \nsuch concomitant administration has not been studied. \n \nThe risk/benefit ratio of mycophenolate mofetil in combination with sirolimus has not been \nestablished (see also section 4.5). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients may be at an increased risk of adverse events such as certain infections (including \ncytomegalovirus tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary \noedema, compared with younger individuals (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n63 \n\nTeratogenic effects \n \nMycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen. Spontaneous abortion (rate of 45% to 49%) and \ncongenital malformations (estimated rate of 23% to 27%) have been reported following MMF \nexposure during pregnancy. Therefore, CellCept is contraindicated in pregnancy unless there are no \nsuitable alternative treatments to prevent transplant rejection. Female patients of childbearing potential \nshould be made aware of the risks and follow the recommendations provided in section 4.6 (e.g. \ncontraceptive methods, pregnancy testing) prior to, during, and after therapy with CellCept. Physicians \nshould ensure that women taking mycophenolate understand the risk of harm to the baby, the need for \neffective contraception, and the need to immediately consult their physician if there is a possibility of \npregnancy. \n \nContraception (see section 4.6) \n \nBecause of robust clinical evidence showing a high risk of abortion and congenital malformations \nwhen mycophenolate mofetil is used in pregnancy, every effort to avoid pregnancy during treatment \nshould be taken. Therefore, women with childbearing potential must use at least one form of reliable \ncontraception (see section 4.3) before starting CellCept therapy, during therapy, and for six weeks \nafter stopping the therapy, unless abstinence is the chosen method of contraception. Two \ncomplementary forms of contraception simultaneously are preferred to minimise the potential for \ncontraceptive failure and unintended pregnancy. \n \nFor contraception advice for men see section 4.6. \n \nEducational materials \n \nIn order to assist patients in avoiding foetal exposure to mycophenolate and to provide additional \nimportant safety information, the Marketing Authorisation Holder will provide educational materials \nto healthcare professionals. The educational materials will reinforce the warnings about the \nteratogenicity of mycophenolate, provide advice on contraception before therapy is started and \nguidance on the need for pregnancy testing. Full patient information about the teratogenic risk and the \npregnancy prevention measures should be given by the physician to women of childbearing potential \nand, as appropriate, to male patients.  \n \nAdditional precautions \nPatients should not donate blood during therapy or for at least 6 weeks following discontinuation of \nmycophenolate. Men should not donate semen during therapy or for 90 days following discontinuation \nof mycophenolate. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAciclovir \nHigher aciclovir plasma concentrations were observed when mycophenolate mofetil was administered \nwith aciclovir in comparison to the administration of aciclovir alone. The changes in MPAG (the \nphenolic glucuronide of MPA) pharmacokinetics (MPAG increased by 8%) were minimal and are not \nconsidered clinically significant. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence \nof renal impairment, as are aciclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate mofetil and \naciclovir, or its prodrugs, e.g. valaciclovir, to compete for tubular secretion and further increases in \nconcentrations of both substances may occur. \n \nAntacids and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) \nDecreased MPA exposure has been observed when antacids, such as magnesium and aluminium \nhydroxides, and PPIs, including lansoprazole and pantoprazole, were administered with CellCept. \nWhen comparing rates of transplant rejection or rates of graft loss between CellCept patients taking \nPPIs vs. CellCept patients not taking PPIs, no significant differences were seen. These data support \nextrapolation of this finding to all antacids because the reduction in exposure when CellCept was co- \n\n\n\n64 \n\nadministered with magnesium and aluminium hydroxides is considerably less than when CellCept was \nco-administered with PPIs. \n \nMedicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation (e.g. cholestyramine, ciclosporin A,  \nantibiotics) \nCaution should be used with medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation because \nof their potential to reduce the efficacy of CellCept. \n \nCholestyramine \nFollowing single dose administration of 1.5 g of mycophenolate mofetil to normal healthy subjects \npre-treated with 4 g TID of cholestyramine for 4 days, there was a 40% reduction in the AUC of MPA \n(see section 4.4 and section 5.2). Caution should be used during concomitant administration because \nof the potential to reduce efficacy of CellCept. \n \nCiclosporin A \nCiclosporin A (CsA) pharmacokinetics are unaffected by mycophenolate mofetil. \nIn contrast, if concomitant CsA treatment is stopped, an increase in MPA AUC of around 30% should \nbe expected. CsA interferes with MPA enterohepatic recycling, resulting in reduced MPA exposures \nby 30 - 50% in renal transplant patients treated with CellCept and CsA compared with patients \nreceiving sirolimus or belatacept and similar doses of CellCept (see also section 4.4). Conversely, \nchanges of MPA exposure should be expected when switching patients from CsA to one of the \nimmunosuppressants which does not interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle. \n \nAntibiotics eliminating -glucuronidase-producing bacteria in the intestine (e.g. aminoglycoside, \ncephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, and penicillin classes of antibiotics) may interfere with MPAG/MPA \nenterohepatic recirculation, thus leading to reduced systemic MPA exposure. Information concerning \nthe following antibiotics is available: \n \nCiprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid \nReductions in pre-dose (trough) MPA concentrations of about 50% have been reported in renal \ntransplant recipients in the days immediately following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or \namoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. This effect tended to diminish with continued antibiotic use and to \ncease within a few days of antibiotic discontinuation. The change in pre-dose level may not accurately \nrepresent changes in overall MPA exposure. Therefore, a change in the dose of CellCept should not \nnormally be necessary in the absence of clinical evidence of graft dysfunction. However, close clinical \nmonitoring should be performed during the combination and shortly after antibiotic treatment. \n \nNorfloxacin and metronidazole \nIn healthy volunteers, no significant interaction was observed when CellCept was concomitantly \nadministered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. However, norfloxacin and metronidazole \ncombined reduced the MPA exposure by approximately 30% following a single dose of CellCept. \n \nTrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole \nNo effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed.  \n \nMedicinal products that affect glucuronidation (e.g. isavuconazole, telmisartan) \nConcomitant administration of drugs affecting glucuronidation of MPA may change MPA exposure. \nCaution is therefore recommended when administering these drugs concomitantly with CellCept.  \n \nIsavuconazole \nAn increase of MPA AUC0-∞ by 35% was observed with concomitant administration of \nisavuconazole. \n \n\n\n\n65 \n\nTelmisartan \nConcomitant administration of telmisartan and CellCept resulted in an approximately 30% decrease of \nMPA concentrations. Telmisartan changes MPA’s elimination by enhancing PPAR gamma \n(peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) expression, which in turn results in an enhanced \nUGT1A9 expression and activity. When comparing rates of transplant rejection, rates of graft loss or \nadverse event profiles between CellCept patients with and without concomitant telmisartan \nmedication, no clinical consequences of the pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction were seen. \n \nGanciclovir \nBased on the results of a single dose administration study of recommended doses of oral \nmycophenolate and IV ganciclovir and the known effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics \nof CellCept (see section 4.2) and ganciclovir, it is anticipated that co-administration of these agents \n(which compete for mechanisms of renal tubular secretion) will result in increases in MPAG and \nganciclovir concentration. No substantial alteration of MPA pharmacokinetics is anticipated and \nCellCept dose adjustment is not required. In patients with renal impairment in whom CellCept and \nganciclovir or its prodrugs, e.g. valganciclovir, are co-administered, the dose recommendations for \nganciclovir should be observed and patients should be monitored carefully. \n \nOral contraceptives \nThe pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral contraceptives were unaffected by co-\nadministration of CellCept (see also section 5.2). \n \nRifampicin \nIn patients not also taking ciclosporin, concomitant administration of CellCept and rifampicin resulted \nin a decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) of 18% to 70%. It is recommended to monitor MPA \nexposure levels and to adjust CellCept doses accordingly to maintain clinical efficacy when rifampicin \nis administered concomitantly. \n \nSevelamer \nDecrease in MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 30% and 25%, respectively, were observed when CellCept \nwas concomitantly administered with sevelamer without any clinical consequences (i.e. graft \nrejection). It is recommended, however, to administer CellCept at least one hour before or three hours \nafter sevelamer intake to minimise the impact on the absorption of MPA. There are no data on \nCellCept with phosphate binders other than sevelamer. \n \nTacrolimus \nIn hepatic transplant patients initiated on CellCept and tacrolimus, the AUC and Cmax of MPA, the \nactive metabolite of CellCept, were not significantly affected by co-administration with tacrolimus. In \ncontrast, there was an increase of approximately 20% in tacrolimus AUC when multiple doses of \nCellCept (1.5 g BID) were administered to hepatic transplant patients taking tacrolimus. However, in \nrenal transplant patients, tacrolimus concentration did not appear to be altered by CellCept (see also \nsection 4.4). \n \nLive vaccines \nLive vaccines should not be given to patients with an impaired immune response. The antibody \nresponse to other vaccines may be diminished (see also 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nPotential interaction \nCo-administration of probenecid with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys raises plasma AUC of \nMPAG by 3-fold. Thus, other substances known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with \nMPAG, and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other substance undergoing tubular \nsecretion.  \n \n\n\n\n66 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nPregnancy whilst taking mycophenolate must be avoided. Therefore, women of childbearing potential \nmust use at least one form of reliable contraception (see section 4.3) before starting CellCept therapy, \nduring therapy, and for six weeks after stopping the therapy, unless abstinence is the chosen method of \ncontraception. Two complementary forms of contraception simultaneously are preferred. \n \nPregnancy \n \nCellCept is contraindicated during pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment to \nprevent transplant rejection. Treatment should not be initiated without providing a negative pregnancy \ntest result to rule out unintended use in pregnancy (see section 4.3). \n \nFemale patients of reproductive potential must be made aware of the increased risk of pregnancy loss \nand congenital malformations at the beginning of the treatment and must be counselled regarding \npregnancy prevention and planning. \n \nBefore starting CellCept treatment, women of childbearing potential should have two negative serum \nor urine pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/ml in order to exclude unintended \nexposure of the embryo to mycophenolate. It is recommended that the second test should be performed \n8 - 10 days after the first test. For transplants from deceased donors, if it is not possible to perform two \ntests 8 - 10 days apart before treatment starts (because of the timing of transplant organ availability), a \npregnancy test must be performed immediately before starting treatment and a further test performed 8 \n- 10 days later. Pregnancy tests should be repeated as clinically required (e.g. after any gap in \ncontraception is reported. Results of all pregnancy tests should be discussed with the patient. Patients \nshould be instructed to consult their physician immediately should pregnancy occur. \n \nMycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen, with an increased risk of spontaneous abortions and \ncongenital malformations in case of exposure during pregnancy; \n• Spontaneous abortions have been reported in 45 to 49% of pregnant women exposed to \n\nmycophenolate mofetil, compared to a reported rate of between 12 and 33% in solid organ \ntransplant patients treated with immunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil. \n\n• Based on literature reports, malformations occurred in 23 to 27% of live births in women \nexposed to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (compared to 2 to 3% of live births in the \noverall population and approximately 4 to 5% of live births in solid organ transplant recipients \ntreated with immunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil). \n\n \nCongenital malformations, including reports of multiple malformations, have been observed post-\nmarketing in children of patients exposed to CellCept during pregnancy in combination with other \nimmunosuppressants. The following malformations were most frequently reported:  \n• Abnormalities of the ear (e.g. abnormally formed or absent external ear), external auditory \n\ncanal atresia (middle ear); \n• Facial malformations such as cleft lip, cleft palate, micrognathia and hypertelorism of the \n\norbits; \n• Abnormalities of the eye (e.g. coloboma); \n• Congenital heart disease such as atrial and ventricular septal defects; \n• Malformations of the fingers (e.g. polydactyly, syndactyly); \n• Tracheo-oesophageal malformations (e.g. oesophageal atresia);  \n• Nervous system malformations such as spina bifida;  \n• Renal abnormalities. \n \nIn addition, there have been isolated reports of the following malformations: \n• Microphthalmia; \n• Congenital choroid plexus cyst; \n• Septum pellucidum agenesis; \n\n\n\n67 \n\n• Olfactory nerve agenesis. \n \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nMycophenolate mofetil has been shown to be excreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known \nwhether this substance is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse \nreactions to mycophenolate mofetil in breast-fed infants, CellCept is contraindicated in nursing \nmothers (see section 4.3). \n \nMen \n \nLimited clinical evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage \nfollowing paternal exposure to mycophenolate mofetil.  \n \nMPA is a powerful teratogen. It is not known if MPA is present in semen. Calculations based on \nanimal data show that the maximum amount of MPA that could potentially be transferred to woman is \nso low that it would be unlikely to have an effect. Mycophenolate has been shown to be genotoxic in \nanimal studies at concentrations exceeding the human therapeutic exposures only by small margins \nsuch that the risk of genotoxic effects on sperm cells cannot completely be excluded. \n \nTherefore, the following precautionary measures are recommended: sexually active male patients or \ntheir female partners are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment of the male \npatient and for at least 90 days after cessation of mycophenolate mofetil. Male patients of reproductive \npotential should be made aware of and discuss with a qualified healthcare professional the potential \nrisks of fathering a child. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCellCept has a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \nCellCept may cause somnolence, confusion, dizziness, tremor or hypotension, and therefore patients \nare advised to use caution when driving or using machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \nAn estimated total of 1557 patients received CellCept during five clinical trials in the prevention of \nacute organ rejection. Of these, 991 were included in the three renal studies, 277 were included in one \nhepatic study, and 289 were included in one cardiac study. Azathioprine was the comparator used in \nthe hepatic and cardiac studies and in two of the renal studies whilst the other renal study was placebo-\ncontrolled. Patients in all study arms also received cyclosporine and corticosteroids. The types of \nadverse reactions reported during post-marketing with CellCept are similar to those seen in the \ncontrolled renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant studies. \n \nDiarrhoea, leukopenia, sepsis and vomiting were among the most common and/or serious adverse drug \nreactions associated with the administration of CellCept in combination with ciclosporin and \ncorticosteroids. There is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from clinical trials and post-marketing experience are listed in \nTable 1, by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) along with their frequencies. The corresponding \nfrequency category for each adverse drug reaction is based on the following convention: very common \n(≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nand very rare (<1/10,000). Due to the large differences observed in the frequency of certain ADRs \nacross the different transplant indications, the frequency is presented separately for renal, hepatic and \ncardiac transplant patients. \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \nTable 1 Summary of adverse drug reactions occurring in patients treated with CellCept  \nreported from clinical trials and post-marketing experience \n \n\nAdverse drug

and 277 (2 g IV / 3 g oral CellCept daily) patients were treated in \nPhase III studies for the prevention of rejection in renal, cardiac and hepatic transplantation, respectively. \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nMalignancies \nPatients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, \nincluding CellCept, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, \nparticularly of the skin (see section 4.4). Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients \ndid not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. \nHepatic transplant patients were followed for at least 1 year, but less than 3 years.  \n \nInfections \nAll patients treated with immunosuppressants are at increased risk of bacterial, viral and fungal \ninfections (some of which may lead to a fatal outcome), including those caused by opportunistic \nagents and latent viral reactivation. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see section \n4.4). The most serious infections were sepsis, peritonitis, meningitis, endocarditis, tuberculosis and \natypical mycobacterial infection. The most common opportunistic infections in patients receiving \nCellCept (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressants in controlled clinical trials in renal, cardiac \nand hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year were candida mucocutaneous, CMV \nviraemia/syndrome and Herpes simplex. The proportion of patients with CMV viraemia/syndrome was \n13.5%. Cases of BK virus associated nephropathy, as well as cases of JC virus associated progressive \nmultifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), have been reported in patients treated with \nimmunosuppressants, including CellCept. \n \nBlood and lymphatic disorders  \nCytopenias, including leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia, are known risks \nassociated with mycophenolate mofetil and may lead or contribute to the occurrence of infections and \nhemorrhages (see section 4.4). Agranulocytosis and neutropenia have been reported; therefore, regular \nmonitoring of patients taking CellCept is advised (see section 4.4). There have been reports of aplastic \nanaemia and bone marrow failure in patients treated with CellCept, some of which have been fatal. \nCases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with CellCept (see section \n4.4). \nIsolated cases of abnormal neutrophil morphology, including the acquired Pelger-Huet anomaly, have \nbeen observed in patients treated with CellCept. These changes are not associated with impaired \nneutrophil function. These changes may suggest a ‘left shift’ in the maturity of neutrophils in \nhaematological investigations, which may be mistakenly interpreted as a sign of infection in \nimmunosuppressed patients such as those that receive CellCept. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nThe most serious gastrointestinal disorders were ulceration and hemorrhage which are known risks \nassociated with mycophenolate mofetil. Mouth, esophageal, gastric, duodenal, and intestinal ulcers \noften complicated by hemorrhage, as well as hematemesis, melena, and hemorrhagic forms of gastritis \nand colitis were commonly reported during the pivotal clinical trials. The most common \ngastrointestinal disorders, however, were diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Endoscopic investigation of \npatients with CellCept-related diarrhea have revealed isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nHypersensitivity \nHypersensitivity reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylactic reaction have been \nreported.  \n \nPregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions \nCases of spontaneous abortion have been reported in patients exposed to mycophenolate mofetil, \nmainly in the first trimester, see section 4.6. \n \n\n\n\n72 \n\nCongenital disorders \nCongenital malformations have been observed post-marketing in children of patients exposed to \nCellCept in combination with other immunosuppressants, see section 4.6. \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nThere have been isolated reports of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis in patients treated \nwith CellCept in combination with other immunosuppressants, some of which have been fatal. There \nhave also been reports of bronchiectasis in children and adults. \n \nImmune system disorders \nHypogammaglobulinaemia has been reported in patients receiving CellCept in combination with other \nimmunosuppressants. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nEdema, including peripheral, face and scrotal edema, was reported very commonly during the pivotal \ntrials. Musculoskeletal pain such as myalgia, and neck and back pain were also very commonly \nreported. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population  \nThe type and frequency of adverse reactions in a clinical study, which recruited 92 paediatric patients \naged 2 to 18 years who were given 600 mg/m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily, were \ngenerally similar to those observed in adult patients given 1 g CellCept twice daily. However, the \nfollowing treatment-related adverse events were more frequent in the paediatric population, \nparticularly in children under 6 years of age, when compared to adults: diarrhoea, sepsis, leukopenia, \nanaemia and infection.  \n \nElderly  \nElderly patients (≥ 65 years) may generally be at increased risk of adverse reactions due to \nimmunosuppression. Elderly patients receiving CellCept as part of a combination immunosuppressive \nregimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus tissue invasive \ndisease) and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary oedema, compared to younger \nindividuals.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose  \n \nReports of overdoses with mycophenolate mofetil have been received from clinical trials and during \npost-marketing experience. In many of these cases, no adverse events were reported. In those overdose \ncases in which adverse events were reported, the events fall within the known safety profile of the \nmedicinal product. \n \nIt is expected that an overdose of mycophenolate mofetil could possibly result in oversuppression of \nthe immune system and increase susceptibility to infections and bone marrow suppression (see section \n4.4). If neutropenia develops, dosing with CellCept should be interrupted or the dose reduced (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nHaemodialysis would not be expected to remove clinically significant amounts of MPA or MPAG. \nBile acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine, can remove MPA by decreasing the enterohepatic \nrecirculation of the drug (see section 5.2). \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n73 \n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: immunosuppressive agents ATC code L04AA06 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nMycophenolate mofetil is the 2-morpholinoethyl ester of MPA. MPA is a potent, selective, \nuncompetitive and reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, and therefore \ninhibits the de novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into DNA. \nBecause T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for their proliferation on de novo synthesis of \npurines whereas other cell types can utilise salvage pathways, MPA has more potent cytostatic effects \non lymphocytes than on other cells.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing oral administration, mycophenolate mofetil undergoes rapid and extensive absorption and \ncomplete presystemic metabolism to the active metabolite, MPA. As evidenced by suppression of \nacute rejection following renal transplantation, the immunosuppressant activity of CellCept is \ncorrelated with MPA concentration. The mean bioavailability of oral mycophenolate mofetil, based on \nMPA AUC, is 94% relative to IV mycophenolate mofetil. Food had no effect on the extent of \nabsorption (MPA AUC) of mycophenolate mofetil when administered at doses of 1.5 g BID to renal \ntransplant patients. However, MPA Cmax was decreased by 40% in the presence of food. \nMycophenolate mofetil is not measurable systemically in plasma following oral administration.  \n \nDistribution \n \nAs a result of enterohepatic recirculation, secondary increases in plasma MPA concentration are \nusually observed at approximately 6 – 12 hours post-dose. A reduction in the AUC of MPA of \napproximately 40% is associated with the co-administration of cholestyramine (4 g TID), indicating \nthat there is a significant amount of enterohepatic recirculation.  \nMPA at clinically relevant concentrations is 97% bound to plasma albumin. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nMPA is metabolised principally by glucuronyl transferase (isoform UGT1A9) to form the inactive \nphenolic glucuronide of MPA (MPAG). In vivo, MPAG is converted back to free MPA via \nenterohepatic recirculation. A minor acylglucuronide (AcMPAG) is also formed. AcMPAG is \npharmacologically active and is suspected to be responsible for some of MMF’s side effects \n(diarrhoea, leukopenia). \n \nElimination \n \nA negligible amount of substance is excreted as MPA (< 1% of the dose) in the urine. Oral \nadministration of radiolabelled mycophenolate mofetil results in complete recovery of the \nadministered dose with 93% of the administered dose recovered in the urine and 6% recovered in the \nfaeces. Most (about 87%) of the administered dose is excreted in the urine as MPAG. \n \nAt clinically encountered concentrations, MPA and MPAG are not removed by haemodialysis. \nHowever, at high MPAG plasma concentrations (> 100 µg/ml), small amounts of MPAG are removed. \nBy interfering with enterohepatic recirculation of the drug, bile acid sequestrants such as \ncholestyramine, reduce MPA AUC (see section 4.9). \n\n\n\n74 \n\nMPA’s disposition depends on several transporters. Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) \nand multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) are involved in MPA’s disposition; OATP \nisoforms, MRP2 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) are transporters associated with the \nglucuronides’ biliary excretion. Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) is also able to transport MPA, \nbut its contribution seems to be confined to the absorption process. In the kidney, MPA and its \nmetabolites potently interact with renal organic anion transporters. \n \nIn the early post-transplant period (< 40 days post-transplant), renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant \npatients had mean MPA AUCs approximately 30% lower and Cmax approximately 40% lower \ncompared to the late post-transplant period (3 – 6 months post-transplant). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nIn a single dose study (6 subjects/group), mean plasma MPA AUC observed in subjects with severe \nchronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate < 25 ml/min/1.73 m2) were 28 – 75% higher \nrelative to the means observed in normal healthy subjects or subjects with lesser degrees of renal \nimpairment. The mean single dose MPAG AUC was 3 – 6-fold higher in subjects with severe renal \nimpairment than in subjects with mild renal impairment or normal healthy subjects, consistent with the \nknown renal elimination of MPAG. Multiple dosing of mycophenolate mofetil in patients with severe \nchronic renal impairment has not been studied. No data are available for cardiac or hepatic transplant \npatients with severe chronic renal impairment. \n \nDelayed renal graft function \nIn patients with delayed renal graft function post-transplant, mean MPA AUC0-12h was comparable to \nthat seen in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. Mean plasma MPAG AUC 0-12h \nwas 2 – 3-fold higher than in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. There may be a \ntransient increase in the free fraction and concentration of plasma MPA in patients with delayed renal \ngraft function. Dose adjustment of CellCept does not appear to be necessary. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn volunteers with alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatic MPA glucuronidation processes were relatively \nunaffected by hepatic parenchymal disease. Effects of hepatic disease on this process probably depend \non the particular disease. However, hepatic disease with predominantly biliary damage, such as \nprimary biliary cirrhosis, may show a different effect.  \n \nPaediatric population  \nPharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in 49 paediatric renal transplant patients (aged 2 to 18 \nyears) given 600 mg/m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily. This dose achieved MPA AUC \nvalues similar to those seen in adult renal transplant patients receiving CellCept at a dose of 1 g BID in \nthe early and late post-transplant period. MPA AUC values across age groups were similar in the early \nand late post-transplant period. \n \nElderly   \nThe pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil and its metabolites have not been found to be altered \nin the elderly patients (≥ 65 years) when compared to younger transplant patients. \n \nPatients taking oral contraceptives \nA study of the co-administration of CellCept (1 g BID) and combined oral contraceptives containing \nethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.15 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) \nor gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) conducted in 18 non-transplant women (not taking other \nimmunosuppressants) over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles showed no clinically relevant influence of \nCellCept on the ovulation suppressing action of the oral contraceptives. Serum levels of LH, FSH and \nprogesterone were not significantly affected. The pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives were \nunaffected by co-administration of CellCept (see also section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n75 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn experimental models, mycophenolate mofetil was not tumourigenic. The highest dose tested in the \nanimal carcinogenicity studies resulted in approximately 2 – 3 times the systemic exposure (AUC or \nCmax) observed in renal transplant patients at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g/day and 1.3 – 2 \ntimes the systemic exposure (AUC or Cmax) observed in cardiac transplant patients at the \nrecommended clinical dose of 3 g/day. \n \nTwo genotoxicity assays (in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and in vivo mouse bone marrow \nmicronucleus test) showed a potential of mycophenolate mofetil to cause chromosomal aberrations. \nThese effects can be related to the pharmacodynamic mode of action, i.e. inhibition of nucleotide \nsynthesis in sensitive cells. Other in vitro tests for detection of gene mutation did not demonstrate \ngenotoxic activity. \n \nMycophenolate mofetil had no effect on fertility of male rats at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day. The \nsystemic exposure at this dose represents 2 – 3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical \ndose of 2 g/day in renal transplant patients and 1.3 – 2 times the clinical exposure at the recommended \nclinical dose of 3 g/day in cardiac transplant patients. In a female fertility and reproduction study \nconducted in rats, oral doses of 4.5 mg/kg/day caused malformations (including anophthalmia, \nagnathia, and hydrocephaly) in the first generation offspring in the absence of maternal toxicity. The \nsystemic exposure at this dose was approximately 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the recommended \nclinical dose of 2 g/day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the clinical exposure \nat the recommended clinical dose of 3 g/day for cardiac transplant patients. No effects on fertility or \nreproductive parameters were evident in the dams or in the subsequent generation.  \n \nIn teratology studies in rats and rabbits, foetal resorptions and malformations occurred in rats at  \n6 mg/kg/day (including anophthalmia, agnathia, and hydrocephaly) and in rabbits at 90 mg/kg/day \n(including cardiovascular and renal anomalies, such as ectopia cordis and ectopic kidneys, and \ndiaphragmatic and umbilical hernia), in the absence of maternal toxicity. The systemic exposure at \nthese levels is approximately equivalent to or less than 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the \nrecommended clinical dose of 2 g/day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the \nclinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g/day for cardiac transplant patients (see \nsection 4.6). \n \nThe haematopoietic and lymphoid systems were the primary organs affected in toxicology studies \nconducted with mycophenolate mofetil in the rat, mouse, dog and monkey. These effects occurred at \nsystemic exposure levels that are equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended \ndose of 2 g/day for renal transplant recipients. Gastrointestinal effects were observed in the dog at \nsystemic exposure levels equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended dose. \nGastrointestinal and renal effects consistent with dehydration were also observed in the monkey at the \nhighest dose (systemic exposure levels equivalent to or greater than clinical exposure). The nonclinical \ntoxicity profile of mycophenolate mofetil appears to be consistent with adverse events observed in \nhuman clinical trials, which now provide safety data of more relevance to the patient population (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n105 \n\nPackage Leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nCellCept 250 mg capsules \nmycophenolate mofetil \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What CellCept is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take CellCept \n3. How to take CellCept \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store CellCept \n6. Content of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What CellCept is and what it is used for \n \nThe full name of your medicine is CellCept 250 mg capsules.  \n• In this leaflet the shorter name CellCept is used. \nCellCept contains mycophenolate mofetil.  \n• This belongs to a group of medicines called “immunosuppressants”.  \nCellCept is used to prevent your body rejecting a transplanted organ. \n• A kidney, heart or liver.  \nCellCept should be used together with other medicines: \n• Ciclosporin and corticosteroids. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take CellCept \n \nWARNING \nMycophenolate causes birth defects and miscarriage. If you are a woman who could become pregnant, \nyou must provide a negative pregnancy test before starting treatment and must follow the \ncontraception advice given to you by your doctor. \n \nYour doctor will speak to you and give you written information, particularly on the effects of \nmycophenolate on unborn babies. Read the information carefully and follow the instructions. \nIf you do not fully understand these instructions, please ask your doctor to explain them again before \nyou take mycophenolate. See also further information in this section under “Warnings and \nprecautions” and “Pregnancy and breast-feeding”. \n \nDo not take CellCept: \n• If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid or any of the \n\nother ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n• If you are a woman who could be pregnant and you have not provided a negative pregnancy \n\ntest before your first prescription, as mycophenolate causes birth defects and miscarriage. \n• If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant or think you may be pregnant \n\n\n\n106 \n\n• If you are not using effective contraception (see Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding). \n• If you are breast-feeding. \nDo not take this medicine if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking CellCept. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor straight away before starting treatment with CellCept: \n• If you have a sign of infection such as a fever or sore throat \n• If you have any unexpected bruising or bleeding \n• If you have ever had a problem with your digestive system such as a stomach ulcer \n• If you are planning to become pregnant or if you get pregnant while you or your partner are \ntaking CellCept \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor straight away before starting \ntreatment with CellCept. \n \nThe effect of sunlight \nCellCept reduces your body’s defences. As a result, there is an increased risk of skin cancer. Limit the \namount of sunlight and UV light you get. Do this by: \n• wearing protective clothing that also covers your head, neck, arms and legs \n• using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. \n \nOther medicines and CellCept \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. This \nincludes medicines obtained without a prescription, such as herbal medicines. This is because \nCellCept can affect the way some other medicines work. Also other medicines can affect the way \nCellCept works. \nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines before \nyou start CellCept: \n• azathioprine or other medicines that suppress your immune system – given after a transplant \n\noperation \n• cholestyramine – used to treat high cholesterol \n• rifampicin – an antibiotic used to prevent and treat infections such as tuberculosis (TB) \n• antacids or proton pump inhibitors – used for acid problems in your stomach such as indigestion \n• phosphate binders – used by people with chronic kidney failure to reduce how much phosphate \n\ngets absorbed into their blood \n• antibiotics – used to treat bacterial infections  \n• isavuconazole – used to treat fungal infections \n• telmisartan – used to treat high blood pressure \n\n \nVaccines \nIf you need to have a vaccine (a live vaccine) while taking CellCept, talk to your doctor or pharmacist \nfirst. Your doctor will have to advise you on what vaccines you can have. \n \nYou must not donate blood during treatment with CellCept and for at least 6 weeks after stopping \ntreatment. Men must not donate semen during treatment with CellCept and for at least 90 days after \nstopping treatment. \n \nCellCept with food and drink \nTaking food and drink has no effect on your treatment with CellCept. \n \nPregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding \n \nContraception in women taking CellCept \nIf you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use an effective method of contraception \nwith CellCept. This includes: \n• Before you start taking CellCept \n\n\n\n107 \n\n• During your entire treatment with CellCept  \n• For 6 weeks after you stop taking CellCept. \nTalk to your doctor about the most suitable contraception for you. This will depend on your individual \nsituation. Two forms of contraception are preferable as this will reduce the risk of unintended \npregnancy. Contact your doctor as soon as possible, if you think your contraception may not \nhave been effective or if you have forgotten to take your contraceptive pill. \n \nYou are a woman who is not capable of becoming pregnant if any of the following applies to you: \n• You are post-menopausal, i.e. at least 50 years old and your last period was more than a year \n\nago (if your periods have stopped because you have had treatment for cancer, then there is still a \nchance you could become pregnant) \n\n• Your fallopian tubes and both ovaries have been removed by surgery (bilateral salpingo-\noophorectomy) \n\n• Your womb (uterus) has been removed by surgery (hysterectomy) \n• Your ovaries no longer work (premature ovarian failure, which has been confirmed by a \n\nspecialist gynaecologist) \n• You were born with one of the following rare conditions that make pregnancy impossible: the \n\nXY genotype, Turner’s syndrome or uterine agenesis \n• You are a child or teenager who has not started having periods. \n \nContraception in men taking CellCept \nThe available evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage if the \nfather takes mycophenolate. However, a risk cannot be completely excluded. As a precaution you or \nyour female partner are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment and for 90 days \nafter you stop taking CellCept.  \n \nIf you are planning to have a child, talk to your doctor about the potential risks and alternative \ntherapies. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will talk to you about \nthe risks in case of pregnancy and the alternatives you can take to prevent rejection of your transplant \norgan if: \n• You plan to become pregnant. \n• You miss or think you have missed a period, or you have unusual menstrual bleeding, or suspect \n\nyou are pregnant. \n• You have sex without using an effective method of contraception. \nIf you do become pregnant during the treatment with mycophenolate, you must inform your doctor \nimmediately. However, keep taking CellCept until you see him or her. \n \nPregnancy \nMycophenolate causes a very high frequency of miscarriage (50%) and of severe birth defects (23 - \n27%) in the unborn baby. Birth defects that have been reported include anomalies of ears, of eyes, of \nface (cleft lip/palate), of development of fingers, of heart, oesophagus (tube that connects the throat \nwith the stomach), kidneys and nervous system (for example spina bifida (where the bones of the \nspine are not properly developed). Your baby may be affected by one or more of these. \n \nIf you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must provide a negative pregnancy test before \nstarting treatment and must follow the contraception advice given to you by your doctor. Your doctor \nmay request more than one test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment. \n \nBreast-feeding \nDo not take CellCept if you are breast-feeding. This is because small amounts of the medicine can \npass into the mother’s milk. \n \n\n\n\n108 \n\nDriving and using machines \nCellCept has a moderate influence on your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If you feel \ndrowsy, numb or confused, talk to your doctor or nurse and do not drive or use any tools or machines \nuntil you feel better. \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to take CellCept \n \nAlways take CellCept exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nHow much to take \nThe amount you take depends on the type of transplant you have had. The usual doses are shown \nbelow. Treatment will continue for as long as you need to prevent you from rejecting your transplant \norgan. \n \nKidney transplant \nAdults \n• The first dose is given within 3 days of the transplant operation. \n• The daily dose is 8 capsules (2 g of the medicine) taken as 2 separate doses.  \n• Take 4 capsules in the morning and then 4 capsules in the evening. \nChildren (aged 2 to 18 years) \n• The dose given will vary depending on the size of the child.  \n• Your doctor will decide the most appropriate dose based on your child’s height and weight \n\n(body surface area – measured as square metres or “m2”). The recommended dose is 600 mg/m² \ntaken twice a day. \n\n \nHeart transplant \nAdults \n• The first dose is given within 5 days of the transplant operation. \n• The daily dose is 12 capsules (3 g of the medicine) taken as 2 separate doses.  \n• Take 6 capsules in the morning and then 6 capsules in the evening. \nChildren \n• There is no information for the use of CellCept in children with a heart transplant. \n \nLiver transplant \nAdults \n• The first dose of oral CellCept will be given to you at least 4 days after the transplant operation \n\nand when you are able to swallow oral medicines. \n• The daily dose is 12 capsules (3 g of the medicine) taken as 2 separate doses.  \n• Take 6 capsules in the morning and then 6 capsules in the evening.  \nChildren \n• There is no information for the use of CellCept in children with a liver transplant. \n \nTaking the medicine \nSwallow your capsules whole with a glass of water \n• Do not break or crush them \n• Do not take any capsules that have broken open or split. \n \nTake care not to let any powder from inside a broken capsule get into your eyes or mouth. \n• If this happens, rinse with plenty of plain water. \n \n\n\n\n109 \n\nTake care not to let any powder from inside a broken capsule get onto your skin.  \n• If this happens, wash the area thoroughly with soap and water. \n \nIf you take more CellCept than you should \nIf you take more CellCept than you should, talk to a doctor or go to a hospital straight away. Also do \nthis if someone else accidentally takes your medicine. Take the medicine pack with you. \n \nIf you forget to take CellCept \nIf you forget to take your medicine at any time, take it as soon as you remember. Then continue to take \nit at the usual times. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. \n \nIf you stop taking CellCept \nDo not stop taking CellCept unless your doctor tells you to. If you stop your treatment you may \nincrease the chance of rejection of your transplant organ.  \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, CellCept can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nTalk to a doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects – you \nmay need urgent medical treatment: \n• you have a sign of infection such as a fever or sore throat \n• you have any unexpected bruising or bleeding \n• you have a rash, swelling of your face, lips, tongue or throat, with difficulty breathing - you \nmay be having a serious allergic reaction to the medicine (such as anaphylaxis, angioeodema). \n \nUsual problems \nSome of the more usual problems are diarrhoea, fewer white cells or red cells in your blood, infection \nand vomiting. Your doctor will do regular blood tests to check for any changes in: \n• the number of your blood cells or signs of infections \n  \nChildren may be more likely than adults to have some side effects. These include diarrhoea, infections, \nfewer white cells and fewer red cells in the blood. \n \nFighting infections \nCellCept reduces your body’s defences. This is to stop you rejecting your transplant. As a result, your \nbody will not be as good as normal at fighting infections. This means you may catch more infections \nthan usual. This includes infections of the brain, skin, mouth, stomach and gut, lungs and urinary \nsystem.  \n \nLymph and skin cancer \nAs can happen in patients taking this type of medicine (immune-suppressants), a very small number of \nCellCept patients have developed cancer of the lymphoid tissues and skin.  \n \nGeneral unwanted effects \nYou may get general side effects affecting your body as a whole. These include serious allergic \nreactions (such as anaphylaxis, angioeodema), fever, feeling very tired, difficulty sleeping, pains (such \nas stomach, chest, joint or muscle), headache, flu symptoms and swelling.  \n \nOther unwanted effects may include: \nSkin problems such as:  \n• acne, cold sores, shingles, skin growth, hair loss, rash, itching. \n \n\n\n\n110 \n\nUrinary problems such as:  \n• blood in the urine. \n \nDigestive system and mouth problems such as:  \n• swelling of the gums and mouth ulcers, \n• inflammation of the pancreas, colon or stomach,  \n• gastrointestinal disorders including bleeding, \n• liver disorder,  \n• diarrhea, constipation, feeling sick (nausea), indigestion, loss of appetite, flatulence. \n \nNervous system problems such as:  \n• feeling dizzy, drowsy or numb,  \n• tremor, muscle spasms, convulsions,  \n• feeling anxious or depressed, changes in your mood or thoughts. \n \nHeart and blood vessel problems such as: \n• change in blood pressure, accelerated heartbeat widening of blood vessels. \n \nLung problems such as:  \n• pneumonia, bronchitis,  \n• shortness of breath, cough, which can be due to bronchiectasis (a condition in which the lung \n\nairways are abnormally dilated) or pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the lung). Talk to your doctor \nif you develop a persistent cough or breathlessness.  \n\n• fluid on the lungs or inside the chest, \n• sinus problems. \n \nOther problems such as:  \n• weight loss, gout, high blood sugar, bleeding, bruising.  \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.

Making up the medicine \n \n \n1. What CellCept is and what it is used for \n \nThe full name of your medicine is CellCept 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion.  \n• In this leaflet the shorter name CellCept is used. \nCellCept contains mycophenolate mofetil.  \n• This belongs to a group of medicines called “immunosuppressants”.  \nCellCept is used to prevent your body rejecting a transplanted organ. \n• A kidney or liver.  \nCellCept should be used together with other medicines: \n• Ciclosporin and corticosteroids. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take CellCept  \n \nWARNING \nMycophenolate causes birth defects and miscarriage. If you are a woman who could become pregnant, \nyou must provide a negative pregnancy test before starting treatment and must follow the \ncontraception advice given to you by your doctor. \n \nYour doctor will speak to you and give you written information, particularly on the effects of \nmycophenolate on unborn babies. Read the information carefully and follow the instructions. \nIf you do not fully understand these instructions, please ask your doctor to explain them again before \nyou take mycophenolate. See also further information in this section under “Warnings and \nprecautions” and “Pregnancy and breast-feeding”. \n \nDo not take CellCept: \n• If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid, polysorbate \n\n80 or any of the other ingredients in this medicine (listed in section 6) \n• If you are a woman who could be pregnant and you have not provided a negative pregnancy test \n\nbefore your first prescription, as mycophenolate causes birth defects and miscarriage. \n\n\n\n114 \n\n• If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant or think you may be pregnant \n• If you are not using effective contraception (see Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding). \n• If you are breast-feeding. \nDo not have this medicine if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \nnurse before having CellCept. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or nurse straight away before starting treatment with CellCept: \n• If you have a sign of infection such as a fever or sore throat \n• If you have any unexpected bruising or bleeding \n• If you have ever had a problem with your digestive system such as a stomach ulcer \n• If you are planning to become pregnant or if you get pregnant while you or your partner are taking \n\nCellCept. \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse straight away before \nstarting treatment with CellCept. \n \nThe effect of sunlight \nCellCept reduces your body’s defences. As a result, there is an increased risk of skin cancer. Limit the \namount of sunlight and UV light you get. Do this by: \n• wearing protective clothing that also covers your head, neck, arms and legs \n• using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. \n \nOther medicines and CellCept  \nPlease tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. This \nincludes medicines obtained without a prescription, such as herbal medicines. This is because \nCellCept can affect the way some other medicines work. Also other medicines can affect the way \nCellCept works. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any of the following medicines before you start \nCellCept: \n• azathioprine or other medicines that suppress your immune system – given after a transplant \n\noperation \n• cholestyramine – used to treat high cholesterol \n• rifampicin – an antibiotic used to prevent and treat infections such as tuberculosis (TB) \n• phosphate binders – used by people with chronic kidney failure to reduce how much phosphate \n\ngets absorbed into their blood. \n• antibiotics – used to treat bacterial infections  \n• isavuconazole – used to treat fungal infections \n• telmisartan – used to treat high blood pressure \n \nVaccines \nIf you need to have a vaccine (a live vaccine) while having CellCept, talk to your doctor or pharmacist \nfirst. Your doctor will have to advise you on what vaccines you can have. \n \nYou must not donate blood during treatment with CellCept and for at least 6 weeks after stopping \ntreatment. Men must not donate semen during treatment with CellCept and for at least 90 days after \nstopping treatment. \nPregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding \n \nContraception in women taking CellCept \nIf you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use an effective method of contraception \nwith CellCept. This includes: \n• Before you start taking CellCept \n• During your entire treatment with CellCept  \n• For 6 weeks after you stop taking CellCept. \n\n\n\n115 \n\nTalk to your doctor about the most suitable contraception for you. This will depend on your individual \nsituation. Two forms of contraception are preferable as this will reduce the risk of unintended \npregnancy. Contact your doctor as soon as possible, if you think your contraception may not \nhave been effective or if you have forgotten to take your contraceptive pill. \n \nYou are a woman who is not capable of becoming pregnant if any of the following applies to you: \n• You are post-menopausal, i.e. at least 50 years old and your last period was more than a year \n\nago (if your periods have stopped because you have had treatment for cancer, then there is still a \nchance you could become pregnant) \n\n• Your fallopian tubes and both ovaries have been removed by surgery (bilateral                            \nsalpingo-oophorectomy) \n\n• Your womb (uterus) has been removed by surgery (hysterectomy) \n• Your ovaries no longer work (premature ovarian failure, which has been confirmed by a \n\nspecialist gynaecologist) \n• You were born with one of the following rare conditions that make pregnancy impossible: the \n\nXY genotype, Turner’s syndrome or uterine agenesis \n• You are a child or teenager who has not started having periods. \n \nContraception in men taking CellCept \nThe available evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage if the \nfather takes mycophenolate. However, a risk cannot be completely excluded. As a precaution, you or \nyour female partner are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment and for 90 days \nafter you stop taking CellCept.  \n \nIf you are planning to have a child, talk to your doctor about the potential risks and alternative \ntherapies. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will talk to you about \nthe risks in case of pregnancy and the alternatives you can take to prevent rejection of your transplant \norgan if: \n• You plan to become pregnant. \n• You miss or think you have missed a period, or you have unusual menstrual bleeding, or   \n\nsuspect you are pregnant. \n• You have sex without using an effective method of contraception. \nIf you do become pregnant during the treatment with mycophenolate, you must inform your doctor \nimmediately. However, keep taking CellCept until you see him or her. \n \nPregnancy \nMycophenolate causes a very high frequency of miscarriage (50%) and of severe birth defects (23-\n27 %) in the unborn baby. Birth defects which have been reported include anomalies of ears, of eyes, \nof face (cleft lip/palate), of development of fingers, of heart, oesophagus (tube that connects the throat \nwith the stomach), kidneys and nervous system (for example spina bifida (where the bones of the \nspine are not properly developed). Your baby may be affected by one or more of these. \n \nIf you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must provide a negative pregnancy test before \nstarting treatment and must follow the contraception advice given to you by your doctor. Your doctor \nmay request more than one test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment. \n \nBreast-feeding \nDo not take CellCept if you are breast-feeding. This is because small amounts of the medicine can \npass into the mother’s milk. \n \n\n\n\n116 \n\nDriving and using machines \nCellCept has a moderate influence on your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If you feel \ndrowsy, numb or confused, talk to your doctor or nurse and do not drive or use any tools or machines \nuntil you feel better. \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1  mmol sodium (23  mg) per dose, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to take CellCept \n \nCellCept is usually given by a doctor or nurse in hospital. It is given as a slow drip (infusion) into a \nvein.  \n \nHow much to take \nThe amount you take depends on the type of transplant you have had. The usual doses are shown \nbelow. Treatment will continue for as long as you need to prevent you from rejecting your transplant \norgan. \n \nKidney transplant \nAdults \n• The first dose is given within 24 hours of the transplant operation. \n• The daily dose is 2 g of the medicine taken as 2 separate doses.  \n• This will be given as 1 g in the morning and then 1 g in the evening. \n \nLiver transplant \nAdults \n• The first dose is given to you as soon as possible after the transplant operation. \n• You will have the medicine for at least 4 days. \n• The daily dose is 2 g of the medicine taken as 2 separate doses.  \n• This will be given as 1 g in the morning and then 1 g in the evening. \n• When you are able to swallow, you will be given this medicine by mouth. \n \nMaking up the medicine \nThe medicine comes as a powder. This needs mixing with glucose before using. Your doctor or nurse \nwill make up the medicine and give it to you. They will follow the instructions under section 7 \n“Making up the medicine”. \n \nIf you take more CellCept than you should \nIf you think that you have had too much medicine, talk to your doctor or nurse straight away. \n \nIf you forget to take CellCept \nIf a dose of CellCept is missed, this will be given to you as soon as possible. Your treatment will then \ncontinue at the normal times. \n \nIf you stop taking CellCept \nDo not stop having CellCept unless your doctor tells you to. If you stop your treatment you may \nincrease the chance of rejection of your transplant organ.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, CellCept can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n\n\n117 \n\n \nTalk to a doctor or nurse straight away if you notice any of the following serious side \neffects – you may need urgent medical treatment: \n• you have a sign of infection such as a fever or sore throat \n• you have any unexpected bruising or bleeding \n• you have a rash, swelling of your face, lips, tongue or throat, with difficulty breathing - you may \n\nbe having a serious allergic reaction to the medicine (such as anaphylaxis, angioeodema). \n \nUsual problems \nSome of the more usual problems are diarrhoea, fewer white cells or red cells in your blood, infection \nand vomiting. Your doctor will do regular blood tests to check for any changes in: \n• the number of your blood cells or signs of infections. \n \nFighting infections \nCellCept reduces your body’s defences. This is to stop you rejecting your transplant. As a result, your \nbody will not be as good as normal at fighting infections. This means you may catch more infections \nthan usual. This includes infections of the brain, skin, mouth, stomach and gut, lungs and urinary \nsystem.  \n \nLymph and skin cancer \nAs can happen in patients having this type of medicine (immune-suppressants), a very small number \nof CellCept patients have developed cancer of the lymphoid tissues and skin.  \n \nGeneral unwanted effects \nYou may get general side effects affecting your body as a whole. These include serious allergic \nreactions (such as anaphylaxis, angioeodema), fever, feeling very tired, difficulty sleeping, pains (such \nas stomach, chest, joint or muscle), headache, flu symptoms and swelling.  \n \nOther unwanted effects may include: \nSkin problems such as:  \n• acne, cold sores, skin growth, shingles, hair loss, rash, itching. \n \nUrinary problems such as:  \n• blood in the urine. \n \nDigestive system and mouth problems such as:  \n• swelling of the gums and mouth ulcers, \n• inflammation of the pancreas, colon or stomach,  \n• gastrointestinal disorders including bleeding, \n•  liver disorders,  \n• diarrhea, constipation, feeling sick (nausea), indigestion, loss of appetite, flatulence. \n \nNervous system problems such as:  \n• feeling drowsy or numb,  \n• tremor, muscle spasms convulsions,  \n• feeling anxious or depressed, changes in your mood or thoughts. \n \nHeart and blood vessel problems such as: \n• change in blood pressure, blood clots, accelerated heartbeat \n• pain, redness and swelling of the blood vessels where you had the infusion. \n \nLung problems such as:  \n• pneumonia, bronchitis,  \n• shortness of breath, cough, which can be due to bronchiectasis (a condition in which the lung \n\nairways are abnormally dilated) or pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the lung). Talk to your \ndoctor if you develop a persistent cough or breathlessness  \n\n\n\n118 \n\n•  fluid on the lungs or inside the chest, \n• sinus problems. \n \nOther problems such as:  \n• weight loss, gout, high blood sugar, bleeding, bruising.  \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine. \n \n \n5. How to store CellCept  \n \n• Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n• Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and vial label after \nEXP. \n• Powder for concentrate for solution for infusion: do not store above 30°C.  \n• Reconstituted solution and the diluted solution: store between 15°C and 30°C. \n• Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist \nhow to throw away  medicines no longer required. These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \nWhat CellCept contains \n• The active substance is mycophenolate mofetil. \n• The other ingredients are: polysorbate 80, citric acid, hydrochloric acid, sodium chloride. \n \nWhat CellCept looks like and contents of the pack \n• CellCept is provided in a 20 ml type I clear glass vial with a grey butyl rubber stopper and \n\naluminium seal with a plastic flip-off cap. \n• It is available in packs of 4 vials. \n \n \n7. Making up the medicine \n \nMethod and route of administration \nCellCept 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion does not contain an antibacterial \npreservative; therefore, reconstitution and dilution of the product must be performed under aseptic \nconditions. \n \nThe contents of CellCept 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion vials must be \nreconstituted with 14 ml of glucose intravenous infusion 5% each. A further dilution with glucose \nintravenous infusion 5% is required to a final concentration of 6 mg/ml. This means that to prepare a \n1 g dose of mycophenolate mofetil the content of 2 reconstituted vials (approx. 2 x 15 mL) must be \nfurther diluted into 140 ml glucose intravenous infusion 5% solution. If the infusion solution is not \nprepared immediately prior to administration, the commencement of administration of the infusion \nsolution should be within 3 hours from reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product. \n \nTake care not to let the made-up medicine get into your eyes. \n∙ If this happens, rinse your eyes with plain water. \nTake care not to let the made-up medicine get on your skin.  \n∙ If this happens, wash the area thoroughly with soap and water.  \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n119 \n\nCellCept 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion must be given as an intravenous (IV) \ninfusion. The infusion flow rate should be controlled to equate to a 2-hour period of administration.  \n \nCellCept IV solution should never be administered by rapid or bolus intravenous injection. \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder \nRoche Registration GmbH  \nEmil-Barell-Strasse 1 \n79639 Grenzach-Wyhlen \nGermany \n \nManufacturing Authorisation Holder responsible for batch release: \nRoche Pharma AG, Emil-Barell-Str. 1, 79639 Grenzach Wyhlen, Germany. \n \nFor any information about this medicinal product, please contact the local representative of the \nMarketing Authorisation Holder: \n \nBelgië/Belgique/Belgien \nN.V.

If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking CellCept. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor straight away before starting treatment with CellCept: \n• If you have a sign of infection such as a fever or sore throat  \n• If you have any unexpected bruising or bleeding \n• If you have ever had a problem with your digestive system such as a stomach ulcer \n• If you have a rare problem with your metabolism called “phenylketonuria” which runs in \n\nfamilies \n• If you are planning to become pregnant or if you get pregnant while you or your partner are \n\ntaking CellCept. \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor straight away before starting \ntreatment with CellCept. \n \nThe effect of sunlight \nCellCept reduces your body’s defences. As a result, there is an increased risk of skin cancer. Limit the \namount of sunlight and UV light you get. Do this by: \n• wearing protective clothing that covers your head, neck, arms and legs \n• using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. \n \nOther medicines and CellCept:  \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. This \nincludes medicines obtained without a prescription, such as herbal medicines. This is because \nCellCept can affect the way some other medicines work. Also, other medicines can affect the way \nCellCept works. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines before \nyou start CellCept: \n• azathioprine or other medicines that suppress your immune system - given after a transplant \n\noperation \n• cholestyramine - used to treat high cholesterol \n• rifampicin - an antibiotic used to prevent and treat infections such as tuberculosis (TB) \n• antacids or proton pump inhibitors - used for acid problems in your stomach such as indigestion \n• phosphate binders - used by people with chronic kidney failure to reduce how much phosphate \n\ngets absorbed into their blood. \n• antibiotics – used to treat bacterial infections  \n• isavuconazole – used to treat fungal infections \n• telmisartan – used to treat high blood pressure \n \nVaccines \nIf you need to have a vaccine (a live vaccine) while taking CellCept, talk to your doctor or pharmacist \nfirst. Your doctor will have to advise you on which vaccines you can have. \n \nYou must not donate blood during treatment with CellCept and for at least 6 weeks after stopping \ntreatment. Men must not donate semen during treatment with CellCept and for at least 90 days after \nstopping treatment. \n \nCellCept with food and drink \nTaking food and drink has no effect on your treatment with CellCept. \n \n\n\n\n123 \n\nPregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding \n \nContraception in women taking CellCept \nIf you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use an effective method of contraception \nwith CellCept. This includes: \n• Before you start taking CellCept \n• During your entire treatment with CellCept  \n• For 6 weeks after you stop taking CellCept. \nTalk to your doctor about the most suitable contraception for you. This will depend on your individual \nsituation. Two forms of contraception are preferable as this will reduce the risk of unintended \npregnancy. Contact your doctor as soon as possible, if you think your contraception may not \nhave been effective or if you have forgotten to take your contraceptive pill. \n \nYou are a woman who is not capable of becoming pregnant if any of the following applies to you: \n• You are post-menopausal, i.e. at least 50 years old and your last period was more than a year \n\nago (if your periods have stopped because you have had treatment for cancer, then there is still a \nchance you could become pregnant) \n\n• Your fallopian tubes and both ovaries have been removed by surgery (bilateral                            \nsalpingo-oophorectomy) \n\n• Your womb (uterus) has been removed by surgery (hysterectomy) \n• Your ovaries no longer work (premature ovarian failure, which has been confirmed by a \n\nspecialist gynaecologist) \n• You were born with one of the following rare conditions that make pregnancy impossible: the \n\nXY genotype, Turner’s syndrome or uterine agenesis \n• You are a child or teenager who has not started having periods. \n \nContraception in men taking CellCept \nThe available evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage if the \nfather takes mycophenolate. However, a risk cannot be completely excluded. As a precaution, you or \nyour female partner are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment and for 90 days \nafter you stop taking CellCept.  \n \nIf you are planning to have a child, talk to your doctor about the potential risks and alternative \ntherapies. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will talk to you about \nthe risks in case of pregnancy and the alternatives you can take to prevent rejection of your transplant \norgan if: \n• You plan to become pregnant. \n• You miss or think you have missed a period, or you have unusual menstrual bleeding, or \n\nsuspect you are pregnant. \n• You have sex without using an effective method of contraception. \nIf you do become pregnant during the treatment with mycophenolate, you must inform your doctor \nimmediately. However, keep taking CellCept until you see him or her. \n \nPregnancy \nMycophenolate causes a very high frequency of miscarriage (50%) and of severe birth defects (23 - \n27 %) in the unborn baby. Birth defects which have been reported include anomalies of ears, of eyes, \nof face (cleft lip/palate), of development of fingers, of heart, oesophagus (tube that connects the throat \nwith the stomach), kidneys and nervous system (for example spina bifida (where the bones of the \nspine are not properly developed). Your baby may be affected by one or more of these. \n \nIf you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must provide a negative pregnancy test before \nstarting treatment and must follow the contraception advice given to you by your doctor. Your doctor \nmay request more than one test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment. \n\n\n\n124 \n\n \nBreast-feeding \nDo not take CellCept if you are breast-feeding. This is because small amounts of the medicine can \npass into the mother’s milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nCellCept has a moderate influence on your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If you feel \ndrowsy, numb or confused, talk to your doctor or nurse and do not drive or use any tools or machines \nuntil you feel better. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of CellCept \n• CellCept contains aspartame. If you have a rare problem with your metabolism called \n\n“phenylketonuria”, talk to your doctor before you start taking this medicine. \n• CellCept contains sorbitol (a type of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you \n\ncannot tolerate or digest some sugars, talk to your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to take CellCept \n \nAlways take CellCept exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nHow much to take \nThe amount you take depends on the type of transplant you have had. The usual doses are shown \nbelow. Treatment will continue for as long as you need to prevent you from rejecting your transplant \norgan. \n \nKidney transplant \nAdults \n• The first dose is given within 3 days of the transplant operation.  \n• The daily dose is 10 ml suspension (2 g of the medicine) taken as 2 separate doses.  \n• Take 5 ml suspension in the morning and then 5 ml suspension in the evening. \n\nChildren (aged 2 to 18 years) \n• The dose given will vary depending on the size of the child.  \n• Your doctor will decide the most appropriate dose based on your child’s height and weight \n\n(body surface area – measured as square metres or “m²”). The recommended dose is \n600 mg/m² taken twice a day. \n\n \nHeart transplant \nAdults \n• The first dose is given within 5 days of the transplant operation.  \n• The daily dose is 15 ml suspension (3 g of the medicine) taken as 2 separate doses.  \n• Take 7.5 ml suspension in the morning and then 7.5 ml suspension in the evening. \nChildren \n• There is no information for the use of CellCept in children with a heart transplant. \n \nLiver transplant \nAdults \n• The first dose of oral CellCept will be given to you at least 4 days after the transplant operation \n\nand when you are able to swallow oral medications.  \n• The daily dose is 15 ml suspension (3 g of the medicine) taken as 2 separate doses.  \n• Take 7.5 ml suspension in the morning and then 7.5 ml suspension in the evening.  \n\nChildren \n\n\n\n125 \n\n• There is no information for the use of CellCept in children with a liver transplant. \n \nMaking up the medicine \nThe medicine comes as a powder. This needs mixing with purified water before using. Your \npharmacist will normally make up the medicine for you. If you need to do it yourself, see section 7 \n“Making up the medicine” \n \nTaking the medicine \nYou need to use the dispenser and bottle adapter supplied with the medicine to measure the dose. \nTry not to inhale the dry powder. Also, try not to get it on your skin, inside your mouth or nose. \nTake care not to let the made-up medicine get into your eyes. \n• If this happens, rinse your eyes with plain water. \nTake care not to let the made-up medicine get onto your skin.  \n• If this happens, wash the area thoroughly with soap and water. \n\n \n \n1. Shake the closed bottle well for about 5 seconds before each use. \n2. Take off the child safety bottle cap. \n3. Take the dispenser and push the plunger completely down toward the tip of the dispenser.  \n4. Then put the tip of the dispenser firmly into the opening of the bottle adapter. \n5. Turn the whole thing upside down (bottle and dispenser – see picture below). \n\n \n \n6. Pull the plunger out slowly. \n• Keep pulling it out until the desired amount of medicine is in the dispenser. \n7. Turn the whole thing back round the right way. \n• Holding onto the body of the dispenser, carefully pull the dispenser out of the bottle adapter. \nThe bottle adapter should stay in the bottle. \n• Put the end of the dispenser directly into your mouth and swallow the medicine.  \n• Do not mix the medicine with any other liquid when you swallow it. Close the bottle with the \n\nchild safety bottle cap after each use. \n• Immediately after use – take the dispenser to pieces and rinse it under running tap water. Allow \n\nit to dry in the air before using it again. Do not use solvent-containing wipes for cleaning. Do \nnot use cloths or wipes for drying. \n\n \n\n\n\n126 \n\nIf you take more CellCept than you should \nIf you take more CellCept than you should, talk to a doctor or go to a hospital straight away. Also do \nthis if someone else accidentally takes your medicine. Take the medicine pack with you. \n \nIf you forget to take CellCept \nIf you forget to take your medicine at any time, take it as soon as you remember. Then continue to take \nit at the usual times. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.  \n \nIf you stop taking CellCept \nDo not stop taking CellCept unless your doctor tells you to. If you stop your treatment you may \nincrease the chance of rejection of your transplant organ. \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, CellCept can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nTalk to a doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects – you \nmay need urgent medical treatment: \n• you have a sign of infection such as a fever or sore throat \n• you have any unexpected bruising or bleeding \n• you have a rash, swelling of your face, lips, tongue or throat, with difficulty breathing – you \n\nmay be having a serious allergic reaction to the medicine (such as anaphylaxis, angioeodema). \n \nUsual problems \nSome of the more usual problems are diarrhoea, fewer white cells or red cells in your blood, infection \nand vomiting. Your doctor will do regular blood tests to check for any changes in: \n• the number of your blood cells or signs of infections. \n \nChildren may be more likely than adults to have some side effects. These include diarrhoea, infections, \nfewer white cells and fewer red cells in the blood. \n \nFighting infections \nCellCept reduces your body’s defences. This is to stop you rejecting your transplant. As a result, your \nbody will not be as good as normal at fighting infections. This means you may catch more infections \nthan usual. This includes infections of the brain, skin, mouth, stomach and gut, lungs and urinary \nsystem.  \n \nLymph and skin cancer \nAs can happen in patients taking this type of medicine (immune-suppressants), a very small number of \nCellCept patients have developed cancer of the lymphoid tissues and skin.  \n \nGeneral unwanted effects \nYou may get general side effects affecting your body as a whole. These include serious allergic \nreactions (such as anaphylaxis, angioeodema), fever, feeling very tired, difficulty sleeping, pains (such \nas stomach, chest, joint or muscle), headache, flu symptoms and swelling.  \n \nOther unwanted effects may include: \nSkin problems such as:  \n• acne, cold sores, shingles, skin growth, hair loss, rash, itching. \n \nUrinary problems such as: \n• blood in the urine. \n \n\n\n\n127 \n\nDigestive system and mouth problems such as: \n• swelling of the gums and mouth ulcers, \n• inflammation of the pancreas, colon or stomach, \n• gastrointestinal disorders including bleeding, \n•  liver disorders, \n• diarrhea, constipation, feeling sick (nausea), indigestion, loss of appetite, flatulence. \n \nNervous system problems such as: \n• feeling dizzy, drowsy or numb, \n• tremor, muscle spasms, convulsions, \n• feeling anxious or depressed, changes in your mood or thoughts. \n \nHeart and blood vessel problems such as: \n• change in blood pressure, accelerated heartbeat, widening of blood vessels.  \n \nLung problems such as: \n• pneumonia, bronchitis, \n• shortness of breath, cough, which can be due to bronchiectasis (a condition in which the lung \n\nairways are abnormally dilated) or pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the lung). Talk to your doctor \nif you develop a persistent cough or breathlessness  \n\n• fluid on the lungs or inside the chest, \n• sinus problems. \n \nOther problems such as: \n• weight loss, gout, high blood sugar, bleeding, bruising. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine. \n \n \n5. How to store CellCept \n \n• Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n• Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and bottle label after \n\nEXP. \n• The shelf-life of the reconstituted suspension is two months. Do not use the suspension past this \n\nexpiry date. \n• Powder for oral suspension: do not store above 30°C.  \n• Reconstituted suspension: do not store above 30°C. \n• Do not throw away any medicines  via wastewater or household waste.

This \nincludes medicines obtained without a prescription, such as herbal medicines. This is because \nCellCept can affect the way some other medicines work. Also other medicines can affect the way \nCellCept works. \nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines before \nyou start CellCept: \n• azathioprine or other medicines that suppress your immune system – given after a transplant \n\noperation \n• cholestyramine – used to treat high cholesterol \n• rifampicin – an antibiotic used to prevent and treat infections such as tuberculosis (TB) \n• antacids or proton pump inhibitors – used for acid problems in your stomach such as indigestion \n• phosphate binders – used by people with chronic kidney failure to reduce how much phosphate \n\ngets absorbed into their blood. \n• antibiotics – used to treat bacterial infections  \n• isavuconazole – used to treat fungal infections \n• telmisartan – used to treat high blood pressure \n \nVaccines \nIf you need to have a vaccine (a live vaccine) while taking CellCept, talk to your doctor or pharmacist \nfirst. Your doctor will have to advise you on what vaccines you can have. \n \nYou must not donate blood during treatment with CellCept and for at least 6 weeks after stopping \ntreatment. Men must not donate semen during treatment with CellCept and for at least 90 days after \nstopping treatment. \n \nCellCept with food and drink \nTaking food and drink has no effect on your treatment with CellCept. \n \n\n\n\n132 \n\nPregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding \n \nContraception in women taking CellCept \nIf you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use an effective method of contraception \nwith CellCept. This includes: \n• Before you start taking CellCept \n• During your entire treatment with CellCept  \n• For 6 weeks after you stop taking CellCept. \nTalk to your doctor about the most suitable contraception for you. This will depend on your individual \nsituation. Two forms of contraception are preferable as this will reduce the risk of unintended \npregnancy. Contact your doctor as soon as possible, if you think your contraception may not \nhave been effective or if you have forgotten to take your contraceptive pill. \n \nYou are a woman who is not capable of becoming pregnant if any of the following applies to you: \n• You are post-menopausal, i.e. at least 50 years old and your last period was more than a year \n\nago (if your periods have stopped because you have had treatment for cancer, then there is still a \nchance you could become pregnant) \n\n• Your fallopian tubes and both ovaries have been removed by surgery (bilateral                            \nsalpingo-oophorectomy) \n\n• Your womb (uterus) has been removed by surgery (hysterectomy) \n• Your ovaries no longer work (premature ovarian failure, which has been confirmed by a \n\nspecialist gynaecologist) \n• You were born with one of the following rare conditions that make pregnancy impossible: the \n\nXY genotype, Turner’s syndrome or uterine agenesis \n• You are a child or teenager who has not started having periods. \n \nContraception in men taking CellCept \nThe available evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage if the \nfather takes mycophenolate. However, a risk cannot be completely excluded. As a precaution you or \nyour female partner are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment and for 90 days \nafter you stop taking CellCept.  \n \nIf you are planning to have a child, talk to your doctor about the potential risks and alternative \ntherapies. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will talk to you about \nthe risks in case of pregnancy and the alternatives you can take to prevent rejection of your transplant \norgan if: \n• You plan to become pregnant. \n• You miss or think you have missed a period, or you have unusual menstrual bleeding, or suspect \n\nyou are pregnant. \n• You have sex without using an effective method of contraception. \nIf you do become pregnant during the treatment with mycophenolate, you must inform your doctor \nimmediately. However, keep taking CellCept until you see him or her. \n \nPregnancy \nMycophenolate causes a very high frequency of miscarriage (50%) and of severe birth defects (23 - \n27 %) in the unborn baby. Birth defects which have been reported include anomalies of ears, of eyes, \nof face (cleft lip/palate), of development of fingers, of heart, oesophagus (tube that connects the throat \nwith the stomach), kidneys and nervous system (for example spina bifida (where the bones of the \nspine are not properly developed). Your baby may be affected by one or more of these. \n \nIf you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must provide a negative pregnancy test before \nstarting treatment and must follow the contraception advice given to you by your doctor. Your doctor \nmay request more than one test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment. \n\n\n\n133 \n\n \nBreast-feeding \nDo not take CellCept if you are breast-feeding. This is because small amounts of the medicine can \npass into the mother’s milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nCellCept has a moderate influence on your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If you feel \ndrowsy, numb or confused, talk to your doctor or nurse and do not drive or use any tools or machines \nuntil you feel better. \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to take CellCept \n \nAlways take CellCept exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nHow much to take \nThe amount you take depends on the type of transplant you have had. The usual doses are shown \nbelow. Treatment will continue for as long as you need to prevent you from rejecting your transplant \norgan. \n \nKidney transplant \nAdults \n• The first dose is given within 3 days of the transplant operation. \n• The daily dose is 4 tablets (2 g of the medicine) taken as 2 separate doses.  \n• Take 2 tablets in the morning and then 2 tablets in the evening. \n\nChildren (aged 2 to 18 years) \n• The dose given will vary depending on the size of the child.  \n• Your doctor will decide the most appropriate dose based on your child’s height and weight \n\n(body surface area – measured as square metres or “m2”). The recommended dose is 600 mg/m2 \ntaken twice a day. \n\n \nHeart transplant \nAdults \n• The first dose is given within 5 days of the transplant operation. \n• The daily dose is 6 tablets (3 g of the medicine) taken as 2 separate doses.  \n• Take 3 tablets in the morning and then 3 tablets in the evening. \nChildren \n• There is no information for the use of CellCept in children with a heart transplant. \n \nLiver transplant \nAdults \n• The first dose of oral CellCept will be given to you at least 4 days after the transplant \n\noperation and when you are able to swallow oral medicines. \n• The daily dose is 6 tablets (3 g of the medicine) taken as 2 separate doses.  \n• Take 3 tablets in the morning and then 3 tablets in the evening.  \nChildren \n• There is no information for the use of CellCept in children with a liver transplant. \n \nTaking the medicine \n• Swallow your tablets whole with a glass of water. \n• Do not break or crush them. \n \n\n\n\n134 \n\nIf you take more CellCept than you should \nIf you take more CellCept than you should, talk to a doctor or go to a hospital straight away. Also do \nthis if someone else accidentally takes your medicine. Take the medicine pack with you. \n \nIf you forget to take CellCept \nIf you forget to take your medicine at any time, take it as soon as you remember. Then continue to take \nit at the usual times. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. \n \nIf you stop taking CellCept \nDo not stop taking CellCept unless your doctor tells you to. If you stop your treatment you may \nincrease the chance of rejection of your transplanted organ.  \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, CellCept can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nTalk to a doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects – you \nmay need urgent medical treatment: \n• you have a sign of infection such as a fever or sore throat \n• you have any unexpected bruising or bleeding \n• you have a rash, swelling of your face, lips, tongue or throat, with difficulty breathing - you may \n\nbe having a serious allergic reaction to the medicine (such as anaphylaxis, angioeodema). \n \nUsual problems \nSome of the more usual problems are diarrhoea, fewer white cells or red cells in your blood, infection \nand vomiting. Your doctor will do regular blood tests to check for any changes in: \n• the number of your blood cells or signs of infections. \n \nChildren may be more likely than adults to have some side effects. These include diarrhoea, infections, \nfewer white cells and fewer red cells in the blood. \n \nFighting infections \nCellCept reduces your body’s defences. This is to stop you rejecting your transplant. As a result, your \nbody will not be as good as normal at fighting infections. This means you may catch more infections \nthan usual. This includes infections of the brain, skin, mouth, stomach and gut, lungs and urinary \nsystem.  \n \nLymph and skin cancer \nAs can happen in patients taking this type of medicine (immune-suppressants), a very small number of \nCellCept patients have developed cancer of the lymphoid tissues and skin.  \n \nGeneral unwanted effects \nYou may get general side effects affecting your body as a whole. These include serious allergic \nreactions (such as anaphylaxis, angioeodema), fever, feeling very tired, difficulty sleeping, pains (such \nas stomach, chest, joint or muscle), headache, flu symptoms and swelling.  \n \nOther unwanted effects may include: \nSkin problems such as:  \n• acne, cold sores, shingles, skin growth hair loss, rash, itching. \n \nUrinary problems such as:  \n• blood in the urine. \n \n\n\n\n135 \n\nDigestive system and mouth problems such as:  \n• swelling of the gums and mouth ulcers, \n• inflammation of the pancreas, colon or stomach,  \n• gastrointestinal disorders including bleeding, \n• liver disorders  \n• diarrhea, constipation, feeling sick (nausea), indigestion, loss of appetite, flatulence. \n \nNervous system problems such as:  \n• feeling dizzy, drowsy or numb,  \n• tremor, muscle spasms, convulsions,  \n• feeling anxious or depressed, changes in your mood or thoughts. \n \nHeart and blood vessel problems such as: \n• change in blood pressure, accelerated heartbeat, widening of blood vessels. \n \nLung problems such as:  \n• pneumonia, bronchitis,  \n• shortness of breath, cough, which can be due to bronchiectasis (a condition in which the lung \n\nairways are abnormally dilated) or pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the lung). Talk to your doctor \nif you develop a persistent cough or breathlessness,fluid on the lungs or inside the chest, \n\n• sinus problems. \n \nOther problems such as:  \n• weight loss, gout, high blood sugar, bleeding, bruising.  \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine. \n \n \n5.
