This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nMysimba 8 mg/90 mg prolonged-release tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 8 mg naltrexone hydrochloride, equivalent to 7.2 mg of naltrexone, and 90 mg \nbupropion hydrochloride, equivalent to 78 mg of bupropion. \n \nExcipient with known effect: \nEach prolonged-release tablet contains 73.2 mg of lactose (see section 4.4). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nProlonged-release tablet. \n \nBlue, biconvex, round tablet of 12-12.2 mm diameter debossed with “NB-890” on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMysimba is indicated, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, for the \nmanagement of weight in adult patients (≥18 years) with an initial Body Mass Index (BMI) of \n• ≥ 30 kg/m2 (obese), or \n• ≥ 27 kg/m2 to < 30 kg/m2 (overweight) in the presence of one or more weight-related \n\nco-morbidities (e.g., type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia, or controlled hypertension) \n \nTreatment with Mysimba should be discontinued after 16 weeks if patients have not lost at least 5% \nof their initial body weight (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nUpon initiating treatment, the dose should be escalated over a 4-week period as follows: \n \n• Week 1: One tablet in the morning \n• Week 2: One tablet in the morning and one tablet in the evening \n• Week 3: Two tablets in the morning and one tablet in the evening \n• Week 4 and onwards: Two tablets in the morning and two tablets in the evening \n \nThe maximum recommended daily dose of Mysimba is two tablets taken twice daily for a total dose \nof 32 mg naltrexone hydrochloride and 360 mg bupropion hydrochloride.  \nThe need for continued treatment should be evaluated after 16 weeks (see section 4.1) and re-\nevaluated annually. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nMissed dose  \nIf a dose is missed, patients should not take an additional dose, but take the prescribed next dose at \nthe usual time.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients (over 65 years) \nNaltrexone/bupropion should be used with caution in patients over 65 years of age and is not \nrecommended in patients over 75 years of age (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2). \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nNaltrexone/bupropion is contraindicated in patients with end-stage renal failure (see section 4.3). In \npatients with moderate or severe renal impairment, the maximum recommended daily dose for \nnaltrexone/bupropion is two tablets (one tablet in the morning and one tablet in the evening) (see \nsections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2). It is recommended that patients with moderate or severe renal impairment \ninitiate treatment with one tablet in the morning for the first week of treatment, and escalate to one \ntablet in the morning and one tablet in the evening from week 2 onwards. Dose reduction is not \nnecessary in patients with mild renal impairment. For individuals who are at elevated risk for renal \nimpairment, in particular patients with diabetes or elderly individuals, estimated glomerular filtration \nrate (eGFR) should be assessed prior to initiating therapy with naltrexone/bupropion. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nNaltrexone/bupropion is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \nNaltrexone/bupropion is not recommended in patients with  moderate hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2). In patients with mild hepatic impairment, the maximum recommended daily \ndose for naltrexone/bupropion is two tablets (one tablet in the morning and one tablet in the evening) \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). It is recommended that patients with mild hepatic impairment initiate \ntreatment with one tablet in the morning for the first week of treatment, and escalate to one tablet in \nthe morning and one tablet in the evening from week 2 onwards. Degree of hepatic impairment \nshould be assessed using the Child-Pugh score. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of naltrexone/bupropion in children and adolescents below 18 have not yet \nbeen established. Therefore, naltrexone/bupropion should not be used in children and adolescents \nbelow 18. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nOral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some water. The tablets should preferably be \ntaken with food (see section 5.2). The tablets should not be cut, chewed, or crushed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n• Patients with uncontrolled hypertension (see section 4.4) \n• Patients with a current seizure disorder or a history of seizures (see section 4.4) \n• Patients with a known central nervous system tumour \n• Patients undergoing acute alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal \n• Patients with a history of bipolar disorder \n• Patients receiving any concomitant treatment containing bupropion or naltrexone \n• Patients with a current or previous diagnosis of bulimia or anorexia nervosa \n• Patients currently dependent on chronic opioids (see sections 4.4 and 4.5) or opiate agonists \n\n(e.g., methadone), or patients in acute opiate withdrawal  \n• Patients receiving concomitant administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI). At \n\nleast 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of MAOI and initiation of treatment with \nnaltrexone/bupropion (see section 4.5) \n\n\n\n4 \n\n• Patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2) \n• Patients with end-stage renal failure (see sections 4.2 and 5.2) \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe safety and tolerability of naltrexone/bupropion should be assessed at regular intervals.  \n \nThe treatment should be discontinued if there are concerns with the safety or tolerability of ongoing \ntreatment, including concerns about increased blood pressure (see section 4.8). \n \nSuicide and suicidal behaviour \n \nNaltrexone/bupropion contains bupropion. Bupropion is indicated for the treatment of depression in \nsome countries. A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled clinical trials of antidepressants in adult \nsubjects with psychiatric disorders showed an increased risk of suicidal behaviour with \nantidepressants compared to placebo in subjects less than 25 years old.  \n \nAlthough in placebo-controlled clinical trials with naltrexone/bupropion for the treatment of obesity \nin adult subjects, no suicides or suicide attempts were reported in studies up to 56 weeks duration \nwith naltrexone/bupropion, suicidality events (including suicidal ideation) have been reported in \nsubjects of all ages treated with naltrexone/bupropion post-marketing.  \n \nClose supervision of patients, particularly those at high risk, should accompany therapy with \nnaltrexone/bupropion especially in early treatment and following dose changes. Patients (and \ncaregivers of patients) should be alerted about the need to monitor for any clinical worsening, \nsuicidal behaviour or thoughts and unusual changes in behaviour and to seek medical advice \nimmediately if these symptoms present. \n \nSeizures \n \nBupropion is associated with a dose-related risk of seizures, with bupropion sustained release (SR) \n300 mg yielding an estimated seizure incidence of 0.1%. Plasma concentrations of bupropion and \nmetabolites of bupropion following single-dose administration of 180 mg of bupropion as \nnaltrexone/bupropion tablets are comparable to concentrations observed after single-dose \nadministration of bupropion SR 150 mg; however, no study has been conducted that determined the \nconcentrations of bupropion and metabolites of bupropion after repeated dosing of \nnaltrexone/bupropion tablets compared to bupropion SR tablets. As it is unknown whether the risk \nfor seizure with bupropion is related to bupropion or a metabolite of bupropion, and there are no data \ndemonstrating comparability of plasma concentrations with repeated dosing, there is uncertainty \nwhether repeated-dose administration naltrexone/bupropion may be associated with a similar rate of \nseizures as bupropion SR 300 mg. The incidence of seizure in subjects receiving \nnaltrexone/bupropion in clinical trials was approximately 0.06% (2/3,239 subjects) vs. 0.0% \n(0/1,515 subjects) on placebo. This incidence of seizure, along with incidence of seizure in subjects \nwho received naltrexone/bupropion in a large cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT), was no higher \nthan the seizure rate with bupropion as a single agent at approved doses. \n \nThe risk of seizures is also related to patient factors, clinical situations, and concomitant medicinal \nproducts, which must be considered in the selection of patients treated with naltrexone/bupropion. \nNaltrexone/bupropion should be discontinued and not restarted in patients who experience a seizure \nwhile being treated with the medicinal product. Caution should be used when prescribing \nnaltrexone/bupropion to patients with predisposing factors that may increase the risk of seizure \nincluding: \n• history of head trauma \n• excessive use of alcohol or addiction to cocaine or stimulants \n• as treatment with naltrexone/bupropion may result in lowered glucose in patients with \n\ndiabetes, the dose of insulin and/or oral diabetic medicinal products should be assessed to \nminimise the risk of hypoglycaemia, which could predispose patients to seizure \n\n\n\n5 \n\n• concomitant administration of medicinal products that may lower the seizure threshold, \nincluding antipsychotics, antidepressants, antimalarials, tramadol, theophylline, systemic \nsteroids, quinolones and sedating antihistamines  \n\n \nThe consumption of alcohol during naltrexone/bupropion treatment should be minimised or avoided. \n \nPatients receiving opioid analgesics \n \nNaltrexone/bupropion must not be administered to patients receiving chronic opiate therapy (see \nsection 4.3). If chronic opiate therapy is required, naltrexone/bupropion treatment must be stopped. \nIn patients requiring intermittent opiate treatment, naltrexone/bupropion therapy should be \ntemporarily discontinued and opiate dose should not be increased above the standard dose. During \nnaltrexone/bupropion clinical studies, the use of concomitant opioid or opioid-like medicinal \nproducts, including analgesics or antitussives were excluded.  However, approximately 12% of \nsubjects took a concomitant opioid or opioid-like medicinal product while enrolled in the \nnaltrexone/bupropion clinical studies, the majority of whom continued study treatment without \ninterruption of naltrexone/bupropion dose, without untoward consequences. \n \nAttempt to overcome blockade \n \nThe attempt to overcome any naltrexone opioid blockade by administering large amounts of \nexogenous opioids is very dangerous and may lead to a fatal overdose or life endangering opioid \nintoxication (e.g., respiratory arrest, circulatory collapse). Patients should be aware that they may be \nmore sensitive to lower doses of opioids after naltrexone/bupropion treatment is discontinued.  \n \nAllergic reactions \n \nAnaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions characterised by symptoms such as pruritus, urticaria, \nangioedema, and dyspnoea requiring medical treatment have been reported in clinical trials with \nbupropion. In addition, there have been rare spontaneous postmarketing reports of erythema \nmultiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and anaphylactic shock associated with bupropion. A patient \nshould stop taking naltrexone/bupropion and consult a doctor if experiencing allergic or \nanaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions (e.g., skin rash, pruritus, hives, chest pain, oedema, and \nshortness of breath) during treatment. \n \nArthralgia, myalgia, and fever with rash and other symptoms suggestive of delayed hypersensitivity \nhave been reported in association with bupropion. These symptoms may resemble serum sickness. \nPatients should be advised to notify their prescribing physician if they experience these symptoms. If \nserum sickness is suspected, naltrexone/bupropion should be discontinued.  \n \nElevation of blood pressure \n \nEarly, transient mean increases from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of up to \n1 mmHg were observed in naltrexone/bupropion Phase 3 clinical trials. In a cardiovascular outcomes \ntrial (CVOT) of patients at increased risk of a cardiovascular event, mean increases from baseline in \nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure of approximately 1 mmHg compared to placebo were also \nobserved. In clinical practice with other bupropion containing products, hypertension, in some cases \nsevere and requiring acute treatment, has been reported.   \n \nBlood pressure and pulse should be measured prior to initiation of therapy with naltrexone/bupropion \nand should be assessed at regular intervals consistent with usual clinical practice. If patients \nexperience clinically relevant and sustained increases in blood pressure or pulse rate as a result of \nnaltrexone/bupropion treatment, it should be discontinued. \n \nNaltrexone/bupropion should be given with caution to those patients with controlled hypertension \nand must not be given to patients with uncontrolled hypertension (see section 4.3). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nCardiovascular disease \n \nThere is no clinical experience establishing the safety of naltrexone/bupropion in patients with a \nrecent history of myocardial infarction, unstable heart disease or NYHA class III or IV congestive \nheart failure. Naltrexone/bupropion should be used with caution in patients with active coronary \nartery disease (e.g., ongoing angina or recent history of myocardial infarction) or history of \ncerebrovascular disease. \n \nHepatotoxicity \n \nIn naltrexone/bupropion completed clinical studies, where naltrexone hydrochloride daily doses \nranged from 16 mg to 48 mg, drug-induced liver injury (DILI) was reported. There have also been \ncases of elevated liver enzymes from post-marketing reporting. A patient with suspected DILI should \nstop taking naltrexone/bupropion. \n \nElderly patients \n \nClinical studies of naltrexone/bupropion did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and \nover to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Elderly patients may be \nmore sensitive to the central nervous system adverse reactions of naltrexone/bupropion. Naltrexone \nand bupropion are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions \nto naltrexone/bupropion may be greater in patients with impaired renal function, a condition that is \nmore common in elderly individuals. Due to these reasons, naltrexone/bupropion should be used with \ncaution in patients over 65 years of age and is not recommended in patients over 75 years of age. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNaltrexone/bupropion has not been extensively evaluated in subjects with renal insufficiency. \nNaltrexone/bupropion is contraindicated in patients with end-stage renal failure. In patients with \nmoderate or severe renal impairment, the maximum recommended daily dose for \nnaltrexone/bupropion should be reduced, as these patients may have higher drug concentrations \nwhich could result in an increase in adverse drug reactions (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2). For \nindividuals who are at elevated risk for renal impairment, in particular, individuals with diabetes or \nelderly individuals, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) should be assessed prior to initiating \ntherapy with naltrexone/bupropion. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNaltrexone/bupropion has not been extensively evaluated in subjects with hepatic impairment. \nNaltrexone/bupropion is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment, and not \nrecommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3, and 5.2). In \npatients with mild hepatic impairment, the maximum recommended daily dose for \nnaltrexone/bupropion should be reduced, as these patients may have higher drug concentrations \nwhich could result in an increase in adverse drug reactions. (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nNeuropsychiatric symptoms and activation of mania \n \nActivation of mania and hypomania have been reported in patients with mood disorders who were \ntreated with other similar medicinal products for major depressive disorder. No activation of mania \nor hypomania was reported in the clinical trials evaluating effects of naltrexone/bupropion in obese \nsubjects, which excluded subjects receiving antidepressants. Naltrexone/bupropion should be used \ncautiously in patients with a history of mania. \n \nData in animals suggest a potential for abuse of bupropion. However, studies on abuse liability in \nhumans and extensive clinical experience show that bupropion has low abuse potential. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nInfluence on the ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe use of naltrexone/bupropion has been associated with somnolence and episodes of loss of \nconsciousness, sometimes caused by seizure. Patients must be advised to exercise caution while \ndriving or operating machines during treatment with naltrexone/bupropion, especially at the \nbeginning of the treatment or during the titration phase. Patients who experience dizziness, \nsomnolence, loss of consciousness or seizure should be advised to avoid driving or operating \nmachines until these adverse effects have resolved. Alternatively, treatment cessation might be \nconsidered (see sections 4.7 and 4.8). \n \nLactose \n \nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) \n \nSince monoamine oxidase A and B inhibitors also enhance the catecholaminergic pathways, by a \ndifferent mechanism from bupropion, naltrexone/bupropion must not be used with MAOI (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nOpioid analgesics \n \nNaltrexone/bupropion is contraindicated in patients currently dependent on chronic opioid or opiate \nagonist therapy (e.g., methadone), or patients in acute opiate withdrawal (see section 4.3). Due to the \nantagonistic effect of naltrexone at the opioid receptor, patients taking naltrexone/bupropion may not \nfully benefit from treatment with opioid-containing medicinal products, such as cough and cold \nremedies, antidiarrhoeal preparations and opioid analgesics. In patients requiring intermittent opiate \ntreatment, naltrexone/bupropion therapy should be temporarily discontinued and opiate dose should \nnot be increased above the standard dose (see section 4.4). If chronic opiate therapy is required, \nnaltrexone/bupropion treatment must be stopped. Naltrexone/bupropion may be used with caution \nafter chronic opioid use has been stopped for 7 to 10 days in order to prevent precipitation of \nwithdrawal. \n \nDrugs metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes \n \nBupropion is metabolised to its major active metabolite hydroxybupropion primarily by the \ncytochrome P450 CYP2B6; thus, the potential exists for interaction when administered with \nmedicinal products that induce or inhibit CYP2B6. Although not metabolised by the CYP2D6 \nisoenzyme, bupropion and its main metabolite, hydroxybupropion, inhibit the CYP2D6 pathway and \nthe potential exists to affect medicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6. \n \nCYP2D6 substrates \nIn a clinical study, naltrexone/bupropion (32 mg naltrexone hydrochloride /360 mg bupropion \nhydrochloride daily) was co-administered with a 50 mg dose of metoprolol (a CYP2D6 substrate). \nNaltrexone/bupropion increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, \nrespectively, relative to metoprolol alone. Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased \npharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single \nmedicinal product with desipramine and venlafaxine. \n \nCo-administration of bupropion with drugs that are metabolised by CYP2D6 isozyme including \ncertain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclic antidepressants, e.g. desipramine, imipramine, \nparoxetine), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., \nmetoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached \nwith caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medicinal \n\n\n\n8 \n\nproduct. Although citalopram is not primarily metabolised by CYP2D6, in one study, bupropion \nincreased the Cmax and AUC of citalopram by 30% and 40%, respectively. Drugs which require \nmetabolic activation by CYP2D6 in order to be effective (e.g., tamoxifen), may have reduced \nefficacy when administered concomitantly with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as bupropion. If \nnaltrexone/bupropion is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug \nmetabolised by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medicinal product should be \nconsidered, particularly for those concomitant medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index. \nWhen feasible, the option of therapeutic drug monitoring should be considered for medicinal \nproducts with a narrow therapeutic index, such as tricyclic antidepressants. \n \nCYP2B6 inducers, inhibitors and substrates  \nBupropion is metabolised to its major active metabolite hydroxybupropion primarily by the CYP2B6 \nisozyme. The potential exists for a drug interaction between naltrexone/bupropion and drugs that \ninduce or are substrates of the CYP2B6 isozyme.  \n \nSince bupropion is extensively metabolised, caution is advised when naltrexone/bupropion is \nco-administered with medicinal products known to induce CYP2B6 (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, \nritonavir, efavirenz) as these may affect the clinical efficacy of naltrexone/bupropion. In a series of \nstudies in healthy volunteers, ritonavir (100 mg twice daily or 600 mg twice daily) or ritonavir \n100 mg plus lopinavir 400 mg twice daily reduced the exposure of bupropion and its major \nmetabolites in a dose dependent manner by 20 to 80%. Similarly, efavirenz 600 mg once daily for \ntwo weeks reduced the exposure of bupropion by approximately 55% in healthy volunteers. \n \nCo-administration of medicinal products that may inhibit the metabolism of bupropion via CYP2B6 \nisoenzyme (e.g., CYP2B6 substrates: cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and CYP2B6 inhibitors: \norphenadrine, ticlopidine, clopidogrel), may result in increased bupropion plasma levels and lower \nlevels of active metabolite hydroxybupropion. The clinical consequences of the inhibition of the \nmetabolism of bupropion via CYP2B6 enzyme and the consequent changes in the \nbupropion-hydroxybupropion ratio are currently unknown, but could potentially lead to reduced \nefficacy of naltrexone/bupropion. \n \nOCT2 substrates \n \nBupropion and its metabolites competitively inhibit the OCT2 in the basolateral membrane of the \nrenal tubule responsible for creatinine secretion, in a manner similar to the OCT2 substrate \ncimetidine. Therefore, mild increases in creatinine observed after long-term treatment with \nnaltrexone/bupropion are likely due to inhibition of OCT2 and not indicative of changes in creatinine \nclearance. Use of naltrexone/bupropion with other OCT2 substrates (e.g., metformin) in clinical trials \ndid not indicate the need for dose adjustment or other precautions. \n \nOther interactions \n \nAlthough clinical data do not identify a pharmacokinetic interaction between bupropion and alcohol, \nthere have been rare reports of adverse neuropsychiatric events or reduced alcohol tolerance in \npatients drinking alcohol during bupropion treatment. There are no known pharmacokinetic \ninteractions between naltrexone and alcohol.  The consumption of alcohol during \nnaltrexone/bupropion treatment should be minimised or avoided.  \n \nCaution should be used when prescribing naltrexone/bupropion to patients with predisposing factors \nthat may increase the risk of seizure including: \n• as treatment with naltrexone/bupropion may result in lowered glucose in patients with \n\ndiabetes, the dose of insulin and/or oral diabetic medicinal products should be assessed to \nminimise the risk of hypoglycaemia, which could predispose patients to seizure \n\n• concomitant administration of medicinal products that may lower the seizure threshold, \nincluding antipsychotics, antidepressants, antimalarials, tramadol, theophylline, systemic \nsteroids, quinolones and sedating antihistamines  \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nNaltrexone/bupropion is contraindicated in patients receiving concomitant treatment with \nmonoamine oxidase inhibitors, bupropion or naltrexone, patients undergoing  acute alcohol or \nbenzodiazepine withdrawal, patients currently dependent on chronic opioids, or opiate agonists (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nAdministration of naltrexone/bupropion to patients receiving either levodopa or amantadine \nconcurrently should be undertaken with caution. Limited clinical data suggest a higher incidence of \nadverse reactions (e.g., nausea, vomiting, and neuropsychiatric adverse reactions – see section 4.8) in \npatients receiving bupropion concurrently with either levodopa or amantadine. \n \nAdministration of naltrexone/bupropion with inhibitors or inducers of UGT 1A2 and 2B7 should be \nundertaken with caution as these may alter the exposure of naltrexone. \n \nNaltrexone/bupropion has not been studied in conjunction with alpha-adrenergic blockers or \nclonidine. \n \nSince bupropion is extensively metabolised, caution is advised when naltrexone/bupropion is \nco-administered with medicinal products known to inhibit metabolism (e.g. valproate), as these may \naffect its clinical efficacy and safety. \n \nNaltrexone/bupropion should preferably be taken with food, as it is known that both naltrexone and \nbupropion plasma concentrations are increased with food and the safety and efficacy data from \nclinical trials is based on dosing with food. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amounts of data from the use of naltrexone/bupropion in pregnant women. \nThe combination has not been tested in reproductive toxicity studies. Studies with naltrexone in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3); animal studies with bupropion show no \nclear evidence of reproductive harm. The potential risk for humans is unknown.  \n \nNaltrexone/bupropion should not be used during pregnancy or in women currently attempting to \nbecome pregnant. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nNaltrexone and bupropion and their metabolites are excreted in human milk.   \n \nSince there is limited information on the systemic exposure to naltrexone and bupropion in \ninfants/newborns being breast-fed, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. \nNaltrexone/bupropion should not be used during breast-feeding.  \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on fertility from the combined use of naltrexone and bupropion. No effect on \nfertility in reproductive toxicity studies have been observed with bupropion. Naltrexone administered \norally to rats caused a significant increase in pseudopregnancy and a decrease in pregnancy rates at \napproximately 30 times the naltrexone dose provided by naltrexone/bupropion. The relevance of \nthese observations to human fertility is not known (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNaltrexone/bupropion has influence on the ability to drive and use machines. When driving vehicles \nor using machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness, somnolence, loss of consciousness \nand seizure may occur during treatment. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nPatients should be cautioned about driving or operating hazardous machinery in case \nnaltrexone/bupropion may affect their ability to engage in such activities (see sections 4.4 and 4.8) \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn clinical studies, 23.8% of subjects receiving naltrexone/bupropion and 11.9% of subjects receiving \nplacebo discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction. The most frequent adverse reactions for \nnaltrexone/bupropion are nausea (very common), constipation (very common), vomiting (very \ncommon), dizziness (common), and dry mouth (common). The most frequent adverse reactions \nleading to discontinuation with naltrexone/bupropion were nausea (very common), headache (very \ncommon), dizziness (common) and vomiting (very common). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe safety profile of naltrexone/bupropion (NB) summarised in Table 1 below is based on clinical \nstudies performed with the fixed-dose combination (adverse reactions at an incidence of at least 0.1% \nand twice that of placebo). The list of terms in Table 2 provides information on the adverse reactions \nof the individual components naltrexone (N) and bupropion (B) identified in their respective \napproved SmPCs for different indications.   \n \nThe frequencies of adverse reactions are ranked according to the following: very common (≥1/10), \ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000, <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nTable 1.

The most common type of seizures is \n\ngeneralised tonic-clonic seizures, a seizure type which can result in some cases in post-ictal confusion or \nmemory impairment (see section 4.4). \n\n*** Toothache and dental caries, while not meeting the criteria for inclusion in this table, are listed based on \nthe subset of patients with dry mouth, in which a higher incidence of toothache and dental caries was \nobserved in subjects treated with NB versus placebo. \n\n \nAs NB is a fixed combination of two active ingredients, in addition to the terms listed in Table 1, \nadditional adverse reactions seen with one of the active substances may potentially occur. The \nadditional undesirable effects occurring with either of the individual components (bupropion or \nnaltrexone) when used for non-obesity indications are summarized in Table 2. \n \nTable 2.

Among the group of subjects treated with naltrexone/bupropion, both cases of \nseizures were considered as serious and led to treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4). There were \nno cases of seizures in the placebo group. \n \nGastrointestinal adverse reactions  \nThe vast majority of subjects treated with naltrexone/bupropion who experienced nausea reported the \nevent within 4 weeks of starting treatment. Events were generally self-limited; the majority of events \nresolved within 4 weeks and almost all resolved by week 24. Similarly, the majority of events of \nconstipation in subjects treated with naltrexone/bupropion were reported during the dose escalation \nphase. The time to resolution of constipation was similar between subjects treated with \nnaltrexone/bupropion and subjects treated with placebo. Approximately half of the subjects treated \nwith naltrexone/bupropion who experienced vomiting first reported the event during the dose \nescalation phase. Time to resolution for vomiting was typically rapid (within one week) and almost \nall events resolved within 4 weeks. The incidence of these common gastrointestinal adverse reactions \nin naltrexone/bupropion versus placebo was as follows: nausea (31.8% vs. 6.7%), constipation \n(18.1% vs. 7.2%), and vomiting (9.9% vs. 2.9%). The incidence of severe nausea, severe \nconstipation, and severe vomiting was low, but was higher in subjects treated with \nnaltrexone/bupropion compared to subjects treated with placebo (severe nausea: \nnaltrexone/bupropion (1.9%), placebo (<0.1%); severe constipation: naltrexone/bupropion (0.6%), \nplacebo (0.1%); severe vomiting: naltrexone/bupropion (0.7%), placebo (0.3%)). No events of \nnausea, constipation, or vomiting were considered serious. \n \nOther frequent adverse reactions  \nThe majority of subjects treated with naltrexone/bupropion who reported dizziness, headache, \ninsomnia, or dry mouth, first reported these events during the dose escalation phase. Dry mouth may \nbe associated with toothache and dental caries; in the subset of patients with dry mouth, a higher \nincidence of toothache and dental caries were observed in subjects treated with naltrexone/bupropion \ncompared to subjects treated with placebo. The incidence of severe headache, severe dizziness, and \nsevere insomnia was low, but was higher in subjects treated with naltrexone/bupropion compared to \nsubjects treated with placebo (severe headache: naltrexone/bupropion (1.1%), placebo (0.3%); severe \ndizziness: naltrexone/bupropion (0.6%), placebo (0.2%); severe insomnia: naltrexone/bupropion \n(0.4%), placebo (<0.1%)). No events of dizziness, dry mouth, headache, or insomnia in subjects \ntreated with naltrexone/bupropion were considered serious. \n \nElderly patients \nElderly patients may be more sensitive to some of the central nervous system-related adverse \nreactions of naltrexone/bupropion (primarily dizziness and tremor). There is an increased incidence \nof gastrointestinal disorders with higher age categories. Common events leading to withdrawal \namong elderly were nausea, vomiting, dizziness, constipation. \n \nType 2 diabetes \nPatients with type 2 diabetes treated with naltrexone/bupropion demonstrated a higher incidence of \ngastrointestinal adverse reactions, primarily nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, than subjects without \n\n\n\n15 \n\ndiabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes may be more prone to these events due to concomitant \nmedicinal product use (e.g., metformin) or may be more likely to have underlying gastrointestinal \ndisorders (e.g., gastroparesis) predisposing to gastrointestinal symptoms. \n \nRenal impairment \nPatients with moderate renal impairment had a higher incidence of gastrointestinal and central \nnervous system-related adverse reactions, thus these patients generally had lower tolerability of \nnaltrexone/bupropion at a total daily dose of 32 mg naltrexone hydrochloride/360 mg bupropion \nhydrochloride, which is thought to be due to higher plasma concentrations of active metabolites. The \ntypes of tolerability events were similar to the events observed in patients with normal renal function \n(see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.2).  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nHuman overdose experience \n \nThere is no clinical experience with overdose with combined use of bupropion and naltrexone. The \nmaximum daily dose of combined use of bupropion and naltrexone administered in clinical trials \ncontained 50 mg naltrexone hydrochloride and 400 mg bupropion hydrochloride. The most serious \nclinical implications of combined use of bupropion and naltrexone overdose are likely related to \nbupropion.   \n \nBupropion \nAcute ingestion of doses in excess of 10 times the maximum therapeutic dose of bupropion \n(equivalent to approximately in excess of 8 times the recommended daily dose of \nnaltrexone/bupropion) has been reported. Seizure was reported in approximately one third of these \noverdose cases. Other serious reactions reported with overdoses of bupropion alone included \nhallucinations, loss of consciousness, sinus tachycardia, and ECG changes such as conduction \ndisturbances (including QRS prolongation) or arrhythmias. Fever, muscle rigidity, rhabdomyolysis, \nhypotension, stupor, coma, and respiratory failure have been reported mainly when bupropion was \npart of multiple drug overdoses. \n \nAlthough most subjects recovered without sequelae, deaths associated with overdoses of bupropion \nalone have been reported in subjects ingesting large doses of the drug.  \n \nNaltrexone \nThere is limited experience with overdose of naltrexone monotherapy in humans. In one study, \nsubjects received 800 mg naltrexone hydrochloride daily (equivalent to 25 times the recommended \ndaily dose of naltrexone/bupropion) for up to one week showing no evidence of toxicity. \n \nOverdose management \n \nAn adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation should be ensured. Cardiac rhythm and vital signs \nshould be monitored.  EEG monitoring is also recommended for the first 48 hours post-ingestion. \nGeneral supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of emesis is not \nrecommended.   \n \nActivated charcoal should be administered. There is no experience with the use of forced diuresis, \ndialysis, hemoperfusion, or exchange transfusion in the management of combined use of bupropion \n\n\n\n16 \n\nand naltrexone overdoses. No specific antidotes for combined use of bupropion and naltrexone are \nknown. \n \nDue to the dose-related risk of seizures with bupropion, hospitalisation following suspected overdose \nwith naltrexone/bupropion should be considered. Based on studies in animals, it is recommended that \nseizures be treated with intravenous benzodiazepine administration and other supportive measures, as \nappropriate. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiobesity preparations excluding diet products, centrally acting \nantiobesity products, ATC code: A08AA62. \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \n \nThe exact neurochemical appetite suppressant effects of naltrexone/bupropion are not fully \nunderstood. The medicinal product has two components: naltrexone, a mu-opioid antagonist, and \nbupropion, a weak inhibitor of neuronal dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake. These components \naffect two principal areas of the brain, specifically the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the \nmesolimbic dopaminergic reward system. \n \nIn the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, bupropion stimulates pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) \nneurons that release alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), which in turn binds to and \nstimulates melanocortin 4 receptors (MC4-R). When α-MSH is released, POMC neurons \nsimultaneously release β-endorphin, an endogenous agonist of the mu-opioid receptors. Binding of \nβ-endorphin to mu-opioid receptors on POMC neurons mediates a negative feedback loop on POMC \nneurons leading to a decrease in the release of α-MSH. Blocking this inhibitory feedback loop with \nnaltrexone is proposed to facilitate a more potent and longer-lasting activation of POMC neurons, \nthereby amplifying the effects of bupropion on energy balance. Preclinical data suggests that \nnaltrexone and bupropion may have greater than additive effects in this region to reduce food intake \nwhen administered together. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety  \n \nThe effects of naltrexone/bupropion on weight loss, weight maintenance, waist circumference, body \ncomposition, obesity-related markers for cardiovascular and metabolic parameters and patient \nreported assessments were examined in double-blind, placebo-controlled obesity Phase 2 and Phase 3 \ntrials (BMI range 27-45 kg/m2) with study durations of 16 to 56 weeks randomised to naltrexone \nhydrochloride (16 to 50 mg/day) and/or bupropion hydrochloride (300 to 400 mg/day) or placebo.  \n \nEffect on weight loss and weight maintenance  \nFour multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled obesity Phase 3 studies (NB-301, NB-302, \nNB-303 and NB-304) were conducted to evaluate the effect of naltrexone/bupropion in conjunction \nwith lifestyle modification in 4,536 subjects randomised to naltrexone/bupropion or placebo. \nTreatment was initiated with a dose escalation period. Three of these studies (NB-301, NB-302 and \nNB-304) designated the primary endpoint at 56 weeks, and 1 study (NB-303) designated the primary \nendpoint at week 28, but continued for 56 weeks. Studies NB-301, NB-303, and NB-304 included \nperiodic instruction from the study sites to reduce caloric intake and increase physical activity, while \nNB-302 included an intensive behavioral modification program consisting of 28 group counseling \nsessions over 56 weeks, as well as a prescribed rigorous diet and exercise regimen. NB-304 evaluated \nsubjects with type 2 diabetes not achieving glycaemic goal of HbA1c <7% (53 mmol/mol) with oral \nanti-diabetes agents or on diet and exercise alone. NB-303 included a re-randomisation in a blinded \nmanner and the addition of a higher dose of naltrexone (naltrexone hydrochloride 48 mg/bupropion \nhydrochloride 360 mg) at week 28 to half of the cohort of subjects in the active treatment arm who \n\n\n\n17 \n\ndid not adequately respond to treatment, and as such the primary endpoint comparing weight change \nwith 32 mg naltrexone hydrochloride /360 mg bupropion hydrochloride vs. placebo was evaluated at \nweek 28. \n \nOf the overall population of 4,536 subjects in the naltrexone/bupropion Phase 3 studies, 25% had \nhypertension, 33% had fasting glucose levels ≥100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) at baseline, 54% had \ndyslipidaemia at study entry, and 11% had type 2 diabetes. \n \nIn the combined Phase 3 studies, the mean age was 46 years, 83% were female, and 77% were White, \n18% were Black and 5% were other races. Baseline mean BMI was 36 kg/m2 and mean waist \ncircumference was 110 cm. The two co-primary endpoints were percent change from baseline body \nweight and the proportion of subjects achieving ≥5% total decreased body weight. Data summaries \nfor mean change in body weight reflect the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population, defined as subjects who \nwere randomised, had a baseline body weight measurement, and had at least one post-baseline body \nweight measurement during the defined treatment phase, using a last observation carried forward \n(LOCF) analysis, as well as a completers analysis. Summaries of the proportion of subjects achieving \n≥5% or ≥10% reduction in body weight utilise a baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) \nanalysis of all randomised subjects. Overall adherence was similar between trials, and similar \nbetween treatment groups. Treatment adherence rates for the integrated Phase 3 studies were: 67% \nNB vs. 74% placebo at 16 weeks, 63% NB vs. 65% Placebo at 26 weeks, 55% NB vs. 55% placebo \nat 52weeks. \n \nAs seen in Table 2, in the NB-301 study subjects had a mean percent body weight loss of -5.4% \nwhile receiving naltrexone/bupropion compared to -1.3% in placebo-treated subjects. Weight loss of \nat least 5% baseline body weight was observed more frequently for subjects treated with \nnaltrexone/bupropion (31%) compared to placebo (12%) (Table 3). More pronounced weight loss \nwas observed in the cohort of subjects who completed 56 weeks of treatment with \nnaltrexone/bupropion (-8.1%) compared to placebo (-1.8%). Comparable results were seen in the \nNB-303 study, which was of similar design, with significant weight loss observed in \nnaltrexone/bupropion -treated subjects compared to placebo at the week 28 primary endpoint, and \nsustained through 56 weeks from baseline (Table 3). \n \nNaltrexone/bupropion was also evaluated in combination with intensive behavioural modification \ncounseling in the NB-302 study. Correspondingly, there was greater mean weight loss from baseline \nfor naltrexone/bupropion treatment (-8.1%) compared to study NB-301 (-5.4%) at week 56, and for \nplacebo (-4.9%) compared to study NB-301 (-1.3%). \n \nThe treatment effects observed in obese and overweight subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus \n(Study NB-304) were somewhat less pronounced than those observed in the other Phase 3 studies. \nNaltrexone/bupropion (-3.7%) was significantly (p<0.001) more efficacious than placebo (-1.7%) \ntreatment in this population. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nTable 3.

Study NB-302 had a more intensive behavioural modification program, while the primary \nendpoint of Study NB-303 was at week 28 to allow for re-randomisation to different doses in the latter portion of \nthe study.  Study NB-304 was conducted in subjects who were overweight or obese and had type 2 diabetes \nmellitus. \n \nOf the subjects with observed data at week 16 in the four Phase 3 clinical trials, 50.8% of those \nrandomised to receive naltrexone/bupropion had lost ≥5% of their baseline body weight, compared to \n19.3% of placebo-treated subjects (week 16 Responders). At one year, the average weight loss (using \nLOCF methodology) among these week 16 Responders who received naltrexone/bupropion was \n11.3%, with 55% losing ≥10% bodyweight. Additionally, week 16 Responders who received \nnaltrexone/bupropion had a high retention rate with 87% completing 1 year of treatment. The ≥5% \nweight loss threshold at week 16 had 86.4% positive predictive value and 84.8% negative predictive \nvalue for determining whether a subject treated with naltrexone/bupropion would achieve at least 5% \nweight loss at week 56.  Patients who did not meet the early response criterion were not found to \nhave increased tolerability or safety issues relative to patients who did have a favourable early \nresponse. \n \nEffect on cardiovascular and metabolic parameters   \nImprovements were observed for waist circumference (including subjects with type 2 diabetes), \ntriglycerides, HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio for subjects treated with naltrexone/bupropion vs. \nplacebo in all Phase 3 studies (Table 4). Improvements in triglycerides, HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C \nratio were seen in naltrexone/bupropion-treated subjects diagnosed with baseline dyslipidaemia \nirrespective of dyslipidaemia treatment. Changes in mean blood pressure are described in section 4.4. \nIn addition, in subjects who did not have type 2 diabetes, there were reductions in fasting insulin and \nHOMA-IR, a measure of insulin resistance, in naltrexone/bupropion-treated subjects. \n \nEffects on glycaemic control in obese subjects with type 2 diabetes \nAfter 56 weeks of treatment in subjects with type 2 diabetes (NB-304), naltrexone/bupropion \nexhibited improvements in glycaemic control parameters compared to placebo (Table 4). Greater \nHbA1c improvement compared to placebo was observed at the first post-baseline measurement \n(week 16, p<0.001). Mean HbA1c change from baseline at week 56 was -0.63% for subjects treated \nwith naltrexone/bupropion compared to subjects on placebo -0.14% (p<0.001). In subjects with \n\n\n\n20 \n\nbaseline HbA1c >8% (64 mmol/mol), HbA1c changes at endpoint were -1.1% and -0.5% for \nnaltrexone/bupropion compared to placebo, respectively. Improvements were observed for fasting \nglucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR and percent of subjects requiring rescue diabetes medicinal \nproducts for subjects treated with naltrexone/bupropion vs. placebo. \n \nTable 5.

Study NB-302 had a more intensive behavioural modification program, while the primary \nendpoint of Study NB-303 was at week 28 to allow for re-randomisation to different doses in the latter portion of \nthe study.  Study NB-304 was conducted in subjects who were overweight or obese and had type 2 diabetes \nmellitus. \n \nEffect on body composition  \nIn a subset of subjects, body composition was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry \n(DEXA) (naltrexone/bupropion = 79 subjects and placebo = 45 subjects) and multislice computed \ntomography (CT) scan (naltrexone/bupropion = 34 subjects and placebo = 24 subjects). The DEXA \nassessment showed that treatment with naltrexone/bupropion was associated with greater reductions \nfrom baseline in total body fat and in visceral adipose tissue than placebo. As expected, \nnaltrexone/bupropion -treated subjects had a greater mean increase from baseline compared with \nplacebo-treated subjects in percent of total body lean mass. These results suggest that most of the \ntotal weight loss was attributable to a reduction in adipose tissue, including visceral adipose. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nMysimba in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in obesity (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). Naltrexone/bupropion should not be used in children and adolescents. \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe results of a single dose relative bioavailability study in healthy subjects demonstrated that \nnaltrexone/bupropion tablets, when dose adjusted, are bioequivalent based on AUC0-∞ mean ratio and \n90% confidence intervals to naltrexone immediate release (IR) or bupropion prolonged release (PR) \nadministered as single agents. \n \nAbsorption \n  \nFollowing single oral administration of naltrexone/bupropion tablets to healthy subjects, peak \nconcentrations of naltrexone and bupropion occurred approximately 2 and 3 hours post \nadministration of naltrexone/bupropion, respectively. There were no differences in bioavailability, as \nmeasured by AUC, of naltrexone or bupropion when administered in combination compared to each \nadministered alone. However, given the prolonged nature of the drug release for \nnaltrexone/bupropion, Cmax for naltrexone was markedly reduced compared to the 50 mg naltrexone \nhydrochloride IR administered alone (about 2-fold difference after dose adjustment). The bupropion \nCmax from naltrexone/bupropion (180 mg bupropion hydrochloride) was equivalent to the Cmax of \nbupropion PR (150 mg bupropion hydrochloride), indicating that the bupropion Cmax achieved with \nnaltrexone/bupropion (360 mg bupropion hydrochloride /day) is comparable to that achieved with \ncommercially available bupropion PR (300 mg bupropion hydrochloride /day) administered alone. \n \nNaltrexone and bupropion are well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (>90% absorbed), \nhowever, naltrexone has a significant first pass effect thereby limiting systemic bioavailablity, with \nonly 5-6% reaching the systemic circulation intact. \n \nFood effect \n \nWhen naltrexone/bupropion was given with a high-fat meal the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone \nincreased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, \nrespectively. At steady state, the food effect resulted in AUC and Cmax increases of 1.7- and 1.9-fold \nfor naltrexone, and 1.1- and 1.3-fold for bupropion, respectively. Clinical experience included \nvarying prandial conditions and supports the use of naltrexone/bupropion tablets with food. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe mean volume of distribution at steady state of oral naltrexone and bupropion given as \nnaltrexgone / bupropion, Vss/F, was 5697 liters and 880 liters, respectively.  \nPlasma protein binding is not extensive for naltrexone (21%) or bupropion (84%) indicating low \npotential for drug interactions by displacement.  \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \n \nFollowing single oral administration of naltrexone/bupropion tablets to healthy subjects, mean T½ \nelimination half-life was approximately 5 hours for naltrexone and 21 hours for bupropion.  \n \nNaltrexone \nThe major metabolite of naltrexone is 6-beta-naltrexol. Though less potent than naltrexone, \n6-beta-naltrexol is eliminated more slowly and thus circulates at much higher concentrations than \nnaltrexone. Naltrexone and 6-beta-naltrexol are not metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes and in \nvitro studies indicate that there is no potential for inhibition or induction of important isozymes. \nNaltrexone is primarily metabolised to 6-beta-naltrexol by the dihydrodiol dehydrogenases \n(DD1, DD2 and DD4). Other major metabolic routes are the formation of the metabolites \n2-hydroxy-3-O-methyl naltrexone and 2-hydroxy-3-O-methyl-6-beta-naltrexol, believed to be \nmediated by catechol-O-methyl transferases (COMT), and glucuronidation, thought to be mediated \nby UGT1A1 and UGT2B7. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nNaltrexone and its metabolites are excreted primarily by the kidney (37 to 60% of the dose). The \nderived value for renal excretion of naltrexone after oral administration, adjusting for plasma protein \nbinding, is 89 mL/min. The enzyme responsible for the main elimination pathway is not known.  \nFaecal excretion is a minor elimination pathway. \n \nBupropion \nBupropion is extensively metabolised with three active metabolites: hydroxybupropion, \nthreohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion. The metabolites have longer elimination half-lives \nthan bupropion and accumulate to a greater extent. In vitro findings suggest that CYP2B6 is the \nprincipal isozyme involved in the formation of hydroxybupropion, while CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 3A4 \nand 2E1 are less involved. In contrast, formation of threohydrobupropion has been reported in the \nliterature to be mediated by 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1.  The metabolic pathway \nresponsible for the formation of erythrohydrobupropion is unknown. \n \nBupropion and its metabolites inhibit CYP2D6. Plasma protein binding of hydroxybupropion is \nsimilar to that of bupropion (84%) whereas the other two metabolites have approximately half the \nbinding. \n \nFollowing oral administration of 200 mg of 14C-bupropion hydrochloride in humans, 87% and 10% \nof the radioactive dose were recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. The fraction of the oral \ndose of bupropion excreted unchanged was 0.5%, a finding consistent with the extensive metabolism \nof bupropion. \n \nAccumulation  \n \nFollowing twice daily administration of naltrexone/bupropion, naltrexone does not accumulate, while \n6-beta-naltrexol accumulates over time.  Based on its half-life, 6-beta-naltrexol is estimated to reach \nsteady state concentrations in approximately 3 days. Metabolites of bupropion (and to a lesser extent \nunmetabolised bupropion) accumulate and reach steady state concentrations in approximately one \nweek. No study has been performed comparing AUC or Cmax of naltrexone/bupropion \nprolonged-release tablets with bupropion PR or naltrexone IR administered as single agents in the \nmultiple dose setting (i.e., under steady state conditions). \n \nSpecial populations  \n \nGender and race \nPooled analysis of naltrexone/bupropion data revealed no meaningful gender or race-related \ndifferences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of bupropion or naltrexone. However, only Caucasian \nand Black subjects were investigated to a significant extent. No dosage adjustment is necessary based \non gender or race. \n \nElderly people \nThe pharmacokinetics of naltrexone/bupropion have not been evaluated in the elderly population. \nBecause naltrexone and bupropion metabolic products are excreted in the urine and elderly people \nare more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may \nbe useful to monitor renal function. Naltrexone/bupropion is not recommended in patients over 75 \nyears of age. \n \nSmokers \nPooled analysis of naltrexone/bupropion data revealed no meaningful differences in the plasma \nconcentrations of bupropion or naltrexone in smokers compared to nonsmokers. The effects of \ncigarette smoking on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion were studied in 34 healthy male and female \nvolunteers; 17 were chronic cigarette smokers and 17 were nonsmokers. Following oral \nadministration of a single 150 mg dose of bupropion hydrochloride, there was no statistically \nsignificant difference in Cmax, half-life, Tmax, AUC, or clearance of bupropion or its active metabolites \nbetween smokers and nonsmokers. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nHepatic impairment  \nA single-dose pharmacokinetic study has been conducted with naltrexone/bupropion in patients with \nhepatic impairment. The results from this study demonstrated that in patients with mild hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh scores of 5-6 [Class A]), there was a modest increase in naltrexone \nconcentrations, but concentrations of bupropion and most other metabolites were mostly comparable \nand no more than doubled to those in patients with normal hepatic function. In patients with \nmoderate (Child-Pugh scores of 7-9 [Class B]) and severe (Child-Pugh scores of 10 or higher [Class \nC]) hepatic impairment, increases in the maximum concentration of naltrexone of ~6- and ~30-fold \nwere observed for the moderate and severe patients respectively, while increases in bupropion were \n~2-fold for both groups. Increases of ~2- and ~4-fold for the area under the curve for bupropion were \nobserved for patients with moderate and severe impairment respectively. There were no consistent \nchanges in naltrexone or bupropion metabolites related to varying degrees of hepatic impairment. \nNaltrexone/bupropion is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3) \nand is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). In patients \nwith mild hepatic impairment, the maximum recommended daily dose for naltrexone/bupropion \nshould be reduced (see section 4.2). \n \nRenal impairment  \nA single-dosepharmacokinetic study has been conducted for naltrexone/bupropion in subjects with \nmild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, compared with subjects with normal renal function. \nThe results from this study demonstrated that the area under the curve for plasma naltrexone and \nmetabolites and for plasma bupropion and metabolites was increased by less than two-fold in patients \nwith moderate and severe renal impairment, and smaller increases were observed for patients with \nmild renal impairment. Based on these results, there are no dose adjustments recommended for \npatients with mild renal impairment. For patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, the \nmaximum recommended daily dose for naltrexone/bupropion should be reduced (see section 4.2). \nNaltrexone/bupropion is contraindicated in end-stage renal failure (see section 4.3). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe effects of combined bupropion and naltrexone use have not been studied in animals. \n \nNon-clinical data on individual components reveal no special hazard for humans based on \nconventional studies of safety, pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic \npotential. Any effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently \nin excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. However, there \nis some evidence on hepatotoxicity with increasing dose, since reversible increases of liver enzymes \nhave been found in humans with therapeutic and higher doses (see section 4.4 and 4.8). Liver \nchanges are seen in animal studies with bupropion but these reflect the action of a hepatic enzyme \ninducer. At recommended doses in humans, bupropion does not induce its own metabolism. This \nsuggests that the hepatic findings in laboratory animals have only limited importance in the \nevaluation and risk assessment of bupropion. \n \nReproduction toxicity \n \nNaltrexone (100 mg/kg/day, approximately 30 times the dose of naltrexone in naltrexone/bupropion \non a mg/m2 basis) caused a significant increase in pseudo-pregnancy in the rat. A decrease in the \npregnancy rate of mated female rats also occurred. There was no effect on male fertility at this dose \nlevel. The relevance of these observations to human fertility is not known. \n \nNaltrexone has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats dosed with 100 mg/kg/day of \nnaltrexone (30 times the naltrexone/bupropion dose) prior to and throughout gestation, and in rabbits \ntreated with 60 mg/kg/day of naltrexone (36 times the naltrexone/bupropion dose) during the period \nof organogenesis. \n \nA fertility study of bupropion in rats at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day, or 8 times the bupropion dose \nprovided by naltrexone/bupropion revealed no evidence of impaired fertility. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \nGenotoxicity \n \nNaltrexone was negative in the following in vitro genotoxicity studies: bacterial reverse mutation \nassay (Ames test), the heritable translocation assay, CHO cell sister chromatid exchange assay, and \nthe mouse lymphoma gene mutation assay. Naltrexone was also negative in an in vivo mouse \nmicronucleus assay. In contrast, naltrexone tested positive in the following assays: Drosophila \nrecessive lethal frequency assay, non-specific DNA damage in repair tests with E. coli and WI-38 \ncells, and urinalysis for methylated histidine residues. The clinical relevance of these equivocal \nfindings is unknown. \n \nGenotoxicity data indicate that bupropion is a weak bacterial mutagen, but not a mammalian \nmutagen, and therefore is of no concern as a human genotoxic agent. Mouse and rat studies confirm \nthe absence of carcinogenicity in these species. \n \n \n6.

See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

What Mysimba is and what it is used for \n \nMysimba contains 2 active substances: naltrexone hydrochloride and bupropion hydrochloride and is \nused in obese or overweight adults to manage weight together with a reduced calorie diet and \nphysical exercise. This medicine works on areas on the brain involved in the control of food intake \nand energy expenditure. \n \nObesity in adults over 18 years of age is defined as a body mass index of greater than or equal to 30 \nand overweight in adults over 18 years of age is defined as a body mass index greater than or equal to \n27 and less than 30. The body mass index is calculated as the measured body weight (kg) divided by \nthe measured height squared (m2).  \n \nMysimba is approved for use in patients with an initial body mass index of 30 or greater; it can also \nbe given to those with a body mass index between 27 and 30 if they have additional weight-related \nconditions such as controlled high blood pressure (hypertension), type 2 diabetes or high levels of \nlipid (fat) in the blood. \n \nMysimba may be discontinued by your doctor after 16 weeks if you have not lost at least 5 percent of \nyour initial body weight. Your doctor may also recommend stopping treatment if there are concerns \nabout increased blood pressure, or other concerns with the safety or tolerability of this medicine. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Mysimba \n \nDo not take Mysimba: \n- if you are allergic to naltrexone, to bupropion or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6); \n- if you have an abnormally high blood pressure (hypertension) that is not controlled using a \n\nmedicinal product; \n\n\n\n36 \n\n- if you have a condition that causes fits (seizures) or if you have a history of fits; \n- if you have a brain tumour; \n- if you are usually a heavy drinker and you have just stopped drinking alcohol, or are going to \n\nstop while you are taking Mysimba; \n- if you have recently stopped taking sedatives or medicines to treat anxiety (especially \n\nbenzodiazepines), or if you are going to stop them while you are taking Mysimba;  \n- if you have or have had a bipolar disorder (extreme mood swings); \n- if you are using any other medicines which contain bupropion or naltrexone; \n- if you have an eating disorder or had one in the past (for example, bulimia or anorexia \n\nnervosa); \n- if you are currently dependent on chronic opiates or opiate agonists (for example methadone), \n\nor you are going through acute withdrawal (cold turkey);  \n- if you are taking medicines for depression or Parkinson’s disease called monoamine oxidase \n\ninhibitors (MAOIs) or have taken them in the last 14 days; \n- if you have severe liver disease;  \n- if you have endstage kidney disease. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Mysimba. \nThis is important because some conditions make it more likely that you could have side effects (see \nalso section 4). \n \nIf you feel depressed, contemplate suicide, have a history of attempting suicide or any other \nmental health problems, you should inform your doctor before taking this medicine.  \n \nFits (seizures) \nMysimba has been shown to cause fits (seizures) in up to 1 in 1,000 patients (see also  \nsection 4). You should inform your doctor before taking this medicine:  \n• if you have had a serious head injury or head trauma;  \n• if you regularly drink alcohol (see “Mysimba with alcohol”);  \n• if you regularly use medicines to help you to sleep (sedatives);  \n• if you are currently dependent on or addicted to cocaine or other stimulating products;  \n• if you have diabetes for which you use insulin or oral medicines that may cause low sugar \n\nlevels in your blood (hypoglycaemia); or \n• if you are taking medicines that may increase the risk of fits (see “Other medicines and \n\nMysimba”). \nIf you have a fit (seizure), you should stop taking Mysimba and consult your doctor immediately. \n \nYou should stop taking Mysimba immediately and consult your doctor if you are experiencing any \nsymptoms of an allergic reaction such as swelling of the throat, tongue, lips, or face, difficulty \nswallowing or breathing, dizziness, fever, rash, pain in the joints or in the muscles, itching or hives \nafter taking this medicine (see also section 4).  \n \nYou should talk to your doctor, especially if: \n• you have high blood pressure before taking Mysimba, because it can become worse. You will \n\nhave your blood pressure and heart rate measured before you start taking Mysimba and while \nyou are taking it. If your blood pressure or heart rate increases significantly, you may need to \nstop taking Mysimba. \n\n• you have uncontrolled coronary artery disease (a heart disease caused by poor blood flow in \nthe blood vessels of the heart) with symptoms such as angina (characterised by chest pain) or a \nrecent heart attack. \n\n• you already have or have had a condition affecting the circulation of blood in the brain \n(cerebrovascular disease). \n\n• you have any liver problems before you start Mysimba.  \n• you have any kidney problems before you start Mysimba. \n• you have a history of mania (feeling elated or over-excited, which causes unusual behaviour).  \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \nOlder People \nUse caution when taking Mysimba, if you are 65 years or older. Mysimba is not recommended if you \nare over 75 years. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nNo studies have been conducted in children and adolescents under the age of 18. Therefore Mysimba \nshould not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Mysimba \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  \n \nDo not take Mysimba with:  \n• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (medicines to treat depression or Parkinson’s disease) such as \n\nphenelzine, selegiline, or rasagiline. You must stop taking these medicines for at least 14 days \nbefore starting Mysimba (see “Do not take Mysimba”). \n\n• Opiates and opiate-containing medicines for example to treat cough and cold (such as \nmixtures containing dextromethorphan or codeine), opiate addiction (such as methadone), pain \n(for example, morphine and codeine), diarrhoea (for example, paregoric). You must have \nstopped taking any opiate medicines at least 7-10 days before starting Mysimba. Your doctor \nmay carry out a blood test to ensure that your body has cleared these medicines before starting \nyour treatment. Naltrexone blocks the effects of opiates; if you take higher doses of opiates to \novercome these effects of naltrexone, you may suffer from an acute opiate intoxication which \nmay be life threatening. After you stop treatment with Mysimba you may be more sensitive to \nlow doses of opiates (see “Do not take Mysimba”).  \n\n \nTell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines, as your doctor will closely \nmonitor you for side effects: \n• Medicines that may, when used alone or in combination with naltrexone/bupropion, increase \n\nthe risk of fits such as:  \no medicines for depression and other mental health problems; \no steroids (except drops, creams, or lotions for eye and skin conditions or inhalers for breathing \n\ndisorders such as asthma); \no medicines used to prevent malaria; \no quinolones (antibiotics such as ciprofloxacine to treat infections); \no tramadol (a painkiller belonging to the class of opiates); \no theophylline (used in the treatment of asthma); \no antihistamines (medicines to treat hayfever, itch, and other allergic reactions) that cause \n\nsleepiness (such as chlorphenamine);   \no medicines to lower sugar levels in your blood (such as insulin, sulphonylureas such as \n\nglyburide or glibenclamide, and meglitinides such as nateglinide or repaglinide); \no medicines to help you to sleep (sedatives such as diazepam). \n\n• Medicines to treat depression (such as desipramine, venlafaxine, imipramine, paroxetine, \ncitalopram) or other mental health problems (such as risperidone, haloperidol, thioridazine);  \n\n• Some medicines used to treat high blood pressure (beta-blockers such as metoprolol, and \nclonidine, a centrally acting antihypertensive); \n\n• Some medicines used to treat irregular heart rhythm (such as propafenone, flecainide); \n• Some medicines used to treat cancer (such as cyclophospamide, ifosphamide, tamoxifen); \n• Some medicines for Parkinson’s disease (such as levodopa, amantadine or orphenadrine); \n• Ticlopidine or clopidogrel, mainly used in the treatment of heart disease or stroke; \n• Medicines used in the treatment of HIV infection and AIDS, such as efavirenz and ritonavir; \n• Medicines used to treat epilepsy such as valproate, carbamazepine, phenytoin or phenobarbital. \n\n \nYour doctor will closely monitor you for side effects and/or may need to adjust the dose of the other \nmedicines or Mysimba. \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \nMysimba with alcohol \nExcessive use of alcohol while being treated with Mysimba might increase the risk for fits (seizures), \nmental disorder events or might reduce alcohol tolerance. Your doctor may suggest you do not drink \nalcohol while you are taking Mysimba, or try to drink as little as possible. If you do drink a lot now, \ndo not just stop suddenly, because that may put you at risk of having a fit.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nMysimba should not be used during pregnancy, or while breast-feeding.  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nAsk your doctor for advice before you drive and operate machines since Mysimba might make you \nfeel dizzy and sleepy which may weaken your ability to concentrate and react. \n \nDo not drive, use any tools or machines, or perform dangerous activities until you know how this \nmedicine affects you. \n \nIf you experience fainting, muscle weakness or fits during treatment, do not drive or use machines.  \n \nIn case of doubt, check with your doctor, who might consider to interrupt the treatment depending on \nyour situation.  \n \nMysimba contains lactose (a type of sugar) \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicinal product. \n \n \n3. How to take Mysimba \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  \n \nThe initial dose is usually one tablet (8 mg naltrexone hydrochloride / 90 mg bupropion \nhydrochloride) once a day in the morning.

Your doctor may test your blood before initiating treatment with Mysimba if you have high \nblood sugar (diabetes) or if you are older than 65, so that your doctor can decide if you should take \nthis medicine or if you need to take a different dose. \n \nThis medicine is for oral use. Swallow your tablets whole. Do not cut them, chew them or crush \nthem. The tablets should preferably be taken with food. \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\nIf you take more Mysimba than you should \nIf you take too many tablets, you may be more likely to have a fit or other side effects similar to \nthose described in section 4 below. Do not delay, contact your doctor or your nearest hospital \nemergency department immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take Mysimba \nSkip the missed dose and take your next dose at the next usual time. Do not take a double dose to \nmake up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Mysimba \nYou may need to take Mysimba for at least 16 weeks to have its full effect. Do not stop taking \nMysimba without talking to your doctor first. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
