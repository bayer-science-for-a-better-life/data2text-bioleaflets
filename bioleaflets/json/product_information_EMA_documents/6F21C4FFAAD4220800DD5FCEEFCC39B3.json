NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nDaronrix, suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe \nPandemic influenza vaccine (whole virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nWhole virion influenza vaccine of pandemic strain, inactivated, containing antigen* equivalent to: \n \nA/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1)*** 15 micrograms**\n \nper 0.5 ml dose  \n \n* propagated in eggs \n** haemagglutinin \n*** adjuvanted by aluminium phosphate 0.45 milligrams Al3+ \n  and aluminium hydroxide, hydrated  0.05 milligrams Al3+\n \nThis vaccine complies with the WHO recommendation and EU decision for the pandemic. \n \nExcipients: \n \nThiomersal 50 micrograms \n \nFor a full list of excipients see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \nTurbid white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation. Pandemic influenza vaccine \nshould be used in accordance with official guidance. (see sections 4.2 and 5.1) \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nDaronrix has been evaluated with a haemagglutinin content of 15 µg HA per dose in adults aged 18-60 \nyears following a 0, 21 day schedule. \n \nAdults from the age of 18 to 60 years will receive two doses of Daronrix, the first administered at an \nelected date, the second at least three weeks after the first dose for maximum efficacy. \n \nNo data have been generated with Daronrix below 18 years of age. Therefore health care providers \nneed to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in that population. \n \nFor pregnant women, see section 4.6. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n  3 \n\nFor further information, see section 5.1. \n \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic reaction (i.e. life-threatening) to any of the constituents or trace residues \n(e.g. eggs, chicken protein, gentamicin sulphate) of this vaccine. However, in a pandemic situation, it \nmay be appropriate to give the vaccine, provided that facilities for resuscitation are immediately \navailable in case of need. \n \nSee section 4.4. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCaution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other \nthan anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients, to thiomersal and to \nresidues e.g. eggs, chicken protein, gentamicin sulphate. \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nIf the pandemic situation allows, immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile \nillness or acute infection. \n \nDaronrix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \nA protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDaronrix should not be given at the same time as other vaccines. However, if co-administration with \nanother vaccine is indicated, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted \nthat the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant \ntreatment. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false positive results in serology tests using the ELISA method to \ndetect antibodies against HIV-1, Hepatitis C and especially HTLV-1 have been observed. The Western \nBlot technique disproves the results. The transient false positive reactions could be due to the IgM \nresponse by the vaccine. \n \n4.6  Pregnancy and lactation \n \nNo data have been generated with Daronrix in pregnant women. Therefore health care providers need \nto assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine to pregnant women taking into \nconsideration official recommendations. Data from vaccinations with interpandemic trivalent vaccines \nin pregnant women do not indicate that adverse foetal and maternal outcomes were attributable to the \nvaccine. \n \nDaronrix may be used during lactation. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n  4 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe vaccine is unlikely to produce an effect on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n• Clinical trials \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trials with different formulations (H5N1, H2N2 and H9N2) (N=941) \nof the mock-up vaccine are listed here below (see section 5.1 for more information on mock-up \nvaccines). Two hundred and one subjects received the monovalent aluminium-adjuvanted whole virus \nvaccine (A/H5N1). \n \nThe incidence of symptoms observed in subjects >60 years of age was lower as compared to the 18-60 \nyears old population. \n \nUndesirable effects reported are listed according to the following frequency: \n \nVery common (≥1/10) \nCommon (≥1/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare (<1/10,000) \nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n \nInfections and infestations \nUncommon: nasopharyngitis, rhinitis \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: headache \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: sweating increase, ecchymosis \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon: myalgia, arthralgia \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: pain and redness at the site of injection, fatigue  \nCommon: swelling and induration at the site of injection, shivering, fever \nUncommon: injection site pruritis \n \nThese reactions usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. \n \n• Post-marketing surveillance \n \nFrom Post-marketing surveillance with interpandemic trivalent vaccines, the following adverse events \nhave been reported: \n \nUncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100):  \nGeneralised skin reactions including pruritus, urticaria or non-specific rash. \n \nRare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000):  \nNeuralgia, paraesthesia, convulsions, transient thrombocytopenia. \nAllergic reactions, in rare cases leading to shock, have been reported. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n  5 \n\n \nVery rare (<1/10,000): \nVasculitis with transient renal involvement. \nNeurological disorders, such as encephalomyelitis, neuritis and Guillain Barré syndrome. \n \nThis medicinal product contains thiomersal (an organomercuric compound) as a preservative and \ntherefore, it is possible that sensitisation reactions may occur (see section 4.4). \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccines, ATC Code J07BB01. \n \nThis section describes the clinical experience with the mock-up vaccines following a two-dose \nadministration.  \n \nMock-up vaccines contain influenza antigens that are different from those in the currently circulating \ninfluenza viruses. These antigens can be considered as “novel” antigens and simulate a situation where \nthe target population for vaccination is immunologically naïve. Data obtained with the mock-up \nvaccine will support a vaccination strategy that is likely to be used for the pandemic vaccine: clinical \nimmunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity data obtained with mock-up vaccines are relevant for the \npandemic vaccines.   \n \nA clinical study has evaluated the immunogenicity of the monovalent aluminium-adjuvanted whole \nvirus vaccine (A/H5N1) with a haemagglutinin content of 15 µg HA per dose in adults aged 18-60 \nyears (N=48) following a 0, 21 day schedule. \n \nThe seroprotection rate, the seroconversion rate and seroconversion factor for anti-HA antibody were \nas follows: \n \nanti-HA antibody 21 days after 1st dose \n\n \n21 days after 2nd dose \n\nSeroprotection rate* 50.0% (95% CI: 35.2;64.8) 70.8% (95% CI: 55.9;83.0) \nSeroconversion rate 47.9% (95% CI: 33.3;62.8) 70.8% (95% CI: 55.9;83.0) \nSeroconversion factor 6 (95% CI: 3.5;10.1) 12.4 (95% CI: 7.1;21.8) \n* anti-HA ≥1:40 \n \nIn this clinical study, the immunogenicity of the monovalent aluminium-adjuvanted whole virus \nvaccine (A/H5N1) with a haemagglutinin content of 27µg HA per dose in adults aged 18-60 years \n(N=49) was also evaluated following a 0, 21 day schedule. \n \nThe seroprotection rate, the seroconversion rate and seroconversion factor for anti-HA antibody were \nas follows 21 days after the first dose: \n \nanti-HA antibody 21 days after 1st dose \n\n \nSeroprotection rate* 73.5% (95% CI: 58.9;85.0) \nSeroconversion rate 69.4% (95% CI: 54.6;81.7) \nSeroconversion factor 14.5 (95% CI: 8.3;25.4) \n\n\n\n \n \n\n  6 \n\n* anti-HA ≥1:40 \n \nNo clinical data have been generated in subjects below 18 years of age.  \n \nAlthough no clinical data have been generated with Daronrix in subjects >60 years of age, the \nimmunogenicity of a mock up formulation with different antigen doses of an aluminium-adjuvanted \nwhole virus vaccine (A/H9N2) administered at 0, 21 days was evaluated in a clinical trial in this \npopulation. These results indicated that higher antigen content may be needed in subjects above 60 \nyears of age as compared to an adult population (18-60 years) in order to ensure optimal protection. \n \nThe persistence of antibodies for the mock-up vaccines varies.  With interpandemic trivalent vaccines, \nit is usually 6 - 12 months, but for Daronrix no data are available yet with the H5N1 strain.  \n \nIn a clinical study where a mock-up formulation of aluminium-adjuvanted whole virus vaccine \n(AH9/N2) containing 3.8 µg HA was evaluated following a 0, 10 day schedule, it has been shown that \na faster onset of protection could be reached as compared to the recommended 0, 21 day schedule. \nHowever data suggested that the duration of protection might be shorter. In circumstances when a fast \nonset of protection is needed, a third dose might therefore be necessary to ensure duration of \nprotection. \n \nDaronrix has been authorised under “Exceptional Circumstances”. \nThis means that for scientific reasons, it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this \nmedicinal product. \nThe European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information which may become \navailable every year and this SPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nNot applicable. \n \n \n6.

However, in a pandemic situation, it \nmay be appropriate to give the vaccine, provided that facilities for resuscitation are immediately \navailable in case of need. \n \nSee section 4.4. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCaution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other \nthan anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients, to thiomersal and to \nresidues e.g. eggs, chicken protein, gentamicin sulphate. \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nIf the pandemic situation allows, immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile \nillness or acute infection. \n \nDaronrix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \nA protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDaronrix should not be given at the same time as other vaccines. However, if co-administration with \nanother vaccine is indicated, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted \nthat the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant \ntreatment. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false positive results in serology tests using the ELISA method to \ndetect antibodies against HIV-1, Hepatitis C and especially HTLV-1 have been observed. The Western \nBlot technique disproves the results. The transient false positive reactions could be due to the IgM \nresponse by the vaccine. \n \n4.6  Pregnancy and lactation \n \nNo data have been generated with Daronrix in pregnant women. Therefore health care providers need \nto assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine to pregnant women taking into \nconsideration official recommendations. Data from vaccinations with interpandemic trivalent vaccines \nin pregnant women do not indicate that adverse foetal and maternal outcomes were attributable to the \nvaccine. \n \nDaronrix may be used during lactation. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n  10 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe vaccine is unlikely to produce an effect on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n• Clinical trials \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trials with different formulations (H5N1, H2N2 and H9N2) (N=941) \nof the mock-up vaccine are listed here below (see section 5.1 for more information on mock-up \nvaccines). Two hundred and one subjects received the monovalent aluminium-adjuvanted whole virus \nvaccine (A/H5N1). \n \nThe incidence of symptoms observed in subjects >60 years of age was lower as compared to the 18-60 \nyears old population. \n \nUndesirable effects reported are listed according to the following frequency: \n \nVery common (≥1/10) \nCommon (≥1/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare (<1/10,000) \nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n \nInfections and infestations \nUncommon: nasopharyngitis, rhinitis \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: headache \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: sweating increase, ecchymosis \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon: myalgia, arthralgia \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: pain and redness at the site of injection, fatigue  \nCommon: swelling and induration at the site of injection, shivering, fever \nUncommon: injection site pruritis \n \nThese reactions usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. \n \n• Post-marketing surveillance \n \nFrom Post-marketing surveillance with interpandemic trivalent vaccines, the following adverse events \nhave been reported: \n \nUncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100):  \nGeneralised skin reactions including pruritus, urticaria or non-specific rash. \n \nRare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000):  \nNeuralgia, paraesthesia, convulsions, transient thrombocytopenia. \nAllergic reactions, in rare cases leading to shock, have been reported. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n  11 \n\n \nVery rare (<1/10,000): \nVasculitis with transient renal involvement. \nNeurological disorders, such as encephalomyelitis, neuritis and Guillain Barré syndrome. \n \nThis medicinal product contains thiomersal (an organomercuric compound) as a preservative and \ntherefore, it is possible that sensitisation reactions may occur (see section 4.4). \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccines, ATC Code J07BB01. \n \nThis section describes the clinical experience with the mock-up vaccines following a two-dose \nadministration.  \n \nMock-up vaccines contain influenza antigens that are different from those in the currently circulating \ninfluenza viruses. These antigens can be considered as “novel” antigens and simulate a situation where \nthe target population for vaccination is immunologically naïve. Data obtained with the mock-up \nvaccine will support a vaccination strategy that is likely to be used for the pandemic vaccine: clinical \nimmunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity data obtained with mock-up vaccines are relevant for the \npandemic vaccines.   \n \nA clinical study has evaluated the immunogenicity of the monovalent aluminium-adjuvanted whole \nvirus vaccine (A/H5N1) with a haemagglutinin content of 15 µg HA per dose in adults aged 18-60 \nyears (N=48) following a 0, 21 day schedule. \n \nThe seroprotection rate, the seroconversion rate and seroconversion factor for anti-HA antibody were \nas follows: \n \nanti-HA antibody 21 days after 1st dose \n\n \n21 days after 2nd dose \n\nSeroprotection rate* 50.0% (95% CI: 35.2;64.8) 70.8% (95% CI: 55.9;83.0) \nSeroconversion rate 47.9% (95% CI: 33.3;62.8) 70.8% (95% CI: 55.9;83.0) \nSeroconversion factor 6 (95% CI: 3.5;10.1) 12.4 (95% CI: 7.1;21.8) \n* anti-HA ≥1:40 \n \nIn this clinical study, the immunogenicity of the monovalent aluminium-adjuvanted whole virus \nvaccine (A/H5N1) with a haemagglutinin content of 27µg HA per dose in adults aged 18-60 years \n(N=49) was also evaluated following a 0, 21 day schedule. \n \nThe seroprotection rate, the seroconversion rate and seroconversion factor for anti-HA antibody were \nas follows 21 days after the first dose: \n \nanti-HA antibody 21 days after 1st dose \n\n \nSeroprotection rate* 73.5% (95% CI: 58.9;85.0) \nSeroconversion rate 69.4% (95% CI: 54.6;81.7) \nSeroconversion factor 14.5 (95% CI: 8.3;25.4) \n\n\n\n \n \n\n  12 \n\n* anti-HA ≥1:40 \n \nNo clinical data have been generated in subjects below 18 years of age.  \n \nAlthough no clinical data have been generated with Daronrix in subjects >60 years of age, the \nimmunogenicity of a mock up formulation with different antigen doses of an aluminium-adjuvanted \nwhole virus vaccine (A/H9N2) administered at 0, 21 days was evaluated in a clinical trial in this \npopulation. These results indicated that higher antigen content may be needed in subjects above 60 \nyears of age as compared to an adult population (18-60 years) in order to ensure optimal protection. \n \nThe persistence of antibodies for the mock-up vaccines varies.  With interpandemic trivalent vaccines, \nit is usually 6 - 12 months, but for Daronrix no data are available yet with the H5N1 strain.  \n \nIn a clinical study where a mock-up formulation of aluminium-adjuvanted whole virus vaccine \n(AH9/N2) containing 3.8 µg HA was evaluated following a 0, 10 day schedule, it has been shown that \na faster onset of protection could be reached as compared to the recommended 0, 21 day schedule. \nHowever data suggested that the duration of protection might be shorter. In circumstances when a fast \nonset of protection is needed, a third dose might therefore be necessary to ensure duration of \nprotection. \n \nDaronrix has been authorised under “Exceptional Circumstances”. \nThis means that for scientific reasons, it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this \nmedicinal product. \nThe European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information which may become \navailable every year and this SPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nNot applicable. \n \n \n6.

CONDITIONS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION \n \n• CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS REGARDING SUPPLY AND USE IMPOSED ON \n\nTHE MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER \n \nMedicinal product subject to medical prescription. \n \nDaronrix can only be marketed when there is an official WHO/EU declaration of an influenza \npandemic, on the condition that the Marketing Authorisation Holder for Daronrix takes due account of \nthe officially declared pandemic strain. \n \n• CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND \n\nEFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNot applicable \n \n• OTHER CONDITIONS \n \nOfficial batch release: in accordance with Article 114 Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, the official \nbatch release will be undertaken by a state laboratory or a laboratory designated for that purpose. \n \nPharmacovigilance system \n \nThe MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance is in place and functioning before the \nproduct is placed on the market and for as long as the marketed product remains in use. \n \nThe MAH commits to performing the studies and pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the \nPharmacovigilance Plan. \n \nPSUR submission during the influenza pandemic:  \n\nDuring a pandemic situation, the frequency of submission of periodic safety update reports \nspecified in Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 will not be adequate for the safety \nmonitoring of a pandemic vaccine for which high levels of exposure are expected within a \nshort period of time.  Such situation requires rapid notification of safety information that may \nhave the greatest implications for risk-benefit balance in a pandemic.  Prompt analysis of \n\n\n\n \n \n\n  22 \n\ncumulative safety information, in light of extent of exposure, will be crucial for regulatory \ndecisions and protection of the population to be vaccinated.  In addition, duration a pandemic, \nresources needed for an in-depth evaluation of Periodic Safety Update Reports in the format as \ndefined in Volume 9a of the Rules Governing Medicinal Product in the European Union may \nnot be adequate for a rapid identification of a new safety issue.  \nIn consequence, as soon as the pandemic is declared (Phase 6 of the WHO global Influenza \npreparedness plan) and the pandemic vaccine is used, the MAH shall submit periodic safety \nupdate reports with periodicity and format defined as follows:  \n\n \nFrequency of submission \n\n- The clock will start from the first Monday after shipment of the first batch of vaccine. \n- First data-lock point is 14 days later. \n- Report submission is no later than day 22 (i.e. the following Monday). \n- Reporting to be fortnightly for the first 3 months of the pandemic. \n- Periodicity will be reviewed by the MAH and the (Co-)Rapporteur at 3 monthly \n\nintervals.   \n \nFormat  \nThe report shall include the following Tables of aggregate data using the agreed templates: \n\n1. Fatal and/or life-threatening reactions – for each Preferred Term (PT), including the \nproportion of fatal reports  \n\n2. Adverse Events of Special Interest (PTs)  \n3. Serious unexpected reactions (PTs)  \n4. All events occurring in the following age groups: 6-23 months, 2-8 years, 8-17 years, \n\n18-60 years, >60 years  \nAll events occurring in pregnant women  \n\n5.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This vaccine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others.  \n- If  any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIn this leaflet:  \n1. What Daronrix is and what it is used for \n2. Before you receive Daronrix \n3. How Daronrix is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Daronrix \n6. Further information \n \n \n1. WHAT DARONRIX IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nDaronrix is a vaccine used in adults aged 18 to 60 years to prevent influenza (flu) in an officially \ndeclared pandemic. The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) \nagainst the disease. \n \nPandemic flu is a type of influenza that occurs every few decades and which spreads rapidly to affect \nmost countries and regions around the world.  The symptoms of pandemic flu are similar to those of \n“ordinary” flu but are usually more severe.   \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU RECEIVE DARONRIX  \n \nDaronrix should not be given: \n \n• if you have previously had any allergic reaction to Daronrix, or any ingredient (including eggs, \n\nchicken protein, gentamicin sulphate (antibiotic)) contained in this vaccine.  The active \nsubstances and other ingredients in Daronrix are listed at the end of the leaflet.  Signs of an \nallergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or \ntongue. However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate to give the vaccine, provided \nthat facilities for resuscitation are immediately available in case of need. \n\n \nTake special care with Daronrix: \n \n• if you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C).  A minor infection such as a \n\ncold should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor first. \n \nUsing other medicines  \nPlease tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription or have recently received any other vaccine. \nIf you take any medicines that reduce immunity to infections or have any other type of treatment (such \nas radiotherapy) that affects the immune system, Daronrix can still be given but your response to the \nvaccine may be poor. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n  39 \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nThere is no information on the use of Daronrix in pregnant women.  Your doctor needs to assess the \nbenefits and potential risks of giving you the vaccine if you are pregnant. Please tell your doctor if you \nare pregnant. \n \nDaronrix may be used during lactation. \n \nDriving and using machines \nAfter administration of Daronrix, it is unlikely that side effects would unable you to drive or use \nmachines. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Daronrix \nThiomersal (preservative) is present in this product, and it is possible that you may experience an \nallergic reaction. \n \n \n3. HOW IS DARONRIX GIVEN \n \nAdults from the age of 18 to 60 years will receive two injections of Daronrix, the first injection will be \nadministered at an elected date, the second at least three weeks after the first injection. \n \nThere is no information on the use of Daronrix below 18 years of age.  Your doctor needs to assess the \nbenefits and potential risks of giving you the vaccine if you are below the age of 18 years. \n \nThe doctor will give Daronrix as an injection into your upper arm muscle.   \n \nThe vaccine should never be given into a vein. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Daronrix can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n♦ Very common (more than 1 per 10 doses of vaccine): \n\n• Headache \n• Fatigue \n• Pain and redness at the injection site \n\n \n♦ Common (less than 1 per 10 but more than 1 per 100 doses of vaccine): \n\n• Increased sweating, bruising \n• Aching muscles, joint pain \n• Swelling at the injection site, hard lump \n• Shivering, fever \n\n \n♦ Uncommon (less than 1 per 100 but more than 1 per 1000 doses of vaccine): \n\n• Sore nose and throat and discomfort when swallowing, runny nose \n• Itching at the injection site \n\n \nThese reactions usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n  40 \n\nOther side effects which have occurred in the days or weeks after vaccination with ordinary flu \nvaccines include: \n \n♦ Uncommon (less than 1 per 100 but more than 1 per 1000 doses of vaccine): \n\n• Generalised skin reactions such as itching, hives or rash \n \n♦ Rare (less than 1 per 1000 but more than 1 per 10,000 doses of vaccine): \n\n• Severe stabbing or throbbing pain along one or more nerves \n• Pins and needles \n• Fits \n• Low blood platelet count \n• Allergic reactions leading to a dangerous decrease of blood pressure, which, if untreated, \n\nmay lead to collapse, coma and death \n \n♦ Very rare (less than 1 per 10,000 doses of vaccine): \n\n• Narrowing or blockage of blood vessels with kidney problems \n• Inflammation of the brain and spinal column \n• Painful swelling in the arms or legs \n• Temporary inflammation of the nerves, causing pain, weakness and paralysis in the \n\nextremities and often progressing to the chest and face. \n \nDo not be alarmed by this list of possible side effects.  It is possible that you have no side effects from \nvaccination. \n \nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please \ntell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n5. HOW TO STORE DARONRIX \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children. \n \nDo not use Daronrix after the expiry date which is stated on the carton.  The expiry date refers to the \nlast day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C).  \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \nDo not freeze.   \n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste.  Ask your pharmacist how to \ndispose of medicines no longer required.  These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6.

Signs of an \nallergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or \ntongue.
