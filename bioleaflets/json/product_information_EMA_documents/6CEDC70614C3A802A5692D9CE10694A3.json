This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nGrasustek 6 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 6 mg of pegfilgrastim* in 0.6 ml solution for injection. The \nconcentration is 10 mg/ml based on protein only**. \n \n*Produced in Escherichia coli cells by recombinant DNA technology followed by conjugation with \npolyethylene glycol (PEG). \n** The concentration is 20 mg/ml if the PEG moiety is included. \n \nThe potency of this product should not be compared to the potency of another pegylated or non-\npegylated protein of the same therapeutic class. For more information, see section 5.1. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 30 mg sorbitol (E 420) (see section 4.4). \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nClear, colourless solution for injection. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nReduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients \ntreated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia \nand myelodysplastic syndromes). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPegfilgrastim therapy should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in oncology and/or \nhaematology. \n \nPosology \n \nOne 6 mg dose (a single pre-filled syringe) of pegfilgrastim is recommended for each chemotherapy \ncycle, given at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nNo dose adjustment is recommended in patients with renal impairment, including those with end-stage \nrenal disease. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim in children has not yet been established. Currently available \ndata are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no dosing recommendations can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nGrasustek is injected subcutaneously. The injections should be given in the thigh, abdomen or upper \narm.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active ingredient or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nLimited clinical data suggest a comparable effect on time to recovery from severe neutropenia for \npegfilgrastim to filgrastim in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (see section 5.1). \nHowever, the long-term effects of pegfilgrastim have not been established in AML; therefore, it \nshould be used with caution in this patient population. \n \nGranulocyte-colony stimulating factor can promote growth of myeloid cells in vitro and similar effects \nmay be seen on some non-myeloid cells in vitro. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim have not been investigated in patients with myelodysplastic \nsyndrome, chronic myelogenous leukaemia, and in patients with secondary AML; therefore, it should \nnot be used in such patients. Particular care should be taken to distinguish the diagnosis of blast \ntransformation of chronic myeloid leukaemia from AML. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim administration in de novo AML patients aged < 55 years with \ncytogenetics t (15;17) have not been established. \n \nGeneral \n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim have not been investigated in patients receiving high-dose \nchemotherapy. This medicinal product should not be used to increase the dose of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy beyond established dose regimens. \n \nPulmonary adverse events \n \nPulmonary adverse reactions, in particular interstitial pneumonia, have been reported after G-CSF \nadministration. Patients with a recent history of pulmonary infiltrates or pneumonia may be at higher \nrisk (see section 4.8). \n \nThe onset of pulmonary signs such as cough, fever, and dyspnoea in association with radiological \nsigns of pulmonary infiltrates, and deterioration in pulmonary function along with increased neutrophil \ncount may be preliminary signs of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). In such \ncircumstances, pegfilgrastim should be discontinued at the discretion of the doctor and the appropriate \ntreatment given (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nGlomerulonephritis \n \nGlomerulonephritis has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim and pegfilgrastim. Generally, \nevents of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose reduction or discontinuation of filgrastim and \npegfilgrastim. Urinalysis monitoring is recommended. \n \nCapillary leak syndrome \n \nCapillary leak syndrome has been reported after granulocyte-colony stimulating factor administration \nand is characterised by hypotension, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema and haemoconcentration. Patients \nwho develop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard \nsymptomatic treatment, which may include the need for intensive care (see section 4.8). \n \nSplenomegaly and splenic rupture \n \nGenerally asymptomatic cases of splenomegaly and cases of splenic rupture, including some fatal \ncases, have been reported following administration of pegfilgrastim (see section 4.8). Therefore, \nspleen size should be carefully monitored (e.g. clinical examination, ultrasound). A diagnosis of \nsplenic rupture should be considered in patients reporting left upper abdominal pain or shoulder tip \npain. \n \nThrombocytopenia and anaemia \n \nTreatment with pegfilgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia because full \ndose myelosuppressive chemotherapy is maintained on the prescribed schedule. Regular monitoring of \nplatelet count and haematocrit is recommended. Special care should be taken when administering \nsingle or combination chemotherapeutic medicinal products which are known to cause severe \nthrombocytopenia. \n \nSickle cell anaemia \n \nSickle cell crises have been associated with the use of pegfilgrastim in patients with sickle cell trait or \nsickle cell disease (see section 4.8). Therefore, doctors should use caution when prescribing \npegfilgrastim in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease, should monitor appropriate clinical \nparameters and laboratory status and be attentive to the possible association of this medicinal product \nwith splenic enlargement and vaso-occlusive crisis. \n \nLeucocytosis \n \nWhite blood cell (WBC) counts of 100 x 109/L or greater have been observed in less than 1 % of \npatients receiving pegfilgrastim. No adverse events directly attributable to this degree of leucocytosis \nhave been reported. Such elevation in white blood cells is transient, typically seen 24 to 48 hours after \nadministration and is consistent with the pharmacodynamic effects of this medicinal product. \nConsistent with the clinical effects and the potential for leucocytosis, a WBC count should be \nperformed at regular intervals during therapy. If leukocyte counts exceed 50 x 109/L after the expected \nnadir, this medicinal product should be discontinued immediately. \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nHypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reactions, occurring during initial or subsequent treatment \nhave been reported in patients treated with pegfilgrastim. Pegfilgrastim should be permanently \ndiscontinued in patients with clinically significant hypersensitivity. Pegfilgrastim should not be \nadministered to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to pegfilgrastim or filgrastim. If a serious \nallergic reaction occurs, appropriate therapy should be administered, with close patient follow-up over \nseveral days. \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\n \nStevens-Johnson syndrome \n \nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, has been reported rarely in \nassociation with pegfilgrastim treatment. If the patient has developed SJS with the use of \npegfilgrastim, treatment with pegfilgrastim must not be restarted in this patient at any time. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Rates of generation of \nantibodies against pegfilgrastim are generally low. Binding antibodies do occur as expected with all \nbiologics; however, they have not been associated with neutralising activity at present. \n \nAortitis \n \nAortitis has been reported after G-CSF administration in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. The \nsymptoms experienced included fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory \nmarkers (e.g. c-reactive protein and white blood cell count). In most cases aortitis was diagnosed by \nCT scan and generally resolved after discontinuation of GCSF. See also section 4.8. \n \nOther warnings \n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim for the mobilisation of blood progenitor cells in patients or \nhealthy donors has not been adequately evaluated. \n \nIncreased haematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been \nassociated with transient positive bone imaging findings. This should be considered when interpreting \nbone-imaging results. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains 30 mg sorbitol in each 6 mg dose which is equivalent to 50 mg/ml.  \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 6 mg dose, i.e. it is essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDue to the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy‚ \npegfilgrastim should be administered at least 24 hours after administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. \nIn clinical trials, pegfilgrastim has been safely administered 14 days before chemotherapy. \nConcomitant use of pegfilgrastim with any chemotherapy medicinal product has not been evaluated in \npatients. In animal models, concomitant administration of pegfilgrastim and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or \nother antimetabolites has been shown to potentiate myelosuppression.  \n \nPossible interactions with other haematopoietic growth factors and cytokines have not been \nspecifically investigated in clinical trials. \n \nThe potential for interaction with lithium, which also promotes the release of neutrophils, has not been \nspecifically investigated. There is no evidence that such an interaction would be harmful. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Grasustek have not been evaluated in patients receiving chemotherapy \nassociated with delayed myelosuppression e.g., nitrosoureas. \n \nSpecific interaction or metabolism studies have not been performed; however, clinical trials have not \nindicated an interaction of pegfilgrastim with any other medicinal products. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited data on the use of pegfilgrastim in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Grasustek is not recommended during pregnancy and in \nwomen of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere is insufficient information on the excretion of pegfilgrastim / metabolites in breast milk. \nTherefore a risk for new-borns/infants cannot be ruled out. A decision must be made whether to \ndiscontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Grasustek therapy taking into account the \nbenefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the mother. \n \nFertility \n \nPegfilgrastim did not affect reproductive performance or fertility in male or female rats at cumulative \nweekly doses approximately 6 to 9 times higher than the recommended human dose (based on body \nsurface area) (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPegfilgrastim has no or a negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were bone pain (very common [≥ 1/10]) and \nmusculoskeletal pain (common). Bone pain was generally of mild to moderate severity, transient and \ncould be controlled in most patients with standard analgesics. \n \nHypersensitivity-type reactions, including skin rash, urticaria, angiooedema, dyspnoea, erythema, \nflushing, and hypotension occurred on initial or subsequent treatment with pegfilgrastim (uncommon \n[≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100]). Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis can occur in patients \nreceiving pegfilgrastim (uncommon) (see section 4.4). \n \nCapillary Leak Syndrome, which can be life-threatening if treatment is delayed, has been reported as \nuncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy following \nadministration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors; see section 4.4 and section “Description of \nselected adverse reactions” below. \n \nSplenomegaly, generally asymptomatic, is uncommon. \n \nSplenic rupture including some fatal cases is uncommonly reported following administration of \npegfilgrastim (see section 4.4). \n \nUncommon pulmonary adverse reactions including interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, \npulmonary infiltrates and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported.

The frequency category was estimated from a statistical calculation based upon 1,576 \npatients receiving pegfilgrastim in nine randomised clinical trials. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nUncommon cases of Sweet's syndrome have been reported, although in some cases underlying \nhaematological malignancies may play a role. \n \nUncommon events of cutaneous vasculitis have been reported in patients treated with pegfilgrastim. \nThe mechanism of vasculitis in patients receiving pegfilgrastim is unknown. \n \nInjection site reactions, including injection-site erythema (uncommon) as well as injection-site pain \n(common events) have occurred during initial or subsequent treatment with pegfilgrastim. \n \nCommon cases of leucocytosis (White Blood Count [WBC] > 100 x 109/l) have been reported (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nReversible, mild to moderate elevations in uric acid and alkaline phosphatase, with no associated \nclinical effects, were uncommon; reversible, mild to moderate elevations in lactate dehydrogenase, \nwith no associated clinical effects, were uncommon in patients receiving pegfilgrastim following \ncytotoxic chemotherapy. \n \nNausea and headaches were very commonly observed in patients receiving chemotherapy. \n \nUncommon elevations in liver function tests (LFTs) for ALT (alanine aminotransferase) or AST \n(aspartate aminotransferase), have been observed in patients after receiving pegfilgrastim following \ncytotoxic chemotherapy. These elevations are transient and return to baseline. \n \nCommon cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported. \n \nCases of capillary leak syndrome have been reported in the post marketing setting with granulocyte \ncolony-stimulating factor use. These have generally occurred in patients with advanced malignant \ndiseases, sepsis, taking multiple chemotherapy medicinal products or undergoing apheresis (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nExperience in children is limited. A higher frequency of serious adverse reactions in younger children \naged 0-5 years (92 %) has been observed compared to older children aged 6-11 and 12-21 years \nrespectively (80 % and 67 %) and adults. The most common adverse reaction reported was bone pain \n(see section 5.1 and 5.2).  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSingle doses of 300 μg/kg have been administered subcutaneously to a limited number of healthy \nvolunteers and patients with non-small cell lung cancer without serious adverse reactions. The adverse \nevents were similar to those in subjects receiving lower doses of pegfilgrastim. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1. Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, colony stimulating factors; ATC Code: L03AA13. \n \nGrasustek is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nHuman granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a glycoprotein, which regulates the \nproduction and release of neutrophils from the bone marrow. Pegfilgrastim is a covalent conjugate of \nrecombinant human G-CSF (r-metHuG-CSF) with a single 20 kd polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule. \nPegfilgrastim is a sustained duration form of filgrastim due to decreased renal clearance. Pegfilgrastim \nand filgrastim have been shown to have identical modes of action, causing a marked increase in \nperipheral blood neutrophil counts within 24 hours, with minor increases in monocytes and/or \nlymphocytes. Similar to filgrastim, neutrophils produced in response to pegfilgrastim show normal or \nenhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic function. As with other \nhaematopoietic growth factors, G-CSF has shown in vitro stimulating properties on human endothelial \ncells. G-CSF can promote growth of myeloid cells, including malignant cells, in vitro and similar \neffects may be seen on some non-myeloid cells in vitro. \n \nIn two randomised, double-blind, pivotal studies in patients with high risk stage II-IV breast cancer \nundergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin and docetaxel, use of \npegfilgrastim, as a single once per cycle dose, reduced the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of \nfebrile neutropenia similarly to that observed with daily administrations of filgrastim (a median of \n11 daily administrations). In the absence of growth factor support, this regimen has been reported to \nresult in a mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia of 5 to7 days, and a 30-40 % incidence of febrile \nneutropenia. In one study (n = 157), which used a 6 mg fixed dose of pegfilgrastim the mean duration \nof grade 4  neutropenia for the pegfilgrastim group was 1.8 days compared with 1.6  days in the \nfilgrastim group (difference 0.23 days, 95 % CI -0.15, 0.63). Over the entire study, the rate of febrile \nneutropenia was 13 % of pegfilgrastim-treated patients compared with 20 % of filgrastim-treated \npatients (difference 7 %, 95 % CI of-19 %, 5 %). In a second study (n = 310), which used a \nweight-adjusted dose (100  μg /kg), the mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia for the pegfilgrastim \ngroup was 1.7 days, compared with 1.8 days in the filgrastim group (difference 0.03 days, 95 % CI \n-0.36, 0.30).  \n \nThe overall rate of febrile neutropenia was 9 % of patients treated with pegfilgrastim and 18 % of \npatients treated with filgrastim (difference 9 %, 95 % CI of-16.8 %,-1.1 %). \n \nIn a placebo-controlled, double blind study in patients with breast cancer the effect of pegfilgrastim on \nthe incidence of febrile neutropenia was evaluated following administration of a chemotherapy \nregimen associated with a febrile neutropenia rate of 10-20 % (docetaxel 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for \n4 cycles). Nine hundred and twenty-eight patients were randomised to receive either a single dose of \npegfilgrastim or placebo approximately 24 hours (day 2) after chemotherapy in each cycle. The \nincidence of febrile neutropenia was lower for patients randomised to receive pegfilgrastim compared \nwith placebo (1% versus 17 %, p < 0.001). The incidence of hospitalisations and intravenous \nanti-infective use associated with a clinical diagnosis of febrile neutropenia was lower in the \npegfilgrastim group compared with placebo (1 % versus 14 %, p < 0.001; and 2 % versus 10 %, p < \n0.001). \n \nA small (n = 83), Phase II, randomised, double-blind study in patients receiving chemotherapy for de \nnovo acute myeloid leukaemia compared pegfilgrastim (single dose of 6 mg) with filgrastim, \nadministered during induction chemotherapy. Median time to recovery from severe neutropenia was \nestimated as 22 days in both treatment groups. Long-term outcome was not studied (see section 4.4). \n \nIn a phase II (n = 37) multicentre, randomised, open-label study of paediatric sarcoma patients \nreceiving 100 μg/kg pegfilgrastim following cycle 1 of vincristine, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n10 \n \n\n(VAdriaC/IE) chemotherapy, a longer duration of severe neutropenia (neutrophils < 0.5 x 109) was \nobserved in younger children aged 0-5 years (8.9 days) compared to older children aged 6-11 years \nand 12-21 years (6 days and 3.7 days, respectively) and adults. Additionally, a higher incidence of \nfebrile neutropenia was observed in younger children aged 0-5 years (75 %) compared to older \nchildren aged 6-11 years and 12-21 years (70 % and 33 %, respectively) and adults (see sections 4.8 \nand 5.2). \n \n5.2. Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAfter a single subcutaneous dose of pegfilgrastim, the peak serum concentration of pegfilgrastim \noccurs at 16 to 120 hours after dosing and serum concentrations of pegfilgrastim are maintained \nduring the period of neutropenia after myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The elimination of \npegfilgrastim is non-linear with respect to dose; serum clearance of pegfilgrastim decreases with \nincreasing dose. Pegfilgrastim appears to be mainly eliminated by neutrophil mediated clearance, \nwhich becomes saturated at higher doses. Consistent with a self-regulating clearance mechanism, the \nserum concentration of pegfilgrastim declines rapidly at the onset of neutrophil recovery (see figure \n1). \n \n\nFigure 1. Profile of median pegfilgrastim serum concentration and absolute neutrophil count \n(ANC) in chemotherapy treated patients after a single 6 mg injection \n\n \n\n \nDue to the neutrophil-mediated clearance mechanism, the pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim is not \nexpected to be affected by renal or hepatic impairment. In an open label, single dose study (n = 31) \nvarious stages of renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease, had no impact on the \npharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim. \n \nElderly \n \nLimited data suggest that the pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim in elderly subjects (> 65 years) is \nsimilar to that in adults. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim were studied in 37 paediatric patients with sarcoma, who \nreceived 100 μg/kg pegfilgrastim after the completion of VAdriaC/IE chemotherapy. The youngest \nage group (0-5 years) had a higher mean exposure to pegfilgrastim (AUC) (± Standard Deviation) \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n(47.9 ± 22.5 μg·hr/ml) than older children aged 6-11 years and 12-21 years (22.0 ± 13.1 μg·hr/ml and \n29.3 ± 23.2 μg·hr/ml, respectively) (see section 5.1). With the exception of the youngest age group \n(0 5 years), the mean AUC in paediatric subjects appeared similar to that for adult patients with \nhigh-risk stage II-IV breast cancer and receiving 100 μg/kg pegfilgrastim after the completion of \ndoxorubicin/docetaxel (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n5.3. Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data from conventional studies of repeated dose toxicity revealed the expected \npharmacological effects including increases in leukocyte count, myeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow, \nextramedullary haematopoiesis and splenic enlargement. \n \nThere were no adverse effects observed in offspring of pregnant rats given pegfilgrastim \nsubcutaneously, but in rabbits pegfilgrastim has been shown to cause embryo/foetal toxicity (embryo \nloss) at cumulative doses approximately 4 times the recommended human dose, which were not seen \nwhen pregnant rabbits were exposed to the recommended human dose. In rat studies, it was shown that \npegfilgrastim may cross the placenta. Studies in rats indicated that reproductive performance, fertility, \noestrous cycling, days between pairing and coitus, and intrauterine survival were unaffected by \npegfilgrastim given subcutaneously. The relevance of these findings for humans is not known. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

What you need to know before you use Grasustek \n3. How to use Grasustek \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Grasustek \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Grasustek is and what it is used for \n \nGrasustek is for use in adults aged 18 and over. \n \nGrasustek contains the active substance pegfilgrastim. Pegfilgrastim is a protein produced by \nbiotechnology in bacteria called E. coli. It belongs to a group of proteins called cytokines and is very \nsimilar to a natural protein (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) produced by your own body. \n \nGrasustek is used to reduce the duration of neutropenia (low white blood cell count) and the \noccurrence of febrile neutropenia (low white blood cell count with a fever) which can be caused by the \nuse of cytotoxic chemotherapy (medicines that destroy rapidly growing cells). White blood cells are \nimportant as they help your body fight infection. These cells are very sensitive to the effects of \nchemotherapy which can cause the number of these cells in your body to decrease. If white blood cells \nfall to a low level, there may not be enough left in the body to fight bacteria and you may have an \nincreased risk of infection. \n \nYour doctor has given you Grasustek to encourage your bone marrow (part of the bone which makes \nblood cells) to produce more white blood cells that help your body fight infection. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Grasustek \n \nDo not use Grasustek \n• if you are allergic to pegfilgrastim, filgrastim, E. coli derived proteins, or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Grasustek: \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\n \n• if you experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty   \n\nbreathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), redness and flushing, skin rash and areas of the \nskin that itch \n\n• if you experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing. This can be a sign of Acute \nRespiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) \n\n• if you have any of the following or combination of the following side effects: \n­ swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, \n\ndifficulty breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of \ntiredness. These could be symptoms of condition called “Capillary Leak Syndrome” \nwhich causes blood to leak from the small blood vessels into your body (see section 4). \n\n• If you get left upper abdominal pain or pain at the tip of your shoulder. This may be a sign of a \nproblem with your spleen (splenomegaly) \n\n• If you have recently had a serious lung infection (pneumonia), fluid in the lungs (pulmonary \noedema), inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease) or an abnormal chest x-ray (lung \ninfiltration) \n\n• If you are aware of any altered blood cell counts (e.g. increase in white blood cells or anaemia) \nor decreased blood platelet counts, which reduces the ability of your blood to clot \n(thrombocytopenia). Your doctor may want to monitor you more closely \n\n• If you have sickle cell anaemia. Your doctor may monitor your condition more closely. \n• if you have sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the \n\nface, lips, tongue or other parts of the body, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing. \nThese could be signs of a severe allergic reaction. \n\n• Inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the \nbody) has been reported rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors. The symptoms can include \nfever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory markers.

The number of cases is small, but because of the seriousness of \nthe ADR, the PRAC recommends that the Product Information should be updated accordingly. \n \nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n \nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n \nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for pegfilgrastim the CHMP is of the opinion that the \nbenefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing pegfilgrastim is unchanged subject to the \nproposed changes to the product information. \n \nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
