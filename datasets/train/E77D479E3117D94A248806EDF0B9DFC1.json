QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach hard capsule contains 5 mg temozolomide. \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach hard capsule contains 30.97 mg of lactose. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule (capsule). \n \nHard gelatin capsules, with white opaque cap and body, imprinted in green ink. The cap is imprinted \nwith \u2018890\u2019. The body is imprinted with \u20185 mg\u2019 and two stripes. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTemozolomide SUN is indicated for the treatment of: \n- adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy \n\n(RT) and subsequently as monotherapy treatment. \n- children from the age of three years, adolescents and adult patients with malignant glioma, such \n\nas glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma, showing recurrence or progression after \nstandard therapy. \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTemozolomide SUN should only be prescribed by physicians experienced in the oncological treatment \nof brain tumours. \n \nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nTemozolomide SUN is administered in combination with focal radiotherapy (concomitant phase) \nfollowed by up to 6 cycles of temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy (monotherapy phase). \n \nConcomitant phase \n \nTMZ is administered orally at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 42 days concomitant with focal \nradiotherapy (60 Gy administered in 30 fractions). No dose reductions are recommended, but delay or \ndiscontinuation of TMZ administration should be decided weekly according to haematological and \nnon-haematological toxicity criteria. TMZ administration can be continued throughout the 42 day \nconcomitant period (up to 49 days) if all of the following conditions are met: \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\n- absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 109/l \n- thrombocyte count \u2265 100 x 109/l \n- common toxicity criteria (CTC) non-haematological toxicity \u2264 Grade 1 (except for alopecia, \n\nnausea and vomiting). \n \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained weekly. TMZ administration should be \ntemporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued during the concomitant phase according to the \nhaematological and non-haematological toxicity criteria as noted in Table 1. \n \n\n Table 1. TMZ dosing interruption or discontinuation during concomitant radiotherapy and TMZ \nToxicity TMZ interruptiona TMZ discontinuation \nAbsolute neutrophil count \u2265 0.5 and < 1.5 x 109/l  < 0.5 x 109/l \nThrombocyte count \u2265 10 and < 100 x 109/l < 10 x 109/l \nCTC non-haematological \ntoxicity (except for alopecia, \nnausea, vomiting) \n\nCTC \nGrade 2 \n\nCTC Grade 3 or 4 \n \n\na: Treatment with concomitant TMZ can be continued when all of the following conditions are met: \n absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1.5 x 109/l; thrombocyte count \u2265 100 x 109/l; CTC non-haematological \n toxicity \u2264 Grade 1 (except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting). \n \nMonotherapy phase \n \nFour weeks after completing the TMZ + RT concomitant phase, TMZ is administered for up to 6 \ncycles of monotherapy treatment. Dose in Cycle 1 (monotherapy) is 150 mg/m2 once daily for 5 days \nfollowed by 23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, the dose is escalated to 200 mg/m2 if \nthe CTC non-haematological toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade \u2264 2 (except for alopecia, nausea and \nvomiting), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is \u2265 1.5 x 109/l, and the thrombocyte count is \n\u2265 100 x 109/l. If the dose was not escalated at Cycle 2, escalation should not be done in subsequent \ncycles. Once escalated, the dose remains at 200 mg/m2 per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent \ncycle except if toxicity occurs. Dose reductions and discontinuations during the monotherapy phase \nshould be applied according to Tables 2 and 3. \n \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose of \nTMZ). The dose should be reduced or administration discontinued according to Table 3. \n \n Table 2.

In patients previously untreated with chemotherapy, TMZ is \nadministered orally at a dose of 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days followed by a 23 day \ntreatment interruption (total of 28 days). In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the initial \ndose is 150 mg/m2 once daily, to be increased in the second cycle to 200 mg/m2 once daily, for 5 days \nif there is no haematological toxicity (see section 4.4) \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn patients 3 years of age or older, TMZ is only to be used in recurrent or progressive malignant \nglioma. Experience in these children is very limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The safety and efficacy \nof TMZ in children under the age of 3 years have not been established. No data are available. \n \nPatients with hepatic or renal impairment \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of TMZ were comparable in patients with normal hepatic function and in those \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on the administration of TMZ in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child\u2019s Class C) or with renal impairment. Based on the \npharmacokinetic properties of TMZ, it is unlikely that dose reductions are required in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment or any degree of renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised \nwhen TMZ is administered in these patients. \n \nElderly patients \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 19-78 years of age, clearance of TMZ is \nnot affected by age. However, elderly patients (> 70 years of age) appear to be at increased risk of \nneutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTemozolomide SUN should be administered in the fasting state. \n \nThe capsules must be swallowed whole with a glass of water and must not be opened or chewed. \n \nIf vomiting occurs after the dose is administered, a second dose should not be administered that day. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC). \n \nSevere myelosuppression (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nOpportunistic infections and reactivation of infections \n \nOpportunistic infections (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) and reactivation of infections \n(such as HBV, CMV) have been observed during the treatment with TMZ (see section 4.8). \n \nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia \n \nPatients who received concomitant TMZ and RT in a pilot trial for the prolonged 42-day schedule \nwere shown to be at particular risk for developing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Thus, \nprophylaxis against PCP is required for all patients receiving concomitant TMZ and RT for the 42-day \nregimen (with a maximum of 49 days) regardless of lymphocyte count. If lymphopenia occurs, they \nare to continue the prophylaxis until recovery of lymphopenia to grade \u2264 1. \n \nThere may be a higher occurrence of PCP when TMZ is administered during a longer dosing regimen. \nHowever, all patients receiving TMZ, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed \nclosely for the development of PCP, regardless of the regimen. Cases of fatal respiratory failure have \nbeen reported in patients using TMZ, in particular in combination with dexamethasone or other \nsteroids. \n \nHepatitis B virus \n \nHepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in death, has been \nreported. Experts in liver disease should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with \npositive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease). During treatment patients should be \nmonitored and managed appropriately. \n \nHepatotoxicity \n \nHepatic injury, including fatal hepatic failure, has been reported in patients treated with TMZ (see \nsection 4.8). Baseline liver function tests should be performed prior to treatment initiation. If \nabnormal, physicians should assess the benefit/risk prior to initiating temozolomide including the \npotential for fatal hepatic failure. For patients on a 42 day treatment cycle liver function tests should \nbe repeated midway during this cycle. For all patients, liver function tests should be checked after each \ntreatment cycle. For patients with significant liver function abnormalities, physicians should assess the \nbenefit/risk of continuing treatment. Liver toxicity may occur several weeks or more after the last \ntreatment with temozolomide. \n \nMeningoencephalitis herpetic \n \nIn post-marketing cases, meningoencephalitis herpetic (including fatal cases) has been observed in \npatients receiving TMZ in combination with radiotherapy, including cases of concomitant steroids \nadministration. \n \nMalignancies \n \nCases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukaemia, have \nalso been reported very rarely (see section 4.8). \n \nAnti-emetic therapy \n \nNausea and vomiting are very commonly associated with TMZ. \nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered prior to or following administration of TMZ. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nAnti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the initial dose of concomitant phase and it is \nstrongly recommended during the monotherapy phase. \n \nPatients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \nPatients who have experienced severe (Grade 3 or 4) vomiting in previous treatment cycles may \nrequire anti-emetic therapy. \n \nLaboratory parameters \n \nPatients treated with TMZ may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, \nwhich may result in aplastic anaemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some \ncases, exposure to concomitant medicinal products associated with aplastic anaemia, including \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to \ndosing, the following laboratory parameters must be met: ANC \u2265 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count \n\u2265 100 x 109/l. A complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or \nwithin 48 hours of that day, and weekly until ANC > 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count > 100 x 109/l. If \nANC falls to < 1.0 x 109/l or the platelet count is < 50 x 109/l during any cycle, the next cycle should \nbe reduced one dose level (see section 4.2). Dose levels include 100 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and \n200 mg/m2. The lowest recommended dose is 100 mg/m2. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is no clinical experience with use of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years. Experience in \nolder children and adolescents is very limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \nElderly patients (> 70 years of age) \n \nElderly patients appear to be at increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, compared with \nyounger patients. Therefore, special care should be taken when TMZ is administered in elderly \npatients. \n \nMale patients \n \nMen being treated with TMZ should be advised not to father a child up to 6 months after receiving the \nlast dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment (see section 4.6). \n \nLactose \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn a separate phase I study, administration of TMZ with ranitidine did not result in alterations in the \nextent of absorption of temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite monomethyl \ntriazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). \n \nAdministration of TMZ with food resulted in a 33 % decrease in Cmax and a 9 % decrease in area under \nthe curve (AUC). \nAs it cannot be excluded that the change in Cmax is clinically significant, Temozolomide SUN should \nbe administered without food. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\n \nBased on an analysis of population pharmacokinetics in phase II trials, co-administration of \ndexamethasone, prochlorperazine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2 receptor antagonists, or \nphenobarbital did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co-administration with valproic acid was associated \nwith a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ. \n \nNo studies have been conducted to determine the effect of TMZ on the metabolism or elimination of \nother medicinal products. However, since TMZ does not undergo hepatic metabolism and exhibits low \nprotein binding, it is unlikely that it would affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products \n(see section 5.2). \n \nUse of TMZ in combination with other myelosuppressive agents may increase the likelihood of \nmyelosuppression. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy \nwhile they are receiving TMZ. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data in pregnant women. In preclinical studies in rats and rabbits receiving 150 mg/m2 \nTMZ, teratogenicity and/or foetal toxicity were demonstrated (see section 5.3). Temozolomide SUN \nshould not be administered to pregnant women. If use during pregnancy must be considered, the \npatient should be apprised of the potential risk to the foetus.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether TMZ is excreted in human milk; thus, breast-feeding should be discontinued \nwhile receiving treatment with TMZ. \n \nMale fertility \n \nTMZ can have genotoxic effects. Therefore, men being treated with it should be advised not to father a \nchild up to 6 months after receiving the last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm \nprior to treatment, because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with TMZ. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTMZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to fatigue and somnolence (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn patients treated with TMZ, whether used in combination with RT or as monotherapy following RT \nfor newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme, or as monotherapy in patients with recurrent or \nprogressive glioma, the reported very common adverse reactions were similar: nausea, vomiting, \nconstipation, anorexia, headache and fatigue. Convulsions were reported very commonly in the newly-\ndiagnosed glioblastoma multiforme patients receiving monotherapy, and rash was reported very \ncommonly in newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme patients receiving TMZ concurrent with RT \nand also as monotherapy, and commonly in recurrent glioma. Most haematologic adverse reactions \nwere reported commonly or very commonly in both indications (Tables 4 and 5), the frequency of \ngrade 3-4 laboratory findings is presented after each table. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn the tables undesirable effects are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. \nFrequency groupings are defined according to the following convention: very common (\u2265 1/10); \ncommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very \nrare (<1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \nNewly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nTable 4 provides treatment-emergent adverse events in patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma \nmultiforme during the concomitant and monotherapy phases of treatment. \n \n\nTable 4.

toxicity for \nmost cytotoxic agents, including TMZ, was observed. When laboratory abnormalities and adverse \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nevents were combined across concomitant and monotherapy treatment phases, Grade 3 or Grade 4 \nneutrophil abnormalities including neutropenic events were observed in 8 % of the patients. Grade 3 or \nGrade 4 thrombocyte abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic events were observed in 14 % of the \npatients who received TMZ. \n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \nIn clinical trials, the most frequently occurring treatment-related undesirable effects were \ngastrointestinal disorders, specifically nausea (43 %) and vomiting (36 %). These reactions were \nusually Grade 1 or 2 (0-5 episodes of vomiting in 24 hours) and were either self-limiting or readily \ncontrolled with standard anti-emetic therapy. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting was 4 %. \n \nTable 5 includes adverse reactions reported during clinical trials for recurrent or progressive malignant \nglioma and following the marketing of Temozolomide SUN. \n \n\nTable 5. Adverse reactions in patients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma \nInfections and infestations \nRare: Opportunistic infections, including PCP \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nVery common: Neutropenia or lymphopenia (grade 3-4), \n\nthrombocytopenia (grade 3-4) \nUncommon: Pancytopenia, anaemia (grade 3-4), leukopenia \n\n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nVery common: Anorexia \nCommon: Weight decrease \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \nCommon: Somnolence, dizziness, paresthesia \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nCommon: Dyspnoea \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common: Vomiting, nausea, constipation \nCommon: Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Rash, pruritus, alopecia \nVery rare: Erythema multiforme, erythroderma, urticaria, \n\nexanthema \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Fatigue \nCommon: Fever, asthenia, rigors, malaise, pain, taste \n\nperversion \nVery rare: Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, \n\nangioedema \n \nLaboratory results \n \nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 19 % and 17 % respectively, of patients \ntreated for malignant glioma. This led to hospitalisation and/or discontinuation of TMZ in 8 % and \n4 %, respectively. Myelosuppression was predictable (usually within the first few cycles, with the \nnadir between Day 21 and Day 28), and recovery was rapid, usually within 1-2 weeks. No evidence of \ncumulative myelosuppression was observed. The presence of thrombocytopenia may increase the risk \nof bleeding, and the presence of neutropenia or leukopenia may increase the risk of infection. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nOther special populations \n \nGender \n \nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis of clinical trial experience there were 101 female and 169 \nmale subjects for whom nadir neutrophil counts were available and 110 female and 174 male subjects \nfor whom nadir platelet counts were available. There were higher rates of Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC \n< 0.5 x 109/l), 12 % vs 5 %, and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/l ), 9 % vs 3 %, in women vs men in the \nfirst cycle of therapy. In a 400 subject recurrent glioma data set, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 8 % \nof female vs 4 % of male subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 8 % of female vs 3 % of male \nsubjects in the first cycle of therapy. In a study of 288 subjects with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma \nmultiforme, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 3 % of female vs 0 % of male subjects and Grade 4 \nthrombocytopenia in 1 % of female vs 0 % of male subjects in the first cycle of therapy. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Although \nthe data is limited, tolerance in children is expected to be the same as in adults. The safety of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years has not been established. \n \nPost-marketing experience \n \nThe following additional serious adverse reactions have been identified during post-marketing \nexposure: \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nTable 6. Summary of events reported with temozolomide in the post-marketing setting* \n \nInfections and infestations* \nUncommon: cytomegalovirus infection, infection reactivation such \n\nas cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus\u2020, \nmeningoencephalitis herpetic\u2020, sepsis\u2020  \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders  \n\nVery rare: prolonged pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia\u2020 \nNeoplasm benign, malignant and unspecified \nVery rare: myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), secondary \n\nmalignancies, including myeloid leukaemia \nEndocrine disorders* \nUncommon: diabetes insipidus \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nVery rare: interstitial pneumonitis/pneumonitis, pulmonary \n\nfibrosis, respiratory failure\u2020 \nHepatobiliary disorders* \nCommon: liver enzymes elevations \n\n \nUncommon: hyperbilirubinemia, cholestasis, hepatitis  \n\nhepatic injury, hepatic failure\u2020 \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery rare: toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome \nFrequency not known: drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic \n\nsymptoms (DRESS) \n\u2020 Including cases with fatal outcome \n* Frequencies estimated based on relevant clinical trials. \n \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses of 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 mg/m2 (total dose per cycle over 5 days) have been evaluated \nclinically in patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was haematological and was reported with any dose but is \nexpected to be more severe at higher doses. An overdose of 10,000 mg (total dose in a single cycle, \nover 5 days) was taken by one patient and the adverse reactions reported were pancytopenia, pyrexia, \nmultiorgan failure and death. There are reports of patients who have taken the recommended dose for \nmore than 5 days of treatment (up to 64 days) with adverse events reported including bone marrow \nsuppression, with or without infection, in some cases severe and prolonged and resulting in death. In \nthe event of an overdose, haematological evaluation is needed. Supportive measures should be \nprovided as necessary. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other alkylating agents, ATC code: L01A X03. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTemozolomide is a triazene, which undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiologic pH to the \nactive monomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to \nbe due primarily to alkylation at the O6 position of guanine with additional alkylation also occurring at \nthe N7 position. Cytotoxic lesions that develop subsequently are thought to involve aberrant repair of \nthe methyl adduct. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nNewly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nA total of 573 patients were randomised to receive either TMZ + RT (n=287) or RT alone (n=286). \nPatients in the TMZ + RT arm received concomitant TMZ (75 mg/m2) once daily, starting the first day \nof RT until the last day of RT, for 42 days (with a maximum of 49 days). This was followed by \nmonotherapy TMZ (150-200 mg/m2) on Days 1-5 of every 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles, starting 4 \nweeks after the end of RT. Patients in the control arm received RT only. Pneumocystis \njiroveciipneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis was required during RT and combined TMZ therapy. \n \nTMZ was administered as salvage therapy in the follow-up phase in 161 patients of the 282 (57 %) in \nthe RT alone arm, and 62 patients of the 277 (22 %) in the TMZ + RT arm. \n \nThe hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 1.59 (95 % CI for HR=1.33-1.91) with a log-rank p \n< 0.0001 in favour of the TMZ arm. The estimated probability of surviving 2 years or more (26 % vs \n10 %) is higher for the RT + TMZ arm. The addition of concomitant TMZ to RT, followed by TMZ \nmonotherapy in the treatment of patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme demonstrated \na statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with RT alone (Figure 1). \n \n Figure 1 Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (intent-to-treat population) \n\n \n \nThe results from the trial were not consistent in the subgroup of patients with a poor performance \nstatus (WHO PS=2, n=70), where overall survival and time to progression were similar in both arms. \nHowever, no unacceptable risks appear to be present in this patient group. \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \nData on clinical efficacy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (Karnofsky performance status \n[KPS] \u2265 70), progressive or recurrent after surgery and RT, were based on two clinical trials with oral \nTMZ. One was a non-comparative trial in 138 patients (29 % received prior chemotherapy), and the \nother was a randomised active-controlled trial of TMZ vs procarbazine in a total of 225 patients (67 % \nreceived prior treatment with nitrosourea based chemotherapy). In both trials, the primary endpoint \nwas progression-free survival (PFS) defined by MRI scans or neurological worsening. In the \nnoncomparative trial, the PFS at 6 months was 19 %, the median progression-free survival was 2.1 \nmonths, and the median overall survival 5.4 months. The objective response rate (ORR) based on MRI \nscans was 8 %. \n \nIn the randomised active-controlled trial, the PFS at 6 months was significantly greater for TMZ than \nfor procarbazine (21 % vs 8 %, respectively \u2013 chi-square p=0.008) with median PFS of 2.89 and 1.88 \nmonths respectively (log rank p=0.0063). The median survival was 7.34 and 5.66 months for TMZ and \nprocarbazine, respectively (log rank p=0.33). At 6 months, the fraction of surviving patients was \nsignificantly higher in the TMZ arm (60 %) compared with the procarbazine arm (44 %) (chi-square \np=0.019). In patients with prior chemotherapy a benefit was indicated in those with a KPS \u2265 80. \n \nData on time to worsening of neurological status favoured TMZ over procarbazine as did data on time \nto worsening of performance status (decrease to a KPS of < 70 or a decrease by at least 30 points). The \nmedian times to progression in these endpoints ranged from 0.7 to 2.1 months longer for TMZ than for \nprocarbazine (log rank p=< 0.01 to 0.03). \n \nRecurrent anaplastic astrocytoma \n \nIn a multicentre, prospective phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral TMZ in the \ntreatment of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse, the 6 month PFS was 46 %. The \nmedian PFS was 5.4 months. Median overall survival was 14.6 months. Response rate, based on the \ncentral reviewer assessment, was 35 % (13 CR and 43 PR) for the intent-to-treat population (ITT) \nn=162. In 43 patients stable disease was reported. The 6-month event-free survival for the ITT \npopulation was 44 % with a median event-free survival of 4.6 months, which was similar to the results \nfor the progression-free survival. For the eligible histology population, the efficacy results were \nsimilar. Achieving a radiological objective response or maintaining progression-free status was \nstrongly associated with maintained or improved quality of life. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Tolerance \nto TMZ is similar to adults. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nTMZ is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH primarily to the active species, 3-methyl-(triazen-\n1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). MTIC is spontaneously hydrolyzed to 5-amino-imidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC), a known intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to \nmethylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species. The cytotoxicity of MTIC is \nthought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine. \nRelative to the AUC of TMZ, the exposure to MTIC and AIC is ~ 2.4 % and 23 %, respectively. In \nvivo, the t1/2 of MTIC was similar to that of TMZ, 1.8 hr. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration to adult patients, TMZ is absorbed rapidly, with peak concentrations reached \nas early as 20 minutes post-administration (mean time between 0.5 and 1.5 hours). After oral \nadministration of 14C-labelled TMZ, mean faecal excretion of 14C over 7 days post-dose was 0.8 % \nindicating complete absorption. \n \nDistribution \n \nTMZ demonstrates low protein binding (10 % to 20 %), and thus it is not expected to interact with \nhighly protein-bound substances. \n \nPET studies in humans and preclinical data suggest that TMZ crosses the blood-brain barrier rapidly \nand is present in the CSF. CSF penetration was confirmed in one patient; CSF exposure based on AUC \nof TMZ was approximately 30 % of that in plasma, which is consistent with animal data. \n \nElimination \n \nThe half-life (t1/2) in plasma is approximately 1.8 hours. The major route of 14C elimination is renal. \nFollowing oral administration, approximately 5 % to 10 % of the dose is recovered unchanged in the \nurine over 24 hours, and the remainder excreted as temozolomide acid, 5-aminoimidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC) or unidentified polar metabolites. \n \nPlasma concentrations increase in a dose-related manner. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution and \nhalf-life are independent of dose. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAnalysis of population-based pharmacokinetics of TMZ revealed that plasma TMZ clearance was \nindependent of age, renal function or tobacco use. In a separate pharmacokinetic study, plasma \npharmacokinetic profiles in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those \nobserved in patients with normal hepatic function. \n \nPaediatric patients had a higher AUC than adult patients; however, the maximum tolerated dose \n(MTD) was 1,000 mg/m2 per cycle both in children and in adults. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSingle-cycle (5-day dosing, 23 days non-treatment), 3- and 6-cycle toxicity studies were conducted in \nrats and dogs. The primary targets of toxicity included the bone marrow, lymphoreticular system, \ntestes, the gastrointestinal tract and, at higher doses, which were lethal to 60 % to 100 % of rats and \ndogs tested, degeneration of the retina occurred. Most of the toxicity showed evidence of reversibility, \nexcept for adverse events on the male reproductive system and retinal degeneration. However, because \nthe doses implicated in retinal degeneration were in the lethal dose range, and no comparable effect \nhas been observed in clinical studies, this finding was not considered to have clinical relevance. \n \nTMZ is an embryotoxic, teratogenic and genotoxic alkylating agent. TMZ is more toxic to the rat and \ndog than to humans, and the clinical dose approximates the minimum lethal dose in rats and dogs. \nDose-related reductions in leukocytes and platelets appear to be sensitive indicators of toxicity. A \nvariety of neoplasms, including mammary carcinomas, keratocanthoma of the skin and basal cell \nadenoma were observed in the 6-cycle rat study while no tumours or pre-neoplastic changes were \nevident in dog studies. Rats appear to be particularly sensitive to oncogenic effects of TMZ, with the \noccurrence of first tumours within 3 months of initiating dosing. This latency period is very short even \nfor an alkylating agent. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nResults of the Ames/salmonella and Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte (HPBL) chromosome \naberration tests showed a positive mutagenicity response. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTemozolomide SUN is indicated for the treatment of: \n- adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy \n\n(RT) and subsequently as monotherapy treatment. \n- children from the age of three years, adolescents and adult patients with malignant glioma, such \n\nas glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma, showing recurrence or progression after \nstandard therapy. \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTemozolomide SUN should only be prescribed by physicians experienced in the oncological treatment \nof brain tumours. \n \nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nTemozolomide SUN is administered in combination with focal radiotherapy (concomitant phase) \nfollowed by up to 6 cycles of temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy (monotherapy phase). \n \nConcomitant phase \n \nTMZ is administered orally at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 42 days concomitant with focal \nradiotherapy (60 Gy administered in 30 fractions). No dose reductions are recommended, but delay or \ndiscontinuation of TMZ administration should be decided weekly according to haematological and \nnon-haematological toxicity criteria. TMZ administration can be continued throughout the 42 day \nconcomitant period (up to 49 days) if all of the following conditions are met: \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n- absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 109/l \n- thrombocyte count \u2265 100 x 109/l \n- common toxicity criteria (CTC) non-haematological toxicity \u2264 Grade 1 (except for alopecia, \n\nnausea and vomiting). \n \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained weekly. TMZ administration should be \ntemporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued during the concomitant phase according to the \nhaematological and non-haematological toxicity criteria as noted in Table 1. \n \n\n Table 1.

Dose in Cycle 1 (monotherapy) is 150 mg/m2 once daily for 5 days \nfollowed by 23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, the dose is escalated to 200 mg/m2 if \nthe CTC non-haematological toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade \u2264 2 (except for alopecia, nausea and \nvomiting), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is \u2265 1.5 x 109/l, and the thrombocyte count is \n\u2265 100 x 109/l. If the dose was not escalated at Cycle 2, escalation should not be done in subsequent \ncycles. Once escalated, the dose remains at 200 mg/m2 per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent \ncycle except if toxicity occurs. Dose reductions and discontinuations during the monotherapy phase \nshould be applied according to Tables 2 and 3. \n \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose of \nTMZ). The dose should be reduced or administration discontinued according to Table 3. \n \n Table 2.

In patients previously untreated with chemotherapy, TMZ is \nadministered orally at a dose of 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days followed by a 23 day \ntreatment interruption (total of 28 days). In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the initial \ndose is 150 mg/m2 once daily, to be increased in the second cycle to 200 mg/m2 once daily, for 5 days \nif there is no haematological toxicity (see section 4.4) \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn patients 3 years of age or older, TMZ is only to be used in recurrent or progressive malignant \nglioma. Experience in these children is very limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The safety and efficacy \nof TMZ in children under the age of 3 years have not been established. No data are available. \n \nPatients with hepatic or renal impairment \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of TMZ were comparable in patients with normal hepatic function and in those \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on the administration of TMZ in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child\u2019s Class C) or with renal impairment. Based on the \npharmacokinetic properties of TMZ, it is unlikely that dose reductions are required in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment or any degree of renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised \nwhen TMZ is administered in these patients. \n \nElderly patients \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 19-78 years of age, clearance of TMZ is \nnot affected by age. However, elderly patients (> 70 years of age) appear to be at increased risk of \nneutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTemozolomide SUN should be administered in the fasting state. \n \nThe capsules must be swallowed whole with a glass of water and must not be opened or chewed. \n \nIf vomiting occurs after the dose is administered, a second dose should not be administered that day. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC). \n \nSevere myelosuppression (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nOpportunistic infections and reactivation of infections \n \nOpportunistic infections (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) and reactivation of infections \n(such as HBV, CMV) have been observed during the treatment with TMZ (see section 4.8). \n \nPneumocystis jiroveciipneumonia \n \nPatients who received concomitant TMZ and RT in a pilot trial for the prolonged 42-day schedule \nwere shown to be at particular risk for developing Pneumocystis jiroveciipneumonia (PCP). Thus, \nprophylaxis against PCP is required for all patients receiving concomitant TMZ and RT for the 42-day \nregimen (with a maximum of 49 days) regardless of lymphocyte count. If lymphopenia occurs, they \nare to continue the prophylaxis until recovery of lymphopenia to grade \u2264 1. \n \nThere may be a higher occurrence of PCP when TMZ is administered during a longer dosing regimen. \nHowever, all patients receiving TMZ, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed \nclosely for the development of PCP, regardless of the regimen. Cases of fatal respiratory failure have \nbeen reported in patients using TMZ, in particular in combination with dexamethasone or other \nsteroids. \n \nHepatitis B virus \n \nHepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in death, has been \nreported. Experts in liver disease should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with \npositive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease). During treatment patients should be \nmonitored and managed appropriately. \n \nHepatotoxicity \n \nHepatic injury, including fatal hepatic failure, has been reported in patients treated with TMZ (see \nsection 4.8). Baseline liver function tests should be performed prior to treatment initiation. If \nabnormal, physicians should assess the benefit/risk prior to initiating temozolomide including the \npotential for fatal hepatic failure. For patients on a 42 day treatment cycle liver function tests should \nbe repeated midway during this cycle. For all patients, liver function tests should be checked after each \ntreatment cycle. For patients with significant liver function abnormalities, physicians should assess the \nbenefit/risk of continuing treatment. Liver toxicity may occur several weeks or more after the last \ntreatment with temozolomide. \n \nMeningoencephalitis herpetic \n \nIn post-marketing cases, meningoencephalitis herpetic (including fatal cases) has been observed in \npatients receiving TMZ in combination with radiotherapy, including cases of concomitant steroids \nadministration. \n \nMalignancies \n \nCases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukaemia, have \nalso been reported very rarely (see section 4.8). \n \nAnti-emetic therapy \n \nNausea and vomiting are very commonly associated with TMZ. \nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered prior to or following administration of TMZ. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nAnti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the initial dose of concomitant phase and it is \nstrongly recommended during the monotherapy phase. \n \nPatients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \nPatients who have experienced severe (Grade 3 or 4) vomiting in previous treatment cycles may \nrequire anti-emetic therapy. \n \nLaboratory parameters \n \nPatients treated with TMZ may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, \nwhich may result in aplastic anaemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some \ncases, exposure to concomitant medicinal products associated with aplastic anaemia, including \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to \ndosing, the following laboratory parameters must be met: ANC \u2265 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count \n\u2265 100 x 109/l. A complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or \nwithin 48 hours of that day, and weekly until ANC > 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count > 100 x 109/l. If \nANC falls to < 1.0 x 109/l or the platelet count is < 50 x 109/l during any cycle, the next cycle should \nbe reduced one dose level (see section 4.2). Dose levels include 100 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and \n200 mg/m2. The lowest recommended dose is 100 mg/m2. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is no clinical experience with use of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years. Experience in \nolder children and adolescents is very limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \nElderly patients (> 70 years of age) \n \nElderly patients appear to be at increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, compared with \nyounger patients. Therefore, special care should be taken when TMZ is administered in elderly \npatients. \n \nMale patients \n \nMen being treated with TMZ should be advised not to father a child up to 6 months after receiving the \nlast dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment (see section 4.6). \n \nLactose \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn a separate phase I study, administration of TMZ with ranitidine did not result in alterations in the \nextent of absorption of temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite monomethyl \ntriazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). \n \nAdministration of TMZ with food resulted in a 33 % decrease in Cmax and a 9 % decrease in area under \nthe curve (AUC). \nAs it cannot be excluded that the change in Cmax is clinically significant, Temozolomide SUN should \nbe administered without food. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\n \nBased on an analysis of population pharmacokinetics in phase II trials, co-administration of \ndexamethasone, prochlorperazine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2 receptor antagonists, or \nphenobarbital did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co-administration with valproic acid was associated \nwith a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ. \n \nNo studies have been conducted to determine the effect of TMZ on the metabolism or elimination of \nother medicinal products. However, since TMZ does not undergo hepatic metabolism and exhibits low \nprotein binding, it is unlikely that it would affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products \n(see section 5.2). \n \nUse of TMZ in combination with other myelosuppressive agents may increase the likelihood of \nmyelosuppression. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy \nwhile they are receiving TMZ. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data in pregnant women. In preclinical studies in rats and rabbits receiving 150 mg/m2 \nTMZ, teratogenicity and/or foetal toxicity were demonstrated (see section 5.3). Temozolomide SUN \nshould not be administered to pregnant women. If use during pregnancy must be considered, the \npatient should be apprised of the potential risk to the foetus.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether TMZ is excreted in human milk; thus, breast-feeding should be discontinued \nwhile receiving treatment with TMZ. \n \nMale fertility \n \nTMZ can have genotoxic effects. Therefore, men being treated with it should be advised not to father a \nchild up to 6 months after receiving the last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm \nprior to treatment, because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with TMZ. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTMZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to fatigue and somnolence (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn patients treated with TMZ, whether used in combination with RT or as monotherapy following RT \nfor newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme, or as monotherapy in patients with recurrent or \nprogressive glioma, the reported very common adverse reactions were similar: nausea, vomiting, \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\nconstipation, anorexia, headache and fatigue. Convulsions were reported very commonly in the newly-\ndiagnosed glioblastoma multiforme patients receiving monotherapy, and rash was reported very \ncommonly in newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme patients receiving TMZ concurrent with RT \nand also as monotherapy, and commonly in recurrent glioma. Most haematologic adverse reactions \nwere reported commonly or very commonly in both indications (Tables 4 and 5), the frequency of \ngrade 3-4 laboratory findings is presented after each table. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn the tables undesirable effects are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. \nFrequency groupings are defined according to the following convention: very common (\u2265 1/10); \ncommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very \nrare (<1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \nNewly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nTable 4 provides treatment-emergent adverse events in patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma \nmultiforme during the concomitant and monotherapy phases of treatment. \n \n\nTable 4.

\n\n*A patient who was randomised to the RT arm only, received TMZ + RT. \n \nLaboratory results \n \nMyelosuppression (neutropenia and thrombocytopenia), which is known dose-limiting toxicity for \nmost cytotoxic agents, including TMZ, was observed. When laboratory abnormalities and adverse \nevents were combined across concomitant and monotherapy treatment phases, Grade 3 or Grade 4 \nneutrophil abnormalities including neutropenic events were observed in 8 % of the patients. Grade 3 or \nGrade 4 thrombocyte abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic events were observed in 14 % of the \npatients who received TMZ. \n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \nIn clinical trials, the most frequently occurring treatment-related undesirable effects were \ngastrointestinal disorders, specifically nausea (43 %) and vomiting (36 %). These reactions were \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\nusually Grade 1 or 2 (0-5 episodes of vomiting in 24 hours) and were either self-limiting or readily \ncontrolled with standard anti-emetic therapy. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting was 4 %. \n \nTable 5 includes adverse reactions reported during clinical trials for recurrent or progressive malignant \nglioma and following the marketing of Temozolomide SUN. \n \n\nTable 5.

This led to hospitalisation and/or discontinuation of TMZ in 8 % and \n4 %, respectively. Myelosuppression was predictable (usually within the first few cycles, with the \nnadir between Day 21 and Day 28), and recovery was rapid, usually within 1-2 weeks. No evidence of \ncumulative myelosuppression was observed. The presence of thrombocytopenia may increase the risk \nof bleeding, and the presence of neutropenia or leukopenia may increase the risk of infection. \n \nOther special populations \n \nGender \n \nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis of clinical trial experience there were 101 female and 169 \nmale subjects for whom nadir neutrophil counts were available and 110 female and 174 male subjects \nfor whom nadir platelet counts were available. There were higher rates of Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC \n< 0.5 x 109/l), 12 % vs 5 %, and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/l ), 9 % vs 3 %, in women vs men in the \nfirst cycle of therapy. In a 400 subject recurrent glioma data set, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 8 % \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nof female vs 4 % of male subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 8 % of female vs 3 % of male \nsubjects in the first cycle of therapy. In a study of 288 subjects with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma \nmultiforme, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 3 % of female vs 0 % of male subjects and Grade 4 \nthrombocytopenia in 1 % of female vs 0 % of male subjects in the first cycle of therapy. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Although \nthe data is limited, tolerance in children is expected to be the same as in adults. The safety of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years has not been established. \n \nPost-marketing experience \n \nThe following additional serious adverse reactions have been identified during post-marketing \nexposure: \n \nTable 6. Summary of events reported with temozolomide in the post-marketing setting* \n \nInfections and infestations* \nUncommon: cytomegalovirus infection, infection reactivation such \n\nas cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus\u2020, \nmeningoencephalitis herpetic\u2020, sepsis\u2020 \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders  \n\nVery rare: prolonged pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia\u2020 \nNeoplasm benign, malignant and unspecified \nVery rare: myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), secondary \n\nmalignancies, including myeloid leukaemia \nEndocrine disorders* \nUncommon: diabetes insipidus \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nVery rare: interstitial pneumonitis/pneumonitis, pulmonary \n\nfibrosis, respiratory failure\u2020 \nHepatobiliary disorders* \nCommon: liver enzymes elevations \n\n \nUncommon: hyperbilirubinemia, cholestasis, hepatitis  \n\nhepatic injury, hepatic failure\u2020 \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery rare: toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome \nFrequency not known: drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic \n\nsymptoms (DRESS) \n\u2020 Including cases with fatal outcome \n* Frequencies estimated based on relevant clinical trials. \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses of 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 mg/m2 (total dose per cycle over 5 days) have been evaluated \nclinically in patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was haematological and was reported with any dose but is \nexpected to be more severe at higher doses. An overdose of 10,000 mg (total dose in a single cycle, \nover 5 days) was taken by one patient and the adverse reactions reported were pancytopenia, pyrexia, \nmultiorgan failure and death. There are reports of patients who have taken the recommended dose for \nmore than 5 days of treatment (up to 64 days) with adverse events reported including bone marrow \nsuppression, with or without infection, in some cases severe and prolonged and resulting in death. In \nthe event of an overdose, haematological evaluation is needed. Supportive measures should be \nprovided as necessary. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other alkylating agents, ATC code: L01A X03. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTemozolomide is a triazene, which undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiologic pH to the \nactive monomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to \nbe due primarily to alkylation at the O6 position of guanine with additional alkylation also occurring at \nthe N7 position. Cytotoxic lesions that develop subsequently are thought to involve aberrant repair of \nthe methyl adduct. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nNewly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nA total of 573 patients were randomised to receive either TMZ + RT (n=287) or RT alone (n=286). \nPatients in the TMZ + RT arm received concomitant TMZ (75 mg/m2) once daily, starting the first day \nof RT until the last day of RT, for 42 days (with a maximum of 49 days). This was followed by \nmonotherapy TMZ (150-200 mg/m2) on Days 1-5 of every 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles, starting 4 \nweeks after the end of RT. Patients in the control arm received RT only. Pneumocystis \njiroveciipneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis was required during RT and combined TMZ therapy. \n \nTMZ was administered as salvage therapy in the follow-up phase in 161 patients of the 282 (57 %) in \nthe RT alone arm, and 62 patients of the 277 (22 %) in the TMZ + RT arm. \n \nThe hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 1.59 (95 % CI for HR=1.33-1.91) with a log-rank p \n< 0.0001 in favour of the TMZ arm. The estimated probability of surviving 2 years or more (26 % vs \n10 %) is higher for the RT + TMZ arm. The addition of concomitant TMZ to RT, followed by TMZ \nmonotherapy in the treatment of patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme demonstrated \na statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with RT alone (Figure 1). \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\n Figure 1 Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (intent-to-treat population) \n\n \n \nThe results from the trial were not consistent in the subgroup of patients with a poor performance \nstatus (WHO PS=2, n=70), where overall survival and time to progression were similar in both arms. \nHowever, no unacceptable risks appear to be present in this patient group. \n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \nData on clinical efficacy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (Karnofsky performance status \n[KPS] \u2265 70), progressive or recurrent after surgery and RT, were based on two clinical trials with oral \nTMZ. One was a non-comparative trial in 138 patients (29 % received prior chemotherapy), and the \nother was a randomised active-controlled trial of TMZ vs procarbazine in a total of 225 patients (67 % \nreceived prior treatment with nitrosourea based chemotherapy). In both trials, the primary endpoint \nwas progression-free survival (PFS) defined by MRI scans or neurological worsening. In the \nnoncomparative trial, the PFS at 6 months was 19 %, the median progression-free survival was 2.1 \nmonths, and the median overall survival 5.4 months. The objective response rate (ORR) based on MRI \nscans was 8 %. \n \nIn the randomised active-controlled trial, the PFS at 6 months was significantly greater for TMZ than \nfor procarbazine (21 % vs 8 %, respectively \u2013 chi-square p=0.008) with median PFS of 2.89 and 1.88 \nmonths respectively (log rank p=0.0063). The median survival was 7.34 and 5.66 months for TMZ and \nprocarbazine, respectively (log rank p=0.33). At 6 months, the fraction of surviving patients was \nsignificantly higher in the TMZ arm (60 %) compared with the procarbazine arm (44 %) (chi-square \np=0.019). In patients with prior chemotherapy a benefit was indicated in those with a KPS \u2265 80. \n \nData on time to worsening of neurological status favoured TMZ over procarbazine as did data on time \nto worsening of performance status (decrease to a KPS of < 70 or a decrease by at least 30 points). The \nmedian times to progression in these endpoints ranged from 0.7 to 2.1 months longer for TMZ than for \nprocarbazine (log rank p=< 0.01 to 0.03). \n \nRecurrent anaplastic astrocytoma \n \nIn a multicentre, prospective phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral TMZ in the \ntreatment of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse, the 6 month PFS was 46 %. The \nmedian PFS was 5.4 months. Median overall survival was 14.6 months. Response rate, based on the \ncentral reviewer assessment, was 35 % (13 CR and 43 PR) for the intent-to-treat population (ITT) \nn=162. In 43 patients stable disease was reported. The 6-month event-free survival for the ITT \npopulation was 44 % with a median event-free survival of 4.6 months, which was similar to the results \nfor the progression-free survival. For the eligible histology population, the efficacy results were \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nsimilar. Achieving a radiological objective response or maintaining progression-free status was \nstrongly associated with maintained or improved quality of life. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Tolerance \nto TMZ is similar to adults. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nTMZ is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH primarily to the active species, 3-methyl-(triazen-\n1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). MTIC is spontaneously hydrolyzed to 5-amino-imidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC), a known intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to \nmethylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species. The cytotoxicity of MTIC is \nthought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine. \nRelative to the AUC of TMZ, the exposure to MTIC and AIC is ~ 2.4 % and 23 %, respectively. In \nvivo, the t1/2 of MTIC was similar to that of TMZ, 1.8 hr. \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration to adult patients, TMZ is absorbed rapidly, with peak concentrations reached \nas early as 20 minutes post-administration (mean time between 0.5 and 1.5 hours). After oral \nadministration of 14C-labelled TMZ, mean faecal excretion of 14C over 7 days post-dose was 0.8 % \nindicating complete absorption. \n \nDistribution \n \nTMZ demonstrates low protein binding (10 % to 20 %), and thus it is not expected to interact with \nhighly protein-bound substances. \n \nPET studies in humans and preclinical data suggest that TMZ crosses the blood-brain barrier rapidly \nand is present in the CSF. CSF penetration was confirmed in one patient; CSF exposure based on AUC \nof TMZ was approximately 30 % of that in plasma, which is consistent with animal data. \n \nElimination \n \nThe half-life (t1/2) in plasma is approximately 1.8 hours. The major route of 14C elimination is renal. \nFollowing oral administration, approximately 5 % to 10 % of the dose is recovered unchanged in the \nurine over 24 hours, and the remainder excreted as temozolomide acid, 5-aminoimidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC) or unidentified polar metabolites. \n \nPlasma concentrations increase in a dose-related manner. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution and \nhalf-life are independent of dose. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAnalysis of population-based pharmacokinetics of TMZ revealed that plasma TMZ clearance was \nindependent of age, renal function or tobacco use. In a separate pharmacokinetic study, plasma \npharmacokinetic profiles in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those \nobserved in patients with normal hepatic function. \n \nPaediatric patients had a higher AUC than adult patients; however, the maximum tolerated dose \n(MTD) was 1,000 mg/m2 per cycle both in children and in adults. \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSingle-cycle (5-day dosing, 23 days non-treatment), 3- and 6-cycle toxicity studies were conducted in \nrats and dogs. The primary targets of toxicity included the bone marrow, lymphoreticular system, \ntestes, the gastrointestinal tract and, at higher doses, which were lethal to 60 % to 100 % of rats and \ndogs tested, degeneration of the retina occurred. Most of the toxicity showed evidence of reversibility, \nexcept for adverse events on the male reproductive system and retinal degeneration. However, because \nthe doses implicated in retinal degeneration were in the lethal dose range, and no comparable effect \nhas been observed in clinical studies, this finding was not considered to have clinical relevance. \n \nTMZ is an embryotoxic, teratogenic and genotoxic alkylating agent. TMZ is more toxic to the rat and \ndog than to humans, and the clinical dose approximates the minimum lethal dose in rats and dogs. \nDose-related reductions in leukocytes and platelets appear to be sensitive indicators of toxicity. A \nvariety of neoplasms, including mammary carcinomas, keratocanthoma of the skin and basal cell \nadenoma were observed in the 6-cycle rat study while no tumours or pre-neoplastic changes were \nevident in dog studies. Rats appear to be particularly sensitive to oncogenic effects of TMZ, with the \noccurrence of first tumours within 3 months of initiating dosing. This latency period is very short even \nfor an alkylating agent. \n \nResults of the Ames/salmonella and Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte (HPBL) chromosome \naberration tests showed a positive mutagenicity response. \n \n \n6.

Dose in Cycle 1 (monotherapy) is 150 mg/m2 once daily for 5 days \nfollowed by 23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, the dose is escalated to 200 mg/m2 if \nthe CTC non-haematological toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade \u2264 2 (except for alopecia, nausea and \nvomiting), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is \u2265 1.5 x 109/l, and the thrombocyte count is \n\u2265 100 x 109/l. If the dose was not escalated at Cycle 2, escalation should not be done in subsequent \ncycles. Once escalated, the dose remains at 200 mg/m2 per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent \ncycle except if toxicity occurs. Dose reductions and discontinuations during the monotherapy phase \nshould be applied according to Tables 2 and 3. \n \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose of \nTMZ).

In patients previously untreated with chemotherapy, TMZ is \nadministered orally at a dose of 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days followed by a 23 day \ntreatment interruption (total of 28 days). In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the initial \ndose is 150 mg/m2 once daily, to be increased in the second cycle to 200 mg/m2 once daily, for 5 days \nif there is no haematological toxicity (see section 4.4) \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn patients 3 years of age or older, TMZ is only to be used in recurrent or progressive malignant \nglioma. Experience in these children is very limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The safety and efficacy \nof TMZ in children under the age of 3 years have not been established. No data are available. \n \nPatients with hepatic or renal impairment \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of TMZ were comparable in patients with normal hepatic function and in those \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on the administration of TMZ in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child\u2019s Class C) or with renal impairment. Based on the \npharmacokinetic properties of TMZ, it is unlikely that dose reductions are required in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment or any degree of renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised \nwhen TMZ is administered in these patients. \n \nElderly patients \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 19-78 years of age, clearance of TMZ is \nnot affected by age. However, elderly patients (> 70 years of age) appear to be at increased risk of \nneutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTemozolomide SUN should be administered in the fasting state. \n \nThe capsules must be swallowed whole with a glass of water and must not be opened or chewed. \n \nIf vomiting occurs after the dose is administered, a second dose should not be administered that day. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC). \n \nSevere myelosuppression (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nOpportunistic infections and reactivation of infections \n \nOpportunistic infections (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) and reactivation of infections \n(such as HBV, CMV) have been observed during the treatment with TMZ (see section 4.8). \n \nPneumocystis jiroveciipneumonia \n \nPatients who received concomitant TMZ and RT in a pilot trial for the prolonged 42-day schedule \nwere shown to be at particular risk for developing Pneumocystis jiroveciipneumonia (PCP). Thus, \nprophylaxis against PCP is required for all patients receiving concomitant TMZ and RT for the 42-day \nregimen (with a maximum of 49 days) regardless of lymphocyte count. If lymphopenia occurs, they \nare to continue the prophylaxis until recovery of lymphopenia to grade \u2264 1. \n \nThere may be a higher occurrence of PCP when TMZ is administered during a longer dosing regimen. \nHowever, all patients receiving TMZ, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed \nclosely for the development of PCP, regardless of the regimen. Cases of fatal respiratory failure have \nbeen reported in patients using TMZ, in particular in combination with dexamethasone or other \nsteroids. \n \nHepatitis B virus \n \nHepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in death, has been \nreported. Experts in liver disease should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with \npositive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease). During treatment patients should be \nmonitored and managed appropriately. \n \nHepatotoxicity \n \nHepatic injury, including fatal hepatic failure, has been reported in patients treated with TMZ (see \nsection 4.8). Baseline liver function tests should be performed prior to treatment initiation. If \nabnormal, physicians should assess the benefit/risk prior to initiating temozolomide including the \npotential for fatal hepatic failure. For patients on a 42 day treatment cycle liver function tests should \nbe repeated midway during this cycle. For all patients, liver function tests should be checked after each \ntreatment cycle. For patients with significant liver function abnormalities, physicians should assess the \nbenefit/risk of continuing treatment. Liver toxicity may occur several weeks or more after the last \ntreatment with temozolomide. \n \nMeningoencephalitis herpetic \n \nIn post-marketing cases, meningoencephalitis herpetic (including fatal cases) has been observed in \npatients receiving TMZ in combination with radiotherapy, including cases of concomitant steroids \nadministration. \n \nMalignancies \n \nCases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukaemia, have \nalso been reported very rarely (see section 4.8). \n \nAnti-emetic therapy \n \nNausea and vomiting are very commonly associated with TMZ. \nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered prior to or following administration of TMZ. \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nAnti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the initial dose of concomitant phase and it is \nstrongly recommended during the monotherapy phase. \n \nPatients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \nPatients who have experienced severe (Grade 3 or 4) vomiting in previous treatment cycles may \nrequire anti-emetic therapy. \n \nLaboratory parameters \n \nPatients treated with TMZ may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, \nwhich may result in aplastic anaemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some \ncases, exposure to concomitant medicinal products associated with aplastic anaemia, including \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to \ndosing, the following laboratory parameters must be met: ANC \u2265 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count \n\u2265 100 x 109/l. A complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or \nwithin 48 hours of that day, and weekly until ANC > 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count > 100 x 109/l. If \nANC falls to < 1.0 x 109/l or the platelet count is < 50 x 109/l during any cycle, the next cycle should \nbe reduced one dose level (see section 4.2). Dose levels include 100 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and \n200 mg/m2. The lowest recommended dose is 100 mg/m2. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is no clinical experience with use of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years. Experience in \nolder children and adolescents is very limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \nElderly patients (> 70 years of age) \n \nElderly patients appear to be at increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, compared with \nyounger patients. Therefore, special care should be taken when TMZ is administered in elderly \npatients. \n \nMale patients \n \nMen being treated with TMZ should be advised not to father a child up to 6 months after receiving the \nlast dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment (see section 4.6). \n \nLactose \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn a separate phase I study, administration of TMZ with ranitidine did not result in alterations in the \nextent of absorption of temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite monomethyl \ntriazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). \n \nAdministration of TMZ with food resulted in a 33 % decrease in Cmax and a 9 % decrease in area under \nthe curve (AUC). \nAs it cannot be excluded that the change in Cmax is clinically significant, Temozolomide SUN should \nbe administered without food. \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\n \nBased on an analysis of population pharmacokinetics in phase II trials, co-administration of \ndexamethasone, prochlorperazine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2 receptor antagonists, or \nphenobarbital did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co-administration with valproic acid was associated \nwith a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ. \n \nNo studies have been conducted to determine the effect of TMZ on the metabolism or elimination of \nother medicinal products. However, since TMZ does not undergo hepatic metabolism and exhibits low \nprotein binding, it is unlikely that it would affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products \n(see section 5.2). \n \nUse of TMZ in combination with other myelosuppressive agents may increase the likelihood of \nmyelosuppression. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy \nwhile they are receiving TMZ. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data in pregnant women. In preclinical studies in rats and rabbits receiving 150 mg/m2 \nTMZ, teratogenicity and/or foetal toxicity were demonstrated (see section 5.3). Temozolomide SUN \nshould not be administered to pregnant women. If use during pregnancy must be considered, the \npatient should be apprised of the potential risk to the foetus.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether TMZ is excreted in human milk; thus, breast-feeding should be discontinued \nwhile receiving treatment with TMZ. \n \nMale fertility \n \nTMZ can have genotoxic effects. Therefore, men being treated with it should be advised not to father a \nchild up to 6 months after receiving the last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm \nprior to treatment, because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with TMZ. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTMZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to fatigue and somnolence (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn patients treated with TMZ, whether used in combination with RT or as monotherapy following RT \nfor newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme, or as monotherapy in patients with recurrent or \nprogressive glioma, the reported very common adverse reactions were similar: nausea, vomiting, \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nconstipation, anorexia, headache and fatigue. Convulsions were reported very commonly in the newly-\ndiagnosed glioblastoma multiforme patients receiving monotherapy, and rash was reported very \ncommonly in newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme patients receiving TMZ concurrent with RT \nand also as monotherapy, and commonly in recurrent glioma. Most haematologic adverse reactions \nwere reported commonly or very commonly in both indications (Tables 4 and 5), the frequency of \ngrade 3-4 laboratory findings is presented after each table. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn the tables undesirable effects are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. \nFrequency groupings are defined according to the following convention: very common (\u2265 1/10); \ncommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very \nrare (<1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \nNewly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nTable 4 provides treatment-emergent adverse events in patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma \nmultiforme during the concomitant and monotherapy phases of treatment. \n \n\nTable 4.

toxicity for \nmost cytotoxic agents, including TMZ, was observed. When laboratory abnormalities and adverse \nevents were combined across concomitant and monotherapy treatment phases, Grade 3 or Grade 4 \nneutrophil abnormalities including neutropenic events were observed in 8 % of the patients. Grade 3 or \nGrade 4 thrombocyte abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic events were observed in 14 % of the \npatients who received TMZ. \n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \nIn clinical trials, the most frequently occurring treatment-related undesirable effects were \ngastrointestinal disorders, specifically nausea (43 %) and vomiting (36 %). These reactions were \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\nusually Grade 1 or 2 (0-5 episodes of vomiting in 24 hours) and were either self-limiting or readily \ncontrolled with standard anti-emetic therapy. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting was 4 %. \n \nTable 5 includes adverse reactions reported during clinical trials for recurrent or progressive malignant \nglioma and following the marketing of Temozolomide SUN. \n \n\nTable 5. Adverse reactions in patients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma \nInfections and infestations \nRare: Opportunistic infections, including PCP \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nVery common: Neutropenia or lymphopenia (grade 3-4), \n\nthrombocytopenia (grade 3-4) \nUncommon: Pancytopenia, anaemia (grade 3-4), leukopenia \n\n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nVery common: Anorexia \nCommon: Weight decrease \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \nCommon: Somnolence, dizziness, paresthesia \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nCommon: Dyspnoea \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common: Vomiting, nausea, constipation \nCommon: Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Rash, pruritus, alopecia \nVery rare: Erythema multiforme, erythroderma, urticaria, \n\nexanthema \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Fatigue \nCommon: Fever, asthenia, rigors, malaise, pain, taste \n\nperversion \nVery rare: Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, \n\nangioedema \n \nLaboratory results \n \nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 19 % and 17 % respectively, of patients \ntreated for malignant glioma. This led to hospitalisation and/or discontinuation of TMZ in 8 % and \n4 %, respectively. Myelosuppression was predictable (usually within the first few cycles, with the \nnadir between Day 21 and Day 28), and recovery was rapid, usually within 1-2 weeks. No evidence of \ncumulative myelosuppression was observed. The presence of thrombocytopenia may increase the risk \nof bleeding, and the presence of neutropenia or leukopenia may increase the risk of infection. \n \nOther special populations \n \nGender \n \nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis of clinical trial experience there were 101 female and 169 \nmale subjects for whom nadir neutrophil counts were available and 110 female and 174 male subjects \nfor whom nadir platelet counts were available. There were higher rates of Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC \n< 0.5 x 109/l), 12 % vs 5 %, and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/l ), 9 % vs 3 %, in women vs men in the \nfirst cycle of therapy. In a 400 subject recurrent glioma data set, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 8 % \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nof female vs 4 % of male subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 8 % of female vs 3 % of male \nsubjects in the first cycle of therapy. In a study of 288 subjects with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma \nmultiforme, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 3 % of female vs 0 % of male subjects and Grade 4 \nthrombocytopenia in 1 % of female vs 0 % of male subjects in the first cycle of therapy. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Although \nthe data is limited, tolerance in children is expected to be the same as in adults. The safety of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years has not been established. \n \nPost-marketing experience \n \nThe following additional serious adverse reactions have been identified during post-marketing \nexposure: \n \nTable 6. Summary of events reported with temozolomide in the post-marketing setting* \n \nInfections and infestations* \nUncommon: cytomegalovirus infection, infection reactivation such \n\nas cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus\u2020, \nmeningoencephalitis herpetic\u2020, sepsis\u2020 \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders  \n\nVery rare: prolonged pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia\u2020 \nNeoplasm benign, malignant and unspecified \nVery rare: myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), secondary \n\nmalignancies, including myeloid leukaemia \nEndocrine disorders* \nUncommon: diabetes insipidus \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nVery rare: interstitial pneumonitis/pneumonitis, pulmonary \n\nfibrosis, respiratory failure\u2020 \nHepatobiliary disorders* \nCommon: liver enzymes elevations \n\n \nUncommon: hyperbilirubinemia, cholestasis, hepatitis  \n\nhepatic injury, hepatic failure\u2020 \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery rare: toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome \nFrequency not known: drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic \n\nsymptoms (DRESS) \n\u2020 Including cases with fatal outcome \n* Frequencies estimated based on relevant clinical trials. \n \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses of 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 mg/m2 (total dose per cycle over 5 days) have been evaluated \nclinically in patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was haematological and was reported with any dose but is \nexpected to be more severe at higher doses. An overdose of 10,000 mg (total dose in a single cycle, \nover 5 days) was taken by one patient and the adverse reactions reported were pancytopenia, pyrexia, \nmultiorgan failure and death. There are reports of patients who have taken the recommended dose for \nmore than 5 days of treatment (up to 64 days) with adverse events reported including bone marrow \nsuppression, with or without infection, in some cases severe and prolonged and resulting in death. In \nthe event of an overdose, haematological evaluation is needed. Supportive measures should be \nprovided as necessary. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other alkylating agents, ATC code: L01A X03. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTemozolomide is a triazene, which undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiologic pH to the \nactive monomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to \nbe due primarily to alkylation at the O6 position of guanine with additional alkylation also occurring at \nthe N7 position. Cytotoxic lesions that develop subsequently are thought to involve aberrant repair of \nthe methyl adduct. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nNewly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nA total of 573 patients were randomised to receive either TMZ + RT (n=287) or RT alone (n=286). \nPatients in the TMZ + RT arm received concomitant TMZ (75 mg/m2) once daily, starting the first day \nof RT until the last day of RT, for 42 days (with a maximum of 49 days). This was followed by \nmonotherapy TMZ (150-200 mg/m2) on Days 1-5 of every 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles, starting 4 \nweeks after the end of RT. Patients in the control arm received RT only. Pneumocystis \njiroveciipneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis was required during RT and combined TMZ therapy. \n \nTMZ was administered as salvage therapy in the follow-up phase in 161 patients of the 282 (57 %) in \nthe RT alone arm, and 62 patients of the 277 (22 %) in the TMZ + RT arm. \n \nThe hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 1.59 (95 % CI for HR=1.33-1.91) with a log-rank p \n< 0.0001 in favour of the TMZ arm. The estimated probability of surviving 2 years or more (26 % vs \n10 %) is higher for the RT + TMZ arm. The addition of concomitant TMZ to RT, followed by TMZ \nmonotherapy in the treatment of patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme demonstrated \na statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with RT alone (Figure 1). \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\n Figure 1 Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (intent-to-treat population) \n\n \n \nThe results from the trial were not consistent in the subgroup of patients with a poor performance \nstatus (WHO PS=2, n=70), where overall survival and time to progression were similar in both arms. \nHowever, no unacceptable risks appear to be present in this patient group. \n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \nData on clinical efficacy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (Karnofsky performance status \n[KPS] \u2265 70), progressive or recurrent after surgery and RT, were based on two clinical trials with oral \nTMZ. One was a non-comparative trial in 138 patients (29 % received prior chemotherapy), and the \nother was a randomised active-controlled trial of TMZ vs procarbazine in a total of 225 patients (67 % \nreceived prior treatment with nitrosourea based chemotherapy). In both trials, the primary endpoint \nwas progression-free survival (PFS) defined by MRI scans or neurological worsening. In the \nnoncomparative trial, the PFS at 6 months was 19 %, the median progression-free survival was 2.1 \nmonths, and the median overall survival 5.4 months. The objective response rate (ORR) based on MRI \nscans was 8 %. \n \nIn the randomised active-controlled trial, the PFS at 6 months was significantly greater for TMZ than \nfor procarbazine (21 % vs 8 %, respectively \u2013 chi-square p=0.008) with median PFS of 2.89 and 1.88 \nmonths respectively (log rank p=0.0063). The median survival was 7.34 and 5.66 months for TMZ and \nprocarbazine, respectively (log rank p=0.33). At 6 months, the fraction of surviving patients was \nsignificantly higher in the TMZ arm (60 %) compared with the procarbazine arm (44 %) (chi-square \np=0.019). In patients with prior chemotherapy a benefit was indicated in those with a KPS \u2265 80. \n \nData on time to worsening of neurological status favoured TMZ over procarbazine as did data on time \nto worsening of performance status (decrease to a KPS of < 70 or a decrease by at least 30 points). The \nmedian times to progression in these endpoints ranged from 0.7 to 2.1 months longer for TMZ than for \nprocarbazine (log rank p=< 0.01 to 0.03). \n \nRecurrent anaplastic astrocytoma \n \nIn a multicentre, prospective phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral TMZ in the \ntreatment of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse, the 6 month PFS was 46 %. The \nmedian PFS was 5.4 months. Median overall survival was 14.6 months. Response rate, based on the \ncentral reviewer assessment, was 35 % (13 CR and 43 PR) for the intent-to-treat population (ITT) \nn=162. In 43 patients stable disease was reported. The 6-month event-free survival for the ITT \npopulation was 44 % with a median event-free survival of 4.6 months, which was similar to the results \nfor the progression-free survival. For the eligible histology population, the efficacy results were \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\nsimilar. Achieving a radiological objective response or maintaining progression-free status was \nstrongly associated with maintained or improved quality of life. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Tolerance \nto TMZ is similar to adults. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nTMZ is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH primarily to the active species, 3-methyl-(triazen-\n1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). MTIC is spontaneously hydrolyzed to 5-amino-imidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC), a known intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to \nmethylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species. The cytotoxicity of MTIC is \nthought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine. \nRelative to the AUC of TMZ, the exposure to MTIC and AIC is ~ 2.4 % and 23 %, respectively. In \nvivo, the t1/2 of MTIC was similar to that of TMZ, 1.8 hr. \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration to adult patients, TMZ is absorbed rapidly, with peak concentrations reached \nas early as 20 minutes post-administration (mean time between 0.5 and 1.5 hours). After oral \nadministration of 14C-labelled TMZ, mean faecal excretion of 14C over 7 days post-dose was 0.8 % \nindicating complete absorption. \n \nDistribution \n \nTMZ demonstrates low protein binding (10 % to 20 %), and thus it is not expected to interact with \nhighly protein-bound substances. \n \nPET studies in humans and preclinical data suggest that TMZ crosses the blood-brain barrier rapidly \nand is present in the CSF. CSF penetration was confirmed in one patient; CSF exposure based on AUC \nof TMZ was approximately 30 % of that in plasma, which is consistent with animal data. \n \nElimination \n \nThe half-life (t1/2) in plasma is approximately 1.8 hours. The major route of 14C elimination is renal. \nFollowing oral administration, approximately 5 % to 10 % of the dose is recovered unchanged in the \nurine over 24 hours, and the remainder excreted as temozolomide acid, 5-aminoimidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC) or unidentified polar metabolites. \n \nPlasma concentrations increase in a dose-related manner. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution and \nhalf-life are independent of dose. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAnalysis of population-based pharmacokinetics of TMZ revealed that plasma TMZ clearance was \nindependent of age, renal function or tobacco use. In a separate pharmacokinetic study, plasma \npharmacokinetic profiles in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those \nobserved in patients with normal hepatic function. \n \nPaediatric patients had a higher AUC than adult patients; however, the maximum tolerated dose \n(MTD) was 1,000 mg/m2 per cycle both in children and in adults. \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSingle-cycle (5-day dosing, 23 days non-treatment), 3- and 6-cycle toxicity studies were conducted in \nrats and dogs. The primary targets of toxicity included the bone marrow, lymphoreticular system, \ntestes, the gastrointestinal tract and, at higher doses, which were lethal to 60 % to 100 % of rats and \ndogs tested, degeneration of the retina occurred. Most of the toxicity showed evidence of reversibility, \nexcept for adverse events on the male reproductive system and retinal degeneration. However, because \nthe doses implicated in retinal degeneration were in the lethal dose range, and no comparable effect \nhas been observed in clinical studies, this finding was not considered to have clinical relevance. \n \nTMZ is an embryotoxic, teratogenic and genotoxic alkylating agent. TMZ is more toxic to the rat and \ndog than to humans, and the clinical dose approximates the minimum lethal dose in rats and dogs. \nDose-related reductions in leukocytes and platelets appear to be sensitive indicators of toxicity. A \nvariety of neoplasms, including mammary carcinomas, keratocanthoma of the skin and basal cell \nadenoma were observed in the 6-cycle rat study while no tumours or pre-neoplastic changes were \nevident in dog studies. Rats appear to be particularly sensitive to oncogenic effects of TMZ, with the \noccurrence of first tumours within 3 months of initiating dosing. This latency period is very short even \nfor an alkylating agent. \n \nResults of the Ames/salmonella and Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte (HPBL) chromosome \naberration tests showed a positive mutagenicity response. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTemozolomide SUN is indicated for the treatment of: \n- adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy \n\n(RT) and subsequently as monotherapy treatment. \n- children from the age of three years, adolescents and adult patients with malignant glioma, such \n\nas glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma, showing recurrence or progression after \nstandard therapy. \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTemozolomide SUN should only be prescribed by physicians experienced in the oncological treatment \nof brain tumours. \n \nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nTemozolomide SUN is administered in combination with focal radiotherapy (concomitant phase) \nfollowed by up to 6 cycles of temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy (monotherapy phase). \n \nConcomitant phase \n \nTMZ is administered orally at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 42 days concomitant with focal \nradiotherapy (60 Gy administered in 30 fractions). No dose reductions are recommended, but delay or \ndiscontinuation of TMZ administration should be decided weekly according to haematological and \nnon-haematological toxicity criteria. TMZ administration can be continued throughout the 42 day \nconcomitant period (up to 49 days) if all of the following conditions are met: \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\n- absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 109/l \n- thrombocyte count \u2265 100 x 109/l \n- common toxicity criteria (CTC) non-haematological toxicity \u2264 Grade 1 (except for alopecia, \n\nnausea and vomiting). \n \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained weekly. TMZ administration should be \ntemporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued during the concomitant phase according to the \nhaematological and non-haematological toxicity criteria as noted in Table 1. \n \n\n Table 1.

Dose in Cycle 1 (monotherapy) is 150 mg/m2 once daily for 5 days \nfollowed by 23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, the dose is escalated to 200 mg/m2 if \nthe CTC non-haematological toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade \u2264 2 (except for alopecia, nausea and \nvomiting), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is \u2265 1.5 x 109/l, and the thrombocyte count is \n\u2265 100 x 109/l. If the dose was not escalated at Cycle 2, escalation should not be done in subsequent \ncycles. Once escalated, the dose remains at 200 mg/m2 per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent \ncycle except if toxicity occurs. Dose reductions and discontinuations during the monotherapy phase \nshould be applied according to Tables 2 and 3. \n \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose of \nTMZ). The dose should be reduced or administration discontinued according to Table 3. \n \n Table 2.

In patients previously untreated with chemotherapy, TMZ is \nadministered orally at a dose of 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days followed by a 23 day \ntreatment interruption (total of 28 days). In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the initial \ndose is 150 mg/m2 once daily, to be increased in the second cycle to 200 mg/m2 once daily, for 5 days \nif there is no haematological toxicity (see section 4.4) \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn patients 3 years of age or older, TMZ is only to be used in recurrent or progressive malignant \nglioma. Experience in these children is very limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The safety and efficacy \nof TMZ in children under the age of 3 years have not been established. No data are available. \n \nPatients with hepatic or renal impairment \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of TMZ were comparable in patients with normal hepatic function and in those \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on the administration of TMZ in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child\u2019s Class C) or with renal impairment. Based on the \npharmacokinetic properties of TMZ, it is unlikely that dose reductions are required in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment or any degree of renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised \nwhen TMZ is administered in these patients. \n \nElderly patients \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 19-78 years of age, clearance of TMZ is \nnot affected by age. However, elderly patients (> 70 years of age) appear to be at increased risk of \nneutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTemozolomide SUN should be administered in the fasting state. \n \nThe capsules must be swallowed whole with a glass of water and must not be opened or chewed. \n \nIf vomiting occurs after the dose is administered, a second dose should not be administered that day. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC). \n \nSevere myelosuppression (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nOpportunistic infections and reactivation of infections \n \nOpportunistic infections (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) and reactivation of infections \n(such as HBV, CMV) have been observed during the treatment with TMZ (see section 4.8). \n \nPneumocystis jiroveciipneumonia \n \nPatients who received concomitant TMZ and RT in a pilot trial for the prolonged 42-day schedule \nwere shown to be at particular risk for developing Pneumocystis jiroveciipneumonia (PCP). Thus, \nprophylaxis against PCP is required for all patients receiving concomitant TMZ and RT for the 42-day \nregimen (with a maximum of 49 days) regardless of lymphocyte count. If lymphopenia occurs, they \nare to continue the prophylaxis until recovery of lymphopenia to grade \u2264 1. \n \nThere may be a higher occurrence of PCP when TMZ is administered during a longer dosing regimen. \nHowever, all patients receiving TMZ, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed \nclosely for the development of PCP, regardless of the regimen. Cases of fatal respiratory failure have \nbeen reported in patients using TMZ, in particular in combination with dexamethasone or other \nsteroids. \n \nHepatitis B virus \n \nHepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in death, has been \nreported. Experts in liver disease should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with \npositive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease). During treatment patients should be \nmonitored and managed appropriately. \n \nHepatotoxicity \n \nHepatic injury, including fatal hepatic failure, has been reported in patients treated with TMZ (see \nsection 4.8). Baseline liver function tests should be performed prior to treatment initiation. If \nabnormal, physicians should assess the benefit/risk prior to initiating temozolomide including the \npotential for fatal hepatic failure. For patients on a 42 day treatment cycle liver function tests should \nbe repeated midway during this cycle. For all patients, liver function tests should be checked after each \ntreatment cycle. For patients with significant liver function abnormalities, physicians should assess the \nbenefit/risk of continuing treatment. Liver toxicity may occur several weeks or more after the last \ntreatment with temozolomide. \n \nMeningoencephalitis herpetic \n \nIn post-marketing cases, meningoencephalitis herpetic (including fatal cases) has been observed in \npatients receiving TMZ in combination with radiotherapy, including cases of concomitant steroids \nadministration. \n \nMalignancies \n \nCases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukaemia, have \nalso been reported very rarely (see section 4.8). \n \nAnti-emetic therapy \n \nNausea and vomiting are very commonly associated with TMZ. \nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered prior to or following administration of TMZ. \n \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nAnti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the initial dose of concomitant phase and it is \nstrongly recommended during the monotherapy phase. \n \nPatients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \nPatients who have experienced severe (Grade 3 or 4) vomiting in previous treatment cycles may \nrequire anti-emetic therapy. \n \nLaboratory parameters \n \nPatients treated with TMZ may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, \nwhich may result in aplastic anaemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some \ncases, exposure to concomitant medicinal products associated with aplastic anaemia, including \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to \ndosing, the following laboratory parameters must be met: ANC \u2265 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count \n\u2265 100 x 109/l. A complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or \nwithin 48 hours of that day, and weekly until ANC > 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count > 100 x 109/l. If \nANC falls to < 1.0 x 109/l or the platelet count is < 50 x 109/l during any cycle, the next cycle should \nbe reduced one dose level (see section 4.2). Dose levels include 100 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and \n200 mg/m2. The lowest recommended dose is 100 mg/m2. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is no clinical experience with use of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years. Experience in \nolder children and adolescents is very limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \nElderly patients (> 70 years of age) \n \nElderly patients appear to be at increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, compared with \nyounger patients. Therefore, special care should be taken when TMZ is administered in elderly \npatients. \n \nMale patients \n \nMen being treated with TMZ should be advised not to father a child up to 6 months after receiving the \nlast dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment (see section 4.6). \n \nLactose \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn a separate phase I study, administration of TMZ with ranitidine did not result in alterations in the \nextent of absorption of temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite monomethyl \ntriazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). \n \nAdministration of TMZ with food resulted in a 33 % decrease in Cmax and a 9 % decrease in area under \nthe curve (AUC). \nAs it cannot be excluded that the change in Cmax is clinically significant, Temozolomide SUN should \nbe administered without food. \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\n \nBased on an analysis of population pharmacokinetics in phase II trials, co-administration of \ndexamethasone, prochlorperazine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2 receptor antagonists, or \nphenobarbital did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co-administration with valproic acid was associated \nwith a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ. \n \nNo studies have been conducted to determine the effect of TMZ on the metabolism or elimination of \nother medicinal products. However, since TMZ does not undergo hepatic metabolism and exhibits low \nprotein binding, it is unlikely that it would affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products \n(see section 5.2). \n \nUse of TMZ in combination with other myelosuppressive agents may increase the likelihood of \nmyelosuppression. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy \nwhile they are receiving TMZ. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data in pregnant women. In preclinical studies in rats and rabbits receiving 150 mg/m2 \nTMZ, teratogenicity and/or foetal toxicity were demonstrated (see section 5.3). Temozolomide SUN \nshould not be administered to pregnant women. If use during pregnancy must be considered, the \npatient should be apprised of the potential risk to the foetus.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether TMZ is excreted in human milk; thus, breast-feeding should be discontinued \nwhile receiving treatment with TMZ. \n \nMale fertility \n \nTMZ can have genotoxic effects. Therefore, men being treated with it should be advised not to father a \nchild up to 6 months after receiving the last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm \nprior to treatment, because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with TMZ. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTMZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to fatigue and somnolence (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn patients treated with TMZ, whether used in combination with RT or as monotherapy following RT \nfor newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme, or as monotherapy in patients with recurrent or \nprogressive glioma, the reported very common adverse reactions were similar: nausea, vomiting, \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\nconstipation, anorexia, headache and fatigue. Convulsions were reported very commonly in the newly-\ndiagnosed glioblastoma multiforme patients receiving monotherapy, and rash was reported very \ncommonly in newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme patients receiving TMZ concurrent with RT \nand also as monotherapy, and commonly in recurrent glioma. Most haematologic adverse reactions \nwere reported commonly or very commonly in both indications (Tables 4 and 5), the frequency of \ngrade 3-4 laboratory findings is presented after each table. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn the tables undesirable effects are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. \nFrequency groupings are defined according to the following convention: very common (\u2265 1/10); \ncommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very \nrare (<1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \nNewly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nTable 4 provides treatment-emergent adverse events in patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma \nmultiforme during the concomitant and monotherapy phases of treatment. \n \n\nTable 4.

toxicity for \nmost cytotoxic agents, including TMZ, was observed. When laboratory abnormalities and adverse \nevents were combined across concomitant and monotherapy treatment phases, Grade 3 or Grade 4 \nneutrophil abnormalities including neutropenic events were observed in 8 % of the patients. Grade 3 or \nGrade 4 thrombocyte abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic events were observed in 14 % of the \npatients who received TMZ. \n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \nIn clinical trials, the most frequently occurring treatment-related undesirable effects were \ngastrointestinal disorders, specifically nausea (43 %) and vomiting (36 %). These reactions were \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\nusually Grade 1 or 2 (0-5 episodes of vomiting in 24 hours) and were either self-limiting or readily \ncontrolled with standard anti-emetic therapy. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting was 4 %. \n \nTable 5 includes adverse reactions reported during clinical trials for recurrent or progressive malignant \nglioma and following the marketing of Temozolomide SUN. \n \n\nTable 5.

This led to hospitalisation and/or discontinuation of TMZ in 8 % and \n4 %, respectively. Myelosuppression was predictable (usually within the first few cycles, with the \nnadir between Day 21 and Day 28), and recovery was rapid, usually within 1-2 weeks. No evidence of \ncumulative myelosuppression was observed. The presence of thrombocytopenia may increase the risk \nof bleeding, and the presence of neutropenia or leukopenia may increase the risk of infection. \n \nOther special populations \n \nGender \n \nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis of clinical trial experience there were 101 female and 169 \nmale subjects for whom nadir neutrophil counts were available and 110 female and 174 male subjects \nfor whom nadir platelet counts were available. There were higher rates of Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC \n< 0.5 x 109/l), 12 % vs 5 %, and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/l ), 9 % vs 3 %, in women vs men in the \nfirst cycle of therapy. In a 400 subject recurrent glioma data set, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 8 % \nof female vs 4 % of male subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 8 % of female vs 3 % of male \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\nsubjects in the first cycle of therapy. In a study of 288 subjects with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma \nmultiforme, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 3 % of female vs 0 % of male subjects and Grade 4 \nthrombocytopenia in 1 % of female vs 0 % of male subjects in the first cycle of therapy. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Although \nthe data is limited, tolerance in children is expected to be the same as in adults. The safety of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years has not been established. \n \nPost-marketing experience \n \nThe following additional serious adverse reactions have been identified during post-marketing \nexposure: \n \nTable 6.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses of 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 mg/m2 (total dose per cycle over 5 days) have been evaluated \nclinically in patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was haematological and was reported with any dose but is \nexpected to be more severe at higher doses. An overdose of 10,000 mg (total dose in a single cycle, \nover 5 days) was taken by one patient and the adverse reactions reported were pancytopenia, pyrexia, \nmultiorgan failure and death. There are reports of patients who have taken the recommended dose for \nmore than 5 days of treatment (up to 64 days) with adverse events reported including bone marrow \nsuppression, with or without infection, in some cases severe and prolonged and resulting in death. In \nthe event of an overdose, haematological evaluation is needed. Supportive measures should be \nprovided as necessary. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other alkylating agents, ATC code: L01A X03. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTemozolomide is a triazene, which undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiologic pH to the \nactive monomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to \nbe due primarily to alkylation at the O6 position of guanine with additional alkylation also occurring at \nthe N7 position. Cytotoxic lesions that develop subsequently are thought to involve aberrant repair of \nthe methyl adduct. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nNewly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nA total of 573 patients were randomised to receive either TMZ + RT (n=287) or RT alone (n=286). \nPatients in the TMZ + RT arm received concomitant TMZ (75 mg/m2) once daily, starting the first day \nof RT until the last day of RT, for 42 days (with a maximum of 49 days). This was followed by \nmonotherapy TMZ (150-200 mg/m2) on Days 1-5 of every 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles, starting 4 \nweeks after the end of RT. Patients in the control arm received RT only. Pneumocystis \njiroveciipneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis was required during RT and combined TMZ therapy. \n \nTMZ was administered as salvage therapy in the follow-up phase in 161 patients of the 282 (57 %) in \nthe RT alone arm, and 62 patients of the 277 (22 %) in the TMZ + RT arm. \n \nThe hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 1.59 (95 % CI for HR=1.33-1.91) with a log-rank p \n< 0.0001 in favour of the TMZ arm. The estimated probability of surviving 2 years or more (26 % vs \n10 %) is higher for the RT + TMZ arm. The addition of concomitant TMZ to RT, followed by TMZ \nmonotherapy in the treatment of patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme demonstrated \na statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with RT alone (Figure 1). \n \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\n Figure 1 Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (intent-to-treat population) \n\n \n \nThe results from the trial were not consistent in the subgroup of patients with a poor performance \nstatus (WHO PS=2, n=70), where overall survival and time to progression were similar in both arms. \nHowever, no unacceptable risks appear to be present in this patient group. \n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \nData on clinical efficacy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (Karnofsky performance status \n[KPS] \u2265 70), progressive or recurrent after surgery and RT, were based on two clinical trials with oral \nTMZ. One was a non-comparative trial in 138 patients (29 % received prior chemotherapy), and the \nother was a randomised active-controlled trial of TMZ vs procarbazine in a total of 225 patients (67 % \nreceived prior treatment with nitrosourea based chemotherapy). In both trials, the primary endpoint \nwas progression-free survival (PFS) defined by MRI scans or neurological worsening. In the \nnoncomparative trial, the PFS at 6 months was 19 %, the median progression-free survival was 2.1 \nmonths, and the median overall survival 5.4 months. The objective response rate (ORR) based on MRI \nscans was 8 %. \n \nIn the randomised active-controlled trial, the PFS at 6 months was significantly greater for TMZ than \nfor procarbazine (21 % vs 8 %, respectively \u2013 chi-square p=0.008) with median PFS of 2.89 and 1.88 \nmonths respectively (log rank p=0.0063). The median survival was 7.34 and 5.66 months for TMZ and \nprocarbazine, respectively (log rank p=0.33). At 6 months, the fraction of surviving patients was \nsignificantly higher in the TMZ arm (60 %) compared with the procarbazine arm (44 %) (chi-square \np=0.019). In patients with prior chemotherapy a benefit was indicated in those with a KPS \u2265 80. \n \nData on time to worsening of neurological status favoured TMZ over procarbazine as did data on time \nto worsening of performance status (decrease to a KPS of < 70 or a decrease by at least 30 points). The \nmedian times to progression in these endpoints ranged from 0.7 to 2.1 months longer for TMZ than for \nprocarbazine (log rank p=< 0.01 to 0.03). \n \nRecurrent anaplastic astrocytoma \n \nIn a multicentre, prospective phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral TMZ in the \ntreatment of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse, the 6 month PFS was 46 %. The \nmedian PFS was 5.4 months. Median overall survival was 14.6 months. Response rate, based on the \ncentral reviewer assessment, was 35 % (13 CR and 43 PR) for the intent-to-treat population (ITT) \nn=162. In 43 patients stable disease was reported. The 6-month event-free survival for the ITT \npopulation was 44 % with a median event-free survival of 4.6 months, which was similar to the results \nfor the progression-free survival. For the eligible histology population, the efficacy results were \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\nsimilar. Achieving a radiological objective response or maintaining progression-free status was \nstrongly associated with maintained or improved quality of life. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Tolerance \nto TMZ is similar to adults. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nTMZ is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH primarily to the active species, 3-methyl-(triazen-\n1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). MTIC is spontaneously hydrolyzed to 5-amino-imidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC), a known intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to \nmethylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species. The cytotoxicity of MTIC is \nthought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine. \nRelative to the AUC of TMZ, the exposure to MTIC and AIC is ~ 2.4 % and 23 %, respectively. In \nvivo, the t1/2 of MTIC was similar to that of TMZ, 1.8 hr. \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration to adult patients, TMZ is absorbed rapidly, with peak concentrations reached \nas early as 20 minutes post-administration (mean time between 0.5 and 1.5 hours). After oral \nadministration of 14C-labelled TMZ, mean faecal excretion of 14C over 7 days post-dose was 0.8 % \nindicating complete absorption. \n \nDistribution \n \nTMZ demonstrates low protein binding (10 % to 20 %), and thus it is not expected to interact with \nhighly protein-bound substances. \n \nPET studies in humans and preclinical data suggest that TMZ crosses the blood-brain barrier rapidly \nand is present in the CSF. CSF penetration was confirmed in one patient; CSF exposure based on AUC \nof TMZ was approximately 30 % of that in plasma, which is consistent with animal data. \n \nElimination \n \nThe half-life (t1/2) in plasma is approximately 1.8 hours. The major route of 14C elimination is renal. \nFollowing oral administration, approximately 5 % to 10 % of the dose is recovered unchanged in the \nurine over 24 hours, and the remainder excreted as temozolomide acid, 5-aminoimidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC) or unidentified polar metabolites. \n \nPlasma concentrations increase in a dose-related manner. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution and \nhalf-life are independent of dose. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAnalysis of population-based pharmacokinetics of TMZ revealed that plasma TMZ clearance was \nindependent of age, renal function or tobacco use. In a separate pharmacokinetic study, plasma \npharmacokinetic profiles in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those \nobserved in patients with normal hepatic function. \n \nPaediatric patients had a higher AUC than adult patients; however, the maximum tolerated dose \n(MTD) was 1,000 mg/m2 per cycle both in children and in adults. \n \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSingle-cycle (5-day dosing, 23 days non-treatment), 3- and 6-cycle toxicity studies were conducted in \nrats and dogs. The primary targets of toxicity included the bone marrow, lymphoreticular system, \ntestes, the gastrointestinal tract and, at higher doses, which were lethal to 60 % to 100 % of rats and \ndogs tested, degeneration of the retina occurred. Most of the toxicity showed evidence of reversibility, \nexcept for adverse events on the male reproductive system and retinal degeneration. However, because \nthe doses implicated in retinal degeneration were in the lethal dose range, and no comparable effect \nhas been observed in clinical studies, this finding was not considered to have clinical relevance. \n \nTMZ is an embryotoxic, teratogenic and genotoxic alkylating agent. TMZ is more toxic to the rat and \ndog than to humans, and the clinical dose approximates the minimum lethal dose in rats and dogs. \nDose-related reductions in leukocytes and platelets appear to be sensitive indicators of toxicity. A \nvariety of neoplasms, including mammary carcinomas, keratocanthoma of the skin and basal cell \nadenoma were observed in the 6-cycle rat study while no tumours or pre-neoplastic changes were \nevident in dog studies. Rats appear to be particularly sensitive to oncogenic effects of TMZ, with the \noccurrence of first tumours within 3 months of initiating dosing. This latency period is very short even \nfor an alkylating agent. \n \nResults of the Ames/salmonella and Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte (HPBL) chromosome \naberration tests showed a positive mutagenicity response. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTemozolomide SUN is indicated for the treatment of: \n- adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy \n\n(RT) and subsequently as monotherapy treatment. \n- children from the age of three years, adolescents and adult patients with malignant glioma, such \n\nas glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma, showing recurrence or progression after \nstandard therapy. \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTemozolomide SUN should only be prescribed by physicians experienced in the oncological treatment \nof brain tumours. \n \nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nTemozolomide SUN is administered in combination with focal radiotherapy (concomitant phase) \nfollowed by up to 6 cycles of temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy (monotherapy phase). \n \nConcomitant phase \n \nTMZ is administered orally at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 42 days concomitant with focal \nradiotherapy (60 Gy administered in 30 fractions). No dose reductions are recommended, but delay or \ndiscontinuation of TMZ administration should be decided weekly according to haematological and \nnon-haematological toxicity criteria. TMZ administration can be continued throughout the 42 day \nconcomitant period (up to 49 days) if all of the following conditions are met: \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\n- absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 109/l \n- thrombocyte count \u2265 100 x 109/l \n- common toxicity criteria (CTC) non-haematological toxicity \u2264 Grade 1 (except for alopecia, \n\nnausea and vomiting). \n \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained weekly. TMZ administration should be \ntemporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued during the concomitant phase according to the \nhaematological and non-haematological toxicity criteria as noted in Table 1. \n\n Table 1.

Dose in Cycle 1 (monotherapy) is 150 mg/m2 once daily for 5 days \nfollowed by 23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, the dose is escalated to 200 mg/m2 if \nthe CTC non-haematological toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade \u2264 2 (except for alopecia, nausea and \nvomiting), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is \u2265 1.5 x 109/l, and the thrombocyte count is \n\u2265 100 x 109/l. If the dose was not escalated at Cycle 2, escalation should not be done in subsequent \ncycles. Once escalated, the dose remains at 200 mg/m2 per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent \ncycle except if toxicity occurs. Dose reductions and discontinuations during the monotherapy phase \nshould be applied according to Tables 2 and 3. \n \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose of \nTMZ).

In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the initial \ndose is 150 mg/m2 once daily, to be increased in the second cycle to 200 mg/m2 once daily, for 5 days \nif there is no haematological toxicity (see section 4.4) \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn patients 3 years of age or older, TMZ is only to be used in recurrent or progressive malignant \nglioma. Experience in these children is very limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The safety and efficacy \nof TMZ in children under the age of 3 years have not been established. No data are available. \n \nPatients with hepatic or renal impairment \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of TMZ were comparable in patients with normal hepatic function and in those \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on the administration of TMZ in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child\u2019s Class C) or with renal impairment. Based on the \npharmacokinetic properties of TMZ, it is unlikely that dose reductions are required in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment or any degree of renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised \nwhen TMZ is administered in these patients. \n \nElderly patients \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 19-78 years of age, clearance of TMZ is \nnot affected by age. However, elderly patients (> 70 years of age) appear to be at increased risk of \nneutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTemozolomide SUN should be administered in the fasting state. \n \nThe capsules must be swallowed whole with a glass of water and must not be opened or chewed. \n \nIf vomiting occurs after the dose is administered, a second dose should not be administered that day. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC). \n \nSevere myelosuppression (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nOpportunistic infections and reactivation of infections \n \nOpportunistic infections (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) and reactivation of infections \n(such as HBV, CMV) have been observed during the treatment with TMZ (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\nPneumocystis jiroveciipneumonia \n \nPatients who received concomitant TMZ and RT in a pilot trial for the prolonged 42-day schedule \nwere shown to be at particular risk for developing Pneumocystis jiroveciipneumonia (PCP). Thus, \nprophylaxis against PCP is required for all patients receiving concomitant TMZ and RT for the 42-day \nregimen (with a maximum of 49 days) regardless of lymphocyte count. If lymphopenia occurs, they \nare to continue the prophylaxis until recovery of lymphopenia to grade \u2264 1. \n \nThere may be a higher occurrence of PCP when TMZ is administered during a longer dosing regimen. \nHowever, all patients receiving TMZ, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed \nclosely for the development of PCP, regardless of the regimen. Cases of fatal respiratory failure have \nbeen reported in patients using TMZ, in particular in combination with dexamethasone or other \nsteroids. \n \nHepatitis B virus \n \nHepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in death, has been \nreported. Experts in liver disease should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with \npositive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease). During treatment patients should be \nmonitored and managed appropriately. \n \nHepatotoxicity \n \nHepatic injury, including fatal hepatic failure, has been reported in patients treated with TMZ (see \nsection 4.8). Baseline liver function tests should be performed prior to treatment initiation. If \nabnormal, physicians should assess the benefit/risk prior to initiating temozolomide including the \npotential for fatal hepatic failure. For patients on a 42 day treatment cycle liver function tests should \nbe repeated midway during this cycle. For all patients, liver function tests should be checked after each \ntreatment cycle. For patients with significant liver function abnormalities, physicians should assess the \nbenefit/risk of continuing treatment. Liver toxicity may occur several weeks or more after the last \ntreatment with temozolomide. \n \nMeningoencephalitis herpetic \n \nIn post-marketing cases, meningoencephalitis herpetic (including fatal cases) has been observed in \npatients receiving TMZ in combination with radiotherapy, including cases of concomitant steroids \nadministration. \n \nMalignancies \n \nCases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukaemia, have \nalso been reported very rarely (see section 4.8). \n \nAnti-emetic therapy \n \nNausea and vomiting are very commonly associated with TMZ. \nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered prior to or following administration of TMZ. \n \nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nAnti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the initial dose of concomitant phase and it is \nstrongly recommended during the monotherapy phase. \n \nPatients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\nPatients who have experienced severe (Grade 3 or 4) vomiting in previous treatment cycles may \nrequire anti-emetic therapy. \n \nLaboratory parameters \n \nPatients treated with TMZ may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, \nwhich may result in aplastic anaemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some \ncases, exposure to concomitant medicinal products associated with aplastic anaemia, including \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to \ndosing, the following laboratory parameters must be met: ANC \u2265 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count \n\u2265 100 x 109/l. A complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or \nwithin 48 hours of that day, and weekly until ANC > 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count > 100 x 109/l. If \nANC falls to < 1.0 x 109/l or the platelet count is < 50 x 109/l during any cycle, the next cycle should \nbe reduced one dose level (see section 4.2). Dose levels include 100 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and \n200 mg/m2. The lowest recommended dose is 100 mg/m2. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is no clinical experience with use of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years. Experience in \nolder children and adolescents is very limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \nElderly patients (> 70 years of age) \n \nElderly patients appear to be at increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, compared with \nyounger patients. Therefore, special care should be taken when TMZ is administered in elderly \npatients. \n \nMale patients \n \nMen being treated with TMZ should be advised not to father a child up to 6 months after receiving the \nlast dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment (see section 4.6). \n \nLactose \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn a separate phase I study, administration of TMZ with ranitidine did not result in alterations in the \nextent of absorption of temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite monomethyl \ntriazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). \n \nAdministration of TMZ with food resulted in a 33 % decrease in Cmax and a 9 % decrease in area under \nthe curve (AUC). \nAs it cannot be excluded that the change in Cmax is clinically significant, Temozolomide SUN should \nbe administered without food. \n \nBased on an analysis of population pharmacokinetics in phase II trials, co-administration of \ndexamethasone, prochlorperazine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2 receptor antagonists, or \nphenobarbital did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co-administration with valproic acid was associated \nwith a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ. \n \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\nNo studies have been conducted to determine the effect of TMZ on the metabolism or elimination of \nother medicinal products. However, since TMZ does not undergo hepatic metabolism and exhibits low \nprotein binding, it is unlikely that it would affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products \n(see section 5.2). \n \nUse of TMZ in combination with other myelosuppressive agents may increase the likelihood of \nmyelosuppression. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy \nwhile they are receiving TMZ. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data in pregnant women. In preclinical studies in rats and rabbits receiving 150 mg/m2 \nTMZ, teratogenicity and/or foetal toxicity were demonstrated (see section 5.3). Temozolomide SUN \nshould not be administered to pregnant women. If use during pregnancy must be considered, the \npatient should be apprised of the potential risk to the foetus.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether TMZ is excreted in human milk; thus, breast-feeding should be discontinued \nwhile receiving treatment with TMZ. \n \nMale fertility \n \nTMZ can have genotoxic effects. Therefore, men being treated with it should be advised not to father a \nchild up to 6 months after receiving the last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm \nprior to treatment, because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with TMZ. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTMZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to fatigue and somnolence (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn patients treated with TMZ, whether used in combination with RT or as monotherapy following RT \nfor newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme, or as monotherapy in patients with recurrent or \nprogressive glioma, the reported very common adverse reactions were similar: nausea, vomiting, \nconstipation, anorexia, headache and fatigue. Convulsions were reported very commonly in the newly-\ndiagnosed glioblastoma multiforme patients receiving monotherapy, and rash was reported very \ncommonly in newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme patients receiving TMZ concurrent with RT \nand also as monotherapy, and commonly in recurrent glioma. Most haematologic adverse reactions \nwere reported commonly or very commonly in both indications (Tables 4 and 5), the frequency of \ngrade 3-4 laboratory findings is presented after each table. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn the tables undesirable effects are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. \nFrequency groupings are defined according to the following convention: very common (\u2265 1/10); \ncommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very \nrare (<1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \nNewly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nTable 4 provides treatment-emergent adverse events in patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma \nmultiforme during the concomitant and monotherapy phases of treatment. \n\nTable 4.

toxicity for \nmost cytotoxic agents, including TMZ, was observed. When laboratory abnormalities and adverse \nevents were combined across concomitant and monotherapy treatment phases, Grade 3 or Grade 4 \nneutrophil abnormalities including neutropenic events were observed in 8 % of the patients. Grade 3 or \nGrade 4 thrombocyte abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic events were observed in 14 % of the \npatients who received TMZ. \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \n\n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \nIn clinical trials, the most frequently occurring treatment-related undesirable effects were \ngastrointestinal disorders, specifically nausea (43 %) and vomiting (36 %). These reactions were \nusually Grade 1 or 2 (0-5 episodes of vomiting in 24 hours) and were either self-limiting or readily \ncontrolled with standard anti-emetic therapy. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting was 4 %. \n \nTable 5 includes adverse reactions reported during clinical trials for recurrent or progressive malignant \nglioma and following the marketing of Temozolomide SUN. \n \n\nTable 5. Adverse reactions in patients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma \nInfections and infestations \nRare: Opportunistic infections, including PCP \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nVery common: Neutropenia or lymphopenia (grade 3-4), \n\nthrombocytopenia (grade 3-4) \nUncommon: Pancytopenia, anaemia (grade 3-4), leukopenia \n\n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nVery common: Anorexia \nCommon: Weight decrease \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \nCommon: Somnolence, dizziness, paresthesia \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nCommon: Dyspnoea \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common: Vomiting, nausea, constipation \nCommon: Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Rash, pruritus, alopecia \nVery rare: Erythema multiforme, erythroderma, urticaria, \n\nexanthema \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Fatigue \nCommon: Fever, asthenia, rigors, malaise, pain, taste \n\nperversion \nVery rare: Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, \n\nangioedema \n \nLaboratory results \n \nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 19 % and 17 % respectively, of patients \ntreated for malignant glioma. This led to hospitalisation and/or discontinuation of TMZ in 8 % and \n4 %, respectively. Myelosuppression was predictable (usually within the first few cycles, with the \nnadir between Day 21 and Day 28), and recovery was rapid, usually within 1-2 weeks. No evidence of \ncumulative myelosuppression was observed. The presence of thrombocytopenia may increase the risk \nof bleeding, and the presence of neutropenia or leukopenia may increase the risk of infection. \n \nOther special populations \n \nGender \n \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \n\nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis of clinical trial experience there were 101 female and 169 \nmale subjects for whom nadir neutrophil counts were available and 110 female and 174 male subjects \nfor whom nadir platelet counts were available. There were higher rates of Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC \n< 0.5 x 109/l), 12 % vs 5 %, and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/l ), 9 % vs 3 %, in women vs men in the \nfirst cycle of therapy. In a 400 subject recurrent glioma data set, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 8 % \nof female vs 4 % of male subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 8 % of female vs 3 % of male \nsubjects in the first cycle of therapy. In a study of 288 subjects with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma \nmultiforme, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 3 % of female vs 0 % of male subjects and Grade 4 \nthrombocytopenia in 1 % of female vs 0 % of male subjects in the first cycle of therapy. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Although \nthe data is limited, tolerance in children is expected to be the same as in adults. The safety of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years has not been established. \n \nPost-marketing experience \n \nThe following additional serious adverse reactions have been identified during post-marketing \nexposure: \n \nTable 6. Summary of events reported with temozolomide in the post-marketing setting* \n \nInfections and infestations* \nUncommon: cytomegalovirus infection, infection reactivation such \n\nas cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus\u2020, \nmeningoencephalitis herpetic\u2020, sepsis\u2020 \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders  \n\nVery rare: prolonged pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia\u2020 \nNeoplasm benign, malignant and unspecified \nVery rare: myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), secondary \n\nmalignancies, including myeloid leukaemia \nEndocrine disorders* \nUncommon: diabetes insipidus \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nVery rare: interstitial pneumonitis/pneumonitis, pulmonary \n\nfibrosis, respiratory failure\u2020 \nHepatobiliary disorders* \nCommon: liver enzymes elevations \n\n \nUncommon: hyperbilirubinemia, cholestasis, hepatitis  \n\nhepatic injury, hepatic failure\u2020 \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery rare: toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome \nFrequency not known drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic \n\nsymptoms (DRESS) \n\u2020 Including cases with fatal outcome \n* Frequencies estimated based on relevant clinical trials. \n \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses of 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 mg/m2 (total dose per cycle over 5 days) have been evaluated \nclinically in patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was haematological and was reported with any dose but is \nexpected to be more severe at higher doses. An overdose of 10,000 mg (total dose in a single cycle, \nover 5 days) was taken by one patient and the adverse reactions reported were pancytopenia, pyrexia, \nmultiorgan failure and death. There are reports of patients who have taken the recommended dose for \nmore than 5 days of treatment (up to 64 days) with adverse events reported including bone marrow \nsuppression, with or without infection, in some cases severe and prolonged and resulting in death. In \nthe event of an overdose, haematological evaluation is needed. Supportive measures should be \nprovided as necessary. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other alkylating agents, ATC code: L01A X03. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTemozolomide is a triazene, which undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiologic pH to the \nactive monomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to \nbe due primarily to alkylation at the O6 position of guanine with additional alkylation also occurring at \nthe N7 position. Cytotoxic lesions that develop subsequently are thought to involve aberrant repair of \nthe methyl adduct. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nNewly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nA total of 573 patients were randomised to receive either TMZ + RT (n=287) or RT alone (n=286). \nPatients in the TMZ + RT arm received concomitant TMZ (75 mg/m2) once daily, starting the first day \nof RT until the last day of RT, for 42 days (with a maximum of 49 days). This was followed by \nmonotherapy TMZ (150-200 mg/m2) on Days 1-5 of every 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles, starting 4 \nweeks after the end of RT. Patients in the control arm received RT only. Pneumocystis \njiroveciipneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis was required during RT and combined TMZ therapy. \n \nTMZ was administered as salvage therapy in the follow-up phase in 161 patients of the 282 (57 %) in \nthe RT alone arm, and 62 patients of the 277 (22 %) in the TMZ + RT arm. \n \nThe hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 1.59 (95 % CI for HR=1.33-1.91) with a log-rank p \n< 0.0001 in favour of the TMZ arm. The estimated probability of surviving 2 years or more (26 % vs \n10 %) is higher for the RT + TMZ arm. The addition of concomitant TMZ to RT, followed by TMZ \nmonotherapy in the treatment of patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme demonstrated \na statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with RT alone (Figure 1). \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n79 \n\n \n\n Figure 1 Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (intent-to-treat population) \n\n \n \nThe results from the trial were not consistent in the subgroup of patients with a poor performance \nstatus (WHO PS=2, n=70), where overall survival and time to progression were similar in both arms. \nHowever, no unacceptable risks appear to be present in this patient group. \n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \nData on clinical efficacy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (Karnofsky performance status \n[KPS] \u2265 70), progressive or recurrent after surgery and RT, were based on two clinical trials with oral \nTMZ. One was a non-comparative trial in 138 patients (29 % received prior chemotherapy), and the \nother was a randomised active-controlled trial of TMZ vs procarbazine in a total of 225 patients (67 % \nreceived prior treatment with nitrosourea based chemotherapy). In both trials, the primary endpoint \nwas progression-free survival (PFS) defined by MRI scans or neurological worsening. In the \nnoncomparative trial, the PFS at 6 months was 19 %, the median progression-free survival was 2.1 \nmonths, and the median overall survival 5.4 months. The objective response rate (ORR) based on MRI \nscans was 8 %. \n \nIn the randomised active-controlled trial, the PFS at 6 months was significantly greater for TMZ than \nfor procarbazine (21 % vs 8 %, respectively \u2013 chi-square p=0.008) with median PFS of 2.89 and 1.88 \nmonths respectively (log rank p=0.0063). The median survival was 7.34 and 5.66 months for TMZ and \nprocarbazine, respectively (log rank p=0.33). At 6 months, the fraction of surviving patients was \nsignificantly higher in the TMZ arm (60 %) compared with the procarbazine arm (44 %) (chi-square \np=0.019). In patients with prior chemotherapy a benefit was indicated in those with a KPS \u2265 80. \n \nData on time to worsening of neurological status favoured TMZ over procarbazine as did data on time \nto worsening of performance status (decrease to a KPS of < 70 or a decrease by at least 30 points). The \nmedian times to progression in these endpoints ranged from 0.7 to 2.1 months longer for TMZ than for \nprocarbazine (log rank p=< 0.01 to 0.03). \n \nRecurrent anaplastic astrocytoma \n \nIn a multicentre, prospective phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral TMZ in the \ntreatment of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse, the 6 month PFS was 46 %. The \nmedian PFS was 5.4 months. Median overall survival was 14.6 months. Response rate, based on the \ncentral reviewer assessment, was 35 % (13 CR and 43 PR) for the intent-to-treat population (ITT) \nn=162. In 43 patients stable disease was reported. The 6-month event-free survival for the ITT \npopulation was 44 % with a median event-free survival of 4.6 months, which was similar to the results \nfor the progression-free survival. For the eligible histology population, the efficacy results were \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\nsimilar. Achieving a radiological objective response or maintaining progression-free status was \nstrongly associated with maintained or improved quality of life. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Tolerance \nto TMZ is similar to adults. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nTMZ is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH primarily to the active species, 3-methyl-(triazen-\n1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). MTIC is spontaneously hydrolyzed to 5-amino-imidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC), a known intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to \nmethylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species. The cytotoxicity of MTIC is \nthought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine. \nRelative to the AUC of TMZ, the exposure to MTIC and AIC is ~ 2.4 % and 23 %, respectively. In \nvivo, the t1/2 of MTIC was similar to that of TMZ, 1.8 hr. \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration to adult patients, TMZ is absorbed rapidly, with peak concentrations reached \nas early as 20 minutes post-administration (mean time between 0.5 and 1.5 hours). After oral \nadministration of 14C-labelled TMZ, mean faecal excretion of 14C over 7 days post-dose was 0.8 % \nindicating complete absorption. \n \nDistribution \n \nTMZ demonstrates low protein binding (10 % to 20 %), and thus it is not expected to interact with \nhighly protein-bound substances. \n \nPET studies in humans and preclinical data suggest that TMZ crosses the blood-brain barrier rapidly \nand is present in the CSF. CSF penetration was confirmed in one patient; CSF exposure based on AUC \nof TMZ was approximately 30 % of that in plasma, which is consistent with animal data. \n \nElimination \n \nThe half-life (t1/2) in plasma is approximately 1.8 hours. The major route of 14C elimination is renal. \nFollowing oral administration, approximately 5 % to 10 % of the dose is recovered unchanged in the \nurine over 24 hours, and the remainder excreted as temozolomide acid, 5-aminoimidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC) or unidentified polar metabolites. \n \nPlasma concentrations increase in a dose-related manner. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution and \nhalf-life are independent of dose. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAnalysis of population-based pharmacokinetics of TMZ revealed that plasma TMZ clearance was \nindependent of age, renal function or tobacco use. In a separate pharmacokinetic study, plasma \npharmacokinetic profiles in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those \nobserved in patients with normal hepatic function. \n \nPaediatric patients had a higher AUC than adult patients; however, the maximum tolerated dose \n(MTD) was 1,000 mg/m2 per cycle both in children and in adults. \n \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSingle-cycle (5-day dosing, 23 days non-treatment), 3- and 6-cycle toxicity studies were conducted in \nrats and dogs. The primary targets of toxicity included the bone marrow, lymphoreticular system, \ntestes, the gastrointestinal tract and, at higher doses, which were lethal to 60 % to 100 % of rats and \ndogs tested, degeneration of the retina occurred. Most of the toxicity showed evidence of reversibility, \nexcept for adverse events on the male reproductive system and retinal degeneration. However, because \nthe doses implicated in retinal degeneration were in the lethal dose range, and no comparable effect \nhas been observed in clinical studies, this finding was not considered to have clinical relevance. \n \nTMZ is an embryotoxic, teratogenic and genotoxic alkylating agent. TMZ is more toxic to the rat and \ndog than to humans, and the clinical dose approximates the minimum lethal dose in rats and dogs. \nDose-related reductions in leukocytes and platelets appear to be sensitive indicators of toxicity. A \nvariety of neoplasms, including mammary carcinomas, keratocanthoma of the skin and basal cell \nadenoma were observed in the 6-cycle rat study while no tumours or pre-neoplastic changes were \nevident in dog studies. Rats appear to be particularly sensitive to oncogenic effects of TMZ, with the \noccurrence of first tumours within 3 months of initiating dosing. This latency period is very short even \nfor an alkylating agent. \n \nResults of the Ames/salmonella and Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte (HPBL) chromosome \naberration tests showed a positive mutagenicity response. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTemozolomide SUN is indicated for the treatment of: \n- adult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy \n\n(RT) and subsequently as monotherapy treatment. \n- children from the age of three years, adolescents and adult patients with malignant glioma, such \n\nas glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma, showing recurrence or progression after \nstandard therapy. \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTemozolomide SUN should only be prescribed by physicians experienced in the oncological treatment \nof brain tumours. \n \nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nTemozolomide SUN is administered in combination with focal radiotherapy (concomitant phase) \nfollowed by up to 6 cycles of temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy (monotherapy phase). \n \nConcomitant phase \n \nTMZ is administered orally at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 42 days concomitant with focal \nradiotherapy (60 Gy administered in 30 fractions). No dose reductions are recommended, but delay or \ndiscontinuation of TMZ administration should be decided weekly according to haematological and \nnon-haematological toxicity criteria. TMZ administration can be continued throughout the 42 day \nconcomitant period (up to 49 days) if all of the following conditions are met: \n\n\n\n84 \n\n \n\n- absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 109/l \n- thrombocyte count \u2265 100 x 109/l \n- common toxicity criteria (CTC) non-haematological toxicity \u2264 Grade 1 (except for alopecia, \n\nnausea and vomiting). \n \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained weekly. TMZ administration should be \ntemporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued during the concomitant phase according to the \nhaematological and non-haematological toxicity criteria as noted in Table 1. \n\n Table 1.

Dose in Cycle 1 (monotherapy) is 150 mg/m2 once daily for 5 days \nfollowed by 23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, the dose is escalated to 200 mg/m2 if \nthe CTC non-haematological toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade \u2264 2 (except for alopecia, nausea and \nvomiting), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is \u2265 1.5 x 109/l, and the thrombocyte count is \n\u2265 100 x 109/l. If the dose was not escalated at Cycle 2, escalation should not be done in subsequent \ncycles. Once escalated, the dose remains at 200 mg/m2 per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent \ncycle except if toxicity occurs. Dose reductions and discontinuations during the monotherapy phase \nshould be applied according to Tables 2 and 3. \n \nDuring treatment a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose of \nTMZ). The dose should be reduced or administration discontinued according to Table 3. \n Table 2.

In patients previously untreated with chemotherapy, TMZ is \nadministered orally at a dose of 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days followed by a 23 day \ntreatment interruption (total of 28 days). In patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the initial \ndose is 150 mg/m2 once daily, to be increased in the second cycle to 200 mg/m2 once daily, for 5 days \nif there is no haematological toxicity (see section 4.4) \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn patients 3 years of age or older, TMZ is only to be used in recurrent or progressive malignant \nglioma. Experience in these children is very limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The safety and efficacy \nof TMZ in children under the age of 3 years have not been established. No data are available. \n \nPatients with hepatic or renal impairment \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of TMZ were comparable in patients with normal hepatic function and in those \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on the administration of TMZ in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (Child\u2019s Class C) or with renal impairment. Based on the \npharmacokinetic properties of TMZ, it is unlikely that dose reductions are required in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment or any degree of renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised \nwhen TMZ is administered in these patients. \n \nElderly patients \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 19-78 years of age, clearance of TMZ is \nnot affected by age. However, elderly patients (> 70 years of age) appear to be at increased risk of \nneutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTemozolomide SUN should be administered in the fasting state. \n \nThe capsules must be swallowed whole with a glass of water and must not be opened or chewed. \n \nIf vomiting occurs after the dose is administered, a second dose should not be administered that day. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC). \n \nSevere myelosuppression (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nOpportunistic infections and reactivation of infections \n \nOpportunistic infections (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) and reactivation of infections \n(such as HBV, CMV) have been observed during the treatment with TMZ (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n86 \n\n \n\nPneumocystis jiroveciipneumonia \n \nPatients who received concomitant TMZ and RT in a pilot trial for the prolonged 42-day schedule \nwere shown to be at particular risk for developing Pneumocystis jiroveciipneumonia (PCP). Thus, \nprophylaxis against PCP is required for all patients receiving concomitant TMZ and RT for the 42-day \nregimen (with a maximum of 49 days) regardless of lymphocyte count. If lymphopenia occurs, they \nare to continue the prophylaxis until recovery of lymphopenia to grade \u2264 1. \n \nThere may be a higher occurrence of PCP when TMZ is administered during a longer dosing regimen. \nHowever, all patients receiving TMZ, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed \nclosely for the development of PCP, regardless of the regimen. Cases of fatal respiratory failure have \nbeen reported in patients using TMZ, in particular in combination with dexamethasone or other \nsteroids. \n \nHepatitis B virus \n \nHepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in death, has been \nreported. Experts in liver disease should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients with \npositive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease). During treatment patients should be \nmonitored and managed appropriately. \n \nHepatotoxicity \n \nHepatic injury, including fatal hepatic failure, has been reported in patients treated with TMZ (see \nsection 4.8). Baseline liver function tests should be performed prior to treatment initiation. If \nabnormal, physicians should assess the benefit/risk prior to initiating temozolomide including the \npotential for fatal hepatic failure. For patients on a 42 day treatment cycle liver function tests should \nbe repeated midway during this cycle. For all patients, liver function tests should be checked after each \ntreatment cycle. For patients with significant liver function abnormalities, physicians should assess the \nbenefit/risk of continuing treatment. Liver toxicity may occur several weeks or more after the last \ntreatment with temozolomide. \n \nMeningoencephalitis herpetic \n \nIn post-marketing cases, meningoencephalitis herpetic (including fatal cases) has been observed in \npatients receiving TMZ in combination with radiotherapy, including cases of concomitant steroids \nadministration. \n \nMalignancies \n \nCases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukaemia, have \nalso been reported very rarely (see section 4.8). \n \nAnti-emetic therapy \n \nNausea and vomiting are very commonly associated with TMZ. \nAnti-emetic therapy may be administered prior to or following administration of TMZ. \n \nAdult patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nAnti-emetic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the initial dose of concomitant phase and it is \nstrongly recommended during the monotherapy phase. \n \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\nPatients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \nPatients who have experienced severe (Grade 3 or 4) vomiting in previous treatment cycles may \nrequire anti-emetic therapy. \n \nLaboratory parameters \n \nPatients treated with TMZ may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, \nwhich may result in aplastic anaemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some \ncases, exposure to concomitant medicinal products associated with aplastic anaemia, including \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to \ndosing, the following laboratory parameters must be met: ANC \u2265 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count \n\u2265 100 x 109/l. A complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or \nwithin 48 hours of that day, and weekly until ANC > 1.5 x 109/l and platelet count > 100 x 109/l. If \nANC falls to < 1.0 x 109/l or the platelet count is < 50 x 109/l during any cycle, the next cycle should \nbe reduced one dose level (see section 4.2). Dose levels include 100 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, and \n200 mg/m2. The lowest recommended dose is 100 mg/m2. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is no clinical experience with use of TMZ in children under the age of 3 years. Experience in \nolder children and adolescents is very limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \nElderly patients (> 70 years of age) \n \nElderly patients appear to be at increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, compared with \nyounger patients. Therefore, special care should be taken when TMZ is administered in elderly \npatients. \n \nMale patients \n \nMen being treated with TMZ should be advised not to father a child up to 6 months after receiving the \nlast dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment (see section 4.6). \n \nLactose \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn a separate phase I study, administration of TMZ with ranitidine did not result in alterations in the \nextent of absorption of temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite monomethyl \ntriazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). \n \nAdministration of TMZ with food resulted in a 33 % decrease in Cmax and a 9 % decrease in area under \nthe curve (AUC). \nAs it cannot be excluded that the change in Cmax is clinically significant, Temozolomide SUN should \nbe administered without food. \n \nBased on an analysis of population pharmacokinetics in phase II trials, co-administration of \ndexamethasone, prochlorperazine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2 receptor antagonists, or \nphenobarbital did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co-administration with valproic acid was associated \nwith a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ. \n\n\n\n88 \n\n \n\n \nNo studies have been conducted to determine the effect of TMZ on the metabolism or elimination of \nother medicinal products. However, since TMZ does not undergo hepatic metabolism and exhibits low \nprotein binding, it is unlikely that it would affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products \n(see section 5.2). \n \nUse of TMZ in combination with other myelosuppressive agents may increase the likelihood of \nmyelosuppression. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy \nwhile they are receiving TMZ. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data in pregnant women. In preclinical studies in rats and rabbits receiving 150 mg/m2 \nTMZ, teratogenicity and/or foetal toxicity were demonstrated (see section 5.3). Temozolomide SUN \nshould not be administered to pregnant women. If use during pregnancy must be considered, the \npatient should be apprised of the potential risk to the foetus.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether TMZ is excreted in human milk; thus, breast-feeding should be discontinued \nwhile receiving treatment with TMZ. \n \nMale fertility \n \nTMZ can have genotoxic effects. Therefore, men being treated with it should be advised not to father a \nchild up to 6 months after receiving the last dose and to seek advice on cryoconservation of sperm \nprior to treatment, because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with TMZ. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTMZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to fatigue and somnolence (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn patients treated with TMZ, whether used in combination with RT or as monotherapy following RT \nfor newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme, or as monotherapy in patients with recurrent or \nprogressive glioma, the reported very common adverse reactions were similar: nausea, vomiting, \nconstipation, anorexia, headache and fatigue. Convulsions were reported very commonly in the newly-\ndiagnosed glioblastoma multiforme patients receiving monotherapy, and rash was reported very \ncommonly in newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme patients receiving TMZ concurrent with RT \nand also as monotherapy, and commonly in recurrent glioma. Most haematologic adverse reactions \n\n\n\n89 \n\n \n\nwere reported commonly or very commonly in both indications (Tables 4 and 5), the frequency of \ngrade 3-4 laboratory findings is presented after each table. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn the tables undesirable effects are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. \nFrequency groupings are defined according to the following convention: very common (\u2265 1/10); \ncommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very \nrare (<1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \nNewly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nTable 4 provides treatment-emergent adverse events in patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma \nmultiforme during the concomitant and monotherapy phases of treatment. \n \n\nTable 4.

\nincreased \n\n \n\n*A patient who was randomised to the RT arm only, received TMZ + RT. \n \nLaboratory results \n \nMyelosuppression (neutropenia and thrombocytopenia), which is known dose-limiting toxicity for \nmost cytotoxic agents, including TMZ, was observed. When laboratory abnormalities and adverse \nevents were combined across concomitant and monotherapy treatment phases, Grade 3 or Grade 4 \nneutrophil abnormalities including neutropenic events were observed in 8 % of the patients. Grade 3 or \nGrade 4 thrombocyte abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic events were observed in 14 % of the \npatients who received TMZ. \n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \nIn clinical trials, the most frequently occurring treatment-related undesirable effects were \ngastrointestinal disorders, specifically nausea (43 %) and vomiting (36 %). These reactions were \nusually Grade 1 or 2 (0-5 episodes of vomiting in 24 hours) and were either self-limiting or readily \ncontrolled with standard anti-emetic therapy. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting was 4 %. \n \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \n\nTable 5 includes adverse reactions reported during clinical trials for recurrent or progressive malignant \nglioma and following the marketing of Temozolomide SUN. \n\nTable 5. Adverse reactions in patients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma \nInfections and infestations \nRare: Opportunistic infections, including PCP \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nVery common: Neutropenia or lymphopenia (grade 3-4), \n\nthrombocytopenia (grade 3-4) \nUncommon: Pancytopenia, anaemia (grade 3-4), leukopenia \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nVery common: Anorexia \nCommon: Weight decrease \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: Headache \nCommon: Somnolence, dizziness, paresthesia \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nCommon: Dyspnoea \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common: Vomiting, nausea, constipation \nCommon: Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: Rash, pruritus, alopecia \nVery rare: Erythema multiforme, erythroderma, urticaria, \n\nexanthema \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: Fatigue \nCommon: Fever, asthenia, rigors, malaise, pain, taste \n\nperversion \nVery rare: Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, \n\nangioedema \n \nLaboratory results \n \nGrade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 19 % and 17 % respectively, of patients \ntreated for malignant glioma. This led to hospitalisation and/or discontinuation of TMZ in 8 % and \n4 %, respectively. Myelosuppression was predictable (usually within the first few cycles, with the \nnadir between Day 21 and Day 28), and recovery was rapid, usually within 1-2 weeks. No evidence of \ncumulative myelosuppression was observed. The presence of thrombocytopenia may increase the risk \nof bleeding, and the presence of neutropenia or leukopenia may increase the risk of infection. \n \nOther special populations \n \nGender \n \nIn a population pharmacokinetics analysis of clinical trial experience there were 101 female and 169 \nmale subjects for whom nadir neutrophil counts were available and 110 female and 174 male subjects \nfor whom nadir platelet counts were available. There were higher rates of Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC \n< 0.5 x 109/l), 12 % vs 5 %, and thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/l ), 9 % vs 3 %, in women vs men in the \nfirst cycle of therapy. In a 400 subject recurrent glioma data set, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 8 % \nof female vs 4 % of male subjects and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in 8 % of female vs 3 % of male \nsubjects in the first cycle of therapy. In a study of 288 subjects with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma \nmultiforme, Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 3 % of female vs 0 % of male subjects and Grade 4 \nthrombocytopenia in 1 % of female vs 0 % of male subjects in the first cycle of therapy. \n \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Although \nthe data is limited, tolerance in children is expected to be the same as in adults. The safety of TMZ in \nchildren under the age of 3 years has not been established. \n \nPost-marketing experience \n \nThe following additional serious adverse reactions have been identified during post-marketing \nexposure: \n \nTable 6. Summary of events reported with temozolomide in the post-marketing setting* \n \nInfections and infestations* \nUncommon: cytomegalovirus infection, infection reactivation such \n\nas cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus\u2020, \nmeningoencephalitis herpetic\u2020, sepsis\u2020 \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders  \n\nVery rare: prolonged pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia\u2020 \nNeoplasm benign, malignant and unspecified \nVery rare: myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), secondary \n\nmalignancies, including myeloid leukaemia \nEndocrine disorders*  \nUncommon: diabetes insipidus \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nVery rare: interstitial pneumonitis/pneumonitis, pulmonary \n\nfibrosis, respiratory failure\u2020 \nHepatobiliary disorders* \nCommon: liver enzymes elevations  \n\n\u2020 \nUncommon: hyperbilirubinemia, cholestasis, hepatitis  \n\nhepatic injury, hepatic failure \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery rare: toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome \nFrequency not known: drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic \n\nsymptoms (DRESS) \n\u2020 Including cases with fatal outcome \n* Frequencies estimated based on relevant clinical trials. \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses of 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 mg/m2 (total dose per cycle over 5 days) have been evaluated \nclinically in patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was haematological and was reported with any dose but is \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n94 \n\n \n\nexpected to be more severe at higher doses. An overdose of 10,000 mg (total dose in a single cycle, \nover 5 days) was taken by one patient and the adverse reactions reported were pancytopenia, pyrexia, \nmultiorgan failure and death. There are reports of patients who have taken the recommended dose for \nmore than 5 days of treatment (up to 64 days) with adverse events reported including bone marrow \nsuppression, with or without infection, in some cases severe and prolonged and resulting in death. In \nthe event of an overdose, haematological evaluation is needed. Supportive measures should be \nprovided as necessary. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other alkylating agents, ATC code: L01A X03. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTemozolomide is a triazene, which undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiologic pH to the \nactive monomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to \nbe due primarily to alkylation at the O6 position of guanine with additional alkylation also occurring at \nthe N7 position. Cytotoxic lesions that develop subsequently are thought to involve aberrant repair of \nthe methyl adduct. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nNewly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nA total of 573 patients were randomised to receive either TMZ + RT (n=287) or RT alone (n=286). \nPatients in the TMZ + RT arm received concomitant TMZ (75 mg/m2) once daily, starting the first day \nof RT until the last day of RT, for 42 days (with a maximum of 49 days). This was followed by \nmonotherapy TMZ (150-200 mg/m2) on Days 1-5 of every 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles, starting 4 \nweeks after the end of RT. Patients in the control arm received RT only. Pneumocystis \njiroveciipneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis was required during RT and combined TMZ therapy. \n \nTMZ was administered as salvage therapy in the follow-up phase in 161 patients of the 282 (57 %) in \nthe RT alone arm, and 62 patients of the 277 (22 %) in the TMZ + RT arm. \n \nThe hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 1.59 (95 % CI for HR=1.33-1.91) with a log-rank p \n< 0.0001 in favour of the TMZ arm. The estimated probability of surviving 2 years or more (26 % vs \n10 %) is higher for the RT + TMZ arm. The addition of concomitant TMZ to RT, followed by TMZ \nmonotherapy in the treatment of patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme demonstrated \na statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with RT alone (Figure 1). \n \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \n\n Figure 1 Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (intent-to-treat population) \n\n \n \nThe results from the trial were not consistent in the subgroup of patients with a poor performance \nstatus (WHO PS=2, n=70), where overall survival and time to progression were similar in both arms. \nHowever, no unacceptable risks appear to be present in this patient group. \n \nRecurrent or progressive malignant glioma \n \nData on clinical efficacy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (Karnofsky performance status \n[KPS] \u2265 70), progressive or recurrent after surgery and RT, were based on two clinical trials with oral \nTMZ. One was a non-comparative trial in 138 patients (29 % received prior chemotherapy), and the \nother was a randomised active-controlled trial of TMZ vs procarbazine in a total of 225 patients (67 % \nreceived prior treatment with nitrosourea based chemotherapy). In both trials, the primary endpoint \nwas progression-free survival (PFS) defined by MRI scans or neurological worsening. In the \nnoncomparative trial, the PFS at 6 months was 19 %, the median progression-free survival was 2.1 \nmonths, and the median overall survival 5.4 months. The objective response rate (ORR) based on MRI \nscans was 8 %. \n \nIn the randomised active-controlled trial, the PFS at 6 months was significantly greater for TMZ than \nfor procarbazine (21 % vs 8 %, respectively \u2013 chi-square p=0.008) with median PFS of 2.89 and 1.88 \nmonths respectively (log rank p=0.0063). The median survival was 7.34 and 5.66 months for TMZ and \nprocarbazine, respectively (log rank p=0.33). At 6 months, the fraction of surviving patients was \nsignificantly higher in the TMZ arm (60 %) compared with the procarbazine arm (44 %) (chi-square \np=0.019). In patients with prior chemotherapy a benefit was indicated in those with a KPS \u2265 80. \n \nData on time to worsening of neurological status favoured TMZ over procarbazine as did data on time \nto worsening of performance status (decrease to a KPS of < 70 or a decrease by at least 30 points). The \nmedian times to progression in these endpoints ranged from 0.7 to 2.1 months longer for TMZ than for \nprocarbazine (log rank p=< 0.01 to 0.03). \n \nRecurrent anaplastic astrocytoma \n \nIn a multicentre, prospective phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral TMZ in the \ntreatment of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse, the 6 month PFS was 46 %. The \nmedian PFS was 5.4 months. Median overall survival was 14.6 months. Response rate, based on the \ncentral reviewer assessment, was 35 % (13 CR and 43 PR) for the intent-to-treat population (ITT) \nn=162. In 43 patients stable disease was reported. The 6-month event-free survival for the ITT \npopulation was 44 % with a median event-free survival of 4.6 months, which was similar to the results \nfor the progression-free survival. For the eligible histology population, the efficacy results were \n\n\n\n96 \n\n \n\nsimilar. Achieving a radiological objective response or maintaining progression-free status was \nstrongly associated with maintained or improved quality of life. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nOral TMZ has been studied in paediatric patients (age 3-18 years) with recurrent brainstem glioma or \nrecurrent high grade astrocytoma, in a regimen administered daily for 5 days every 28 days. Tolerance \nto TMZ is similar to adults. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nTMZ is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH primarily to the active species, 3-methyl-(triazen-\n1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC). MTIC is spontaneously hydrolyzed to 5-amino-imidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC), a known intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to \nmethylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species. The cytotoxicity of MTIC is \nthought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine. \nRelative to the AUC of TMZ, the exposure to MTIC and AIC is ~ 2.4 % and 23 %, respectively. In \nvivo, the t1/2 of MTIC was similar to that of TMZ, 1.8 hr. \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oral administration to adult patients, TMZ is absorbed rapidly, with peak concentrations reached \nas early as 20 minutes post-administration (mean time between 0.5 and 1.5 hours). After oral \nadministration of 14C-labelled TMZ, mean faecal excretion of 14C over 7 days post-dose was 0.8 % \nindicating complete absorption. \n \nDistribution \n \nTMZ demonstrates low protein binding (10 % to 20 %), and thus it is not expected to interact with \nhighly protein-bound substances. \n \nPET studies in humans and preclinical data suggest that TMZ crosses the blood-brain barrier rapidly \nand is present in the CSF. CSF penetration was confirmed in one patient; CSF exposure based on AUC \nof TMZ was approximately 30 % of that in plasma, which is consistent with animal data. \n \nElimination \n \nThe half-life (t1/2) in plasma is approximately 1.8 hours. The major route of 14C elimination is renal. \nFollowing oral administration, approximately 5 % to 10 % of the dose is recovered unchanged in the \nurine over 24 hours, and the remainder excreted as temozolomide acid, 5-aminoimidazole-4-\ncarboxamide (AIC) or unidentified polar metabolites. \n \nPlasma concentrations increase in a dose-related manner. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution and \nhalf-life are independent of dose. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAnalysis of population-based pharmacokinetics of TMZ revealed that plasma TMZ clearance was \nindependent of age, renal function or tobacco use. In a separate pharmacokinetic study, plasma \npharmacokinetic profiles in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those \nobserved in patients with normal hepatic function. \n \nPaediatric patients had a higher AUC than adult patients; however, the maximum tolerated dose \n(MTD) was 1,000 mg/m2 per cycle both in children and in adults. \n \n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSingle-cycle (5-day dosing, 23 days non-treatment), 3- and 6-cycle toxicity studies were conducted in \nrats and dogs. The primary targets of toxicity included the bone marrow, lymphoreticular system, \ntestes, the gastrointestinal tract and, at higher doses, which were lethal to 60 % to 100 % of rats and \ndogs tested, degeneration of the retina occurred. Most of the toxicity showed evidence of reversibility, \nexcept for adverse events on the male reproductive system and retinal degeneration. However, because \nthe doses implicated in retinal degeneration were in the lethal dose range, and no comparable effect \nhas been observed in clinical studies, this finding was not considered to have clinical relevance. \n \nTMZ is an embryotoxic, teratogenic and genotoxic alkylating agent. TMZ is more toxic to the rat and \ndog than to humans, and the clinical dose approximates the minimum lethal dose in rats and dogs. \nDose-related reductions in leukocytes and platelets appear to be sensitive indicators of toxicity. A \nvariety of neoplasms, including mammary carcinomas, keratocanthoma of the skin and basal cell \nadenoma were observed in the 6-cycle rat study while no tumours or pre-neoplastic changes were \nevident in dog studies. Rats appear to be particularly sensitive to oncogenic effects of TMZ, with the \noccurrence of first tumours within 3 months of initiating dosing. This latency period is very short even \nfor an alkylating agent. \n \nResults of the Ames/salmonella and Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte (HPBL) chromosome \naberration tests showed a positive mutagenicity response. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n128 \n\n \n\nPackage Leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nTemozolomide SUN 5 mg hard capsules \ntemozolomide \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet  \n \n1. What Temozolomide SUN is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Temozolomide SUN \n3. How to take Temozolomide SUN \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Temozolomide SUN \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Temozolomide SUN is and what it is used for \n \nTemozolomide SUN contains a medicine called temozolomide. This medicine is an antitumour agent. \n \nTemozolomide SUN is used for the treatment of specific forms of brain tumours: \n- in adults with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. Temozolomide SUN is at first used \n\ntogether with radiotherapy (concomitant phase of treatment) and after that alone (monotherapy \nphase of treatment). \n\n- in children 3 years and older and adult patients with malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma \nmultiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma. Temozolomide SUN is used in these tumours if they \nreturn or get worse after standard treatment. \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Temozolomide SUN \n \nDo not take Temozolomide SUN \n \n- if you are allergic to temozolomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you have had an allergic reaction to dacarbazine (an anticancer medicine sometimes called \n DTIC). Signs of allergic reaction include itchiness, breathlessness or wheezing, or swelling of \n the face, lips, tongue or throat. \n- if the numbers of certain kinds of blood cells, such as your white blood cells or platelets are \n\nseverely reduced (known as myelosuppression). These blood cells are important for fighting \ninfection and for proper blood clotting. Your doctor will check your blood to make sure you \nhave enough of these cells before you begin treatment. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Temozolomide SUN, \n\n\n\n129 \n\n \n\n \n- as you should be observed closely for the development of a serious form of chest infection \n\ncalled Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). If you have been newly-diagnosed with \nglioblastoma multiforme you may be receiving Temozolomide SUN for 42 days in combination \nwith radiotherapy. In this case, your doctor will also prescribe medicine to help you prevent this \ntype of pneumonia (PCP). \n\n- if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Temozolomide \nSUN could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients \nwill be carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. \n\n- if you have low counts of red blood cells (anaemia), white blood cells and platelets, or blood \nclotting problems before starting the treatment, or if you develop them during treatment. Your \nblood will be tested frequently during treatment to monitor the side effects of Temozolomide \nSUN on your blood cells. Your doctor may decide to reduce the dose, interrupt, stop or change \nyour treatment. You may also need other treatments. In some cases, it may be necessary to stop \ntreatment with Temozolomide SUN.  \n\n- as you may have a small risk of other changes in blood cells, including leukaemia. \n- if you have nausea (feeling sick) and/or vomiting which are very common side effects of \n\nTemozolomide SUN (see section 4), your doctor may prescribe you a medicine (an anti-emetic) \nto help prevent vomiting. \nIf you vomit frequently before or during treatment, ask your doctor about the best time to take \nTemozolomide SUN until the vomiting is under control. If you vomit after taking your dose, do \nnot take a second dose on the same day. \n\n- if you develop fever or symptoms of an infection contact your doctor immediately. \n- if you are older than 70 years of age, you might be more prone to infection, bruising or \n\nbleeding. \n- if you have liver or kidney problems, your dose of Temozolomide SUN may need to be \n\nadjusted. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children under the age of 3 years because it has not been studied. There is \nlimited information in patients over 3 years of age who have taken Temozolomide SUN. \n \nOther medicines and Temozolomide SUN \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. This is because you must not be treated with \nTemozolomide SUN during pregnancy unless clearly indicated by your doctor. \n \nEffective contraceptive precautions must be taken by both male and female patients who are taking \nTemozolomide SUN (see also \u201cMale fertility\u201d below). \n \nYou should stop breast-feeding while receiving treatment with Temozolomide SUN. \n \nMale fertility \nTemozolomide SUN may cause permanent infertility. Male patients should use effective contraception \nand not father a child for up to 6 months after stopping treatment. It is recommended to seek advice on \nconservation of sperm prior to treatment. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTemozolomide SUN may make you feel tired or sleepy. In this case, do not drive or use any tools or \nmachines or cycle until you see how this medicine affects you (see section 4). \n \n\n\n\n130 \n\n \n\nTemozolomide SUN contains lactose \nTemozolomide SUN contains lactose (a kind of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you \nhave an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Temozolomide SUN \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nDosage and duration of treatment \n \nYour doctor will work out your dose of Temozolomide SUN. This is based on your size (height and \nweight) and whether you have a recurrent tumour and have had chemotherapy treatment in the past. \nYou may be given other medicines (anti-emetics) to take before and/or after taking Temozolomide \nSUN to prevent or control nausea and vomiting. \n \nPatients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nIf you are a newly-diagnosed patient, treatment will occur in two phases: \n- treatment together with radiotherapy (concomitant phase) first \n- followed by treatment with Temozolomide SUN only (monotherapy phase). \n \nDuring the concomitant phase, your doctor will start Temozolomide SUN at a dose of 75 mg/m2 (usual \ndose). You will take this dose every day for 42 to 49 days in combination with radiotherapy. The \nTemozolomide SUN dose may be delayed or stopped, depending on your blood counts and how you \ntolerate your medicine during the concomitant phase. \nOnce the radiotherapy is completed, you will have no treatment for 4 weeks. This will give your body \na chance to recover. \nThen, you will start the monotherapy phase. \n \nDuring the monotherapy phase, the dose and way you take Temozolomide SUN can vary. Your doctor \nwill work out your exact dose. There may be up to 6 treatment periods (cycles). Each one lasts 28 \ndays. The first dose will be 150 mg/m2. You will take your new dose of Temozolomide SUN once \ndaily for the first 5 days (\u201cdosing days\u201d) of each cycle. Then you will have 23 days without \nTemozolomide SUN. This adds up to a 28-day treatment cycle. \nAfter day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again take Temozolomide SUN once daily for 5 days \nfollowed by 23 days without Temozolomide SUN. The Temozolomide SUN dose may be adjusted, \ndelayed or stopped depending on your blood counts and how you tolerate your medicine during each \ntreatment cycle. \n \nPatients with tumours that have returned or worsened (malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma \nmultiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma) taking Temozolomide SUN only \n \nA treatment cycle with Temozolomide SUN lasts 28 days. \nYou will take Temozolomide SUN only once daily for the first 5 days. This daily dose depends on \nwhether or not you have received chemotherapy before. \n \nIf you have not been previously treated with chemotherapy, your first dose of Temozolomide SUN \nwill be 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days. If you have been previously treated with \nchemotherapy, your first dose of Temozolomide SUN will be 150 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 \ndays. Then, you will have 23 days without Temozolomide SUN. This adds up to a 28-day treatment \ncycle. \n \n\n\n\n131 \n\n \n\nAfter day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again receive Temozolomide SUN once daily for 5 \ndays, followed by 23 days without Temozolomide SUN. \n \nBefore each new treatment cycle, your blood will be tested to see if the Temozolomide SUN dose \nneeds to be adjusted. Depending on your blood test results, your doctor may adjust your dose for the \nnext cycle. \n \nHow to take Temozolomide SUN \n \nTake your prescribed dose of Temozolomide SUN once a day, preferably at the same time each day. \n \nTake the capsules on an empty stomach; for example, at least one hour before you plan to eat \nbreakfast. Swallow the capsule(s) whole with a glass of water. Do not open, crush or chew the \ncapsules. If a capsule is damaged, avoid contact of the powder with your skin, eyes or nose. If you \naccidentally get some in your eyes or nose, flush the area with water.  \n \n\n \n \nDepending on the prescribed dose, you may have to take more than one capsule at the same time. You \nmay have to take different strengths to make up the dose. The marking on the capsule is different for \neach strength (see table below). \n \n\nStrength Imprint \nTemozolomide SUN 5 mg hard capsules 890 & 5 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 20 mg hard capsules 891 & 20 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 100 mg hard capsules 892 & 100 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 140 mg hard capsules 929 & 140 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 180 mg hard capsules 930 & 180 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 250 mg hard capsules 893 & 250 mg \n \nYou should make sure you fully understand and remember the following: \n- the number of capsules you need to take every dosing day. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to \n\nwrite it down (including the marking) \n- which days are your dosing days. \nReview the dose with your doctor each time you start a new cycle, since it may be different from the \nlast cycle. \n\n\n\n132 \n\n \n\n \nAlways take Temozolomide SUN exactly as your doctor has told you. It is very important to check \nwith your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. Making a mistake in how you take this medicine \nmay have serious health consequences. \n \nIf you take more Temozolomide SUN than you should \nIf you accidentally take more Temozolomide SUN capsules than you were told to, contact your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take Temozolomide SUN \nTake the missed dose as soon as possible during the same day. If a full day has gone by, check with \nyour doctor. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, unless your doctor tells you to \ndo so. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nContact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following: \n- a severe allergic (hypersensitive) reaction (hives, wheezing or other breathing difficulty) \n- uncontrolled bleeding \n- seizures (convulsions) \n- fever \n- chills \n- severe headache that does not go away. \n \nTemozolomide SUN treatment can cause a reduction in certain kinds of blood cells. This may cause \nyou to have increased bruising or bleeding, anaemia (a shortage of red blood cells), fever, and reduced \nresistance to infections. The reduction in blood cell counts is usually short-lived. In some cases, it may \nbe prolonged and may lead to a very severe form of anaemia (aplastic anaemia). Your doctor will \nmonitor your blood regularly for any changes, and will decide if any specific treatment is needed. In \nsome cases, your Temozolomide SUN dose will be reduced or treatment stopped. \n \nSide effects from clinical studies \n \nTemozolomide SUN in combination treatment with radiotherapy in newly-diagnosed glioblastoma \n \nPatients receiving Temozolomide SUN in combination with radiotherapy may experience different \nside effects from patients taking Temozolomide SUN alone.

What you need to know before you take Temozolomide SUN \n3. How to take Temozolomide SUN \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Temozolomide SUN \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Temozolomide SUN is and what it is used for \n \nTemozolomide SUN contains a medicine called temozolomide. This medicine is an antitumour agent. \n \nTemozolomide SUN is used for the treatment of specific forms of brain tumours: \n- in adults with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. Temozolomide SUN is at first used \n\ntogether with radiotherapy (concomitant phase of treatment) and after that alone (monotherapy \nphase of treatment). \n\n- in children 3 years and older and adult patients with malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma \nmultiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma. Temozolomide SUN is used in these tumours if they \nreturn or get worse after standard treatment. \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Temozolomide SUN \n \nDo not take Temozolomide SUN \n \n- if you are allergic to temozolomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you have had an allergic reaction to dacarbazine (an anticancer medicine sometimes called \n DTIC). Signs of allergic reaction include itchiness, breathlessness or wheezing, or swelling of \n the face, lips, tongue or throat. \n- if the numbers of certain kinds of blood cells, such as your white blood cells or platelets are \n\nseverely reduced (known as myelosuppression). These blood cells are important for fighting \ninfection and for proper blood clotting. Your doctor will check your blood to make sure you \nhave enough of these cells before you begin treatment. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Temozolomide SUN, \n\n\n\n138 \n\n \n\n \n- as you should be observed closely for the development of a serious form of chest infection \n\ncalled Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). If you have been newly-diagnosed with \nglioblastoma multiforme you may be receiving Temozolomide SUN for 42 days in combination \nwith radiotherapy. In this case, your doctor will also prescribe medicine to help you prevent this \ntype of pneumonia (PCP). \n\n- if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Temozolomide \nSUN could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients \nwill be carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. \n\n- if you have low counts of red blood cells (anaemia), white blood cells and platelets, or blood \nclotting problems before starting the treatment, or if you develop them during treatment. Your \nblood will be tested frequently during treatment to monitor the side effects of Temozolomide \nSUN on your blood cells. Your doctor may decide to reduce the dose, interrupt, stop or change \nyour treatment. You may also need other treatments. In some cases, it may be necessary to stop \ntreatment with Temozolomide SUN.  \n\n- as you may have a small risk of other changes in blood cells, including leukaemia. \n- if you have nausea (feeling sick) and/or vomiting which are very common side effects of \n\nTemozolomide SUN (see section 4), your doctor may prescribe you a medicine (an anti-emetic) \nto help prevent vomiting. \nIf you vomit frequently before or during treatment, ask your doctor about the best time to take \nTemozolomide SUN until the vomiting is under control. If you vomit after taking your dose, do \nnot take a second dose on the same day. \n\n- if you develop fever or symptoms of an infection contact your doctor immediately. \n- if you are older than 70 years of age, you might be more prone to infection, bruising or \n\nbleeding. \n- if you have liver or kidney problems, your dose of Temozolomide SUN may need to be \n\nadjusted. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children under the age of 3 years because it has not been studied. There is \nlimited information in patients over 3 years of age who have taken Temozolomide SUN. \n \nOther medicines and Temozolomide SUN \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. This is because you must not be treated with \nTemozolomide SUN during pregnancy unless clearly indicated by your doctor. \n \nEffective contraceptive precautions must be taken by both male and female patients who are taking \nTemozolomide SUN (see also \u201cMale fertility\u201d below). \nYou should stop breast-feeding while receiving treatment with Temozolomide SUN. \n \nMale fertility \nTemozolomide SUN may cause permanent infertility. Male patients should use effective contraception \nand not father a child for up to 6 months after stopping treatment. It is recommended to seek advice on \nconservation of sperm prior to treatment. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTemozolomide SUN may make you feel tired or sleepy. In this case, do not drive or use any tools or \nmachines or cycle until you see how this medicine affects you (see section 4). \n \n\n\n\n139 \n\n \n\nTemozolomide SUN contains lactose \nTemozolomide SUN contains lactose (a kind of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you \nhave an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Temozolomide SUN \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nDosage and duration of treatment \n \nYour doctor will work out your dose of Temozolomide SUN. This is based on your size (height and \nweight) and whether you have a recurrent tumour and have had chemotherapy treatment in the past. \nYou may be given other medicines (anti-emetics) to take before and/or after taking Temozolomide \nSUN to prevent or control nausea and vomiting. \n \nPatients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nIf you are a newly-diagnosed patient, treatment will occur in two phases: \n- treatment together with radiotherapy (concomitant phase) first \n- followed by treatment with Temozolomide SUN only (monotherapy phase). \n \nDuring the concomitant phase, your doctor will start Temozolomide SUN at a dose of 75 mg/m2 (usual \ndose). You will take this dose every day for 42 to 49 days in combination with radiotherapy. The \nTemozolomide SUN dose may be delayed or stopped, depending on your blood counts and how you \ntolerate your medicine during the concomitant phase. \nOnce the radiotherapy is completed, you will have no treatment for 4 weeks. This will give your body \na chance to recover. \nThen, you will start the monotherapy phase. \n \nDuring the monotherapy phase, the dose and way you take Temozolomide SUN can vary. Your doctor \nwill work out your exact dose. There may be up to 6 treatment periods (cycles). Each one lasts 28 \ndays. The first dose will be 150 mg/m2. You will take your new dose of Temozolomide SUN once \ndaily for the first 5 days (\u201cdosing days\u201d) of each cycle. Then you will have 23 days without \nTemozolomide SUN. This adds up to a 28-day treatment cycle. \nAfter day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again take Temozolomide SUN once daily for 5 days \nfollowed by 23 days without Temozolomide SUN. The Temozolomide SUN dose may be adjusted, \ndelayed or stopped depending on your blood counts and how you tolerate your medicine during each \ntreatment cycle. \n \nPatients with tumours that have returned or worsened (malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma \nmultiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma) taking Temozolomide SUN only \n \nA treatment cycle with Temozolomide SUN lasts 28 days. \nYou will take Temozolomide SUN only once daily for the first 5 days. This daily dose depends on \nwhether or not you have received chemotherapy before. \n \nIf you have not been previously treated with chemotherapy, your first dose of Temozolomide SUN \nwill be 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days. If you have been previously treated with \nchemotherapy, your first dose of Temozolomide SUN will be 150 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 \ndays. Then, you will have 23 days without Temozolomide SUN. This adds up to a 28-day treatment \ncycle. \n \n\n\n\n140 \n\n \n\nAfter day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again receive Temozolomide SUN once daily for 5 \ndays, followed by 23 days without Temozolomide SUN. \n \nBefore each new treatment cycle, your blood will be tested to see if the Temozolomide SUN dose \nneeds to be adjusted. Depending on your blood test results, your doctor may adjust your dose for the \nnext cycle. \n \nHow to take Temozolomide SUN \n \nTake your prescribed dose of Temozolomide SUN once a day, preferably at the same time each day. \n \nTake the capsules on an empty stomach; for example, at least one hour before you plan to eat \nbreakfast. Swallow the capsule(s) whole with a glass of water. Do not open, crush or chew the \ncapsules. If a capsule is damaged, avoid contact of the powder with your skin, eyes or nose. If you \naccidentally get some in your eyes or nose, flush the area with water.  \n \n\n \n \n \nDepending on the prescribed dose, you may have to take more than one capsule at the same time. You \nmay have to take different strengths to make up the dose. The marking on the capsule is different for \neach strength (see table below). \n \n\nStrength Imprint \nTemozolomide SUN 5 mg hard capsules 890 & 5 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 20 mg hard capsules 891 & 20 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 100 mg hard capsules 892 & 100 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 140 mg hard capsules 929 & 140 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 180 mg hard capsules 930 & 180 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 250 mg hard capsules 893 & 250 mg \n \nYou should make sure you fully understand and remember the following: \n- the number of capsules you need to take every dosing day. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to \n\nwrite it down (including the marking) \n- which days are your dosing days. \n\n\n\n141 \n\n \n\nReview the dose with your doctor each time you start a new cycle, since it may be different from the \nlast cycle. \n \nAlways take Temozolomide SUN exactly as your doctor has told you. It is very important to check \nwith your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. Making a mistake in how you take this medicine \nmay have serious health consequences. \n \nIf you take more Temozolomide SUN than you should \nIf you accidentally take more Temozolomide SUN capsules than you were told to, contact your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take Temozolomide SUN \nTake the missed dose as soon as possible during the same day. If a full day has gone by, check with \nyour doctor. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, unless your doctor tells you to \ndo so. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nContact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following: \n- a severe allergic (hypersensitive) reaction (hives, wheezing or other breathing difficulty) \n- uncontrolled bleeding \n- seizures (convulsions) \n- fever \n- chills \n- severe headache that does not go away. \n \nTemozolomide SUN treatment can cause a reduction in certain kinds of blood cells. This may cause \nyou to have increased bruising or bleeding, anaemia (a shortage of red blood cells), fever, and reduced \nresistance to infections. The reduction in blood cell counts is usually short-lived. In some cases, it may \nbe prolonged and may lead to a very severe form of anaemia (aplastic anaemia). Your doctor will \nmonitor your blood regularly for any changes, and will decide if any specific treatment is needed. In \nsome cases, your Temozolomide SUN dose will be reduced or treatment stopped. \n \nSide effects from clinical studies \n \nTemozolomide SUN in combination treatment with radiotherapy in newly-diagnosed glioblastoma \n \nPatients receiving Temozolomide SUN in combination with radiotherapy may experience different \nside effects from patients taking Temozolomide SUN alone.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Temozolomide SUN is and what it is used for \n \nTemozolomide SUN contains a medicine called temozolomide. This medicine is an antitumour agent. \n \nTemozolomide SUN is used for the treatment of specific forms of brain tumours: \n- in adults with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. Temozolomide SUN is at first used \n\ntogether with radiotherapy (concomitant phase of treatment) and after that alone (monotherapy \nphase of treatment). \n\n- in children 3 years and older and adult patients with malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma \nmultiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma. Temozolomide SUN is used in these tumours if they \nreturn or get worse after standard treatment. \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Temozolomide SUN \n \nDo not take Temozolomide SUN \n \n- if you are allergic to temozolomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you have had an allergic reaction to dacarbazine (an anticancer medicine sometimes called \n DTIC). Signs of allergic reaction include itchiness, breathlessness or wheezing, or swelling of \n the face, lips, tongue or throat. \n- if the numbers of certain kinds of blood cells, such as your white blood cells or platelets are \n\nseverely reduced (known as myelosuppression). These blood cells are important for fighting \ninfection and for proper blood clotting. Your doctor will check your blood to make sure you \nhave enough of these cells before you begin treatment. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Temozolomide SUN, \n\n\n\n147 \n\n \n\n \n- as you should be observed closely for the development of a serious form of chest infection \n\ncalled Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). If you have been newly-diagnosed with \nglioblastoma multiforme you may be receiving Temozolomide SUN for 42 days in combination \nwith radiotherapy. In this case, your doctor will also prescribe medicine to help you prevent this \ntype of pneumonia (PCP). \n\n- if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Temozolomide \nSUN could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients \nwill be carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. \n\n- if you have low counts of red blood cells (anaemia), white blood cells and platelets, or blood \nclotting problems before starting the treatment, or if you develop them during treatment. Your \nblood will be tested frequently during treatment to monitor the side effects of Temozolomide \nSUN on your blood cells. Your doctor may decide to reduce the dose, interrupt, stop or change \nyour treatment. You may also need other treatments. In some cases, it may be necessary to stop \ntreatment with Temozolomide SUN.  \n\n- as you may have a small risk of other changes in blood cells, including leukaemia. \n- if you have nausea (feeling sick) and/or vomiting which are very common side effects of \n\nTemozolomide SUN (see section 4), your doctor may prescribe you a medicine (an anti-emetic) \nto help prevent vomiting. \nIf you vomit frequently before or during treatment, ask your doctor about the best time to take \nTemozolomide SUN until the vomiting is under control. If you vomit after taking your dose, do \nnot take a second dose on the same day. \n\n- if you develop fever or symptoms of an infection contact your doctor immediately. \n- if you are older than 70 years of age, you might be more prone to infection, bruising or \n\nbleeding. \n- if you have liver or kidney problems, your dose of Temozolomide SUN may need to be \n\nadjusted. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children under the age of 3 years because it has not been studied. There is \nlimited information in patients over 3 years of age who have taken Temozolomide SUN. \n \nOther medicines and Temozolomide SUN \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. This is because you must not be treated with \nTemozolomide SUN during pregnancy unless clearly indicated by your doctor. \n \nEffective contraceptive precautions must be taken by both male and female patients who are taking \nTemozolomide SUN (see also \u201cMale fertility\u201d below). \nYou should stop breast-feeding while receiving treatment with Temozolomide SUN. \n \nMale fertility \nTemozolomide SUN may cause permanent infertility. Male patients should use effective contraception \nand not father a child for up to 6 months after stopping treatment. It is recommended to seek advice on \nconservation of sperm prior to treatment. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTemozolomide SUN may make you feel tired or sleepy. In this case, do not drive or use any tools or \nmachines or cycle until you see how this medicine affects you (see section 4). \n \n\n\n\n148 \n\n \n\nTemozolomide SUN contains lactose \nTemozolomide SUN contains lactose (a kind of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you \nhave an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Temozolomide SUN \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nDosage and duration of treatment \n \nYour doctor will work out your dose of Temozolomide SUN. This is based on your size (height and \nweight) and whether you have a recurrent tumour and have had chemotherapy treatment in the past. \nYou may be given other medicines (anti-emetics) to take before and/or after taking Temozolomide \nSUN to prevent or control nausea and vomiting. \n \nPatients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nIf you are a newly-diagnosed patient, treatment will occur in two phases: \n- treatment together with radiotherapy (concomitant phase) first \n- followed by treatment with Temozolomide SUN only (monotherapy phase). \n \nDuring the concomitant phase, your doctor will start Temozolomide SUN at a dose of 75 mg/m2 (usual \ndose). You will take this dose every day for 42 to 49 days in combination with radiotherapy. The \nTemozolomide SUN dose may be delayed or stopped, depending on your blood counts and how you \ntolerate your medicine during the concomitant phase. \nOnce the radiotherapy is completed, you will have no treatment for 4 weeks. This will give your body \na chance to recover. \nThen, you will start the monotherapy phase. \n \nDuring the monotherapy phase, the dose and way you take Temozolomide SUN can vary. Your doctor \nwill work out your exact dose. There may be up to 6 treatment periods (cycles). Each one lasts 28 \ndays. The first dose will be 150 mg/m2. You will take your new dose of Temozolomide SUN once \ndaily for the first 5 days (\u201cdosing days\u201d) of each cycle. Then you will have 23 days without \nTemozolomide SUN. This adds up to a 28-day treatment cycle. \nAfter day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again take Temozolomide SUN once daily for 5 days \nfollowed by 23 days without Temozolomide SUN. The Temozolomide SUN dose may be adjusted, \ndelayed or stopped depending on your blood counts and how you tolerate your medicine during each \ntreatment cycle. \n \nPatients with tumours that have returned or worsened (malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma \nmultiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma) taking Temozolomide SUN only \n \nA treatment cycle with Temozolomide SUN lasts 28 days. \nYou will take Temozolomide SUN only once daily for the first 5 days. This daily dose depends on \nwhether or not you have received chemotherapy before. \n \nIf you have not been previously treated with chemotherapy, your first dose of Temozolomide SUN \nwill be 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days. If you have been previously treated with \nchemotherapy, your first dose of Temozolomide SUN will be 150 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 \ndays. Then, you will have 23 days without Temozolomide SUN. This adds up to a 28-day treatment \ncycle. \n \n\n\n\n149 \n\n \n\nAfter day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again receive Temozolomide SUN once daily for 5 \ndays, followed by 23 days without Temozolomide SUN. \n \nBefore each new treatment cycle, your blood will be tested to see if the Temozolomide SUN dose \nneeds to be adjusted. Depending on your blood test results, your doctor may adjust your dose for the \nnext cycle. \n \nHow to take Temozolomide SUN \n \nTake your prescribed dose of Temozolomide SUN once a day, preferably at the same time each day. \n \nTake the capsules on an empty stomach; for example, at least one hour before you plan to eat \nbreakfast. Swallow the capsule(s) whole with a glass of water. Do not open, crush or chew the \ncapsules. If a capsule is damaged, avoid contact of the powder with your skin, eyes or nose. If you \naccidentally get some in your eyes or nose, flush the area with water.  \n \n\n \n \n \nDepending on the prescribed dose, you may have to take more than one capsule at the same time. You \nmay have to take different strengths to make up the dose. The marking on the capsule is different for \neach strength (see table below). \n \n\nStrength Imprint \nTemozolomide SUN 5 mg hard capsules 890 & 5 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 20 mg hard capsules 891 & 20 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 100 mg hard capsules 892 & 100 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 140 mg hard capsules 929 & 140 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 180 mg hard capsules 930 & 180 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 250 mg hard capsules 893 & 250 mg \n \nYou should make sure you fully understand and remember the following: \n- the number of capsules you need to take every dosing day. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to \n\nwrite it down (including the marking) \n- which days are your dosing days. \n\n\n\n150 \n\n \n\nReview the dose with your doctor each time you start a new cycle, since it may be different from the \nlast cycle. \n \nAlways take Temozolomide SUN exactly as your doctor has told you. It is very important to check \nwith your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. Making a mistake in how you take this medicine \nmay have serious health consequences. \n \nIf you take more Temozolomide SUN than you should \nIf you accidentally take more Temozolomide SUN capsules than you were told to, contact your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take Temozolomide SUN \nTake the missed dose as soon as possible during the same day. If a full day has gone by, check with \nyour doctor. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, unless your doctor tells you to \ndo so. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nContact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following: \n- a severe allergic (hypersensitive) reaction (hives, wheezing or other breathing difficulty) \n- uncontrolled bleeding \n- seizures (convulsions) \n- fever \n- chills \n- severe headache that does not go away. \n \nTemozolomide SUN treatment can cause a reduction in certain kinds of blood cells. This may cause \nyou to have increased bruising or bleeding, anaemia (a shortage of red blood cells), fever, and reduced \nresistance to infections. The reduction in blood cell counts is usually short-lived. In some cases, it may \nbe prolonged and may lead to a very severe form of anaemia (aplastic anaemia). Your doctor will \nmonitor your blood regularly for any changes, and will decide if any specific treatment is needed. In \nsome cases, your Temozolomide SUN dose will be reduced or treatment stopped. \n \nSide effects from clinical studies \n \nTemozolomide SUN in combination treatment with radiotherapy in newly-diagnosed glioblastoma \n \nPatients receiving Temozolomide SUN in combination with radiotherapy may experience different \nside effects from patients taking Temozolomide SUN alone.

This medicine is an antitumour agent. \n \nTemozolomide SUN is used for the treatment of specific forms of brain tumours: \n- in adults with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. Temozolomide SUN is at first used \n\ntogether with radiotherapy (concomitant phase of treatment) and after that alone (monotherapy \nphase of treatment). \n\n- in children 3 years and older and adult patients with malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma \nmultiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma. Temozolomide SUN is used in these tumours if they \nreturn or get worse after standard treatment. \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Temozolomide SUN \n \nDo not take Temozolomide SUN \n \n- if you are allergic to temozolomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you have had an allergic reaction to dacarbazine (an anticancer medicine sometimes called \n DTIC). Signs of allergic reaction include itchiness, breathlessness or wheezing, or swelling of \n the face, lips, tongue or throat. \n- if the numbers of certain kinds of blood cells, such as your white blood cells or platelets are \n\nseverely reduced (known as myelosuppression). These blood cells are important for fighting \ninfection and for proper blood clotting. Your doctor will check your blood to make sure you \nhave enough of these cells before you begin treatment. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Temozolomide SUN, \n\n\n\n156 \n\n \n\n \n- as you should be observed closely for the development of a serious form of chest infection \n\ncalled Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). If you have been newly-diagnosed with \nglioblastoma multiforme you may be receiving Temozolomide SUN for 42 days in combination \nwith radiotherapy. In this case, your doctor will also prescribe medicine to help you prevent this \ntype of pneumonia (PCP). \n\n- if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Temozolomide \nSUN could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients \nwill be carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. \n\n- if you have low counts of red blood cells (anaemia), white blood cells and platelets, or blood \nclotting problems before starting the treatment, or if you develop them during treatment. Your \nblood will be tested frequently during treatment to monitor the side effects of Temozolomide \nSUN on your blood cells. Your doctor may decide to reduce the dose, interrupt, stop or change \nyour treatment. You may also need other treatments. In some cases, it may be necessary to stop \ntreatment with Temozolomide SUN.  \n\n- as you may have a small risk of other changes in blood cells, including leukaemia. \n- if you have nausea (feeling sick) and/or vomiting which are very common side effects of \n\nTemozolomide SUN (see section 4), your doctor may prescribe you a medicine (an anti-emetic) \nto help prevent vomiting. \nIf you vomit frequently before or during treatment, ask your doctor about the best time to take \nTemozolomide SUN until the vomiting is under control. If you vomit after taking your dose, do \nnot take a second dose on the same day. \n\n- if you develop fever or symptoms of an infection contact your doctor immediately. \n- if you are older than 70 years of age, you might be more prone to infection, bruising or \n\nbleeding. \n- if you have liver or kidney problems, your dose of Temozolomide SUN may need to be \n\nadjusted. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children under the age of 3 years because it has not been studied. There is \nlimited information in patients over 3 years of age who have taken Temozolomide SUN. \n \nOther medicines and Temozolomide SUN \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. This is because you must not be treated with \nTemozolomide SUN during pregnancy unless clearly indicated by your doctor. \n \nEffective contraceptive precautions must be taken by both male and female patients who are taking \nTemozolomide SUN (see also \u201cMale fertility\u201d below). \nYou should stop breast-feeding while receiving treatment with Temozolomide SUN. \n \nMale fertility \nTemozolomide SUN may cause permanent infertility. Male patients should use effective contraception \nand not father a child for up to 6 months after stopping treatment. It is recommended to seek advice on \nconservation of sperm prior to treatment. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTemozolomide SUN may make you feel tired or sleepy. In this case, do not drive or use any tools or \nmachines or cycle until you see how this medicine affects you (see section 4). \n \n\n\n\n157 \n\n \n\nTemozolomide SUN contains lactose \nTemozolomide SUN contains lactose (a kind of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you \nhave an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Temozolomide SUN \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nDosage and duration of treatment \n \nYour doctor will work out your dose of Temozolomide SUN. This is based on your size (height and \nweight) and whether you have a recurrent tumour and have had chemotherapy treatment in the past. \nYou may be given other medicines (anti-emetics) to take before and/or after taking Temozolomide \nSUN to prevent or control nausea and vomiting. \n \nPatients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nIf you are a newly-diagnosed patient, treatment will occur in two phases: \n- treatment together with radiotherapy (concomitant phase) first \n- followed by treatment with Temozolomide SUN only (monotherapy phase). \n \nDuring the concomitant phase, your doctor will start Temozolomide SUN at a dose of 75 mg/m2 (usual \ndose). You will take this dose every day for 42 to 49 days in combination with radiotherapy. The \nTemozolomide SUN dose may be delayed or stopped, depending on your blood counts and how you \ntolerate your medicine during the concomitant phase. \nOnce the radiotherapy is completed, you will have no treatment for 4 weeks. This will give your body \na chance to recover. \nThen, you will start the monotherapy phase. \n \nDuring the monotherapy phase, the dose and way you take Temozolomide SUN can vary. Your doctor \nwill work out your exact dose. There may be up to 6 treatment periods (cycles). Each one lasts 28 \ndays. The first dose will be 150 mg/m2. You will take your new dose of Temozolomide SUN once \ndaily for the first 5 days (\u201cdosing days\u201d) of each cycle. Then you will have 23 days without \nTemozolomide SUN. This adds up to a 28-day treatment cycle. \nAfter day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again take Temozolomide SUN once daily for 5 days \nfollowed by 23 days without Temozolomide SUN. The Temozolomide SUN dose may be adjusted, \ndelayed or stopped depending on your blood counts and how you tolerate your medicine during each \ntreatment cycle. \n \nPatients with tumours that have returned or worsened (malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma \nmultiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma) taking Temozolomide SUN only \n \nA treatment cycle with Temozolomide SUN lasts 28 days. \nYou will take Temozolomide SUN only once daily for the first 5 days. This daily dose depends on \nwhether or not you have received chemotherapy before. \n \nIf you have not been previously treated with chemotherapy, your first dose of Temozolomide SUN \nwill be 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days. If you have been previously treated with \nchemotherapy, your first dose of Temozolomide SUN will be 150 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 \ndays. Then, you will have 23 days without Temozolomide SUN. This adds up to a 28-day treatment \ncycle. \n \n\n\n\n158 \n\n \n\nAfter day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again receive Temozolomide SUN once daily for 5 \ndays, followed by 23 days without Temozolomide SUN. \n \nBefore each new treatment cycle, your blood will be tested to see if the Temozolomide SUN dose \nneeds to be adjusted. Depending on your blood test results, your doctor may adjust your dose for the \nnext cycle. \n \nHow to take Temozolomide SUN \n \nTake your prescribed dose of Temozolomide SUN once a day, preferably at the same time each day. \n \nTake the capsules on an empty stomach; for example, at least one hour before you plan to eat \nbreakfast. Swallow the capsule(s) whole with a glass of water. Do not open, crush or chew the \ncapsules. If a capsule is damaged, avoid contact of the powder with your skin, eyes or nose. If you \naccidentally get some in your eyes or nose, flush the area with water.  \n \n\n \n \n \nDepending on the prescribed dose, you may have to take more than one capsule at the same time. You \nmay have to take different strengths to make up the dose. The marking on the capsule is different for \neach strength (see table below). \n \n\nStrength Imprint \nTemozolomide SUN 5 mg hard capsules 890 & 5 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 20 mg hard capsules 891 & 20 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 100 mg hard capsules 892 & 100 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 140 mg hard capsules 929 & 140 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 180 mg hard capsules 930 & 180 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 250 mg hard capsules 893 & 250 mg \n \nYou should make sure you fully understand and remember the following: \n- the number of capsules you need to take every dosing day. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to \n\nwrite it down (including the marking) \n- which days are your dosing days. \n\n\n\n159 \n\n \n\nReview the dose with your doctor each time you start a new cycle, since it may be different from the \nlast cycle. \n \nAlways take Temozolomide SUN exactly as your doctor has told you. It is very important to check \nwith your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. Making a mistake in how you take this medicine \nmay have serious health consequences. \n \nIf you take more Temozolomide SUN than you should \nIf you accidentally take more Temozolomide SUN capsules than you were told to, contact your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take Temozolomide SUN \nTake the missed dose as soon as possible during the same day. If a full day has gone by, check with \nyour doctor. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, unless your doctor tells you to \ndo so. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nContact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following: \n- a severe allergic (hypersensitive) reaction (hives, wheezing or other breathing difficulty) \n- uncontrolled bleeding \n- seizures (convulsions) \n- fever \n- chills \n- severe headache that does not go away. \n \nTemozolomide SUN treatment can cause a reduction in certain kinds of blood cells. This may cause \nyou to have increased bruising or bleeding, anaemia (a shortage of red blood cells), fever, and reduced \nresistance to infections. The reduction in blood cell counts is usually short-lived. In some cases, it may \nbe prolonged and may lead to a very severe form of anaemia (aplastic anaemia). Your doctor will \nmonitor your blood regularly for any changes, and will decide if any specific treatment is needed. In \nsome cases, your Temozolomide SUN dose will be reduced or treatment stopped. \n \nSide effects from clinical studies \n \nTemozolomide SUN in combination treatment with radiotherapy in newly-diagnosed glioblastoma \n \nPatients receiving Temozolomide SUN in combination with radiotherapy may experience different \nside effects from patients taking Temozolomide SUN alone.

Temozolomide SUN is used in these tumours if they \nreturn or get worse after standard treatment. \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Temozolomide SUN \n \nDo not take Temozolomide SUN \n \n- if you are allergic to temozolomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you have had an allergic reaction to dacarbazine (an anticancer medicine sometimes called \n DTIC). Signs of allergic reaction include itchiness, breathlessness or wheezing, or swelling of \n the face, lips, tongue or throat. \n- if the numbers of certain kinds of blood cells, such as your white blood cells or platelets are \n\nseverely reduced (known as myelosuppression).

Patients \nwill be carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. \n\n- if you have low counts of red blood cells (anaemia), white blood cells and platelets, or blood \nclotting problems before starting the treatment, or if you develop them during treatment. Your \nblood will be tested frequently during treatment to monitor the side effects of Temozolomide \nSUN on your blood cells. Your doctor may decide to reduce the dose, interrupt, stop or change \nyour treatment. You may also need other treatments. In some cases, it may be necessary to stop \ntreatment with Temozolomide SUN.  \n\n- as you may have a small risk of other changes in blood cells, including leukaemia. \n- if you have nausea (feeling sick) and/or vomiting which are very common side effects of \n\nTemozolomide SUN (see section 4), your doctor may prescribe you a medicine (an anti-emetic) \nto help prevent vomiting. \nIf you vomit frequently before or during treatment, ask your doctor about the best time to take \nTemozolomide SUN until the vomiting is under control. If you vomit after taking your dose, do \nnot take a second dose on the same day. \n\n- if you develop fever or symptoms of an infection contact your doctor immediately. \n- if you are older than 70 years of age, you might be more prone to infection, bruising or \n\nbleeding. \n- if you have liver or kidney problems, your dose of Temozolomide SUN may need to be \n\nadjusted. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children under the age of 3 years because it has not been studied. There is \nlimited information in patients over 3 years of age who have taken Temozolomide SUN. \n \nOther medicines and Temozolomide SUN \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. This is because you must not be treated with \nTemozolomide SUN during pregnancy unless clearly indicated by your doctor. \n \nEffective contraceptive precautions must be taken by both male and female patients who are taking \nTemozolomide SUN (see also \u201cMale fertility\u201d below). \nYou should stop breast-feeding while receiving treatment with Temozolomide SUN. \n \nMale fertility \nTemozolomide SUN may cause permanent infertility. Male patients should use effective contraception \nand not father a child for up to 6 months after stopping treatment. It is recommended to seek advice on \nconservation of sperm prior to treatment. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTemozolomide SUN may make you feel tired or sleepy. In this case, do not drive or use any tools or \nmachines or cycle until you see how this medicine affects you (see section 4). \n \n\n\n\n166 \n\n \n\nTemozolomide SUN contains lactose \nTemozolomide SUN contains lactose (a kind of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you \nhave an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Temozolomide SUN \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nDosage and duration of treatment \n \nYour doctor will work out your dose of Temozolomide SUN. This is based on your size (height and \nweight) and whether you have a recurrent tumour and have had chemotherapy treatment in the past. \nYou may be given other medicines (anti-emetics) to take before and/or after taking Temozolomide \nSUN to prevent or control nausea and vomiting. \n \nPatients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nIf you are a newly-diagnosed patient, treatment will occur in two phases: \n- treatment together with radiotherapy (concomitant phase) first \n- followed by treatment with Temozolomide SUN only (monotherapy phase). \n \nDuring the concomitant phase, your doctor will start Temozolomide SUN at a dose of 75 mg/m2 (usual \ndose). You will take this dose every day for 42 to 49 days in combination with radiotherapy. The \nTemozolomide SUN dose may be delayed or stopped, depending on your blood counts and how you \ntolerate your medicine during the concomitant phase. \nOnce the radiotherapy is completed, you will have no treatment for 4 weeks. This will give your body \na chance to recover. \nThen, you will start the monotherapy phase. \n \nDuring the monotherapy phase, the dose and way you take Temozolomide SUN can vary. Your doctor \nwill work out your exact dose. There may be up to 6 treatment periods (cycles). Each one lasts 28 \ndays. The first dose will be 150 mg/m2. You will take your new dose of Temozolomide SUN once \ndaily for the first 5 days (\u201cdosing days\u201d) of each cycle. Then you will have 23 days without \nTemozolomide SUN. This adds up to a 28-day treatment cycle. \nAfter day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again take Temozolomide SUN once daily for 5 days \nfollowed by 23 days without Temozolomide SUN. The Temozolomide SUN dose may be adjusted, \ndelayed or stopped depending on your blood counts and how you tolerate your medicine during each \ntreatment cycle. \n \nPatients with tumours that have returned or worsened (malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma \nmultiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma) taking Temozolomide SUN only \n \nA treatment cycle with Temozolomide SUN lasts 28 days. \nYou will take Temozolomide SUN only once daily for the first 5 days. This daily dose depends on \nwhether or not you have received chemotherapy before. \n \nIf you have not been previously treated with chemotherapy, your first dose of Temozolomide SUN \nwill be 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days. If you have been previously treated with \nchemotherapy, your first dose of Temozolomide SUN will be 150 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 \ndays. Then, you will have 23 days without Temozolomide SUN. This adds up to a 28-day treatment \ncycle. \n \n\n\n\n167 \n\n \n\nAfter day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again receive Temozolomide SUN once daily for 5 \ndays, followed by 23 days without Temozolomide SUN. \n \nBefore each new treatment cycle, your blood will be tested to see if the Temozolomide SUN dose \nneeds to be adjusted. Depending on your blood test results, your doctor may adjust your dose for the \nnext cycle. \n \nHow to take Temozolomide SUN \n \nTake your prescribed dose of Temozolomide SUN once a day, preferably at the same time each day. \n \nTake the capsules on an empty stomach; for example, at least one hour before you plan to eat \nbreakfast. Swallow the capsule(s) whole with a glass of water. Do not open, crush or chew the \ncapsules. If a capsule is damaged, avoid contact of the powder with your skin, eyes or nose. If you \naccidentally get some in your eyes or nose, flush the area with water.  \n \n\n \n \n \nDepending on the prescribed dose, you may have to take more than one capsule at the same time. You \nmay have to take different strengths to make up the dose. The marking on the capsule is different for \neach strength (see table below). \n \n\nStrength Imprint \nTemozolomide SUN 5 mg hard capsules 890 & 5 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 20 mg hard capsules 891 & 20 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 100 mg hard capsules 892 & 100 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 140 mg hard capsules 929 & 140 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 180 mg hard capsules 930 & 180 mg \nTemozolomide SUN 250 mg hard capsules 893 & 250 mg \n \nYou should make sure you fully understand and remember the following: \n- the number of capsules you need to take every dosing day.

Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nContact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following: \n- a severe allergic (hypersensitive) reaction (hives, wheezing or other breathing difficulty) \n- uncontrolled bleeding \n- seizures (convulsions) \n- fever \n- chills \n- severe headache that does not go away. \n \nTemozolomide SUN treatment can cause a reduction in certain kinds of blood cells. This may cause \nyou to have increased bruising or bleeding, anaemia (a shortage of red blood cells), fever, and reduced \nresistance to infections. The reduction in blood cell counts is usually short-lived. In some cases, it may \nbe prolonged and may lead to a very severe form of anaemia (aplastic anaemia). Your doctor will \nmonitor your blood regularly for any changes, and will decide if any specific treatment is needed. In \nsome cases, your Temozolomide SUN dose will be reduced or treatment stopped. \n \nSide effects from clinical studies \n \nTemozolomide SUN in combination treatment with radiotherapy in newly-diagnosed glioblastoma \n \nPatients receiving Temozolomide SUN in combination with radiotherapy may experience different \nside effects from patients taking Temozolomide SUN alone.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Temozolomide SUN is and what it is used for \n \nTemozolomide SUN contains a medicine called temozolomide. This medicine is an antitumour agent. \n \nTemozolomide SUN is used for the treatment of specific forms of brain tumours: \n- in adults with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. Temozolomide SUN is at first used \n\ntogether with radiotherapy (concomitant phase of treatment) and after that alone (monotherapy \nphase of treatment). \n\n- in children 3 years and older and adult patients with malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma \nmultiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma. Temozolomide SUN is used in these tumours if they \nreturn or get worse after standard treatment. \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Temozolomide SUN \n \nDo not take Temozolomide SUN \n \n- if you are allergic to temozolomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you have had an allergic reaction to dacarbazine (an anticancer medicine sometimes called \n DTIC). Signs of allergic reaction include itchiness, breathlessness or wheezing, or swelling of \n the face, lips, tongue or throat. \n- if the numbers of certain kinds of blood cells, such as your white blood cells or platelets are \n\nseverely reduced (known as myelosuppression). These blood cells are important for fighting \ninfection and for proper blood clotting. Your doctor will check your blood to make sure you \nhave enough of these cells before you begin treatment. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Temozolomide SUN, \n\n\n\n174 \n\n \n\n \n- as you should be observed closely for the development of a serious form of chest infection \n\ncalled Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). If you have been newly-diagnosed with \nglioblastoma multiforme you may be receiving Temozolomide SUN for 42 days in combination \nwith radiotherapy. In this case, your doctor will also prescribe medicine to help you prevent this \ntype of pneumonia (PCP). \n\n- if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Temozolomide \nSUN could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients \nwill be carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. \n\n- if you have low counts of red blood cells (anaemia), white blood cells and platelets, or blood \nclotting problems before starting the treatment, or if you develop them during treatment. Your \nblood will be tested frequently during treatment to monitor the side effects of Temozolomide \nSUN on your blood cells. Your doctor may decide to reduce the dose, interrupt, stop or change \nyour treatment. You may also need other treatments. In some cases, it may be necessary to stop \ntreatment with Temozolomide SUN.  \n\n- as you may have a small risk of other changes in blood cells, including leukaemia. \n- if you have nausea (feeling sick) and/or vomiting which are very common side effects of \n\nTemozolomide SUN (see section 4), your doctor may prescribe you a medicine (an anti-emetic) \nto help prevent vomiting. \nIf you vomit frequently before or during treatment, ask your doctor about the best time to take \nTemozolomide SUN until the vomiting is under control. If you vomit after taking your dose, do \nnot take a second dose on the same day. \n\n- if you develop fever or symptoms of an infection contact your doctor immediately. \n- if you are older than 70 years of age, you might be more prone to infection, bruising or \n\nbleeding. \n- if you have liver or kidney problems, your dose of Temozolomide SUN may need to be \n\nadjusted. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children under the age of 3 years because it has not been studied. There is \nlimited information in patients over 3 years of age who have taken Temozolomide SUN. \n \nOther medicines and Temozolomide SUN \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. This is because you must not be treated with \nTemozolomide SUN during pregnancy unless clearly indicated by your doctor. \n \nEffective contraceptive precautions must be taken by both male and female patients who are taking \nTemozolomide SUN (see also \u201cMale fertility\u201d below). \nYou should stop breast-feeding while receiving treatment with Temozolomide SUN. \n \nMale fertility \nTemozolomide SUN may cause permanent infertility. Male patients should use effective contraception \nand not father a child for up to 6 months after stopping treatment. It is recommended to seek advice on \nconservation of sperm prior to treatment. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTemozolomide SUN may make you feel tired or sleepy. In this case, do not drive or use any tools or \nmachines or cycle until you see how this medicine affects you (see section 4). \n \n\n\n\n175 \n\n \n\nTemozolomide SUN contains lactose \nTemozolomide SUN contains lactose (a kind of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you \nhave an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Temozolomide SUN \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nDosage and duration of treatment \n \nYour doctor will work out your dose of Temozolomide SUN. This is based on your size (height and \nweight) and whether you have a recurrent tumour and have had chemotherapy treatment in the past. \nYou may be given other medicines (anti-emetics) to take before and/or after taking Temozolomide \nSUN to prevent or control nausea and vomiting. \n \nPatients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \n \nIf you are a newly-diagnosed patient, treatment will occur in two phases: \n- treatment together with radiotherapy (concomitant phase) first \n- followed by treatment with Temozolomide SUN only (monotherapy phase). \n \nDuring the concomitant phase, your doctor will start Temozolomide SUN at a dose of 75 mg/m2 (usual \ndose). You will take this dose every day for 42 to 49 days in combination with radiotherapy. The \nTemozolomide SUN dose may be delayed or stopped, depending on your blood counts and how you \ntolerate your medicine during the concomitant phase. \nOnce the radiotherapy is completed, you will have no treatment for 4 weeks. This will give your body \na chance to recover. \nThen, you will start the monotherapy phase. \n \nDuring the monotherapy phase, the dose and way you take Temozolomide SUN can vary. Your doctor \nwill work out your exact dose. There may be up to 6 treatment periods (cycles). Each one lasts 28 \ndays. The first dose will be 150 mg/m2. You will take your new dose of Temozolomide SUN once \ndaily for the first 5 days (\u201cdosing days\u201d) of each cycle. Then you will have 23 days without \nTemozolomide SUN. This adds up to a 28-day treatment cycle. \nAfter day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again take Temozolomide SUN once daily for 5 days \nfollowed by 23 days without Temozolomide SUN. The Temozolomide SUN dose may be adjusted, \ndelayed or stopped depending on your blood counts and how you tolerate your medicine during each \ntreatment cycle. \n \nPatients with tumours that have returned or worsened (malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma \nmultiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma) taking Temozolomide SUN only \n \nA treatment cycle with Temozolomide SUN lasts 28 days. \nYou will take Temozolomide SUN only once daily for the first 5 days. This daily dose depends on \nwhether or not you have received chemotherapy before. \n \nIf you have not been previously treated with chemotherapy, your first dose of Temozolomide SUN \nwill be 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days. If you have been previously treated with \nchemotherapy, your first dose of Temozolomide SUN will be 150 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 \ndays. Then, you will have 23 days without Temozolomide SUN. This adds up to a 28-day treatment \ncycle. \n \n\n\n\n176 \n\n \n\nAfter day 28, the next cycle will begin. You will again receive Temozolomide SUN once daily for 5 \ndays, followed by 23 days without Temozolomide SUN. \n \nBefore each new treatment cycle, your blood will be tested to see if the Temozolomide SUN dose \nneeds to be adjusted. Depending on your blood test results, your doctor may adjust your dose for the \nnext cycle. \n \nHow to take Temozolomide SUN \n \nTake your prescribed dose of Temozolomide SUN once a day, preferably at the same time each day. \n \nTake the capsules on an empty stomach; for example, at least one hour before you plan to eat \nbreakfast.

This may cause \nyou to have increased bruising or bleeding, anaemia (a shortage of red blood cells), fever, and reduced \nresistance to infections. The reduction in blood cell counts is usually short-lived. In some cases, it may \nbe prolonged and may lead to a very severe form of anaemia (aplastic anaemia). Your doctor will \nmonitor your blood regularly for any changes, and will decide if any specific treatment is needed. In \nsome cases, your Temozolomide SUN dose will be reduced or treatment stopped. \n \nSide effects from clinical studies \n \nTemozolomide SUN in combination treatment with radiotherapy in newly-diagnosed glioblastoma \n \nPatients receiving Temozolomide SUN in combination with radiotherapy may experience different \nside effects from patients taking Temozolomide SUN alone.

allergic reaction to dacarbazine (an anticancer medicine sometimes called dtic). signs of allergic reaction include itchiness, breathlessness or wheezing, or swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat. - if the numbers of certain kinds of blood cells, such as your white blood cells or platelets are severely reduced (known as myelosuppression). these blood cells are important for fighting infection and for proper blood clotting. your doctor will check your blood to make sure you have enough of these cells before you begin treatment. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking temozolomide sun, 129 - as you should be observed closely for the development of a serious form of chest infection called pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (pcp). if you have been newly-diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme you may be receiving temozolomide sun for 42 days in combination with radiotherapy. in this case, your doctor will also prescribe medicine to help you prevent this type of pneumonia (pcp). - if you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis b infection. this is because temozolomide sun could cause hepatitis b to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. patients will be carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. - if you have low counts of red blood cells (anaemia), white blood cells and platelets, or blood clotting problems before starting the treatment, or if you develop them during treatment. your blood will be tested frequently during treatment to monitor the side effects of temozolomide sun on your blood cells. your doctor may decide to reduce the dose, interrupt, stop or change your treatment. you may also need other treatments. in some cases, it may be necessary to stop treatment with temozolomide sun. - as you may have a small risk of other changes in blood cells, including leukaemia. - if you have nausea (feeling sick) and/or vomiting which are very common side effects of temozolomide sun (see section 4), your doctor may prescribe you a medicine (an anti-emetic) to help prevent vomiting. if you vomit frequently before or during treatment, ask your doctor about the best time to take temozolomide sun until the vomiting is under control. if you vomit after taking your dose, do not take a second dose on the same day. - if you develop fever or symptoms of an infection contact your doctor immediately. - if you are older than 70 years of age, you might be more prone to infection, bruising or bleeding. - if you have liver or kidney problems, your dose of temozolomide sun may need to be adjusted. children and adolescents do not give this medicine to children under the age of 3 years because it has not been studied. there is

take any other medicines. pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. this is because you must not be treated with temozolomide sun during pregnancy unless clearly indicated by your doctor. effective contraceptive precautions must be taken by both male and female patients who are taking temozolomide sun (see also \"male fertility\" below). you should stop breast-feeding while receiving treatment with temozolomide sun. male fertility temozolomide sun may cause permanent infertility. male patients should use effective contraception and not father a child for up to 6 months after stopping treatment. it is recommended to seek advice on conservation

pharmacist has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. dosage and duration of treatment your doctor will work out your dose of temozolomide sun. this is based on your size (height and weight) and whether you have a recurrent tumour and have had chemotherapy treatment in the past. you may be given other medicines (anti-emetics) to take before and/or after taking temozolomide sun to prevent or control nausea and vomiting. patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme if you are a newly-diagnosed patient, treatment will occur in two phases: - treatment together with radiotherapy (concomitant phase) first - followed by treatment with temozolomide sun only (monotherapy phase). during the concomitant phase, your doctor will start temozolomide sun at a dose of 75 mg/m2 (usual dose). you will take this dose every day for 42 to 49 days in combination with radiotherapy. the temozolomide sun dose may be delayed or stopped, depending on your blood counts and how you tolerate your medicine during the concomitant phase. once the radiotherapy is completed, you will have no treatment for 4 weeks. this will give your body a chance to recover. then, you will start the monotherapy phase. during the monotherapy phase, the dose and way you take temozolomide sun can vary. your doctor will work out your exact dose. there may be up to 6 treatment periods (cycles). each one lasts 28 days. the first dose will be 150 mg/m2. you will take your new dose of temozolomide sun once daily for the first 5 days (\"dosing days\") of each cycle. then you will have 23 days without temozolomide sun. this adds up to a 28-day treatment cycle. after day 28, the next cycle will begin. you will again take temozolomide sun once daily for 5 days followed by 23 days without temozolomide sun. the temozolomide sun dose may be adjusted, delayed or stopped depending on your blood counts and how you tolerate your medicine during each treatment cycle. patients with tumours that have returned or worsened (malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma) taking temozolomide sun only a treatment cycle with temozolomide sun lasts 28 days. you will take temozolomide sun only once daily for the first 5 days. this daily dose depends on whether or not you have received chemotherapy before. if you have not been previously treated with chemotherapy, your first dose of temozolomide sun will be 200 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days. if you have been previously treated with chemotherapy, your first dose of temozolomide sun will be 150 mg/m2 once daily for the first 5 days. then, you will have 23 days without temozolomide sun. this adds up to a 28-day treatment cycle. after day 28, the next cycle will begin. you will again receive temozolomide sun once daily for 5 days, followed by 23 days without temozolomide sun. before each new treatment cycle, your blood will be tested to see if the temozolomide sun dose needs to be adjusted. depending on your blood test results, your doctor may adjust your dose for the next cycle. how to take temozolomide sun take your prescribed dose of temozolomide sun once a day, preferably at the same time each day. take the capsules on an empty stomach; for example, at least one hour before you plan to eat breakfast. swallow the capsule(s) whole with a glass of water. do not open, crush or chew the capsules. if a capsule is damaged, avoid contact of the powder with your skin, eyes or nose. if you accidentally get some in your eyes or nose, flush the area with water. depending on the prescribed dose, you may have to take more than one capsule at the same time. you may have to take different strengths to make up the dose. the marking on the capsule is different for each strength (see table below). strength imprint temozolomide sun 5 mg hard capsules 890 & 5 mg temozolomide sun 20 mg hard capsules 891 & 20 mg temozolomide sun 100 mg hard capsules 892 & 100 mg

remember the following: - the number of capsules you need to take every dosing day. ask your doctor or pharmacist to write it down (including the marking) - which days are your dosing days. review the dose with your doctor each time you start a new cycle, since it may be different from the last cycle. always take temozolomide sun exactly as your doctor has told you. it is very important to check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. making a mistake in how you take this medicine may have serious health consequences. if you take more temozolomide sun than you should if you accidentally take more temozolomide sun capsules than you were told to, contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately. if you forget to take temozolomide sun take the missed dose as soon as possible during the same day. if a full day has gone by, check with your doctor. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, unless your doctor tells you to do so. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "temozolomide sun", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0},
