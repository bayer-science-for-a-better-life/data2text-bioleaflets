QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nPREVYMIS 240 mg film-coated tablets\nEach film-coated tablet contains 240 mg of letermovir.\n\nPREVYMIS 480 mg film-coated tablets\nEach film-coated tablet contains 480 mg of letermovir.\n\nExcipients with known effect\nEach 240 mg film-coated tablet contains 4 mg of lactose (as monohydrate).\nEach 480 mg film-coated tablet contains 6.4 mg of lactose (as monohydrate).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet)\n\nPREVYMIS 240 mg film-coated tablets\nYellow oval tablet of dimensions 16.5 mm x 8.5 mm, debossed with “591” on one side and MSD logo \non the other side.\n\nPREVYMIS 480 mg film-coated tablets\nPink oval, bi-convex tablet of dimensions 21.2 mm x 10.3 mm, debossed with “595” on one side and\nMSD logo on the other side.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nPREVYMIS is indicated for prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation and disease in adult\nCMV-seropositive recipients [R+] of an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).\n\nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antiviral agents.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPREVYMIS should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of patients who have \nhad an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant.\n\nPosology\nPREVYMIS is also available as concentrate for solution for infusion (240 mg and 480 mg).\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nPREVYMIS tablets and concentrate for solution for infusion may be used interchangeably at the \ndiscretion of the physician, and no dose adjustment is necessary.\n\nThe recommended dosage of PREVYMIS is one 480 mg tablet once daily.\n\nPREVYMIS should be started after HSCT. PREVYMIS may be started on the day of transplant and no \nlater than 28 days post-transplant. PREVYMIS may be started before or after engraftment. Prophylaxis \nwith PREVYMIS should continue through 100 days post-transplant.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of letermovir use for more than 100 days has not been studied in clinical \ntrials. Prolonged letermovir prophylaxis beyond 100 days post-transplant may be of benefit in some\npatients at high risk for late CMV reactivation (see section 5.1). Use of letermovir prophylaxis for \ngreater than 100 days requires a careful assessment of the benefit-risk balance.\n\nDosage adjustment \nIf PREVYMIS is co-administered with cyclosporine, the dosage of PREVYMIS should be decreased \nto 240 mg once daily (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).\n If cyclosporine is initiated after starting PREVYMIS, the next dose of PREVYMIS should be \n\ndecreased to 240 mg once daily.\n If cyclosporine is discontinued after starting PREVYMIS, the next dose of PREVYMIS should be \n\nincreased to 480 mg once daily.\n If cyclosporine dosing is temporarily interrupted due to high cyclosporine levels, no dose \n\nadjustment of PREVYMIS is needed.\n\nMissed dose\nPatients should be instructed that if they miss a dose of PREVYMIS, they should take it as soon as \nthey remember. If they do not remember until it is time for the next dose, they should skip the missed \ndose and go back to the regular schedule. Patients should not double their next dose or take more than \nthe prescribed one.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment of PREVYMIS is required based on age (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment of PREVYMIS is required based on mild (Child-Pugh Class A) to moderate \n(Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. PREVYMIS is not recommended for patients with severe \n(Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nCombined hepatic and renal impairment\nPREVYMIS is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment combined with \nmoderate or severe renal impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment of PREVYMIS is recommended for patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal \nimpairment. No dose recommendation can be made for patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD)\nwith or without dialysis. Efficacy and safety has not been demonstrated for patients with ESRD.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of PREVYMIS in patients below 18 years of age have not been established. \nNo data are available (see section 5.1).\n\nMethod of administration\nFor oral use.\nThe tablet should be swallowed whole and may be taken with or without food. The tablet should not \nbe divided, crushed, or chewed.\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\nConcomitant administration with pimozide (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\nConcomitant administration with ergot alkaloids (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\nConcomitant administration with St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (see section 4.5).\nWhen letermovir is combined with cyclosporine: \nConcomitant use of dabigatran, atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin or pitavastatin is contraindicated \n(see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nMonitoring of CMV DNA\nThe safety and efficacy of letermovir has been established in patients with a negative CMV DNA test \nresult prior to initiation of prophylaxis. CMV DNA was monitored on a weekly basis until post-\ntransplant Week 14, and subsequently bi-weekly until Week 24. In cases of clinically significant CMV \nDNAemia or disease, letermovir prophylaxis was stopped and standard-of-care pre-emptive therapy \n(PET) or treatment was initiated. In patients in whom letermovir prophylaxis was initiated and the \nbaseline CMV DNA test was subsequently found to be positive, prophylaxis could be continued if \nPET criteria had not been met (see section 5.1).\n\nRisk of adverse reactions or reduced therapeutic effect due to medicinal product interactions\nThe concomitant use of PREVYMIS and certain medicinal products may result in known or \npotentially significant medicinal product interactions, some of which may lead to:\n possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposure of concomitant medicinal \n\nproducts or letermovir.\n significant decrease of concomitant medicinal product plasma concentrations which may lead to \n\nreduced therapeutic effect of the concomitant medicinal product.\nSee Table 1 for steps to prevent or manage these known or potentially significant medicinal product \ninteractions, including dosing recommendations (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).\n\nDrug interactions\nPREVYMIS should be used with caution with medicinal products that are CYP3A substrates with\nnarrow therapeutic ranges (e.g., alfentanil, fentanyl, and quinidine) as co-administration may result in \nincreases in the plasma concentrations of CYP3A substrates. Close monitoring and/or dose adjustment \nof co-administered CYP3A substrates is recommended (see section 4.5).\n\nIncreased monitoring of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus is generally recommended the first 2 \nweeks after initiating and ending letermovir (see section 4.5) as well as after changing route of \nadministration of letermovir.\n\nLetermovir is a moderate inducer of enzymes and transporters. Induction may give rise to reduced \nplasma concentrations of some metabolised and transported medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nTherapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is therefore recommended for voriconazole. Concomitant use of \ndabigatran should be avoided due to risk of reduced dabigatran efficacy.\n\nLetermovir may increase the plasma concentrations of medicinal products transported by OATP1B1/3 \nsuch as many of the statins (see section 4.5 and Table 1).\n\nExcipients\nPREVYMIS contains lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal \nproduct.\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is\nto say essentially ‘sodium-free’.\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nGeneral information about differences in exposure between different letermovir treatment regimens \n-The estimated letermovir plasma exposure is different depending on the dose regimen used (see table \nin section 5.2). Therefore, the clinical consequences of drug interactions for letermovir will be \ndependent on which letermovir regimen is used and whether or not letermovir is combined with \ncyclosporine.\n-The combination of cyclosporine and letermovir may lead to more marked or additional effects on \nconcomitant medicinal products as compared to letermovir alone (see Table 1).\n\nEffect of other medicinal products on letermovir\nThe elimination pathways of letermovir in vivo are biliary excretion and glucuronidation. The relative \nimportance of these pathways is unknown. Both elimination pathways involve active uptake into the\nhepatocyte through the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1/ 3. After uptake, glucuronidation of \nletermovir is mediated by UGT1A1 and 3. Letermovir also appears to be subject to P-gp and BCRP \nmediated efflux in the liver and intestine (see section 5.2).\n\nInducers of drug metabolizing enzymes or transporters\nCo-administration of PREVYMIS (with or without cyclosporine) with strong and moderate inducers of \ntransporters (e.g., P-gp) and/or enzymes (e.g., UGTs) is not recommended, as it may lead to \nsubtherapeutic letermovir exposure (see Table 1).  \n-Examples of strong inducers include rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. John’s wort \n(Hypericum perforatum), rifabutin and phenobarbital.\n-Examples of moderate inducers include thioridazine, modafinil, ritonavir, lopinavir, efavirenz and \netravirine. \n\nRifampicin co-administration resulted in an initial increase in letermovir plasma concentrations (due to \nOATP1B1/3 and/or P-gp inhibition) that is not clinically relevant, followed by clinically relevant \ndecreases in letermovir plasma concentrations (due to induction of P-gp/UGT) with continued \nrifampicin co-administration (see Table 1).\n\nAdditional effects of other products on letermovir relevant when combined with cyclosporine\n\nInhibitors of OATP1B1 or 3\nCo-administration of PREVYMIS with medicinal products that are inhibitors of OATP1B1/3 \ntransporters may result in increased letermovir plasma concentrations. If PREVYMIS is co-\nadministered with cyclosporine (a potent OATP1B1/3 inhibitor), the recommended dose of \nPREVYMIS is 240 mg once daily (see Table 1 and sections 4.2 and 5.2). Caution is advised if other \nOATP1B1/3 inhibitors are added to letermovir combined with cyclosporine.\n-Examples of OATP1B1 inhibitors include gemfibrozil, erythromycin, clarithromycin, and several \nprotease inhibitors (atazanavir, simeprevir).\n\nInhibitors of P-gp/BCRP\nIn vitro results indicate that letermovir is a substrate of P-gp/BCRP. Changes in letermovir plasma \nconcentrations due to inhibition of P-gp/BCRP by itraconazole were not clinically relevant.\n\nEffect of letermovir on other medicinal products\n\nMedicinal products mainly eliminated through metabolism or influenced by active transport \nLetermovir is a general inducer in vivo of enzymes and transporters. Unless a particular enzyme or\ntransporter is also inhibited (see below) induction can be expected. Therefore, letermovir may \npotentially lead to decreased plasma exposure and possibly reduced efficacy of co-administered \nmedicinal products that are mainly eliminated through metabolism or by active transport.\n\nThe size of the induction effect is dependent on letermovir route of administration and whether\ncyclosporine is concomitantly used. The full induction effect can be expected after 10-14 days of \n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nletermovir treatment. The time needed to reach steady state of a specific affected medicinal product \nwill also influence the time needed to reach full effect on the plasma concentrations.\n\nIn vitro, letermovir is an inhibitor of CYP3A, CYP2C8, CYP2B6, BCRP, UGT1A1, OATP2B1, and \nOAT3 at in vivo relevant concentrations. In vivo studies are available investigating the net effect on \nCYP3A4, P-gp, OATP1B1/3 additionally on CYP2C19. The net effect in vivo on the other listed \nenzymes and transporters is not known. Detailed information is presented below.\nIt is unknown whether letermovir may affect the exposure of piperacillin/tazobactam, amphotericine B \nand micafungin. The potential interaction between letermovir and these medicinal products have not \nbeen investigated. There is a theoretical risk of reduced exposure due to induction but the size of the \neffect and thus clinical relevance is presently unknown.\n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP3A\nLetermovir is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A in vivo. Co-administration of PREVYMIS with oral\nmidazolam (a CYP3A substrate) results in 2-3-fold increased midazolam plasma concentrations. Co-\nadministration of PREVYMIS may result in clinically relevant increases in the plasma concentrations \nof co-administered CYP3A substrates (see sections 4.3, 4.4, and 5.2). \n-Examples of such medicinal products include certain immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine, \ntacrolimus, sirolimus), HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and amiodarone (see Table 1). Pimozide and\nergot alkaloids are contraindicated (see section 4.3).\nThe size of the CYP3A inhibitory effect is dependent on letermovir route of administration and \nwhether cyclosporine is concomitantly used.\nDue to time dependent inhibition and simultaneous induction the net enzyme inhibitory effect may not \nbe reached until after 10-14 days. The time needed to reach steady state of a specific affected \nmedicinal product will also influence the time needed to reach full effect on the plasma concentrations. \nWhen ending treatment, it takes 10-14 days for the inhibitory effect to disappear. If monitoring is \napplied, this is recommended the first 2 weeks after initiating and ending letermovir (see section 4.4) \nas well as after changing route of letermovir administration.\n\nMedicinal products transported by OATP1B1/3\nLetermovir is an inhibitor of OATP1B1/3 transporters. Administration of PREVYMIS may result in a\nclinically relevant increase in plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products that are \nOATP1B1/3 substrates. \n-Examples of such medicinal products include HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, fexofenadine, \nrepaglinide and glyburide (see Table 1). Comparing letermovir regimen administered without \ncyclosporine, the effect is more marked after iv than oral letermovir.\nThe magnitude of the OATP1B1/3 inhibition on co-administered medicinal products is likely greater \nwhen PREVYMIS is co-administered with cyclosporine (a potent OATP1B1/3 inhibitor). This needs \nto be considered when the letermovir regimen is changed during treatment with an OATP1B1/3 \nsubstrate.\n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2C9 and/or CYP2C19\nCo-administration of PREVYMIS with voriconazole (a CYP2C19 substrate) results in significantly \ndecreased voriconazole plasma concentrations, indicating that letermovir is an inducer of CYP2C19. \nCYP2C9 is likely also induced. Letermovir has the potential to decrease the exposure of CYP2C9\nand/or CYP2C19 substrates potentially resulting in subtherapeutic levels. \n-Examples of such medicinal products include warfarin, voriconazole, diazepam, lansoprazole, \nomeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, tilidine, tolbutamide (see Table 1).\nThe effect is expected to be less pronounced for oral letermovir without cyclosporine, than IV \nletermovir with or without cyclosporine, or oral letermovir with cyclosporine. This needs to be \nconsidered when the letermovir regimen is changed during treatment with a CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 \nsubstrate. See also general information on induction above regarding time courses of the interaction.\n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2C8\nLetermovir inhibits CYP2C8 in vitro but may also induce CYP2C8 based on its induction potential. \nThe net effect in vivo is unknown. \n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\n-An example of a medicinal product which is mainly eliminated by CYP2C8 is repaglinide (see \nTable 1). Concomitant use of repaglinide and letermovir with or without cyclosporine is not \nrecommended.\n\nMedicinal products transported by P-gp in the intestine\nLetermovir is an inducer of intestinal P-gp. Administration of PREVYMIS may result in a clinically \nrelevant decrease in plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products that are significantly \ntransported by P-gp in the intestine such as dabigatran and sofosbuvir.\n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6, UGT1A1 or transported by BCRP or OATP2B1\nLetermovir is a general inducer in vivo but has also been observed to inhibit CYP2B6, UGT1A1, \nBCRP, and OATP2B1 in vitro. The net effect in vivo is unknown. Therefore, the plasma \nconcentrations of medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes or transporters may increase \nor decrease when co-administered with letermovir. Additional monitoring may be recommended; refer \nto the prescribing information for such medicinal products.\n- Examples of medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP2B6 include bupropion.\n- Examples of medicinal products metabolised by UGT1A1 are raltegravir and dolutegravir.\n- Examples of medicinal products transported by BCRP include rosuvastatin and sulfasalazine.\n- An example of a medicinal product transported by OATP2B1 is celiprolol.\n\nMedicinal products transported by the renal transporter OAT3\nIn vitro data indicate that letermovir is an inhibitor of OAT3; therefore, letermovir may be an OAT3 \ninhibitor in vivo. Plasma concentrations of medicinal products transported by OAT3 may be increased.\n-Examples of medicinal products transported by OAT3 includes ciprofloxacin, tenofovir, imipenem,\nand cilastin.\n\nGeneral information\nIf dose adjustments of concomitant medicinal products are made due to treatment with PREVYMIS,\ndoses should be readjusted after treatment with PREVYMIS is completed. A dose adjustment may also\nbe needed when changing route of administration or immunosuppressant.\n\nTable 1 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant medicinal product \ninteractions. The medicinal product interactions described are based on studies conducted with \nPREVYMIS or are predicted medicinal product interactions that may occur with PREVYMIS (see \nsections 4.3, 4.4, 5.1, and 5.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nTable 1: Interactions and dose recommendations with other medicinal products. Note that the \ntable is not extensive but provides examples of clinically relevant interactions. See also the \ngeneral text on DDIs above.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, interaction studies have been performed with oral letermovir without \ncyclosporine. Please note that the interaction potential and clinical consequences may be \ndifferent depending on whether letermovir is administered orally or IV, and whether \ncyclosporine is concomitantly used. When changing the route of administration, or if changing \nimmunosuppressant, the recommendation concerning co-administration should be revisited. \n\nConcomitant \nmedicinal product \n\nEffect on

Fatigue and vertigo \nhave been reported in some patients during treatment with PREVYMIS, which may influence a \npatient’s ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8). \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe safety assessment of PREVYMIS was based on a Phase 3 clinical trial (P001) in HSCT recipients \nwho received PREVYMIS or placebo through Week 14 post-transplant and were followed for safety \nthrough Week 24 post-transplant (see section 5.1).\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions occurring in at least 1% of subjects in the PREVYMIS\ngroup and at a frequency greater than placebo were: nausea (7.2%), diarrhoea (2.4%), and vomiting \n(1.9%).\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of PREVYMIS were nausea \n(1.6%), vomiting (0.8%), and abdominal pain (0.5%).\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\nThe following adverse reactions were identified in patients taking PREVYMIS in clinical trials. The \nadverse reactions are listed below by body system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined \nas follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), \nrare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) or very rare (< 1/10,000).\n\n \n\n\n\n18\n\nTable 2: Adverse reactions identified with PREVYMIS\nFrequency Adverse reactions\nImmune system disorders\nUncommon hypersensitivity\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nUncommon decreased appetite\nNervous system disorders\nUncommon dysgeusia, headache\nEar and labyrinth disorders\nUncommon vertigo\nGastrointestinal disorders\nCommon nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting\nUncommon abdominal pain\nHepatobiliary disorders\nUncommon alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate \n\naminotransferase increased\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nUncommon muscle spasms\nRenal and urinary disorders\nUncommon blood creatinine increased\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nUncommon fatigue, oedema peripheral\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no experience with human overdose with PREVYMIS. During Phase 1 clinical trials, 86 \nhealthy subjects received doses ranging from 720 mg/day to 1440 mg/day of PREVYMIS for up to 14 \ndays. The adverse reaction profile was similar to that of the clinical dose of 480 mg/day. There is no \nspecific antidote for overdose with PREVYMIS. In case of overdose, it is recommended that the \npatient be monitored for adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.\n\nIt is unknown whether dialysis will result in meaningful removal of PREVYMIS from systemic \ncirculation.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, direct acting antivirals, ATC code: J05AX18\n\nMechanism of action\nLetermovir inhibits the CMV DNA terminase complex which is required for cleavage and packaging \nof viral progeny DNA. Letermovir affects the formation of proper unit length genomes and interferes \nwith virion maturation.\n\nAntiviral activity\nThe median EC50 value of letermovir against a collection of clinical CMV isolates in a cell-culture \nmodel of infection was 2.1 nM (range = 0.7 nM to 6.1 nM, n=74). \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n19\n\nViral resistance\n\nIn cell culture\nThe CMV genes UL51, UL56, and UL89 encode subunits of CMV DNA terminase. CMV mutants \nwith reduced susceptibility to letermovir have been confirmed in cell culture. EC50 values for \nrecombinant CMV mutants expressing the substitutions map to pUL51 (P91S), pUL56 (C25F, S229F, \nV231A, V231L, V236A, T244K, T244R, L254F, L257F, L257I, F261C, F261L, F261S, Y321C, \nL328V, M329T, A365S, N368D), and pUL89 (N320H, D344E) were 1.6- to <10-fold higher than \nthose for wild-type reference virus; these substitutions are not likely to be clinically relevant. EC50\n\nvalues for recombinant CMV mutants expressing pUL56 substitutions N232Y, V236L, V236M,\nE237D, E237G, L241P, K258E, C325F, C325R, C325W, C325Y, R369G, R369M, R369S and R369T \nwere 10- to 9,300-fold higher than those for the wild-type reference virus; some of these substitutions \nhave been observed in patients who have experienced prophylaxis failure in clinical studies (see \nbelow). \n\nIn clinical studies\nIn a Phase 2b trial evaluating letermovir doses of 60, 120, or 240 mg/day or placebo for up to 84 days \nin 131 HSCT recipients, DNA sequence analysis of a select region of UL56 (amino acids 231 to 369) \nwas performed on samples obtained from 12 letermovir-treated subjects who experienced prophylaxis \nfailure and for whom samples were available for analysis. One subject (who received 60 mg/day) had a \nletermovir resistant genotypic variant (GV) (V236M).\n\nIn a Phase 3 trial (P001), DNA sequence analysis of the entire coding regions of UL56 and UL89 was \nperformed on samples obtained from 40 letermovir-treated subjects in the FAS population who \nexperienced prophylaxis failure and for whom samples were available for analysis. Two subjects had \nletermovir-resistant GVs detected, both with substitutions mapping to pUL56. One subject had the \nsubstitution V236M and the other subject had the substitution E237G. One additional subject, who had \ndetectable CMV DNA at baseline (and was therefore not in the FAS population), had pUL56 \nsubstitutions, C325W and R369T, detected after discontinuing letermovir.\n\nCross-resistance\nCross-resistance is not likely with medicinal products with a different mechanism of action. \nLetermovir is fully active against viral populations with substitutions conferring resistance to CMV \nDNA polymerase inhibitors (ganciclovir, cidofovir, and foscarnet). A panel of recombinant CMV \nstrains with substitutions conferring resistance to letermovir was fully susceptible to cidofovir, \nfoscarnet and ganciclovir with the exception of a recombinant strain with the pUL56 E237G \nsubstitution which confers a 2.1-fold reduction in ganciclovir susceptibility relative to wild-type.\n\nCardiac electrophysiology\nThe effect of letermovir on doses up to 960 mg given IV on the QTc interval was evaluated in a \nrandomised, single-dose, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg oral) 4-period \ncrossover thorough QT trial in 38 healthy subjects. Letermovir does not prolong QTc to any clinically \nrelevant extent following the 960 mg IV dose with plasma concentrations approximately 2-fold higher \nthan the 480 mg IV dose.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nAdult CMV-seropositive recipients [R+] of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant\nTo evaluate letermovir prophylaxis as a preventive strategy for CMV infection or disease, the efficacy \nof letermovir was assessed in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial (P001) in \nadult CMV-seropositive recipients [R+] of an allogeneic HSCT. Subjects were randomised (2:1) to \nreceive either letermovir at a dose of 480 mg once daily adjusted to 240 mg when co-administered \nwith cyclosporine, or placebo. Randomisation was stratified by investigational site and risk (high vs. \nlow) for CMV reactivation at the time of study entry. Letermovir was initiated after HSCT (Day 0-28 \npost-transplant) and continued through Week 14 post-transplant. Letermovir was administered either \norally or IV; the dose of letermovir was the same regardless of the route of administration. Subjects \n\n \n\n\n\n20\n\nwere monitored through Week 24 post-transplant for the primary efficacy endpoint with continued \nfollow-up through Week 48 post-transplant.\n\nSubjects received CMV DNA monitoring weekly until post-transplant week 14 and then bi-weekly\nuntil post-transplant week 24, with initiation of standard-of-care CMV pre-emptive therapy if CMV \nDNAemia was considered clinically significant. Subjects had continued follow-up through Week 48 \npost-transplant. \n\nAmong the 565 treated subjects, 373 subjects received letermovir (including 99 subjects who received \nat least one IV dose) and 192 received placebo (including 48 subjects who received at least one IV \ndose). The median time to starting letermovir was 9 days after transplantation. Thirty-seven percent \n(37%) of subjects were engrafted at baseline. The median age was 54 years (range: 18 to 78 years); 56 \n(15.0%) subjects were 65 years of age or older: 58% were male; 82% were White; 10% were Asian; \n2% were Black or African; and 7% were Hispanic or Latino. At baseline, 50% of subjects received a \nmyeloablative regimen, 52% were receiving cyclosporine, and 42% were receiving tacrolimus. The \nmost common primary reasons for transplant were acute myeloid leukemia (38%), myeloblastic \nsyndrome (15%), and lymphoma (13%). Twelve percent (12%) of subjects were positive for CMV \nDNA at baseline.\n\nAt baseline, 31% of subjects were at high risk for reactivation as defined by one or more of the \nfollowing criteria: Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-related (sibling) donor with at least one \nmismatch at one of the following three HLA-gene loci: HLA-A, -B or –DR, haploidentical donor; \nunrelated donor with at least one mismatch at one of the following four HLA-gene loci: HLA-A, -B, -\nC and -DRB1; use of umbilical cord blood as stem cell source; use of ex vivo T-cell-depleted grafts; \nGrade 2 or greater Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD), requiring systemic corticosteroids.\n\nPrimary efficacy endpoint\nThe primary efficacy endpoint of clinically significant CMV infection in P001 was defined by the \nincidence of CMV DNAemia warranting anti-CMV pre-emptive therapy (PET) or the occurrence of \nCMV end-organ disease. The Non-Completer=Failure (NC=F) approach was used, where subjects \nwho discontinued from the study prior to Week 24 post-transplant or had a missing outcome at Week \n24 post-transplant were counted as failures.\n\nLetermovir demonstrated superior efficacy over placebo in the analysis of the primary endpoint, as \nshown in Table 3. The estimated treatment difference of -23.5% was statistically significant (one-sided \np-value <0.0001).\n\n \n\n\n\n21\n\nTable 3: P001: Efficacy results in HSCT recipients (NC=F Approach, FAS Population)\n\nLetermovir Placebo \n(N=325) (N=170) \n\nParameter       n (%) n (%) \nPrimary efficacy endpoint\n(Proportion of subjects who failed prophylaxis by \nWeek 24)                 \n\n122 (37.5)                                        103 (60.6)                         \n\nReasons for Failures†                                                  \n                                                                                  \n\nClinically significant CMV infection                     57 (17.5)                                              71 (41.8)                                    \n     CMV DNAemia warranting anti-CMV PET   52 (16.0)                                                 68 (40.0)                                    \n    CMV end-organ disease                                                                5 (1.5)                                         3 (1.8)                                      \n\nDiscontinued from study                                     56 (17.2)                                              27 (15.9)                                    \nMissing outcome                                         9 (2.8)                                                  5 (2.9)                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                    \nStratum-adjusted treatment difference (Letermovir-\nPlacebo)§            \n\n                                                                                          \n\nDifference (95% CI)                                                             -23.5 (-32.5, -14.6)                                                                \np-value                                                                         <0.0001                                                                                             \n† The categories of failure are mutually exclusive and based on the hierarchy of categories in the order \nlisted.\n§ 95% CIs and p-value for the treatment differences in percent response were calculated using stratum-\nadjusted Mantel-Haenszel method with the difference weighted by the harmonic mean of sample size \nper arm for each stratum (high or low risk).

Letermovir exposure increased in a greater than dose-\nproportional manner with both oral or IV administration. The mechanism is likely\nsaturation/autoinhibition of OATP1B1/3.\n\nIn healthy subjects, the geometric mean steady-state AUC and Cmax values were 71,500 ng•hr/mL and \n13,000 ng/mL, respectively, with 480 mg once daily oral letermovir.\n\nLetermovir reached steady-state in 9 to 10 days with an accumulation ratio of 1.2 for AUC and 1.0 for \nCmax.\n\n-70 -60 -50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20\n\nLetermovir - Placebo Difference (%) and 95% C.I.\nFavors Letermovir\n\nTacrolimus (n=145, 69)\n\nFavors Placebo\n\nReduced intensity conditioning (n=86, 48)\n\nCyclosporin A (n=162, 90)\n\nHaploidentical donor\n\nNon-myeloablative (n=85, 37)\n\nImmunosuppressive Regimen\n\nConditioning Regimen\nMyeloablative (n=154, 85)\n\nNo (n=276, 153)\nYes (n=49, 17)\n\nMismatched unrelated (n=43, 24)\n\nMismatched related (n=52, 18)\nMatched unrelated (n=122, 70)\n\nMatched related (n=108, 58)\nDonor mismatch\n\nBone marrow (n=72, 43)\nPeripheral blood (n=241, 117)\n\nStem Cell Source\n\nHigh Risk (n=102, 45)\nLow Risk  (n=223, 125)\n\nRisk stratum\n\nOverall  (N=325, 170)\n\n \n\n\n\n24\n\nIn HSCT recipients, letermovir AUC was estimated using population pharmacokinetic analyses using \nPhase 3 data (see Table 4). Differences in exposure across treatment regimens are not clinically \nrelevant; efficacy was consistent across the range of exposures observed in P001.\n\nTable 4: Letermovir AUC (ng•hr/mL) values in HSCT Recipients\nTreatment Regimen Median (90% Prediction Interval)*\n\n480 mg Oral, no cyclosporine 34,400 (16,900, 73,700)\n\n480 mg IV, no cyclosporine 100,000 (65,300, 148,000)\n\n240 mg Oral, with cyclosporine 60,800 (28,700, 122,000)\n\n240 mg IV, with cyclosporine 70,300 (46,200, 106,000)\n\n* Population post-hoc predictions from the population PK analysis using Phase 3 data\n\nAbsorption\nLetermovir was absorbed rapidly with a median time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of 1.5\nto 3.0 hours and declined in a biphasic manner. In HSCT recipients, bioavailability of letermovir was \nestimated to be approximately 35% with 480 mg once daily oral letermovir administered without \ncyclosporine. The inter-individual variability for bioavailability was estimated to be approximately \n37%. \n\nEffect of cyclosporine\nIn HSCT recipients, co-administration of cyclosporine increased plasma concentrations of letermovir \ndue to inhibition of OATP1B. Bioavailability of letermovir was estimated to be approximately 85% \nwith 240 mg once daily oral letermovir co-administered with cyclosporine in patients.\nIf letermovir is co-administered with cyclosporine, the recommended dose of letermovir is 240 mg \nonce daily (see section 4.2).\n\nEffect of food\nIn healthy subjects, oral administration of 480 mg single dose of letermovir with a standard high fat \nand high calorie meal did not have any effect on the overall exposure (AUC) and resulted in \napproximately 30% increase in peak levels (Cmax) of letermovir. Letermovir may be administered \norally with or without food as has been done in the clinical studies (see section 4.2).\n\nDistribution\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analyses, the mean steady-state volume of distribution is \nestimated to be 45.5 L following intravenous administration in HSCT recipients.\n\nLetermovir is extensively bound (98.2%) to human plasma proteins, independent of the concentration\nrange (3 to 100 mg/L) evaluated, in vitro. Some saturation was observed at lower concentrations. \nBlood to plasma partitioning of letermovir is 0.56 and independent of the concentration range (0.1 to \n10 mg/L) evaluated in vitro.\n\nIn preclinical distribution studies, letermovir is distributed to organs and tissues with the highest \nconcentrations observed in the gastrointestinal tract, bile duct and liver and low concentrations in the \nbrain.\n\nBiotransformation\nThe majority of letermovir-related components in plasma is unchanged parent (96.6%). No major \nmetabolites are detected in plasma. Letermovir is partly eliminated by glucuronidation mediated by \nUGT1A1/1A3. \n\n \n\n\n\n25\n\nElimination\nThe mean apparent terminal half-life for letermovir is approximately 12 hours with 480 mg IV \nletermovir in healthy subjects. The major elimination pathways of letermovir is biliary excretion as \nwell as direct glucuronidation. The process involves the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and 3 \nfollowed by UGT1A1/3 catalysed glucuronidation.\n\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analyses, letermovir steady-state apparent CL is estimated to be \n4.84 L/hr following intravenous administration of 480 mg in HSCT recipients. The inter-individual \nvariability for CL is estimated to be 24.6%.\n\nExcretion\nAfter oral administration of radio-labeled letermovir, 93.3% of radioactivity was recovered in faeces. \nThe majority of letermovir was biliary excreted as unchanged parent with a minor amount (6% of \ndose) as an acyl-glucuronide metabolite in faeces. The acyl-glucuronide is unstable in faeces. Urinary \nexcretion of letermovir was negligible (<2% of dose).\n\nPharmacokinetics in special populations\n\nHepatic impairment\nLetermovir unbound AUC was approximately 81%- and 4-fold higher in subjects with moderate \n(Child-Pugh Class B [CP-B], score of 7-9) and severe (Child-Pugh Class C [CP-C], score of 10-15) \nhepatic impairment, respectively, compared to healthy subjects. The changes in letermovir exposure in \nsubjects with moderate hepatic impairment are not clinically relevant.\n\nMarked increases in letermovir unbound exposure are anticipated in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment combined with moderate or severe renal impairment (see section 4.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nLetermovir unbound AUC was approximately 115- and 81% higher in subjects with moderate (eGFR \nof 31.0 to 56.8 mL/min/1.73m2) and severe (eGFR of 11.9 to 28.1 mL/min/1.73m2) renal impairment, \nrespectively, compared to healthy subjects. The changes in letermovir exposure due to moderate or \nsevere renal impairment are not considered to be clinically relevant. Subjects with ESRD have not \nbeen studied.\n\nWeight\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analyses, letermovir AUC is estimated to be 18.7% lower in \nsubjects weighing 80-100 kg compared to subjects weighing 67 kg. This difference is not clinically \nrelevant.\n\nRace\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analyses, letermovir AUC is estimated to be 33.2% higher in \nAsians compared to Whites. This change is not clinically relevant.\n\nGender\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analyses, there is no difference in letermovir pharmacokinetics \nin females compared to males.\n\nElderly\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analyses, there is no effect of age on letermovir \npharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required based on age.\n\n \n\n\n\n26\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nGeneral toxicity\nIrreversible testicular toxicity was noted only in rats at systemic exposures (AUC) ≥3-fold the \nexposures in humans at the recommended human dose (RHD). This toxicity was characterized by \nseminiferous tubular degeneration, and oligospermia and cell debris in the epididymides, with \ndecreased testicular and epididymides weights. There was no testicular toxicity in rats at exposures \n(AUC) similar to the exposures in humans at the RHD. Testicular toxicity was not observed in mice \nand monkeys at the highest doses tested at exposures up to 4-fold and 2-fold, respectively, the \nexposures in humans at the RHD. The relevance to humans is unknown. \n\nIt is known that hydroxypropylbetadex can cause kidney vacuolation in rats when given intravenously \nat doses greater than 50 mg/kg/day. Vacuolation was noted in the kidneys of rats administered IV \nletermovir formulated with 1500 mg/kg/day of the cyclodextrin excipient hydroxypropylbetadex. \n\nCarcinogenesis\nCarcinogenicity studies with letermovir have not been conducted.\n\nMutagenesis\nLetermovir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including microbial \nmutagenesis assays, chromosomal aberration in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells, and in an in vivo mouse \nmicronucleus study.\n\nReproduction\nFertility\nIn the fertility and early embryonic development studies in the rat, there were no effects of letermovir \non female fertility. In male rats, reduced sperm concentration, reduced sperm motility, and decreased \nfertility were observed at systemic exposures ≥ 3-fold the AUC in humans at the RHD (see General \ntoxicity).\n\nIn monkeys administered letermovir, there was no evidence of testicular toxicity based on \nhistopathologic evaluation, measurement of testicular size, blood hormone analysis (follicle \nstimulating hormone, inhibin B and testosterone) and sperm evaluation (sperm count, motility and \nmorphology) at systemic exposures approximately 2-fold the AUC in humans at the RHD.\n\nDevelopment\nIn rats, maternal toxicity (including decrease in body weight gain) was noted at 250 mg/kg/day \n(approximately 11-fold the AUC at the RHD); in the offspring, decreased foetal weight with delayed \nossification, slightly oedematous foetuses, and increased incidence of shortened umbilical cords and of \nvariations and malformations in the vertebrae, ribs, and pelvis were observed. No maternal or \ndevelopmental effects were noted at the dose of 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.5-fold the AUC at the \nRHD).\nIn rabbits, maternal toxicity (including mortality and abortions) was noted at 225 mg/kg/day \n(approximately 2-fold the AUC at the RHD); in the offspring, an increased incidence of malformations \nand variations in the vertebrae and ribs were observed. \nIn the pre- and post-natal developmental study, letermovir was administered orally to pregnant rats. \nThere was no developmental toxicity observed up to the highest exposure tested (2-fold the AUC at \nthe RHD).\n\n \n\n\n\n27\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nPREVYMIS is indicated for prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation and disease in adult \nCMV-seropositive recipients [R+] of an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).\n\nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antiviral agents.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPREVYMIS should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of patients who have \nhad an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant.\n\n \n\n\n\n30\n\nPosology\nPREVYMIS is also available for oral administration (240 mg and 480 mg film-coated tablets).\n\nPREVYMIS tablets and concentrate for solution for infusion may be used interchangeably at the \ndiscretion of the physician, and no dose adjustment is necessary.\n\nThe recommended dosage of PREVYMIS is 480 mg once daily.\n\nPREVYMIS should be started after HSCT. PREVYMIS may be started on the day of transplant and no \nlater than 28 days post-transplant. PREVYMIS may be started before or after engraftment. Prophylaxis \nwith PREVYMIS should continue through 100 days post-transplant.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of letermovir use for more than 100 days has not been studied in clinical \ntrials. Prolonged letermovir prophylaxis beyond 100 days post-transplant may be of benefit in some \npatients at high risk for late CMV reactivation (see section 5.1). Use of letermovir prophylaxis for \ngreater than 100 days requires a careful assessment of the benefit-risk balance.\n\nDosage adjustment \nIf PREVYMIS is co-administered with cyclosporine, the dosage of PREVYMIS should be decreased \nto 240 mg once daily (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).\n If cyclosporine is initiated after starting PREVYMIS, the next dose of PREVYMIS should be \n\ndecreased to 240 mg once daily.\n If cyclosporine is discontinued after starting PREVYMIS, the next dose of PREVYMIS should be \n\nincreased to 480 mg once daily.\n If cyclosporine dosing is temporarily interrupted due to high cyclosporine levels, no dose \n\nadjustment of PREVYMIS is needed.\n\nMissed dose\nIf a dose is missed, it should be given to the patient as soon as possible. If it is time for the next dose, \nskip the missed dose and go back to the regular schedule. Do not double the next dose or give more \nthan the prescribed dose.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment of PREVYMIS is required based on age (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment of PREVYMIS is required based on mild (Child-Pugh Class A) to moderate \n(Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. PREVYMIS is not recommended for patients with severe \n(Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nCombined hepatic and renal impairment\nPREVYMIS is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment combined with \nmoderate or severe renal impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment of PREVYMIS is recommended for patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal \nimpairment. No dose recommendation can be made for patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD)\nwith or without dialysis. Efficacy and safety has not been demonstrated for patients with ESRD.\n\nPREVYMIS concentrate for solution for infusion contains hydroxypropylbetadex. The anticipated \nclinical exposure to hydroxypropylbetadex with intravenously administered letermovir is expected to \nbe approximately 3600 mg/day for a letermovir dose of 480 mg. There were no cases of kidney injury \ncaused by hydroxypropylbetadex in human studies of intravenously administered letermovir with \ntreatment durations of up to 47 days. In patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine \n\n \n\n\n\n31\n\nclearance less than 50 mL/min) receiving PREVYMIS, accumulation of hydroxypropylbetadex, could \noccur (see section 5.3). Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of PREVYMIS in patients below 18 years of age have not been established. \nNo data are available (see section 5.1).\n\nMethod of administration\nFor intravenous use only.\nPREVYMIS concentrate for solution for infusion requires dilution (see section 6.6) prior to \nadministration.\nPREVYMIS diluted solution must be administered through a sterile 0.2 micron or 0.22 micron \npolyethersulfone (PES) in-line filter. Do not administer the diluted solution through a filter other than \na sterile 0.2 micron or 0.22 micron PES in-line filter.\nPREVYMIS should be administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion only. PREVYMIS should not be \nadministered as an intravenous push or bolus.\nAfter dilution, PREVYMIS should be administered by intravenous infusion via peripheral or central \nvenous catheter using a total time of approximately 60 minutes. The entire contents of the IV bag \nshould be administered.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\nConcomitant administration with pimozide (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\nConcomitant administration with ergot alkaloids (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\nConcomitant administration with St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (see section 4.5).\nWhen letermovir is combined with cyclosporine:\nConcomitant use of dabigatran, atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin or pitavastatin is contraindicated \n(see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nMonitoring of CMV DNA\nThe safety and efficacy of letermovir has been established in patients with a negative CMV DNA test \nresult prior to initiation of prophylaxis. CMV DNA was monitored on a weekly basis until post-\ntransplant Week 14, and subsequently bi-weekly until Week 24. In cases of clinically significant CMV \nDNAemia or disease, letermovir prophylaxis was stopped and standard-of-care pre-emptive therapy \n(PET) or treatment was initiated. In patients in whom letermovir prophylaxis was initiated and the \nbaseline CMV DNA test was subsequently found to be positive, prophylaxis could be continued if \nPET criteria had not been met (see section 5.1).\n\nRisk of adverse reactions or reduced therapeutic effect due to medicinal product interactions\nThe concomitant use of PREVYMIS and certain medicinal products may result in known or \npotentially significant medicinal product interactions, some of which may lead to:\n possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposure of concomitant medicinal\n\nproducts or letermovir.\n significant decrease of concomitant medicinal product plasma concentrations which may lead to \n\nreduced therapeutic effect of the concomitant medicinal product.\nSee Table 1 for steps to prevent or manage these known or potentially significant medicinal product \ninteractions, including dosing recommendations (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).\n\nDrug interactions\nPREVYMIS should be used with caution with medicinal products that are CYP3A substrates with \nnarrow therapeutic ranges (e.g., alfentanil, fentanyl, and quinidine) as co-administration may result in \nincreases in the plasma concentrations of CYP3A substrates. Close monitoring and/or dose adjustment \nof co-administered CYP3A substrates is recommended (see section 4.5).\n\n \n\n\n\n32\n\nIncreased monitoring of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus is generally recommended the first 2 \nweeks after initiating and ending letermovir (see section 4.5) as well as after changing route of \nadministration of letermovir.\n\nLetermovir is a moderate inducer of enzymes and transporters. Induction may give rise to reduced \nplasma concentrations of some metabolised and transported medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nTherapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is therefore recommended for voriconazole.\nConcomitant use of dabigatran should be avoided due to risk of reduced dabigatran efficacy.\n\nLetermovir may increase the plasma concentrations of medicinal products transported by OATP1B1/3 \nsuch as many of the statins (see section 4.5 and Table 1).\n\nAdministration through a sterile 0.2 or 0.22 micron PES in-line filter\nPREVYMIS concentrate for solution for infusion may contain a few product-related small translucent \nor white particles. Administration of PREVYMIS diluted solution always requires the use of a sterile \n0.2 micron or 0.22 micron PES in-line filter, regardless of whether these product-related particles are \nvisible in the vial or diluted solution (see sections 4.2 and 6.6).\n\nExcipients\nPREVYMIS 240 mg concentrate for solution for infusion contains 23 mg (or 1.0 mmol) sodium per \ndose. This should be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.\nPREVYMIS 480 mg concentrate for solution for infusion contains 46 mg (or 2.0 mmol) sodium per \ndose. This should be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nGeneral information about differences in exposure between different letermovir treatment regimens \n-The estimated letermovir plasma exposure is different depending on the dose regimen used (see table \nin section 5.2). Therefore, the clinical consequences of drug interactions for letermovir will be \ndependent on which letermovir regimen is used and whether or not letermovir is combined with \ncyclosporine.\n-The combination of cyclosporine and letermovir may lead to more marked or additional effects on \nconcomitant medicinal products as compared to letermovir alone (see Table 1).\n\nEffect of other medicinal products on letermovir\nThe elimination pathways of letermovir in vivo are biliary excretion and glucuronidation. The relative \nimportance of these pathways is unknown. Both elimination pathways involve active uptake into the \nhepatocyte through the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1/ 3. After uptake, glucuronidation of \nletermovir is mediated by UGT1A1 and 3. Letermovir also appears to be subject to P-gp and BCRP \nmediated efflux in the liver and intestine (see section 5.2).\n\nInducers of drug metabolizing enzymes or transporters\nCo-administration of PREVYMIS (with or without cyclosporine) with strong and moderate inducers of\ntransporters (e.g., P-gp) and/or enzymes (e.g., UGTs) is not recommended, as it may lead to \nsubtherapeutic letermovir exposure (see Table 1).  \n-Examples of strong inducers include rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. John’s wort \n(Hypericum perforatum), rifabutin and phenobarbital.\n-Examples of moderate inducers include thioridazine, modafinil, ritonavir, lopinavir, efavirenz and \netravirine.\n\nRifampicin co-administration resulted in an initial increase in letermovir plasma concentrations (due to \nOATP1B1/3 and/or P-gp inhibition) that is not clinically relevant, followed by clinically relevant\ndecreases in letermovir plasma concentrations (due to induction of P-gp/UGT) with continued \nrifampicin co-administration (see Table 1).\n\n \n\n\n\n33\n\nAdditional effects of other products on letermovir relevant when combined with cyclosporine\n\nInhibitors of OATP1B1 or 3 \nCo-administration of PREVYMIS with medicinal products that are inhibitors of OATP1B1/3 \ntransporters may result in increased letermovir plasma concentrations. If PREVYMIS is co-\nadministered with cyclosporine (a potent OATP1B1/3 inhibitor), the recommended dose of \nPREVYMIS is 240 mg once daily (see Table 1 and sections 4.2 and 5.2). Caution is advised if other \nOATP1B1/3 inhibitors are added to letermovir combined with cyclosporine.\n-Examples of OATP1B1 inhibitors include gemfibrozil, erythromycin, clarithromycin, and several \nprotease inhibitors (atazanavir, simeprevir).\n\nInhibitors of P-gp/BCRP\nIn vitro results indicate that letermovir is a substrate of P-gp/BCRP. Changes in letermovir plasma \nconcentrations due to inhibition of P-gp/BCRP by itraconazole were not clinically relevant.\n\nEffect of letermovir on other medicinal products\n\nMedicinal products mainly eliminated through metabolism or influenced by active transport \nLetermovir is a general inducer in vivo of enzymes and transporters. Unless a particular enzyme or\ntransporter is also inhibited (see below) induction can be expected. Therefore, letermovir may \npotentially lead to decreased plasma exposure and possibly reduced efficacy of co-administered \nmedicinal products that are mainly eliminated through metabolism or by active transport.\nThe size of the induction effect is dependent on letermovir route of administration and whether\ncyclosporine is concomitantly used.\nThe full induction effect can be expected after 10-14 days of letermovir treatment. The time needed to \nreach steady state of a specific affected medicinal product will also influence the time needed to reach \nfull effect on the plasma concentrations.\n\nIn vitro, letermovir is an inhibitor of CYP3A, CYP2C8, CYP2B6, BCRP, UGT1A1, OATP2B1, and \nOAT3 at in vivo relevant concentrations. In vivo studies are available investigating the net effect on \nCYP3A4, P-gp, OATP1B1/3 additionally on CYP2C19. The net effect in vivo on the other listed\nenzymes and transporters is not known. Detailed information is presented below.\nIt is unknown whether letermovir may affect the exposure of piperacillin/tazobactam, amphotericine B\nand micafungin. The potential interaction between letermovir and these medicinal products have not \nbeen investigated. There is a theoretical risk of reduced exposure due to induction but the size of the \neffect and thus clinical relevance is presently unknown.\n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP3A\nLetermovir is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A in vivo. Co-administration of PREVYMIS with oral \nmidazolam (a CYP3A substrate) results in 2-3-fold increased midazolam plasma concentrations. Co-\nadministration of PREVYMIS may result in clinically relevant increases in the plasma concentrations \nof co-administered CYP3A substrates (see sections 4.3, 4.4, and 5.2). \n-Examples of such medicinal products include certain immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine, \ntacrolimus, sirolimus), HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and amiodarone (see Table 1). Pimozide and \nergot alkaloids are contraindicated (see section 4.3).\nThe size of the CYP3A inhibitory effect is dependent on letermovir route of administration and\nwhether cyclosporine is concomitantly used.\nDue to time dependent inhibition and simultaneous induction the net enzyme inhibitory effect may not \nbe reached until after 10-14 days. The time needed to reach steady state of a specific affected \nmedicinal product will also influence the time needed to reach full effect on the plasma concentrations.\nWhen ending treatment, it takes 10-14 days for the inhibitory effect to disappear. If monitoring is \napplied, this is recommended the first 2 weeks after initiating and ending letermovir (see section 4.4) \nas well as after changing route of letermovir administration.\n\n \n\n\n\n34\n\nMedicinal products transported by OATP1B1/3\nLetermovir is an inhibitor of OATP1B1/3 transporters. Administration of PREVYMIS may result in a \nclinically relevant increase in plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products that are \nOATP1B1/3 substrates. \n-Examples of such medicinal products include HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, fexofenadine, \nrepaglinide and glyburide (see Table 1). Comparing letermovir regimen administered without \ncyclosporine, the effect is more marked after iv than oral letermovir. \nThe magnitude of the OATP1B1/3 inhibition on co-administered medicinal products is likely greater \nwhen PREVYMIS is co-administered with cyclosporine (a potent OATP1B1/3 inhibitor). This needs \nto be considered when the letermovir regimen is changed during treatment with an OATP1B1/3 \nsubstrate.\n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2C9 and/or CYP2C19\nCo-administration of PREVYMIS with voriconazole (a CYP2C19 substrate) results in significantly \ndecreased voriconazole plasma concentrations, indicating that letermovir is an inducer of CYP2C19. \nCYP2C9 is likely also induced. Letermovir has the potential to decrease the exposure of CYP2C9 \nand/or CYP2C19 substrates potentially resulting in subtherapeutic levels. \n-Examples of such medicinal products include warfarin, voriconazole, diazepam, lansoprazole, \nomeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, tilidine, tolbutamide (see Table 1).\nThe effect is expected to be less pronounced for oral letermovir without cyclosporine, than IV\nletermovir with or without cyclosporine, or oral letermovir with cyclosporine. This needs to be \nconsidered when the letermovir regimen is changed during treatment with a CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 \nsubstrate. See also general information on induction above regarding time courses of the interaction.\n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2C8\nLetermovir inhibits CYP2C8 in vitro but may also induce CYP2C8 based on its induction potential. \nThe net effect in vivo is unknown. \n-An example of a medicinal product which is mainly eliminated by CYP2C8 is repaglinide (see Table \n1). Concomitant use of repaglinide and letermovir with or without cyclosporine is not recommended.\n\nMedicinal products transported by P-gp in the intestine\nLetermovir is an inducer of intestinal P-gp. Administration of PREVYMIS may result in a clinically \nrelevant decrease in plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products that are significantly\ntransported by P-gp in the intestine such as dabigatran and sofosbuvir.\n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6, UGT1A1 or transported by BCRP or OATP2B1 \nLetermovir is a general inducer in vivo but has also been observed to inhibit CYP2B6, UGT1A1, \nBCRP, and OATP2B1 in vitro. The net effect in vivo is unknown. Therefore, the plasma \nconcentrations of medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes or transporters may increase \nor decrease when co-administered with letermovir. Additional monitoring may be recommended; refer \nto the prescribing information for such medicinal products.\n-Examples of medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP2B6 include bupropion.\n-Examples of medicinal products metabolised by UGT1A1 are raltegravir and dolutegravir.\n-Examples of medicinal products transported by BCRP include rosuvastatin and sulfasalazine.\n-An example of medicinal product transported by OATP2B1 is celiprolol.\n\nMedicinal products transported by the renal transporter OAT3\nIn vitro data indicate that letermovir is an inhibitor of OAT3; therefore, letermovir may be an OAT3 \ninhibitor in vivo. Plasma concentrations of medicinal products transported by OAT3 may be increased.\n-Examples of medicinal products transported by OAT3 includes ciprofloxacin, tenofovir, imipenem, \nand cilastin.\n\nGeneral information\nIf dose adjustments of concomitant medicinal products are made due to treatment with PREVYMIS, \ndoses should be readjusted after treatment with PREVYMIS is completed. A dose adjustment may also \nbe needed when changing route of administration or immunosuppressant.\n\n \n\n\n\n35\n\nTable 1 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant medicinal product \ninteractions. The medicinal product interactions described are based on studies conducted with \nPREVYMIS or are predicted medicinal product interactions that may occur with PREVYMIS (see \nsections 4.3, 4.4, 5.1, and 5.2). \n\nTable 1: Interactions and dose recommendations with other medicinal products. Note that the \ntable is not extensive but provides examples of clinically relevant interactions. See also the \ngeneral text on DDIs above.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, interaction studies have been performed with oral letermovir without\ncyclosporine. Please note that the interaction potential and clinical consequences may be \ndifferent depending on whether letermovir is administered orally or IV, and whether\ncyclosporine is concomitantly used. When changing the route of administration, or if changing \nimmunosuppressant, the recommendation concerning co-administration should be revisited. \n\nConcomitant \nmedicinal product \n\nEffect on

Fatigue and vertigo \nhave been reported in some patients during treatment with PREVYMIS, which may influence a \npatient’s ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8). \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe safety assessment of PREVYMIS was based on a Phase 3 clinical trial (P001) in HSCT recipients \nwho received PREVYMIS or placebo through Week 14 post-transplant and were followed for safety \nthrough Week 24 post-transplant (see section 5.1).\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions occurring in at least 1% of subjects in the PREVYMIS\ngroup and at a frequency greater than placebo were: nausea (7.2%), diarrhoea (2.4%), and vomiting \n(1.9%).\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of PREVYMIS were nausea \n(1.6%), vomiting (0.8%), and abdominal pain (0.5%).\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\nThe following adverse reactions were identified in patients taking PREVYMIS in clinical trials. The \nadverse reactions are listed below by body system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined \nas follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), \nrare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) or very rare (< 1/10,000).\n\n \n\n\n\n45\n\nTable 2: Adverse reactions identified with PREVYMIS\nFrequency Adverse reactions\nImmune system disorders\nUncommon hypersensitivity\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\nUncommon decreased appetite\nNervous system disorders\nUncommon dysgeusia, headache\nEar and labyrinth disorders\nUncommon vertigo\nGastrointestinal disorders\nCommon nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting\nUncommon abdominal pain\nHepatobiliary disorders\nUncommon alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate \n\naminotransferase increased\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nUncommon muscle spasms\nRenal and urinary disorders\nUncommon blood creatinine increased\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nUncommon fatigue, oedema peripheral\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no experience with human overdose with PREVYMIS. During Phase 1 clinical trials, 86 \nhealthy subjects received doses ranging from 720 mg/day to 1440 mg/day of PREVYMIS for up to 14 \ndays. The adverse reaction profile was similar to that of the clinical dose of 480 mg/day. There is no \nspecific antidote for overdose with PREVYMIS. In case of overdose, it is recommended that the \npatient be monitored for adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.\n\nIt is unknown whether dialysis will result in meaningful removal of PREVYMIS from systemic \ncirculation.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, direct acting antivirals, ATC code: J05AX18\n\nMechanism of action\nLetermovir inhibits the CMV DNA terminase complex which is required for cleavage and packaging \nof viral progeny DNA. Letermovir affects the formation of proper unit length genomes and interferes \nwith virion maturation.\n\nAntiviral activity\nThe median EC50 value of letermovir against a collection of clinical CMV isolates in a cell-culture \nmodel of infection was 2.1 nM (range = 0.7 nM to 6.1 nM, n=74). \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n46\n\nViral resistance\n\nIn cell culture\nThe CMV genes UL51, UL56, and UL89 encode subunits of CMV DNA terminase. CMV mutants \nwith reduced susceptibility to letermovir have been confirmed in cell culture. EC50 values for \nrecombinant CMV mutants expressing the substitutions map to pUL51 (P91S), pUL56 (C25F, S229F, \nV231A, V231L, V236A, T244K, T244R, L254F, L257F, L257I, F261C, F261L, F261S, Y321C, \nL328V, M329T, A365S, N368D), and pUL89 (N320H, D344E) were 1.6- to <10-fold higher than \nthose for wild-type reference virus; these substitutions are not likely to be clinically relevant. EC50\n\nvalues for recombinant CMV mutants expressing pUL56 substitutions N232Y, V236L, V236M, \nE237D, E237G, L241P, K258E, C325F, C325R, C325W, C325Y, R369G, R369M, R369S and R369T \nwere 10- to 9,300-fold higher than those for the wild-type reference virus; some of these substitutions \nhave been observed in patients who have experienced prophylaxis failure in clinical studies (see \nbelow). \n\nIn clinical studies\nIn a Phase 2b trial evaluating letermovir doses of 60, 120, or 240 mg/day or placebo for up to 84 days \nin 131 HSCT recipients, DNA sequence analysis of a select region of UL56 (amino acids 231 to 369) \nwas performed on samples obtained from 12 letermovir-treated subjects who experienced prophylaxis \nfailure and for whom samples were available for analysis. One subject (who received 60 mg/day) had a \nletermovir resistant genotypic variant (GV) (V236M).\n\nIn a Phase 3 trial (P001), DNA sequence analysis of the entire coding regions of UL56 and UL89 was \nperformed on samples obtained from 40 letermovir-treated subjects in the FAS population who \nexperienced prophylaxis failure and for whom samples were available for analysis. Two subjects had \nletermovir-resistant GVs detected, both with substitutions mapping to pUL56. One subject had the \nsubstitution V236M and the other subject had the substitution E237G. One additional subject, who had \ndetectable CMV DNA at baseline (and was therefore not in the FAS population), had pUL56 \nsubstitutions, C325W and R369T, detected after discontinuing letermovir.\n\nCross-resistance\nCross-resistance is not likely with medicinal products with a different mechanism of action. \nLetermovir is fully active against viral populations with substitutions conferring resistance to CMV \nDNA polymerase inhibitors (ganciclovir, cidofovir, and foscarnet). A panel of recombinant CMV \nstrains with substitutions conferring resistance to letermovir was fully susceptible to cidofovir, \nfoscarnet and ganciclovir with the exception of a recombinant strain with the pUL56 E237G \nsubstitution which confers a 2.1-fold reduction in ganciclovir susceptibility relative to wild-type.\n\nCardiac electrophysiology\nThe effect of letermovir on doses up to 960 mg given IV on the QTc interval was evaluated in a \nrandomised, single-dose, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg oral) 4-period \ncrossover thorough QT trial in 38 healthy subjects. Letermovir does not prolong QTc to any clinically \nrelevant extent following the 960 mg IV dose with plasma concentrations approximately 2-fold higher \nthan the 480 mg IV dose.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nAdult CMV-seropositive recipients [R+] of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant\nTo evaluate letermovir prophylaxis as a preventive strategy for CMV infection or disease, the efficacy \nof letermovir was assessed in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial (P001) in \nadult CMV-seropositive recipients [R+] of an allogeneic HSCT. Subjects were randomised (2:1) to \nreceive either letermovir at a dose of 480 mg once daily adjusted to 240 mg when co-administered \nwith cyclosporine, or placebo. Randomisation was stratified by investigational site and risk (high vs. \nlow) for CMV reactivation at the time of study entry. Letermovir was initiated after HSCT (Day 0-28 \npost-transplant) and continued through Week 14 post-transplant. Letermovir was administered either \norally or IV; the dose of letermovir was the same regardless of the route of administration. Subjects \n\n \n\n\n\n47\n\nwere monitored through Week 24 post-transplant for the primary efficacy endpoint with continued \nfollow-up through Week 48 post-transplant. \n\nSubjects received CMV DNA monitoring weekly until post-transplant week 14 and then bi-weekly \nuntil post-transplant week 24, with initiation of standard-of-care CMV pre-emptive therapy if CMV \nDNAemia was considered clinically significant. Subjects had continued follow-up through Week 48 \npost-transplant. \n\nAmong the 565 treated subjects, 373 subjects received letermovir (including 99 subjects who received \nat least one IV dose) and 192 received placebo (including 48 subjects who received at least one IV \ndose). The median time to starting letermovir was 9 days after transplantation. Thirty-seven percent \n(37%) of subjects were engrafted at baseline. The median age was 54 years (range: 18 to 78 years); 56 \n(15.0%) subjects were 65 years of age or older: 58% were male; 82% were White; 10% were Asian; \n2% were Black or African; and 7% were Hispanic or Latino. At baseline, 50% of subjects received a \nmyeloablative regimen, 52% were receiving cyclosporine, and 42% were receiving tacrolimus. The \nmost common primary reasons for transplant were acute myeloid leukemia (38%), myeloblastic \nsyndrome (15%), and lymphoma (13%). Twelve percent (12%) of subjects were positive for CMV \nDNA at baseline.\n\nAt baseline, 31% of subjects were at high risk for reactivation as defined by one or more of the \nfollowing criteria: Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-related (sibling) donor with at least one \nmismatch at one of the following three HLA-gene loci: HLA-A, -B or –DR, haploidentical donor; \nunrelated donor with at least one mismatch at one of the following four HLA-gene loci: HLA-A, -B, -\nC and -DRB1; use of umbilical cord blood as stem cell source; use of ex vivo T-cell-depleted grafts; \nGrade 2 or greater Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD), requiring systemic corticosteroids.\n\nPrimary efficacy endpoint\nThe primary efficacy endpoint of clinically significant CMV infection in P001 was defined by the \nincidence of CMV DNAemia warranting anti-CMV pre-emptive therapy (PET) or the occurrence of \nCMV end-organ disease. The Non-Completer=Failure (NC=F) approach was used, where subjects \nwho discontinued from the study prior to Week 24 post-transplant or had a missing outcome at Week \n24 post-transplant were counted as failures.\nLetermovir demonstrated superior efficacy over placebo in the analysis of the primary endpoint, as \nshown in Table 3. The estimated treatment difference of -23.5% was statistically significant (one-sided \np-value <0.0001).\n\n \n\n\n\n48\n\nTable 3: P001: Efficacy results in HSCT recipients (NC=F Approach, FAS Population)\n\nLetermovir Placebo \n(N=325) (N=170) \n\nParameter       n (%) n (%) \nPrimary efficacy endpoint\n(Proportion of subjects who failed prophylaxis by \nWeek 24)                 \n\n122 (37.5)                                        103 (60.6)                              \n\nReasons for Failures†                                                  \n                                                                                          \n\nClinically significant CMV infection                      57 (17.5)                                              71 (41.8)                                    \n     CMV DNAemia warranting anti-CMV PET    52 (16.0)                                                 68 (40.0)                                    \n    CMV end-organ disease                                                                5 (1.5)                                          3 (1.8)                                      \nDiscontinued from study                                    56 (17.2)                                              27 (15.9)                                    \nMissing outcome                                         9 (2.8)                                                  5 (2.9)                             \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \nStratum-adjusted treatment difference (Letermovir-\nPlacebo)§            \n\n                                                                                          \n\nDifference (95% CI)                                                             -23.5 (-32.5, -14.6)                                                                                \np-value                                                                         <0.0001                                                                                             \n† The categories of failure are mutually exclusive and based on the hierarchy of categories in the order \nlisted.\n§ 95% CIs and p-value for the treatment differences in percent response were calculated using stratum-\nadjusted Mantel-Haenszel method with the difference weighted by the harmonic mean of sample size \nper arm for each stratum (high or low risk). A 1-sided p-value ≤0.0249 was used for declaring \nstatistical significance.\nFAS=Full analysis set; FAS includes randomised subjects who received at least one dose of study \nmedicine, and excludes subjects with detectable CMV DNA at baseline. Approach to handling missing \nvalues: Non-Completer=Failure (NC=F) approach.

Letermovir exposure increased in a greater than dose-\nproportional manner with both oral or IV administration. The mechanism is likely \nsaturation/autoinhibition of OATP1B1/3.\n\nIn healthy subjects, the geometric mean steady-state AUC and Cmax values were 71,500 ng•hr/mL and \n13,000 ng/mL, respectively, with 480 mg once daily oral letermovir.\n\nLetermovir reached steady-state in 9 to 10 days with an accumulation ratio of 1.2 for AUC and 1.0 for \nCmax.\n\nIn HSCT recipients, letermovir AUC was estimated using population pharmacokinetic analyses using \nPhase 3 data (see Table 4). Differences in exposure across treatment regimens are not clinically \nrelevant; efficacy was consistent across the range of exposures observed in P001.\n\n-70 -60 -50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20\n\nLetermovir - Placebo Difference (%) and 95% C.I.\nFavors Letermovir\n\nTacrolimus (n=145, 69)\n\nFavors Placebo\n\nReduced intensity conditioning (n=86, 48)\n\nCyclosporin A (n=162, 90)\n\nHaploidentical donor\n\nNon-myeloablative (n=85, 37)\n\nImmunosuppressive Regimen\n\nConditioning Regimen\nMyeloablative (n=154, 85)\n\nNo (n=276, 153)\nYes (n=49, 17)\n\nMismatched unrelated (n=43, 24)\n\nMismatched related (n=52, 18)\nMatched unrelated (n=122, 70)\n\nMatched related (n=108, 58)\nDonor mismatch\n\nBone marrow (n=72, 43)\nPeripheral blood (n=241, 117)\n\nStem Cell Source\n\nHigh Risk (n=102, 45)\nLow Risk (n=223, 125)\n\nRisk stratum\n\nOverall  (N=325, 170)\n\n \n\n\n\n51\n\nTable 4: Letermovir AUC (ng•hr/mL) values in HSCT Recipients\nTreatment Regimen Median (90% Prediction Interval)*\n\n480 mg Oral, no cyclosporine 34,400 (16,900, 73,700)\n\n480 mg IV, no cyclosporine 100,000 (65,300, 148,000)\n\n240 mg Oral, with cyclosporine 60,800 (28,700, 122,000)\n\n240 mg IV, with cyclosporine 70,300 (46,200, 106,000)\n\n* Population post-hoc predictions from the population PK analysis using Phase 3 data\n\nAbsorption\nLetermovir was absorbed rapidly with a median time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of 1.5\nto 3.0 hours and declined in a biphasic manner. In HSCT recipients, bioavailability of letermovir was \nestimated to be approximately 35% with 480 mg once daily oral letermovir administered without \ncyclosporine. The inter-individual variability for bioavailability was estimated to be approximately \n37%. \n\nEffect of cyclosporine\nIn HSCT recipients, co-administration of cyclosporine increased plasma concentrations of letermovir \ndue to inhibition of OATP1B. Bioavailability of letermovir was estimated to be approximately 85% \nwith 240 mg once daily oral letermovir co-administered with cyclosporine in patients.\nIf letermovir is co-administered with cyclosporine, the recommended dose of letermovir is 240 mg \nonce daily (see section 4.2).\n\nEffect of food\nIn healthy subjects, oral administration of 480 mg single dose of letermovir with a standard high fat \nand high calorie meal did not have any effect on the overall exposure (AUC) and resulted in \napproximately 30% increase in peak levels (Cmax) of letermovir. Letermovir may be administered \norally with or without food as has been done in the clinical studies (see section 4.2).\n\nDistribution\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analyses, the mean steady-state volume of distribution is \nestimated to be 45.5 L following intravenous administration in HSCT recipients.\nLetermovir is extensively bound (98.2%) to human plasma proteins, independent of the concentration \nrange (3 to 100 mg/L) evaluated, in vitro. Some saturation was observed at lower concentrations. \nBlood to plasma partitioning of letermovir is 0.56 and independent of the concentration range (0.1 to \n10 mg/L) evaluated in vitro.\nIn preclinical distribution studies, letermovir is distributed to organs and tissues with the highest \nconcentrations observed in the gastrointestinal tract, bile duct and liver and low concentrations in the \nbrain.\n\nBiotransformation\nThe majority of letermovir-related components in plasma is unchanged parent (96.6%). No major \nmetabolites are detected in plasma. Letermovir is partly eliminated by glucuronidation mediated by \nUGT1A1/1A3. \n\nElimination\nThe mean apparent terminal half-life for letermovir is approximately 12 hours with 480 mg IV \nletermovir in healthy subjects. The major elimination pathways of letermovir is biliary excretion as \nwell as direct glucuronidation. The process involves the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and 3 \nfollowed by UGT1A1/3 catalysed glucuronidation.\n\n \n\n\n\n52\n\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analyses, letermovir steady-state apparent CL is estimated to be \n4.84 L/hr following intravenous administration of 480 mg in HSCT recipients. The inter-individual \nvariability for CL is estimated to be 24.6%.\n\nExcretion\nAfter oral administration of radio-labeled letermovir, 93.3% of radioactivity was recovered in faeces. \nThe majority of letermovir was biliary excreted as unchanged parent with a minor amount (6% of \ndose) as an acyl-glucuronide metabolite in faeces. The acyl-glucuronide is unstable in faeces. Urinary \nexcretion of letermovir was negligible (<2% of dose).\n\nPharmacokinetics in special populations\n\nHepatic impairment\nLetermovir unbound AUC was approximately 81%- and 4-fold higher in subjects with moderate \n(Child-Pugh Class B [CP-B], score of 7-9) and severe (Child-Pugh Class C [CP-C], score of 10-15) \nhepatic impairment, respectively, compared to healthy subjects. The changes in letermovir exposure in \nsubjects with moderate hepatic impairment are not clinically relevant.\n\nMarked increases in letermovir unbound exposure are anticipated in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment combined with moderate or severe renal impairment (see section 4.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nLetermovir unbound AUC was approximately 115- and 81% higher in subjects with moderate (eGFR \nof 31.0 to 56.8 mL/min/1.73m2) and severe (eGFR of 11.9 to 28.1 mL/min/1.73m2) renal impairment, \nrespectively, compared to healthy subjects. The changes in letermovir exposure due to moderate or \nsevere renal impairment are not considered to be clinically relevant. Subjects with ESRD have not \nbeen studied.\n\nWeight\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analyses, letermovir AUC is estimated to be 18.7% lower in \nsubjects weighing 80-100 kg compared to subjects weighing 67 kg. This difference is not clinically \nrelevant.\n\nRace\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analyses, letermovir AUC is estimated to be 33.2% higher in \nAsians compared to Whites. This change is not clinically relevant.\n\nGender\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analyses, there is no difference in letermovir pharmacokinetics \nin females compared to males.\n\nElderly\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analyses, there is no effect of age on letermovir \npharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required based on age.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nGeneral toxicity\nIrreversible testicular toxicity was noted only in rats at systemic exposures (AUC) ≥3-fold the \nexposures in humans at the recommended human dose (RHD). This toxicity was characterized by \nseminiferous tubular degeneration, and oligospermia and cell debris in the epididymides, with \ndecreased testicular and epididymides weights. There was no testicular toxicity in rats at exposures \n(AUC) similar to the exposures in humans at the RHD. Testicular toxicity was not observed in mice \nand monkeys at the highest doses tested at exposures up to 4-fold and 2-fold, respectively, the \nexposures in humans at the RHD. The relevance to humans is unknown. \n\n \n\n\n\n53\n\nIt is known that hydroxypropylbetadex can cause kidney vacuolation in rats when given intravenously \nat doses greater than 50 mg/kg/day. Vacuolation was noted in the kidneys of rats administered IV \nletermovir formulated with 1500 mg/kg/day of the cyclodextrin excipient hydroxypropylbetadex. \n\nCarcinogenesis\nCarcinogenicity studies with letermovir have not been conducted.\n\nMutagenesis\nLetermovir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including microbial \nmutagenesis assays, chromosomal aberration in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells, and in an in vivo mouse \nmicronucleus study.\n\nReproduction\nFertility\nIn the fertility and early embryonic development studies in the rat, there were no effects of letermovir \non female fertility. In male rats, reduced sperm concentration, reduced sperm motility, and decreased \nfertility were observed at systemic exposures ≥ 3-fold the AUC in humans at the RHD (see General \ntoxicity).\n\nIn monkeys administered letermovir, there was no evidence of testicular toxicity based on \nhistopathologic evaluation, measurement of testicular size, blood hormone analysis (follicle \nstimulating hormone, inhibin B and testosterone) and sperm evaluation (sperm count, motility and \nmorphology) at systemic exposures approximately 2-fold the AUC in humans at the RHD.\n\nDevelopment\nIn rats, maternal toxicity (including decrease in body weight gain) was noted at 250 mg/kg/day \n(approximately 11-fold the AUC at the RHD); in the offspring, decreased foetal weight with delayed \nossification, slightly oedematous foetuses, and increased incidence of shortened umbilical cords and of \nvariations and malformations in the vertebrae, ribs, and pelvis were observed. No maternal or \ndevelopmental effects were noted at the dose of 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.5-fold the AUC at the \nRHD).\nIn rabbits, maternal toxicity (including mortality and abortions) was noted at 225 mg/kg/day \n(approximately 2-fold the AUC at the RHD); in the offspring, an increased incidence of malformations \nand variations in the vertebrae and ribs were observed. \nIn the pre- and post-natal developmental study, letermovir was administered orally to pregnant rats. \nThere was no developmental toxicity observed up to the highest exposure tested (2-fold the AUC at \nthe RHD).\n\n6.

What PREVYMIS is and what it is used for\n\nPREVYMIS is an antiviral prescription medicine that contains the active substance letermovir.\n\nPREVYMIS is a medicine for adults who have recently had a bone marrow transplant. The medicine \nhelps stop you from getting ill from CMV (‘cytomegalovirus’).\n\nCMV is a virus that a lot of people have without knowing. Normally, CMV just stays in their body and \nit does not hurt them. However, if your immune system is weak after you get a bone marrow \ntransplant, you may be at high risk of becoming ill from CMV.\n\n2. What you need to know before you are given PREVYMIS\n\nYou should not be given PREVYMIS if:\n you are allergic to letermovir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).\n you take either of these medicines:\n\no pimozide - used for Tourette’s syndrome\no ergot alkaloids (such as ergotamine and dihydroergotamine) - used for migraine \n\nheadaches.\n you take the following herbal product:\n\no St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)\nYou should not be given PREVYMIS if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given PREVYMIS.\n\nIf you are taking PREVYMIS with cyclosporine, do not take the following medicines: \no dabigatran - used for blood clots\no atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pitavastatin –for high cholesterol\n\n \n\n\n\n81\n\nWarnings and precautions \nIf you are also taking a medicine for high cholesterol (see list of medicines in section “Other medicines \nand PREVYMIS” below) you must tell your doctor immediately if you have unexplained muscle aches \nor pains especially if you feel unwell or have a fever. Your medicine or dose may then need to be \nchanged. See the package leaflet for your other medicine for further information.\n\nAdditional blood tests may be needed to monitor the following medicinal products:\n Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus\n Voriconazole\n\nChildren and adolescents\nPREVYMIS is not for use in children and adolescents under 18 years old. This is because PREVYMIS\nhas not been tested in this age group.\n\nOther medicines and PREVYMIS\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines. This is because PREVYMIS may affect the way other medicines work, and other \nmedicines may affect how PREVYMIS works. Your doctor or pharmacist will tell you if it is safe to \ntake PREVYMIS with other medicines.\n\nThere are some medicines you must not take with PREVYMIS. See list under “Do not take\nPREVYMIS if you take either of these medicines.”\n\nAlso tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines. This is because your doctor may \nhave to change your medicines or change the dose of your medicines:\n alfentanil - for severe pain\n fentanyl - for severe pain\n quinidine - for abnormal heart rhythms\n cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus - used to prevent transplant rejection\n voriconazole - for fungal infections\n statins, such as atorvastatin, fluvastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, pitavastatin - for \n\nhigh cholesterol\n glyburide, repaglinide - for high blood sugar\n carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin - for fits or seizures\n dabigatran, warfarin - used to thin the blood or for blood clots\n midazolam – used as a sedative  \n amiodarone - used to correct irregular heartbeats\n oral contraceptive steroids-for birth control\n omeprazole, pantoprazole – for stomach ulcers and other stomach\n\nproblems\n nafcillin - for bacterial infections\n rifabutin, rifampicin - for mycobacterial infections\n thioridazine - for psychiatric disorders\n bosentan - for high blood pressure in the vessels in the lungs\n efavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine, lopinavir, ritonavir - for HIV\n modafinil - for wakefulness\n\nYou can ask your doctor or pharmacist for a list of medicines that may interact with PREVYMIS.\n\nPregnancy\nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice before taking this medicine. PREVYMIS is not recommended in pregnancy.
