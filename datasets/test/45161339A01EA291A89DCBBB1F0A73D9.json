CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1  Therapeutic indications  \n \nDuoPlavin is indicated for the secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients \nalready taking both clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). DuoPlavin is a fixed-dose combination \nmedicinal product for continuation of therapy in:  \n \n\u2022 Non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave \n\nmyocardial infarction) including patients undergoing a stent placement following percutaneous \ncoronary intervention \n\n\u2022 ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction in medically treated patients eligible for \nthrombolytic therapy \n\n \nFor further information please refer to section 5.1. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nAdults and elderly \n \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nDuoPlavin 75 mg/75 mg film-coated tablets  \nDuoPlavin should be given as a single daily 75 mg/75 mg dose.  \n \nDuoPlavin 75 mg/100 mg film-coated tablets  \nDuoPlavin should be given as a single daily 75 mg/100 mg dose.  \n \nDuoPlavin fixed-dose combination is used following initiation of therapy with clopidogrel and ASA \ngiven separately, and replaces the individual clopidogrel and ASA products.  \n\u2212 In patients with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or \n\nnon-Q-wave myocardial infarction): The optimal duration of treatment has not been formally \nestablished. Clinical trial data support use up to 12 months, and the maximum benefit was seen at \n3 months (see section 5.1). If the use of DuoPlavin is discontinued, patients may benefit with \ncontinuation of one antiplatelet medicinal product. \n\n \n\u2212 In patients with ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction: Therapy should be started as \n\nearly as possible after symptoms start and continued for at least four weeks. The benefit of the \ncombination of clopidogrel with ASA beyond four weeks has not been studied in this setting (see \nsection 5.1). If the use of DuoPlavin is discontinued, patients may benefit with continuation of one \nantiplatelet medicinal product.  \n\n \nIf a dose is missed: \n- Within less than 12 hours after regular scheduled time: patients should take the dose \n\nimmediately and then take the next dose at the regular scheduled time. \n- For more than 12 hours: patients should take the next dose at the regular scheduled time and \n\nshould not double the dose. \n \n\nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of DuoPlavin in children and adolescents under 18 years old have not been \nestablished. DuoPlavin is not recommended in this population. \n \nRenal impairment  \nDuoPlavin must not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.3). Therapeutic \nexperience is limited in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see section 4.4). Therefore \nDuoPlavin should be used with caution in these patients. \n \nHepatic impairment \nDuoPlavin must not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). Therapeutic \nexperience is limited in patients with moderate hepatic disease who may have bleeding diatheses (see \nsection 4.4). Therefore DuoPlavin should be used with caution in these patients. \n\n \nMethod of administration \nFor oral use.  \nIt may be given with or without food.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nDue to the presence of both components of the medicinal product, DuoPlavin is contraindicated in case \nof: \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n\u2022 Severe hepatic impairment.  \n\u2022 Active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial haemorrhage.  \n \nIn addition, due to the presence of ASA, its use is also contraindicated in: \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and syndrome of asthma, \n\nrhinitis, and nasal polyps. Patients with pre-existing mastocytosis, in whom the use of \nacetylsalicylic acid may induce severe hypersensitivity reactions (including circulatory shock \nwith flushing, hypotension, tachycardia and vomiting). \n\n\n\n 4 \n\n\u2022 Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min). \n\u2022 Third trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nBleeding and haematological disorders \nDue to the risk of bleeding and haematological adverse reactions, blood cell count determination \nand/or other appropriate testing should be promptly considered whenever clinical symptoms \nsuggestive of bleeding arise during the course of treatment (see section 4.8). As a dual antiplatelet \nagent, DuoPlavin should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding \nfrom trauma, surgery or other pathological conditions and in patients receiving treatment with other \nNSAIDs including Cox-2 inhibitors, heparin, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, selective serotonin \nreuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), CYP2C19 strong inducers, thrombolytics, or other medicinal products \nassociated with bleeding risk such as pentoxifylline (see section 4.5). Patients should be followed \ncarefully for any signs of bleeding including occult bleeding, especially during the first weeks of \ntreatment and/or after invasive cardiac procedures or surgery. The concomitant administration of \nDuoPlavin with oral anticoagulants is not recommended since it may increase the intensity of bleeding \n(see section 4.5).  \n \nPatients should inform physicians and dentists that they are taking DuoPlavin before any surgery is \nscheduled and before any new medicinal product is taken. Where elective surgery is being considered, \nthe need for dual antiplatelet therapy should be reviewed and consideration given to the use of a single \nantiplatelet agent. If patients must temporarily stop antiplatelet therapy, DuoPlavin should be \ndiscontinued 7 days prior to surgery. \n \nDuoPlavin prolongs bleeding time and should be used with caution in patients who have lesions with a \npropensity to bleed (particularly gastrointestinal and intraocular).  \n \nPatients should also be told that it might take longer than usual to stop bleeding when they take \nDuoPlavin, and that they should report any unusual bleeding (site or duration) to their physician. \n \nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) \nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been reported very rarely following the use of \nclopidogrel, sometimes after a short exposure. It is characterised by thrombocytopenia and \nmicroangiopathic haemolytic anaemia associated with either neurological findings, renal dysfunction \nor fever. TTP is a potentially fatal condition requiring prompt treatment including plasmapheresis. \n \nAcquired haemophilia \nAcquired haemophilia has been reported following use of clopidogrel. In cases of confirmed isolated \nactivated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) prolongation with or without bleeding, acquired \nhaemophilia should be considered. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of acquired haemophilia should \nbe managed and treated by specialists, and clopidogrel should be discontinued. \n \nRecent transient ischaemic attack or stroke \nIn patients with recent transient ischaemic attack or stroke who are at high risk of recurrent ischaemic \nevents, the combination of ASA and clopidogrel has been shown to increase major bleeding. \nTherefore, such addition should be undertaken with caution outside of clinical situations where the \ncombination has proven to be beneficial. \n \nCytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) \nPharmacogenetics: In patients who are poor CYP2C19 metabolisers, clopidogrel at recommended \ndoses forms less of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and has a smaller effect on platelet function. \nTests are available to identify a patient's CYP2C19 genotype.  \n \nSince clopidogrel is metabolised to its active metabolite partly by CYP2C19, use of medicinal products \nthat inhibit the activity of this enzyme would be expected to result in reduced drug levels of the active \nmetabolite of clopidogrel. The clinical relevance of this interaction is uncertain. As a precaution, \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nconcomitant use of strong or moderate CYP2C19 inhibitors should be discouraged (see section 4.5 for \na list of CYP2C19 inhibitors, see also section 5.2).  \n \nUse of medicinal products that induce the activity of CYP2C19 would be expected to result in \nincreased drug levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and might potentiate the bleeding risk. As \na precaution, concomitant use of strong CYP2C19 inducers should be discouraged (see section 4.5). \n \nCYP2C8 substrates \nCaution is required in patients treated concomitantly with clopidogrel and CYP2C8 substrate \nmedicinal products (see section 4.5).  \n \nCross-reactions among thienopyridines \nPatients should be evaluated for history of hypersensitivity to thienopyridines (such as clopidogrel, \nticlopidine, prasugrel) since cross-reactivity among thienopyridines has been reported (see section 4.8). \nThienopyridines may cause mild to severe allergic reactions such as rash, angioedema, or \nhaematological cross-reactions such as thrombocytopaenia and neutropaenia. Patients who had \ndeveloped a previous allergic reaction and/or haematological reaction to one thienopyridine may have \nan increased risk of developing the same or another reaction to another thienopyridine. Monitoring for \nsigns of hypersensitivity in patients with a known allergy to thienopyridines is advised. \n \nCaution required due to ASA \n\u2022 In patients with a history of asthma or allergic disorders since they are at increased risk of \n\nhypersensitivity reactions. \n\u2022 In patients with gout since low doses of ASA increase urate concentrations. \n\u2022 In children under 18 years of age, there is a possible association between ASA and Reye\u2019s \n\nsyndrome. Reye\u2019s syndrome is a very rare disease which can be fatal. \n\u2022 This medicinal product must be administered under close medical supervision in patients with \n\nglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency due to risk of haemolysis (see section \n4.8).  \n\n\u2022 Alcohol may increase the risk of gastrointestinal injury when taken with ASA. Patients should \nbe counseled about the risks of gastrointestinal injury and bleeding while taking clopidogrel plus \nASA with alcohol, especially if alcohol consumption is chronic or heavy. (See section 4.5.) \n\n \nGastrointestinal (GI) \nDuoPlavin should be used with caution in patients with a history of peptic ulcer or gastroduodenal \nhaemorrhage or minor upper GI symptoms as this may be due to gastric ulceration which may lead to \ngastric bleeding. GI undesirable effects including stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and GI \nbleeding may occur. Minor GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime \nduring therapy. Physicians should remain alert for signs of GI ulceration and bleeding, even in the \nabsence of previous GI symptoms. Patients should be told about the signs and symptoms of GI \nundesirable effects and what steps to take if they occur. (See section 4.8.) \n \nIn patients concomitantly receiving nicorandil and NSAIDs including ASA and LAS, there is an \nincreased risk for severe complications such as gastrointestinal ulceration, perforation and \nhaemorrhage (see section 4.5). \n \nExcipients \nDuoPlavin contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \nThis medicinal product also contains hydrogenated castor oil which may cause stomach upset and \ndiarrhoea. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nMedicinal products associated with bleeding risk  \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nThere is an increased risk of bleeding due to the potential additive effect. The concomitant \nadministration of medicinal products associated with bleeding risk should be undertaken with caution \n(see section 4.4).  \n \nOral anticoagulants  \nThe concomitant administration of DuoPlavin with oral anticoagulants is not recommended since it \nmay increase the intensity of bleeding (see section 4.4). Although the administration of clopidogrel \n75 mg/day did not modify the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin or International Normalised Ratio (INR) \nin patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy, coadministration of clopidogrel with warfarin \nincreases the risk of bleeding because of independent effects on hemostasis.  \n \nGlycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors \nDuoPlavin should be used with caution in patients who receive concomitant glycoprotein IIb/IIIa \ninhibitors (see section 4.4). \n \nHeparin \nIn a clinical study conducted in healthy subjects, clopidogrel did not necessitate modification of the \nheparin dose or alter the effect of heparin on coagulation. Co-administration of heparin had no effect \non the inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by clopidogrel. A pharmacodynamic interaction \nbetween DuoPlavin and heparin is possible, leading to increased risk of bleeding. Therefore, \nconcomitant use should be undertaken with caution (see section 4.4). \n \nThrombolytics \nThe safety of the concomitant administration of clopidogrel, fibrin or non-fibrin specific thrombolytic \nagents and heparins was assessed in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The incidence of \nclinically significant bleeding was similar to that observed when thrombolytic agents and heparin are \nco-administered with ASA (see section 4.8). The safety of the concomitant administration of \nDuoPlavin with other thrombolytic agents has not been formally established and should be undertaken \nwith caution (see section 4.4). \n \nNSAIDs \nIn a clinical study conducted in healthy volunteers, the concomitant administration of clopidogrel and \nnaproxen increased occult gastrointestinal blood loss. Consequently, the concomitant use of NSAIDs \nincluding Cox-2 inhibitors is not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nExperimental data suggest that ibuprofen may inhibit the effect of low dose aspirin on platelet \naggregation when they are dosed concomitantly. However, the limitations of these data and the \nuncertainties regarding extrapolation of ex vivo data to the clinical situation imply that no firm \nconclusions can be made for regular ibuprofen use, and no clinically relevant effect is considered to be \nlikely for occasional ibuprofen use (see section 5.1). \n \nMetamizole \nMetamizole may reduce the effect of ASA on platelet aggregation when taken concomitantly. \nTherefore, this combination should be used with caution in patients taking low dose ASA for \ncardioprotection . \n \nSSRIs \nSince SSRIs affect platelet activation and increase the risk of bleeding, the concomitant administration \nof SSRIs with clopidogrel should be undertaken with caution. \n \nOther concomitant therapy with clopidogrel \n \nInducers of CYP2C19 \nSince clopidogrel is metabolised to its active metabolite partly by CYP2C19, use of medicinal products \nthat induce the activity of this enzyme would be expected to result in increased drug levels of the \nactive metabolite of clopidogrel. \n \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nRifampicin strongly induces CYP2C19 resulting to both an increase level of clopidogrel active \nmetabolite and platelet inhibition, which in particular might potentiate the risk of bleeding. As a \nprecaution, concomitant use of strong CYP2C19 inducers should be discouraged (see section 4.4). \n \nInhibitors of CYP2C19 \nSince clopidogrel is metabolised to its active metabolite partly by CYP2C19, use of medicinal products \nthat inhibit the activity of this enzyme would be expected to result in reduced drug levels of the active \nmetabolite of clopidogrel. The clinical relevance of this interaction is uncertain. As a precaution \nconcomitant use of strong or moderate CYP2C19 inhibitors should be discouraged (see sections 4.4 \nand 5.2). \n \nMedicinal products that are strong or moderate CYP2C19 inhibitors include, for example, omeprazole \nand esomeprazole, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, moclobemide, voriconazole, fluconazole, ticlopidine, \ncarbamazepine, and efavirenz. \n \nProton Pump Inhibitors (PPI) \nOmeprazole 80 mg once daily administered either at the same time as clopidogrel or with 12 hours \nbetween the administrations of the two drugs decreased the exposure of the active metabolite by 45% \n(loading dose) and 40% (maintenance dose). The decrease was associated with a 39% (loading dose) \nand 21% (maintenance dose) reduction of inhibition of platelet aggregation. Esomeprazole is expected \nto give a similar interaction with clopidogrel.   \n \nInconsistent data on the clinical implications of this pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) \ninteraction in terms of major cardiovascular events have been reported from both observational and \nclinical studies. As a precaution, concomitant use of omeprazole or esomeprazole should be \ndiscouraged (see section 4.4). \n \nLess pronounced reductions of metabolite exposure has been observed with pantoprazole or \nlansoprazole. \nThe plasma concentrations of the active metabolite was 20% reduced (loading dose) and 14% reduced \n(maintenance dose) during concomitant treatment with pantoprazole 80 mg once daily. This was \nassociated with a reduction of the mean inhibition of platelet aggregation by 15% and 11%, \nrespectively. These results indicate that clopidogrel can be administered with pantoprazole. \n \nThere is no evidence that other medicinal products that reduce stomach acid such as H2 blockers or \nantacids interfere with antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel. \n \nBoosted anti-retroviral therapy (ART): HIV patients treated with boosted anti-retroviral therapies \n(ART) are at high risk of vascular events. \n \nA significantly reduced platelet inhibition has been shown in HIV patients treated with ritonavir-or \ncobicistat-boosted ART. Although the clinical relevance of these findings is uncertain, there have been \nspontaneous reports of HIV-infected patients treated with ritonavir boosted ART, who have \nexperienced re-occlusive events after de-obstruction or have suffered thrombotic events under a \nclopidogrel loading treatment schedule. Average platelet inhibition can be decreased with concomitant \nuse of clopidogrel and ritonavir. Therefore, concomitant use of clopidogrel with ART boosted \ntherapies should be discouraged. \n \nOther medicinal products \nA number of other clinical studies have been conducted with clopidogrel and other concomitant \nmedicinal products to investigate the potential for pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic (PK) \ninteractions. No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidogrel \nwas co-administered with atenolol, nifedipine, or both atenolol and nifedipine. Furthermore, the \npharmacodynamic activity of clopidogrel was not significantly influenced by the co-administration of \nphenobarbital or oestrogen. \n \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of digoxin or theophylline were not modified by the co-administration of \nclopidogrel. Antacids did not modify the extent of clopidogrel absorption. \n \nData from the CAPRIE study indicate that phenytoin and tolbutamide which are metabolised by \nCYP2C9 can be safely co-administered with clopidogrel. \n \nCYP2C8 substrate medicinal products: Clopidogrel has been shown to increase repaglinide exposure \nin healthy volunteers. In vitro studies have shown the increase in repaglinide exposure is due to \ninhibition of CYP2C8 by the glucuronide metabolite of clopidogrel. Due to the risk of increased \nplasma concentrations, concomitant administration of clopidogrel and drugs primarily cleared by \nCYP2C8 metabolism (e.g., repaglinide, paclitaxel) should be undertaken with caution (see section 4.4). \n \nOther concomitant therapy with ASA \nInteractions with the following medicinal products have been reported with ASA: \n \nUricosurics (benzbromarone, probenecid, sulfinpyrazone) \nCaution is required because ASA may inhibit the effect of uricosuric agents through competitive \nelimination of uric acid. \n \nMethotrexate \nDue to the presence of ASA, methotrexate used at doses higher than 20 mg/week should be used with \ncaution with DuoPlavin as it can inhibit renal clearance of methotrexate, which may lead to bone \nmarrow toxicity.  \n \nTenofovir \nConcomitant administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and NSAIDs may increase the risk of \nrenal failure. \n \nValproic acid \nThe concomitant administration of salicylates and valproic acid may result in decreased valproic acid \nprotein binding and inhibition of valproic acid metabolism resulting in increased serum levels of total \nand free valproic acid. \n \nVaricella vaccine \nIt is recommended that patients not be given salicylates for an interval of six weeks after receiving the \nvaricella vaccine. Cases of Reye\u2019s syndrome have occurred following the use of salicylates during \nvaricella infections (see section 4.4). \n \nAcetazolamide \nCaution is recommended when co-administering salicylates with acetazolamide as there is an increased \nrisk of metabolic acidosis. \n \nNicorandil \nIn patients concomitantly receiving nicorandil and NSAIDs including ASA and LAS, there is an \nincreased risk for severe complications such as gastrointestinal ulceration, perforation and \nhaemorrhage (see section 4.4). \n \nOther interactions with ASA \nInteractions with the following medicinal products with higher (anti-inflammatory) doses of ASA have \nalso been reported: angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, phenytoin, beta blockers, \ndiuretics, and oral hypoglycemic agents.  \n \nAlcohol \nAlcohol may increase the risk of gastrointestinal injury when taken with ASA. Patients should be \ncounseled about the risks of gastrointestinal injury and bleeding while taking clopidogrel plus ASA \nwith alcohol, especially if alcohol consumption is chronic or heavy. (See section 4.4.) \n \n\n\n\n 9 \n\nOther interactions with clopidogrel and ASA \nMore than 30,000 patients entered into clinical trials with clopidogrel plus ASA at maintenance doses \nlower than or equal to 325 mg, and received a variety of concomitant medicinal products including \ndiuretics, beta blockers, ACE Inhibitors, calcium antagonists, cholesterol lowering agents, coronary \nvasodilators, antidiabetic agents (including insulin), antiepileptic agents and GPIIb/IIIa antagonists \nwithout evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions. \n \nApart from the specific medicinal product interaction information described above, interaction studies \nwith DuoPlavin and some medicinal products commonly administered in patients with \natherothrombotic disease have not been performed. \n \nAs with other oral P2Y12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists has the potential to delay and \nreduce the absorption of clopidogrel presumably because of slowed gastric emptying. The clinical \nrelevance is unknown. Consider the use of a parenteral antiplatelet agent in acute coronary syndrome \npatients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists. \n \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nNo clinical data on exposure to DuoPlavin during pregnancy are available. DuoPlavin should not be \nused during the first two trimesters of pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires \ntreatment with clopidogrel/ASA.  \n \nDue to the presence of ASA, DuoPlavin is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy. \n \nClopidogrel: \nAs no clinical data on exposure to clopidogrel during pregnancy are available, it is preferable not to \nuse clopidogrel during pregnancy as a precautionary measure. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, \nembryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). \n \nASA: \nLow doses (up to 100 mg/day): \nClinical studies indicate that doses up to 100 mg/day for restricted obstetrical use, which require \nspecialised monitoring, appear safe. \n \nDoses of 100-500 mg/day:  \nThere is insufficient clinical experience regarding the use of doses above 100 mg/day up \nto 500 mg/day. Therefore, the recommendations below for doses of 500 mg/day and above apply also \nfor this dose range.  \n \nDoses of 500 mg/day and above:  \nInhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may adversely affect the pregnancy and/or the embryo/foetal \ndevelopment. Data from epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of miscarriage and of \ncardiac malformation and gastroschisis after use of a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor in early \npregnancy. The absolute risk for cardiovascular malformation was increased from less than 1%, up to \napproximately 1.5%. The risk is believed to increase with dose and duration of therapy. In animals, \nadministration of a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor has been shown to result in reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3). Until the 24th amenorrhea week (5th month of pregnancy), acetylsalicylic acid should \nnot be given unless clearly necessary. If acetylsalicylic acid is used by a woman attempting to \nconceive, or until the 24th amenorrhea week (5th month of pregnancy), the dose should be kept as low \nand duration of treatment as short as possible. \n \nFrom the beginning of the sixth month of pregnancy, all prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors may \nexpose: \n\n\n\n 10 \n\n\u2022 the foetus to: \n- cardiopulmonary toxicity (with premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and pulmonary \n\nhypertension);  \n- renal dysfunction, which may progress to renal failure with oligo-hydroamniosis;  \n\n \n\u2022 the mother and the neonate, at the end of pregnancy, to:  \n\n- possible prolongation of bleeding time, an anti-aggregating effect which may occur even at \nvery low doses;  \n\n- inhibition of uterine contractions resulting in delayed or prolonged labour.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether clopidogrel is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of clopidogrel in breast milk. ASA is known to be excreted in limited amounts in human \nmilk. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with DuoPlavin.  \n \nFertility  \nThere are no fertility data with DuoPlavin. Clopidogrel was not shown to alter fertility in animal \nstudies. It is unknown whether ASA dose in DuoPlavin alters fertility. \n \n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nDuoPlavin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8  Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nClopidogrel has been evaluated for safety in more than 42,000 patients who have participated in \nclinical studies, including over 30,000 patients treated with clopidogrel plus ASA, and over \n9,000 patients treated for 1 year or more. The clinically relevant adverse reactions observed in four \nmajor studies, the CAPRIE study (a study comparing clopidogrel alone to ASA) and the CURE, \nCLARITY and COMMIT studies (studies comparing clopidogrel plus ASA to ASA alone) are \ndiscussed below. Overall clopidogrel 75 mg/day was similar to ASA 325 mg/day in CAPRIE \nregardless of age, gender and race. In addition to clinical studies experience, adverse reactions have \nbeen spontaneously reported. \n \nBleeding is the most common reaction reported both in clinical studies as well as in the post-marketing \nexperience where it was mostly reported during the first month of treatment. \n \nIn CAPRIE, in patients treated with either clopidogrel or ASA, the overall incidence of any bleeding \nwas 9.3%. The incidence of severe cases was similar for clopidogrel and ASA. \n \nIn CURE there was no excess in major bleeds with clopidogrel plus ASA within 7 days after coronary \nbypass graft surgery in patients who stopped therapy more than five days prior to surgery. In patients \nwho remained on therapy within five days of bypass graft surgery, the event rate was 9.6% for \nclopidogrel plus ASA, and 6.3% for placebo plus ASA. \n \nIn CLARITY, there was an overall increase in bleeding in the clopidogrel plus ASA group vs. the \ngroup taking ASA alone. The incidence of major bleeding was similar between groups.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose  \n \nClopidogrel \nOverdose following clopidogrel administration may lead to prolonged bleeding time and subsequent \nbleeding complications. Appropriate therapy should be considered if bleedings are observed.  \nNo antidote to the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel has been found. If prompt correction of \nprolonged bleeding time is required, platelet transfusion may reverse the effects of clopidogrel. \n \nASA  \nThe following symptoms are associated with moderate intoxication: dizziness, headache, tinnitus, \nconfusion and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting and gastric pain).  \n \nWith severe intoxication, serious disturbances of the acid-base equilibrium occur. Initial \nhyperventilation leads to respiratory alkalosis. Subsequently a respiratory acidosis occurs as a result of \na suppressive effect on the respiratory centre. A metabolic acidosis also arises due to the presence of \nsalicylates. Given that children, infants and toddlers are often only seen at a late stage of intoxication, \nthey will usually have already reached the acidosis stage.  \n \nThe following symptoms can also arise: hyperthermia and perspiration, leading to dehydration, \nrestlessness, convulsions, hallucinations and hypoglycaemia. Depression of the nervous system can \nlead to coma, cardiovascular collapse and respiratory arrest. The lethal dose of acetylsalicylic acid is \n25-30 g. Plasma salicylate concentrations above 300 mg/l (1.67 mmol/l) suggest intoxication.  \n \nOverdose with ASA/clopidogrel fixed dose combination may be associated with increased bleeding \nand subsequent bleeding complications due to the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel and ASA.  \n \nNon-cardiogenic pulmonary edema can occur with acute and chronic acetylsalicylic acid overdose (see \nsection 4.8).  \n \nIf a toxic dose has been ingested then admission to hospital is necessary. With moderate intoxication \nan attempt can be made to induce vomiting; if this fails, gastric lavage is indicated. Activated charcoal \n(adsorbent) and sodium sulphate (laxative) are then administered. Alkalising of the urine (250 mmol \nsodium bicarbonate for 3 hours) while monitoring the urine pH is indicated. Haemodialysis is the \npreferred treatment for severe intoxication. Treat other signs of intoxication symptomatically.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties  \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, platelet aggregation inhibitors excl. Heparin, ATC \nCode: B01AC30.  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nClopidogrel is a prodrug, one of whose metabolites is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel \nmust be metabolised by CYP450 enzymes to produce the active metabolite that inhibits platelet \naggregation. The active metabolite of clopidogrel selectively inhibits the binding of adenosine \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 17 \n\ndiphosphate (ADP) to its platelet P2Y12 receptor and the subsequent ADP-mediated activation of the \nglycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation. Due to the irreversible \nbinding, platelets exposed are affected for the remainder of their lifespan (approximately 7-10 days) \nand recovery of normal platelet function occurs at a rate consistent with platelet turnover. Platelet \naggregation induced by agonists other than ADP is also inhibited by blocking the amplification of \nplatelet activation by released ADP. \n \nBecause the active metabolite is formed by CYP450 enzymes, some of which are polymorphic or \nsubject to inhibition by other medicinal products, not all patients will have adequate platelet inhibition. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nRepeated doses of clopidogrel 75 mg per day produced substantial inhibition of ADP-induced platelet \naggregation from the first day; this increased progressively and reached steady state between Day 3 \nand Day 7. At steady state, the average inhibition level observed with a dose of 75 mg per day was \nbetween 40% and 60%. Platelet aggregation and bleeding time gradually returned to baseline values, \ngenerally within 5 days after treatment was discontinued. \n \nAcetylsalicylic acid inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of prostaglandin \ncyclo-oxygenase and thus inhibits the generation of thromboxane A2, an inducer of platelet \naggregation and vasoconstriction. This effect lasts for the life of the platelet. \n \nExperimental data suggest that ibuprofen may inhibit the effect of low dose aspirin on platelet \naggregation when they are dosed concomitantly. In one study, when a single dose of ibuprofen 400 mg \nwas taken within 8 hours before or within 30 minutes after immediate release aspirin dosing (81 mg), a \ndecreased effect of ASA on the formation of thromboxane or platelet aggregation occurred. However, \nthe limitations of these data and the uncertainties regarding extrapolation of ex vivo data to the clinical \nsituation imply that no firm conclusions can be made for regular ibuprofen use, and no clinically \nrelevant effect is considered to be likely for occasional ibuprofen use. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe safety and efficacy of clopidogrel plus ASA have been evaluated in three double-blind studies \ninvolving over 61,900 patients: the CURE, CLARITY and COMMIT studies, comparing clopidogrel \nplus ASA to ASA alone, both treatments given in combination with other standard therapy. \n \nThe CURE study included 12,562 patients with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome \n(unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction), and presenting within 24 hours of onset of the \nmost recent episode of chest pain or symptoms consistent with ischaemia. Patients were required to \nhave either ECG changes compatible with new ischaemia or elevated cardiac enzymes or troponin I or \nT to at least twice the upper limit of normal. Patients were randomised to clopidogrel (300 mg loading \ndose followed by 75 mg/day, N=6,259) plus ASA (75-325 mg once daily) or ASA alone (N=6,303), \n(75-325 mg once daily) and other standard therapies. Patients were treated for up to one year. In \nCURE, 823 (6.6%) patients received concomitant GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist therapy. Heparins \nwere administered in more than 90% of the patients and the relative rate of bleeding between \nclopidogrel plus ASA and ASA alone was not significantly affected by the concomitant heparin \ntherapy.  \n \nThe number of patients experiencing the primary endpoint [cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial \ninfarction (MI), or stroke] was 582 (9.3%) in the clopidogrel plus ASA group and 719 (11.4%) in the \nASA group, a 20% relative risk reduction (RRR) (95% CI of 10%-28%; p=0.00009) for the \nclopidogrel plus ASA group [17% relative risk reduction when patients were treated conservatively, \n29% when they underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with or without \nstent and 10% when they underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)]. New cardiovascular \nevents (primary endpoint) were prevented, with relative risk reductions of 22% (CI: 8.6, 33.4), 32% \n(CI: 12.8, 46.4), 4% (CI: -26.9, 26.7), 6% (CI: -33.5, 34.3) and 14% (CI: -31.6, 44.2), during the 0-1, \n1-3, 3-6, 6-9 and 9-12 month study intervals, respectively. Thus, beyond 3 months of treatment, the \n\n\n\n 18 \n\nbenefit observed in the clopidogrel plus ASA group was not further increased, whereas the risk of \nhaemorrhage persisted (see section 4.4).  \n \nThe use of clopidogrel in CURE was associated with a decrease in the need for thrombolytic therapy \n(RRR = 43.3%; CI: 24.3%, 57.5%) and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (RRR = 18.2%; CI: 6.5%, 28.3%). \n \nThe number of patients experiencing the co-primary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke or refractory \nischaemia) was 1,035 (16.5%) in the clopidogrel plus ASA group and 1,187 (18.8%) in the ASA \ngroup, a 14% relative risk reduction (95% CI of 6%-21%, p=0.0005) for the clopidogrel plus ASA \ngroup. This benefit was mostly driven by the statistically significant reduction in the incidence of MI \n[287 (4.6%) in the clopidogrel plus ASA group and 363 (5.8%) in the ASA group]. There was no \nobserved effect on the rate of rehospitalisation for unstable angina. \n \nThe results obtained in populations with different characteristics (e.g. unstable angina or non-Q-wave \nMI, low to high risk levels, diabetes, need for revascularisation, age, gender, etc.) were consistent with \nthe results of the primary analysis. In particular, in a post-hoc analysis in 2,172 patients (17% of the \ntotal CURE population) who underwent stent placement (Stent-CURE), the data showed that \nclopidogrel compared to placebo, demonstrated a significant RRR of 26.2% favouring clopidogrel for \nthe co-primary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke) and also a significant RRR of 23.9% for the second \nco-primary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke or refractory ischaemia). Moreover, the safety profile of \nclopidogrel in this subgroup of patients did not raise any particular concern. Thus, the results from this \nsubset are in line with the overall trial results.  \n \nIn patients with acute ST-segment elevation MI, safety and efficacy of clopidogrel have been \nevaluated in 2 randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, CLARITY and COMMIT. \n \nThe CLARITY trial included 3,491 patients presenting within 12 hours of the onset of a ST elevation \nMI and planned for thrombolytic therapy. Patients received clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose, \nfollowed by 75 mg/day, n=1,752) plus ASA or ASA alone (n=1,739), (150 to 325 mg as a loading \ndose, followed by 75 to 162 mg/day), a fibrinolytic agent and, when appropriate, heparin. The patients \nwere followed for 30 days. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of the composite of an occluded \ninfarct-related artery on the predischarge angiogram, or death or recurrent MI before coronary \nangiography. For patients who did not undergo angiography, the primary endpoint was death or \nrecurrent myocardial infarction by Day 8 or by hospital discharge. The patient population included \n19.7% women and 29.2% patients \u226565 years. A total of 99.7% of patients received fibrinolytics \n(fibrin-specific: 68.7%, non-fibrin specific: 31.1%), 89.5% heparin, 78.7% beta blockers, 54.7% ACE \ninhibitors and 63% statins. \n \nFifteen percent (15.0%) of patients in the clopidogrel plus ASA group and 21.7% in the group treated \nwith ASA alone reached the primary endpoint, representing an absolute reduction of 6.7% and a 36% \nodds reduction in favor of clopidogrel (95% CI: 24, 47%; p <0.001), mainly related to a reduction in \noccluded infarct-related arteries. This benefit was consistent across all prespecified subgroups \nincluding patients\u2019 age and gender, infarct location, and type of fibrinolytic or heparin used. \n \nThe 2x2 factorial design COMMIT trial included 45,852 patients presenting within 24 hours of the \nonset of the symptoms of suspected MI with supporting ECG abnormalities (i.e. ST elevation, ST \ndepression or left bundle-branch block). Patients received clopidogrel (75 mg/day, n=22,961) plus \nASA (162 mg/day), or ASA alone (162 mg/day) (n=22,891), for 28 days or until hospital discharge. \nThe co-primary endpoints were death from any cause and the first occurrence of re-infarction, stroke \nor death. The population included 27.8% women, 58.4% patients \u226560 years (26% \u226570 years) and \n54.5% patients who received fibrinolytics. \n \nClopidogrel plus ASA significantly reduced the relative risk of death from any cause by 7% \n(p = 0.029), and the relative risk of the combination of re-infarction, stroke or death by 9% \n(p = 0.002), representing an absolute reduction of 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively. This benefit was \nconsistent across age, gender and with or without fibrinolytics, and was observed as early as 24 hours. \n \n\n\n\n 19 \n\nDe-escalation of P2Y12 Inhibitor Agents in ACS  \nSwitching from a more potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitor to clopidogrel in association with aspirin after \nacute phase in ACS has been evaluated in two randomized investigator-sponsored studies (ISS) \u2013 \nTOPIC and TROPICAL-ACS \u2013 with clinical outcome data. \n \nThe clinical benefit provided by the more potent P2Y12 inhibitors, ticagrelor and prasugrel, in their \npivotal studies is related to a significant reduction in recurrent ischaemic events (including acute and \nsubacute stent thrombosis (ST), myocardial infarction (MI), and urgent revascularization). Although \nthe ischaemic benefit was consistent throughout the first year, greater reduction in ischaemic \nrecurrence after ACS was observed during the initial days following the treatment initiation.  In \ncontrast, post-hoc analyses demonstrated statistically significant increases in the bleeding risk with the \nmore potent P2Y12 inhibitors, occurring predominantly during the maintenance phase, after the first \nmonth post-ACS. TOPIC and TROPICAL-ACS were designed to study how to mitigate the bleeding \nevents while maintaining efficacy. \n \nTOPIC (Timing Of Platelet Inhibition after acute Coronary syndrome) \nThis randomized, open-label trial included ACS patients requiring PCI. Patients on aspirin and a more \npotent P2Y12 blocker and without adverse event at one month were assigned to switch to fixed-dose \naspirin plus clopidogrel (de-escalated dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)) or continuation of their drug \nregimen (unchanged DAPT).   \n \nOverall, 645 of 646 patients with STEMI or NSTEMI or unstable angina were analyzed (de-escalated \nDAPT (n=322); unchanged DAPT (n=323)). Follow-up at one year was performed for 316 patients \n(98.1%) in the de-escalated DAPT group and 318 patients (98.5%) in the unchanged DAPT group. \nThe median follow-up for both groups was 359 days. The characteristics of the studied cohort were \nsimilar in the 2 groups. \n \nThe primary outcome, a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, urgent revascularization, and \nBARC (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium) bleeding \u22652 at 1 year post ACS, occurred in \n43 patients (13.4%) in the de-escalated DAPT group and in 85 patients (26.3%) in the unchanged \nDAPT group (p<0.01). This statistically significant difference was mainly driven by fewer bleeding \nevents, with no difference reported in ischaemic endpoints (p=0.36), while BARC\u2009\u22652 bleeding \noccurred less frequently in the de-escalated DAPT group (4.0%) versus 14.9%  in the unchanged \nDAPT group (p<0.01). Bleeding events defined as all BARC occurred in 30 patients (9.3%) in the \nde-escalated DAPT group and in 76 patients (23.5%) in the unchanged DAPT group (p<0.01). \n \nTROPICAL-ACS (Testing Responsiveness to Platelet Inhibition on Chronic Antiplatelet Treatment \nfor Acute Coronary Syndromes) \nThis randomized, open-label trial included 2,610 biomarker-positive ACS patients after successful \nPCI. Patients were randomized to receive either prasugrel 5 or 10 mg/d (Days 0-14) (n=1306), or \nprasugrel 5 or 10 mg/d (Days 0-7) then de-escalated to clopidogrel 75 mg/d (Days 8-14) (n=1304), in \ncombination with ASA (<100 mg/day).  At Day 14, platelet function testing (PFT) was performed. \nThe prasugrel-only patients were continued on prasugrel for 11.5 months.   \n \nThe de-escalated patients underwent high platelet reactivity (HPR) testing.  If HPR\u226546 units, the \npatients were escalated back to prasugrel 5 or 10 mg/d for 11.5 months; if HPR<46 units, the patients \ncontinued on clopidogrel 75 mg/d for 11.5 months.  Therefore, the guided de-escalation arm had \npatients on either prasugrel (40%) or clopidogrel (60%). All patients were continued on aspirin and \nwere followed for one year.  \n \nThe primary endpoint (the combined incidence of CV death, MI, stroke and BARC bleeding grade \u22652 \nat 12 months) was met showing non-inferiority. Ninety five patients (7%) in the guided de-escalation \ngroup and 118 patients (9%) in the control group (p non-inferiority=0.0004) had an event. The guided \nde-escalation did not result in an increased combined risk of ischemic events (2.5% in the de-\nescalation group vs 3.2% in the control group; p non-inferiority=0.0115), nor in the key secondary \nendpoint of BARC bleeding \u22652 ((5%) in the de-escalation group versus 6% in the control group \n\n\n\n 20 \n\n(p=0.23)). The cumulative incidence of all bleeding events (BARC class 1 to 5) was 9% (114 events) \nin the guided de-escalation group versus 11% (137 events) in the control group (p=0.14). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nDuoPlavin in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of coronary atherosclerosis (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n \nClopidogrel:  \nAbsorption \nAfter single and repeated oral doses of 75 mg per day, clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed. Mean peak \nplasma levels of unchanged clopidogrel (approximately 2.2-2.5 ng/ml after a single 75 mg oral dose) \noccurred approximately 45 minutes after dosing. Absorption is at least 50%, based on urinary \nexcretion of clopidogrel metabolites. \n \nDistribution \nClopidogrel and the main circulating (inactive) metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma \nproteins (98% and 94% respectively). The binding is non-saturable in vitro over a wide concentration \nrange. \n \nBiotransformation \nClopidogrel is extensively metabolised by the liver. In vitro and in vivo, clopidogrel is metabolised \naccording to two main metabolic pathways: one mediated by esterases and leading to hydrolysis into \nits inactive carboxylic acid derivative (85% of circulating metabolites), and one mediated by multiple \ncytochromes P450. Clopidogrel is first metabolised to a 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite. \nSubsequent metabolism of the 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite results in formation of the \nactive metabolite, a thiol derivative of clopidogrel. The active metabolite is formed mostly by \nCYP2C19 with contributions from several other CYP enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and \nCYP3A4. The active thiol metabolite which has been isolated in vitro, binds rapidly and irreversibly to \nplatelet receptors, thus inhibiting platelet aggregation. \n \nThe Cmax of the active metabolite is twice as high following a single 300-mg clopidogrel loading dose \nas it is after four days of 75-mg maintenance dose. Cmax occurs approximately 30 to 60 minutes after \ndosing.  \n \nElimination \nFollowing an oral dose of 14C-labelled clopidogrel in man, approximately 50% was excreted in the \nurine and approximately 46% in the faeces in the 120-hour interval after dosing. After a single oral \ndose of 75 mg, clopidogrel has a half-life of approximately 6 hours. The elimination half-life of the \nmain circulating (inactive) metabolite was 8 hours after single and repeated administration. \n \nPharmacogenetics \nCYP2C19 is involved in the formation of both the active metabolite and the 2-oxo-clopidogrel \nintermediate metabolite. Clopidogrel active metabolite pharmacokinetics and antiplatelet effects, as \nmeasured by ex vivo platelet aggregation assays, differ according to CYP2C19 genotype.  \n \nThe CYP2C19*1 allele corresponds to fully functional metabolism while the CYP2C19*2 and \nCYP2C19*3 alleles correspond to nonfunctional metabolism. The CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 \nalleles account for the majority of reduced function alleles in Caucasian (85%) and Asian (99%) poor \nmetabolisers. Other alleles associated with absent or reduced metabolism are less frequent and include \nCYP2C19*4, *5, *6, *7, and *8. A patient with poor metaboliser status will possess two loss-of-\nfunction alleles as defined above. Published frequencies for the poor CYP2C19 metaboliser genotypes \nare approximately 2% for Caucasians, 4% for Blacks and 14% for Chinese. Tests are available to \ndetermine a patient\u2019s CYP2C19 genotype.  \n \n\n\n\n 21 \n\nA crossover study in 40 healthy subjects, 10 each in the four CYP2C19 metaboliser groups (ultrarapid, \nextensive, intermediate and poor), evaluated pharmacokinetic and antiplatelet responses using 300 mg \nfollowed by 75 mg/day and 600 mg followed by 150 mg/day, each for a total of 5 days (steady state). \nNo substantial differences in active metabolite exposure and mean inhibition of platelet aggregation \n(IPA) were observed between ultrarapid, extensive and intermediate metabolisers. In poor \nmetabolisers, active metabolite exposure was decreased by 63-71% compared to extensive \nmetabolisers. After the 300 mg/75 mg dose regimen, antiplatelet responses were decreased in the poor \nmetabolisers with mean IPA (5 \u03bcM ADP) of 24% (24 hours) and 37% (Day 5) as compared to IPA of \n39% (24 hours) and 58% (Day 5) in the extensive metabolisers and 37% (24 hours) and 60% (Day 5) \nin the intermediate metabolisers. When poor metabolisers received the 600 mg/150 mg regimen, active \nmetabolite exposure was greater than with the 300 mg/75 mg regimen. In addition, IPA was 32% \n(24 hours) and 61% (Day 5), which were greater than in the poor metabolisers receiving the \n300 mg/75 mg regimen, and were similar to the other CYP2C19 metaboliser groups receiving the \n300 mg/75 mg regimen. An appropriate dose regimen for this patient population has not been \nestablished in clinical outcome trials. \n \nConsistent with the above results, in a meta-analysis including 6 studies of 335 clopidogrel-treated \nsubjects at steady state, it was shown that active metabolite exposure was decreased by 28% for \nintermediate metabolisers, and 72% for poor metabolisers while platelet aggregation inhibition (5 \u03bcM \nADP) was decreased with differences in IPA of 5.9% and 21.4%, respectively, when compared to \nextensive metabolisers. \n \nThe influence of CYP2C19 genotype on clinical outcomes in patients treated with clopidogrel has not \nbeen evaluated in prospective, randomised, controlled trials. There have been a number of \nretrospective analyses, however, to evaluate this effect in patients treated with clopidogrel for whom \nthere are genotyping results: CURE (n=2721), CHARISMA (n=2428), CLARITY-TIMI 28 (n=227), \nTRITON-TIMI 38 (n=1477), and ACTIVE-A (n=601), as well as a number of published cohort \nstudies. \n \nIn TRITON-TIMI 38 and 3 of the cohort studies (Collet, Sibbing, Giusti) the combined group of \npatients with either intermediate or poor metaboliser status had a higher rate of cardiovascular events \n(death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) or stent thrombosis compared to extensive metabolisers. \n \nIn CHARISMA and one cohort study (Simon), an increased event rate was observed only in poor \nmetabolisers when compared to extensive metabolisers. \n \nIn CURE, CLARITY, ACTIVE-A and one of the cohort studies (Trenk), no increased event rate was \nobserved based on metaboliser status. \n \nNone of these analyses were adequately sized to detect differences in outcome in poor metabolisers. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite of clopidogrel is not known in these special populations. \n \nRenal impairment \nAfter repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day in subjects with severe renal disease (creatinine \nclearance from 5 to 15 ml/min), inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was lower (25%) than \nthat observed in healthy subjects, however, the prolongation of bleeding time was similar to that seen \nin healthy subjects receiving 75 mg of clopidogrel per day. In addition, clinical tolerance was good in \nall patients.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nAfter repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day for 10 days in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment, inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was similar to that observed in healthy \nsubjects. The mean bleeding time prolongation was also similar in the two groups.  \n \n\n\n\n 22 \n\nRace \nThe prevalence of CYP2C19 alleles that result in intermediate and poor CYP2C19 metabolism differs \naccording to race/ethnicity (see Pharmacogenetics). From literature, limited data in Asian populations \nare available to assess the clinical implication of genotyping of this CYP on clinical outcome events. \n \nAcetylsalicylic acid (ASA):  \nAbsorption  \nFollowing absorption, the ASA in DuoPlavin is hydrolyzed to salicylic acid with peak plasma levels of \nsalicylic acid occurring within 1 hour of dosing, such that plasma levels of ASA are essentially \nundetectable 1.5-3 hours after dosing.  \n \nDistribution  \nASA is poorly bound to plasma proteins and its apparent volume of distribution is low (10 l). Its \nmetabolite, salicylic acid, is highly bound to plasma proteins, but its binding is concentration \ndependent (nonlinear). At low concentrations (<100 micrograms/ml), approximately 90% of salicylic \nacid is bound to albumin. Salicylic acid is widely distributed to all tissues and fluids in the body, \nincluding the central nervous system, breast milk, and foetal tissues.  \n \nBiotransformation and Elimination  \nThe ASA in DuoPlavin is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to salicylic acid, with a half-life of 0.3 to \n0.4 hours for ASA doses from 75 to 100 mg. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form \nsalicyluric acid, a phenolic glucuronide, an acyl glucuronide, and a number of minor metabolites. \nSalicylic acid in DuoPlavin has a plasma half-life of approximately 2 hours. Salicylate metabolism is \nsaturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability \nof the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10\u221220 g), \nthe plasma half-life may be increased to over 20 hours. At high ASA doses, the elimination of salicylic \nacid follows zero-order kinetics (i.e., the rate of elimination is constant in relation to plasma \nconcentration), with an apparent half-life of 6 hours or higher. Renal excretion of unchanged active \nsubstance depends upon urinary pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free \nsalicylate increases from <5% to >80%. Following therapeutic doses, approximately 10% is found \nexcreted in the urine as salicylic acid, 75% as salicyluric acid, 10% phenolic- and 5% acyl-\nglucuronides of salicylic acid.  \n\n \nBased on the pharmacokinetic and metabolic characteristics of both compounds, clinically significant \nPK interactions are unlikely \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nClopidogrel \nDuring non-clinical studies in rat and baboon, the most frequently observed effects were liver changes. \nThese occurred at doses representing at least 25 times the exposure seen in humans receiving the \nclinical dose of 75 mg/day and were a consequence of an effect on hepatic metabolising enzymes. No \neffect on hepatic metabolising enzymes was observed in humans receiving clopidogrel at the \ntherapeutic dose. \n \nAt very high doses, a poor gastric tolerability (gastritis, gastric erosions and/or vomiting) of \nclopidogrel was also reported in rat and baboon. \n \nThere was no evidence of carcinogenic effect when clopidogrel was administered for 78 weeks to mice \nand 104 weeks to rats when given at doses up to 77 mg/kg per day (representing at least 25 times the \nexposure seen in humans receiving the clinical dose of 75 mg/day). \n \nClopidogrel has been tested in a range of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies, and showed no \ngenotoxic activity. \n \nClopidogrel was found to have no effect on the fertility of male and female rats and was not \nteratogenic in either rats or rabbits. When given to lactating rats, clopidogrel caused a slight delay in \n\n\n\n 23 \n\nthe development of the offspring. Specific pharmacokinetic studies performed with radiolabelled \nclopidogrel have shown that the parent compound or its metabolites are excreted in the milk. \nConsequently, a direct effect (slight toxicity), or an indirect effect (low palatability) cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nAcetylsalicylic acid \nSingle-dose studies have shown that the oral toxicity of ASA is low. Repeat-dose toxicity studies have \nshown that levels up to 200 mg/kg/day are well tolerated in rats; dogs appear to be more sensitive, \nprobably due to the high sensitivity of canines to the ulcerogenic effects of NSAIDs. No genotoxicity \nor clastogenicity issues of concern have been found with ASA. Although no formal carcinogenicity \nstudies have been performed with ASA, it has been shown that it is not a tumour promoter. \n \nReproduction toxicity data show that ASA is teratogenic in several laboratory animals.  \n \nIn animals, administration of a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor has been shown to result in increased \npre- and post-implantation loss and embryo-foetal lethality. In addition, increased incidences of \nvarious malformations, including cardiovascular, have been reported in animals given a prostaglandin \nsynthesis inhibitor during the organogenetic period. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n\u2022 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\u2022 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\u2022 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

What DuoPlavin is and what it is used for \n \nDuoPlavin contains clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and belongs to a group of medicines \ncalled antiplatelet medicinal products. Platelets are very small structures in the blood which clump \ntogether during blood clotting. By preventing this clumping in some types of blood vessels (called \narteries), antiplatelet medicinal products reduce the chances of blood clots forming (a process called \natherothrombosis). \n \nDuoPlavin is taken by adults to prevent blood clots forming in hardened arteries which can lead to \natherothrombotic events (such as stroke, heart attack, or death).  \n \nYou have been prescribed DuoPlavin in place of the two separate medicines, clopidogrel and ASA, to \nhelp prevent blood clots because you have experienced a severe type of chest pain known as \u2018unstable \nangina\u2019 or heart attack (myocardial infarction). For the treatment of this condition your doctor may \nhave placed a stent in the blocked or narrowed artery to restore effective blood flow. \n \n2.  What you need to know before you take DuoPlavin \n \nDo not take DuoPlavin  \n\u2022 if you are allergic to clopidogrel, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6).  \n\u2022 if you are allergic to other products called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory products usually used \n\nto treat painful and/or inflammatory conditions of muscles or joints. \n\u2022 if you have a medical condition that includes the combination of asthma, nasal discharge (runny \n\nnose) and polyps (a type of growth in the nose). \n\u2022 if you have a medical condition that is currently causing bleeding such as a stomach ulcer or \n\nbleeding within the brain. \n\u2022 if you suffer from severe liver disease. \n\u2022 if you suffer from severe kidney disease. \n\u2022 if you are in your last trimester of pregnancy.  \n\n\n\n 42 \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nIf any of the situations mentioned below apply to you, you should tell your doctor before taking \nDuoPlavin: \n\u2022 if you have a risk of bleeding such as:  \n\n- a medical condition that puts you at risk of internal bleeding (such as a stomach ulcer). \n- a blood disorder that makes you prone to internal bleeding (bleeding inside any tissues, \n\norgans or joints of your body). \n- a recent serious injury. \n- a recent surgery (including dental). \n- a planned surgery (including dental) in the next seven days. \n\n\u2022 if you have had a clot in an artery of your brain (ischaemic stroke) which occurred in the last \nseven days. \n\n\u2022 if you have kidney or liver disease. \n\u2022 if you have a history of asthma or allergic reactions including allergy to any medicine used to \n\ntreat your disease.  \n\u2022 if you have gout.  \n\u2022 if you drink alcohol, because of the increased risk of bleeding or gastrointestinal injury.  \n\u2022 if you have a condition known as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency \n\nbecause of the risk of a particular form of anaemia (low number of red blood cells). \n \n\nWhile you are taking DuoPlavin: \n\u2022 You should tell your doctor \n\n- if a surgery (including dental) is planned. \n- if you have any stomach or abdominal pain or bleeding in the stomach or bowels (red \n\nstools or black stools). \n\u2022 You should also tell your doctor immediately if you develop a medical condition known as \n\nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura or TTP that includes fever and bruising under the skin \nthat may appear as red pinpoint dots, with or without unexplained extreme tiredness, confusion, \nyellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice) (see section 4). \n\n\u2022 If you cut or injure yourself, it may take longer than usual for bleeding to stop. This is linked to \nthe way your medicine works as it prevents the ability of blood clots to form. For minor cuts and \ninjuries e.g., cutting yourself, shaving, this is usually of no concern. However, if you are \nconcerned by your bleeding, you should contact your doctor straightaway (see section 4 \n\u2018Possible side effects\u2019). \n\n\u2022 Your doctor may order blood tests. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDuoPlavin is not intended for use in children or adolescents less than 18 years of age.

hardened arteries which can lead to atherothrombotic events (such as stroke, heart attack, or death). you have been prescribed duoplavin in place of the two separate medicines, clopidogrel and asa, to help prevent blood clots because you have experienced a severe type of chest pain known as 'unstable angina' or heart attack (myocardial infarction). for the treatment of this condition your doctor

acid (asa) or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). if you are allergic to other products called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory products usually used to treat painful and/or inflammatory conditions of muscles or joints. if you have a medical condition that includes the combination of asthma, nasal discharge (runny nose) and polyps (a type of growth in the nose). if you have a medical condition that is currently causing bleeding such as a stomach ulcer or bleeding within the brain. if you suffer from severe liver disease. if you suffer from severe kidney disease. if you are in your last trimester of pregnancy. warnings and precautions if any of the situations mentioned below apply to you, you should tell your doctor before taking duoplavin: if you have a risk of bleeding such as: - a medical condition that puts you at risk of internal bleeding (such as a stomach ulcer). - a blood disorder that makes you prone to internal bleeding (bleeding inside any tissues, organs or joints of your body). - a recent serious injury. - a recent surgery (including dental). - a planned surgery (including dental) in the next seven days. if you have had a clot in an artery of your brain (ischaemic stroke) which occurred in the last seven days. if you have kidney or liver disease. if you have a history of asthma or allergic reactions including allergy to any medicine used to treat your disease. if you have gout. if you drink alcohol, because of the increased risk of bleeding or gastrointestinal injury. if you have a condition known as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency because of the risk of a particular form of anaemia (low number of red blood cells). while you are taking duoplavin: you should tell your doctor - if a surgery (including dental) is planned. - if you have any stomach or abdominal pain or bleeding in the stomach or bowels (red stools or black stools). you should also tell your doctor immediately if you develop a medical condition known as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or ttp that includes fever and bruising under the skin that may appear as red pinpoint dots, with or without unexplained extreme tiredness, confusion, yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice) (see section 4). if you cut or injure yourself, it may take longer than usual for bleeding to stop. this is linked to the way your medicine works as it prevents the ability of blood clots to form. for minor cuts and injuries e.g., cutting yourself, shaving, this is usually of no concern. however, if you are concerned by your bleeding, you should contact your doctor straightaway (see section 4 'possible side effects'). your doctor may order blood tests. children and adolescents duoplavin is not intended for use in children or adolescents less than 18 years of age. there is a possible association between acetylsalicylic acid (asa) and reye's syndrome when products containing asa are given to children or adolescents with a viral infection. reye's syndrome is a very rare disease which can be fatal. other medicines and duoplavin tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. some other medicines may influence the use of duoplavin or vice versa. you should specifically tell your doctor if you take medicines that may increase your risk of bleeding such as: - oral anticoagulants, medicines used to reduce blood clotting, - asa or another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicine usually used to treat painful and/or inflammatory conditions of muscle or joints, - heparin or any other injectable medicine used to reduce blood clotting, - ticlopidine, other antiplatelet agent, 43 - a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (including but not restricted to fluoxetine or fluvoxamine), medicines usually used to treat depression, - rifampicin (used to treat severe infections) omeprazole or esomeprazole, medicines to treat upset stomach, methotrexate, a medicine used to treat severe joint disease (rheumatoid arthritis) or skin disease (psoriasis), acetazolamide, a medicine used to treat glaucoma (increased ocular pressure) or epilepsy or to increase

chickenpox or shingles, within 6 weeks of taking duoplavin, or if you have active chickenpox or shingles infection (see section 2 'children and adolescents'), moclobemide, medicine to treat depression, repaglinide, medicine to treat diabetes, paclitaxel, medicine to treat cancer, nicorandil, medicine to treat cardiac chest pain, opioids: while you are treated with clopidogrel, you should inform your doctor before being prescribed any opioids (used to treat severe pain). you should stop other clopidogrel treatment while you are taking duoplavin. an occasional use of asa (no more than 1,000 mg in any 24-hour period) should generally not cause a problem, but prolonged use of asa in other circumstances should be discussed with your doctor or pharmacist. pregnancy and breast-feeding

which appears under the skin as red pinpoint dots, and/or confusion (see section 2 'warnings and precautions'). swelling in the mouth or skin disorders such as rashes and itching, blisters of the skin. these may be the signs of an allergic reaction. the most common side effect which has been seen with duoplavin is bleeding. bleeding may occur as bleeding in the stomach or bowels, bruising, haematoma (unusual bleeding or bruising under the skin), nose bleed, blood in the urine. in a small number of cases, bleeding in the eye, inside the head (especially in elderly), the lung or the joints has also been reported. if you experience prolonged bleeding when taking duoplavin if you cut or injure yourself, it may take longer than usual for bleeding to stop. this is linked to the way your medicine works as it prevents the ability of blood clots to form. for minor cuts and injuries 45 e.g., cutting yourself, shaving, this is usually of no concern. however, if you are concerned by your bleeding, you should contact your doctor straightaway (see section 2 'warnings and precautions'). other side effects include: common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): diarrhoea, abdominal pain, indigestion or heartburn. uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): headache, stomach ulcer, vomiting, nausea, constipation, excessive gas in stomach or intestines, rashes, itching, dizziness, sensation of tingling and numbness. rare side effect (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people): vertigo, enlarged breasts in males. very rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): jaundice (yellowing of skin and/or eyes); burning in stomach and/or esophagus (gullet); severe abdominal pain with or without back pain; fever, breathing difficulties sometimes associated with cough; generalised allergic reactions (for example, overall sensation of heat with sudden general discomfort until fainting); swelling in the mouth; blisters of the skin; skin allergy; sore mouth (stomatitis); decrease in blood pressure; confusion; hallucinations; joint pain; muscular pain; changes in taste or loss of taste of foods, inflammation of small vessels. side effects with frequency not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): ulcer perforation, ringing in the ears, hearing loss, sudden life-threatening allergic or hypersensitivity reactions with chest or abdominal pain, kidney disease, low blood sugar, gout (a condition of painful, swollen joints caused by uric acid crystals) and worsening of food allergies, a particular form of anaemia (low number of red blood cells) (see section 2 'warnings and precautions'), swelling. in addition, your doctor may identify changes in your blood or urine tests. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed
