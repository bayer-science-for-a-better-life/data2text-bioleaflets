This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNUBEQA 300 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 300 mg of darolutamide. \n \nExcipient with known effect \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 186 mg of lactose monohydrate (see section 4.4). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nWhite to off-white, oval tablets with a length of 16 mm and a width of 8 mm, marked with \u201c300\u201d on \none side, and \u201cBAYER\u201d on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nNUBEQA is indicated for the treatment of adult men with non-metastatic castration resistant prostate \ncancer (nmCRPC) who are at high risk of developing metastatic disease (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by a specialist physician experienced in treatment of \nprostate cancer. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 600 mg darolutamide (two tablets of 300 mg) taken twice daily, equivalent \nto a total daily dose of 1200 mg (see section 5.2). \n \nMedical castration with a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue should be \ncontinued during treatment of patients not surgically castrated. \n \nMissed dose \nIf a dose is missed, the dose should be taken as soon as the patient remembers prior to the next \nscheduled dose. The patient should not take two doses together to make up for a missed dose. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nDose modification \nIf a patient experiences a \u2265 Grade 3 toxicity or an intolerable adverse reaction (see section 4.8), dosing \nshould be withheld or reduced to 300 mg twice daily until symptoms improve. Treatment may then be \nresumed at a dose of 600 mg twice daily. \n \nDose reduction below 300 mg twice daily is not recommended, because efficacy has not been \nestablished. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. \nFor patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m2) not receiving haemodialysis, \nthe recommended starting dose is 300 mg twice daily (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. \nThe available data on darolutamide pharmacokinetics in moderate hepatic impairment is limited. \nDarolutamide has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nFor patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Classes B and C), the \nrecommended starting dose is 300 mg twice daily (see sections 4.4 and 5.2.). \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of darolutamide in the paediatric population for the indication of treatment of \nnmCRPC. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nNUBEQA is for oral use. \n \nThe tablets should be taken whole with food (see section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nWomen who are or may become pregnant (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nRenal impairment \n \nThe available data in patients with severe renal impairment are limited. \nAs exposure might be increased those patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions (see \nsections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nThe available data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment are limited, and darolutamide has not \nbeen studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nAs exposure might be increased those patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions (see \nsections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nRecent cardiovascular disease \n \nPatients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease in the past 6 months including stroke, \nmyocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina pectoris, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, and \nsymptomatic congestive heart failure were excluded from the clinical studies. Therefore, the safety of \ndarolutamide in these patients has not been established. \nIf NUBEQA is prescribed, patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease should be treated \nfor these conditions according to established guidelines. \n \nConcomitant use with other medicinal products \n \nUse of strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inducers during treatment with darolutamide may decrease the \nplasma concentration of darolutamide and is not recommended, unless there is no therapeutic \nalternative. Selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product with less potential to induce \nCYP3A4 or P-gp should be considered (see section 4.5). \n \nPatients should be monitored for adverse reactions of BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrates as \nco-administration with darolutamide may increase the plasma concentrations of these substrates. \nCo-administration with rosuvastatin should be avoided unless there is no therapeutic alternative (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nAndrogen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT interval \n \nIn patients with a history of risk factors for QT prolongation and in patients receiving concomitant \nmedicinal products that might prolong the QT interval (see section 4.5), physicians should assess the \nbenefit-risk ratio including the potential for Torsade de pointes prior to initiating NUBEQA. \n \nInformation about excipients \n \nNUBEQA contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on darolutamide \n \nCYP3A4 and P-gp inducers \nDarolutamide is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). \nUse of strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers and P-gp inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, \nSt. John's Wort, phenytoin, and rifampicin) during treatment with darolutamide is not recommended, \nunless there is no therapeutic alternative. Selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product, \nwith no or weak potential to induce CYP3A4 or P-gp should be considered. \nRepeated administration of rifampicin (600 mg), a strong CYP3A4 and a P-gp inducer, with a single \ndose of darolutamide (600 mg) together with food, resulted in a decrease of 72% in mean exposure \n(AUC0-72) and a decrease of 52% in Cmax of darolutamide. \n \nCYP3A4, P-gp and BCRP inhibitors \nDarolutamide is a substrate of CYP3A4, P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). \nNo clinically relevant drug-drug interaction is expected in case of CYP3A4, P-gp or BCRP inhibitor \nadministration. Darolutamide may be given concomitantly with CYP3A4, P-gp or BCRP inhibitors. \nConcomitant use of darolutamide with a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases \ndarolutamide exposure which may increase the risk of darolutamide adverse reactions. It is \nrecommended to monitor patients more frequently for darolutamide adverse reactions and modify \ndarolutamide dose as needed. \n\n\n\n5 \n\nAdministration of itraconazole (200 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily on the following 7 days), \na strong CYP3A4, P-gp and BCRP inhibitor, with a single dose of darolutamide (600 mg on day 5 \ntogether with food) resulted in a 1.7-fold increase in mean exposure (AUC0-72) and a 1.4-fold increase \nof Cmax of darolutamide. \n \nUGT1A9 inhibitors \nDarolutamide is a substrate of UGT1A9. \nNo clinically relevant drug-drug interaction is expected in case of UGT1A9 inhibitor administration.  \nDarolutamide may be given concomitantly with UGT1A9 inhibitors. \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that co-administration of UGT1A9 inhibitors with \ndarolutamide resulted in a 1.2-fold increase in exposure (AUC0-72) of darolutamide. \n \nEffects of darolutamide on other medicinal products \n \nBCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrates \nDarolutamide is an inhibitor of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and Organic Anion \nTransporting Polypeptides (OATP) 1B1 and 1B3. \nCo-administration of rosuvastatin should be avoided unless there is no therapeutic alternative. \nSelection of an alternative concomitant medicinal product with less potential to inhibit BCRP, \nOATP1B1 and OATP1B3 should be considered. \nAdministration of darolutamide (600 mg twice daily for 5 days) prior to co-administration of a single \ndose of rosuvastatin (5 mg) together with food resulted in approximately 5-fold increase in mean \nexposure (AUC) and Cmax of rosuvastatin. \nCo-administration of darolutamide with other BCRP substrates should be avoided where possible. \nCo-administration of darolutamide may increase the plasma concentrations of other concomitant \nBCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrates (e.g. methotrexate, sulfasalazine, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, \npitavastatin). Therefore, it is recommended to monitor patients for adverse reactions of BCRP, \nOATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrates. In addition, the related recommendation in the product \ninformation of these substrates should be followed when co-administered with darolutamide. \n \nP-gp substrates \nNo clinically relevant drug-drug interaction is expected in case of P-gp substrate administration. \nDarolutamide may be given concomitantly with P-gp substrates (e.g. digoxin, verapamil or \nnifedipine). Co-administration of darolutamide together with the sensitive P-gp substrate dabigatran \netexilate did not reveal any increase in exposure (AUC and Cmax) of dabigatran. \n \nCYP3A4 substrates \nDarolutamide is a mild inducer of CYP3A4. \nNo clinically relevant drug-drug interaction is expected in case of CYP substrate administration. \nDarolutamide may be given concomitantly with CYP substrates (e.g. warfarin, L-thyroxine, \nomeprazole). \nAdministration of darolutamide (600 mg twice daily for 9 days) prior to co-administration of a single \ndose of the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate midazolam (1 mg) together with food, decreased the mean \nexposure (AUC) and Cmax of midazolam by 29% and 32%, respectively. \nDarolutamide did not inhibit the metabolism of selected CYP substrates in vitro at clinically relevant \nconcentrations. \n \nMedicinal products that prolong the QT interval \nSince androgen deprivation treatment may prolong the QT interval, the co-administration with \nmedicinal products known to prolong the QT interval or medicinal products able to induce Torsade de \npointes should be carefully evaluated. These include medicinal products such as class IA (e.g., \nquinidine, disopyramide) or class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide) antiarrhythmic \nmedicinal products, methadone, moxifloxacin, and antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nThis medicinal product is not indicated in women of childbearing potential. It is not to be used in \nwomen who are, or may be, pregnant or breast-feeding (see sections 4.1 and 4.3). \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / contraception in males and females \n \nIt is not known whether darolutamide or its metabolites are present in semen. If the patient is engaged \nin sexual activity with a woman of childbearing potential, a highly effective contraceptive method \n(<1% failure rate per year) should be used during and for 1 week after completion of treatment with \nNUBEQA to prevent pregnancy. \n \nPregnancy  \n \nBased on its mechanism of action, darolutamide may cause foetal harm. No non-clinical reproductive \ntoxicity studies have been conducted (see section 5.3). \nIt is not known whether darolutamide or its metabolites are present in semen. If the patient is engaged \nin sexual activity with a pregnant woman, a condom should be used during and for 1 week after \ncompletion of treatment with NUBEQA. Exposure of the foetus to an androgen receptor inhibitor \nthrough seminal transfer to the pregnant woman has to be avoided, as this could affect development of \nthe foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether darolutamide or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. No studies in \nanimals have been conducted to evaluate the excretion of darolutamide or its metabolites into milk \n(see section 5.3). A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no human data on the effect of darolutamide on fertility. \nBased on animal studies, NUBEQA may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential (see \nsection 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNUBEQA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently observed adverse reaction is fatigue/asthenic conditions (15.8%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions observed are listed in Table 1 below. They are classified according to System \nOrgan Class. \nAdverse reactions are grouped according to their frequencies. Frequency groups are defined by the \nfollowing convention: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from \nthe available data). \nWithin each frequency group, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions reported in the ARAMIS study \nSystem organ class \n(MedDRA) \n\nVery common Common \n\nCardiac disorders  Ischaemic heart diseaseb \nHeart failurec \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n Rash \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\n Pain in extremity \nMusculoskeletal pain \nFractures \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\nFatigue/asthenic conditionsa  \n\nInvestigationsd Neutrophil count decreased \nBilirubin increased \nAST increased \n\n \n\na Includes fatigue and asthenia, lethargy and malaise. \nb Includes arteriosclerosis coronary artery, coronary artery disease, coronary artery occlusion, coronary \n\nartery stenosis, acute coronary syndrome, acute myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, angina unstable, \nmyocardial infarction, myocardial ischaemia. \n\nc Includes cardiac failure, cardiac failure acute, cardiac failure chronic, cardiac failure congestive, \ncardiogenic shock. \n\nd Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nFatigue \nFatigue/asthenic conditions were reported in 15.8% of patients treated with darolutamide and in 11.4% \nof patients treated with placebo. Events with worst grade of 3 were reported in 0.6% of patients treated \nwith darolutamide and in 1.1% of patients treated with placebo. Fatigue (not including asthenia, \nlethargy or malaise) occurred in the majority of patients (12.1% of patients treated with darolutamide \nand 8.7% of patients treated with placebo). \n \nFractures \nFractures occurred in 4.2% of patients treated with darolutamide and in 3.6% of patients treated with \nplacebo. \n \nIschaemic heart disease and heart failure \nIschaemic heart disease occurred in 3.2% of patients treated with darolutamide and in 2.5% of patients \ntreated with placebo. Grade 5 events occurred in 0.3% of patients treated with darolutamide and 0.2% \nof patients treated with placebo. Heart failure occurred in 1.9% of patients treated with darolutamide \nand in 0.9% of patients treated with placebo. \n \nNeutrophil count decreased \nNeutrophil count decreased was reported as a laboratory abnormality in 19.6% of patients treated with \ndarolutamide and in 9.4% of patients treated with placebo. The median time to nadir was 256 days. \nThe laboratory tests abnormalities manifested predominantly as grade 1 or 2 intensity. Neutrophil \ncount decreased of grade 3 and 4 was reported in 3.5% and 0.5% of patients, respectively. Only one \npatient permanently discontinued darolutamide due to neutropenia. Neutropenia was either transient or \nreversible (88% of patients) and were not associated with any clinically relevant signs or symptoms. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nBilirubin increased \nBilirubin increased was reported as a laboratory abnormality in 16.4% of patients treated with \ndarolutamide and in 6.9% of patients treated with placebo. The episodes were predominantly of \ngrade 1 or 2 intensity, not associated with any clinically relevant signs or symptoms, and reversible \nafter darolutamide was discontinued. Bilirubin increased of grade 3 was reported in 0.1% of patients \ntreated with darolutamide and in 0% of patients treated with placebo. In the darolutamide arm, the \nmean time to first onset of increased bilirubin was 153 days, and the mean duration of the first episode \nwas 182 days. No patients were discontinued from treatment due to increase in bilirubin. \n \nAST increased \nAST increased was reported as a laboratory abnormality in 22.5% of patients treated with \ndarolutamide and in 13.6% of patients treated with placebo. The episodes were predominantly of \ngrade 1 or 2 intensity, not associated with any clinically relevant signs or symptoms, and reversible \nafter darolutamide was discontinued. AST increased of grade 3 was reported in 0.5% of patients \ntreated with darolutamide and in 0.2% of patients treated with placebo. In the darolutamide arm, the \nmean time to first onset of increased AST was 258 days, and the mean duration of the first episode \nwas 118 days. No patients were discontinued from treatment due to increase in AST. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe highest dose of darolutamide studied clinically was 900 mg twice daily, equivalent to a total daily \ndose of 1800 mg. No dose limiting toxicities were observed with this dose. \nConsidering the saturable absorption (see section 5.2) and the absence of evidence for acute toxicity, \nan intake of a higher than recommended dose of darolutamide is not expected to lead to toxicity. \nIn the event of intake of a higher than recommended dose, treatment with darolutamide can be \ncontinued with the next dose as scheduled. \nThere is no specific antidote for darolutamide and symptoms of overdose are not established. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Endocrine therapy, anti-androgens; ATC code: L02BB06 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nDarolutamide is an androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor with a flexible polar-substituted pyrazole \nstructure that binds with high affinity directly to the receptor ligand binding domain. \nDarolutamide competitively inhibits androgen binding, AR nuclear translocation, and AR mediated \ntranscription. A major metabolite, keto-darolutamide, exhibited similar in vitro activity to \ndarolutamide. Darolutamide treatment decreases prostate tumour cell proliferation leading to potent \nantitumour activity. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nNo prolongation of the mean QTcF interval (i.e., greater than 10 ms) was observed after oral \nadministration of 600 mg darolutamide twice daily compared to placebo. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of darolutamide was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled multicentre phase III study (ARAMIS) in patients with non-metastatic (as assessed \nby conventional imaging CT, bone scan, MRI) castration resistant prostate cancer with a \nprostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) of \u2264 10 months.  \nPatients were included in the trial if they had 3 rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels after the \nnadir taken at least 1 week apart during androgen deprivation therapy, PSA \u2265 2 ng/mL at screening \nand castrate level of serum testosterone < 1.7 nmol/L. \nPatients with a medical history of seizure were allowed to enter the study. There were 12 patients \n(0.21%) enrolled on the darolutamide arm with a history of seizure. \nPatients with uncontrolled hypertension or recent (in the past 6 months) stroke, myocardial infarction, \nsevere/unstable angina pectoris, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, congestive heart failure New \nYork Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV were excluded from the study. \nPatients with prior treatment with second generation AR inhibitors such as enzalutamide, apalutamide \nand darolutamide, or CYP17 enzyme inhibitors such as abiraterone acetate as well as patients \nreceiving systemic corticosteroid with dose greater than the equivalent 10 mg of prednisone/day \nwithin 28 days before randomisation were excluded from the study. \nIn total, 1509 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either 600 mg darolutamide orally twice daily \n(n=955) or matching placebo (n=554). \nAll patients received a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue concurrently or had a \nbilateral orchiectomy. Patients with presence of pelvic lymph nodes < 2 cm in short axis below the \naortic bifurcation were allowed to enter the study. Absence or presence of metastasis was assessed by \nindependent central radiological review. Included in these analyses were 89 patients that were \nretrospectively identified with metastasis at baseline. Randomization was stratified by PSADT \n(\u2264 6 months or > 6 months) and use of osteoclast-targeted therapy at study entry (yes or no). \n \nThe following patient demographics and disease characteristics were balanced between treatment \narms. The median age was 74 years (range 48-95) and 9% of patients were 85 years of age or older. \nThe racial distribution was 79% White, 13% Asian, and 3% Black. A majority of patients had a \nGleason score of 7 or higher at diagnosis (73%). The median PSADT was 4.5 months. Nine percent \n(9%) of patients had prior orchiectomy, 25% of patients had prior prostatectomy and 50% of patients \nhad at least one prior radiotherapy. Seventy-six percent (76%) of patients received more than one prior \nanti-hormonal treatment. Patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status \n(ECOG PS) score of 0 (69%) or 1 (31%) at study entry. \n \nTreatment with darolutamide continued until radiographic disease progression as assessed by \nconventional imaging (CT, bone scan, MRI) by blinded central review, unacceptable toxicity or \nwithdrawal. \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was metastasis free survival (MFS). Secondary endpoints were overall \nsurvival (OS), time to pain progression, time to initiation of first cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate \ncancer, and time to first symptomatic skeletal events (defined as occurrence of any of the following: \nexternal beam radiotherapy to relieve skeletal symptoms, new symptomatic pathologic bone fracture, \nspinal cord compression, or tumour-related orthopaedic surgical intervention). \n \nTreatment with darolutamide resulted in an improvement in MFS compared to placebo (see Table 2 \nand Figure 1). \nMFS results were consistent across patient subgroups regardless of PSADT, prior use of \nbone-targeting agents or loco-regional disease. Additional subgroups with consistent MFS results \nincluded PSA at baseline, Gleason score at diagnosis, age, geographical region, ECOG PS at baseline, \nrace, and number of prior hormonal therapies. \nTreatment with darolutamide also resulted in a positive trend in overall survival (median was not \nreached in either arm at the time of the interim OS analysis) and a delay in time to pain progression \ncompared to placebo (see Table 2 and Figure 2). Time to initiation of first cytotoxic chemotherapy and \ntime to first symptomatic skeletal event were not mature at the time of primary analyses (see Table 2). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nTable 2: Efficacy results from the ARAMIS study \n\nEfficacy \nparameter \n\nNumber of events (%) Median (95% CI) \n\nHazard Ratioa  \n(95% Confidence \n\nInterval [CI]) \np-value \n\n(two-sided) \nDarolutamide \n\n(n=955) \nPlacebo \n(n=554) \n\nDarolutamide \n(n=955) \n\nPlacebo \n(n=554)  \n\nMetastasis \nfree survival  \n\n221 (23.1%) 216 (39.0%) 40.4 months \n(34.3, NR) \n\n18.4 months \n(15.5, 22.3) \n\n0.413 \n(0.341, 0.500) \n\n<0.000001 \nOverall \nsurvival \n\n78 (8.2%) 58 (10.5%) NR \n(44.5, NR) \n\nNR \n(NR, NR) \n\n0.706 \n(0.501, 0.994) \n\n0.045210b \nTime to pain \nprogressionc \n\n251 (26.3%) 178 (32.1%) 40.3 months \n(33.2, 41.2) \n\n25.4 months \n(19.1, 29.6) \n\n0.647 \n(0.533, 0.785) \n\n0.000008b \nTime to \ninitiation of \nfirst cytotoxic \nchemotherapy \n\n73 (7.6%) 79 (14.3%) NR \n(NR, NR) \n\n38.2 months \n(35.6, 41.9) 0.433 (0.314, 0.595) \n\n<0.000001b \n\nTime to first \nsymptomatic \nskeletal event \n\n16 (1.7%) 18 (3.2%) NR \n(NR, NR) \n\nNR \n(NR, NR) \n\n0.428 \n(0.218, 0.842) \n\n0.011262b \na Hazard ratio < 1 favours darolutamide \nb The p-value for OS did not reach the pre-defined threshold for statistical significance at the time of the \n\ninterim OS analysis.

In vitro, all three substances \nshow similar pharmacological activity. Darolutamide is poorly soluble in aqueous solvents over a \nlarge pH range and generally more soluble in organic solvents. \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing oral administration of 600 mg (2 tablets of 300 mg), peak plasma concentrations of \ndarolutamide of 4.79 mg/L (coefficient of variation: 30.9%) are usually reached around 4 hours after \nadministration. The ratio of the two diastereomers, (S,R)-darolutamide to (S,S)-darolutamide, changed \nfrom a 1:1 ratio in the tablet to an approximately 1:9 ratio in plasma based on AUC0-12 data at \nsteady-state. Following oral administration together with food, steady-state is reached after 2-5 days of \nrepeated twice-daily dosing. \nThe absolute bioavailability compared to an intravenous injection is approximately 30% following oral \nadministration of a NUBEQA tablet containing 300 mg darolutamide under fasted conditions. \nBioavailability of darolutamide was enhanced by 2.0- to 2.5-fold when administered with food. A \nsimilar increase of exposure was observed for the major metabolite keto-darolutamide.  \n \nDistribution \n \nThe apparent volume of distribution of darolutamide after intravenous administration is 119 L \nindicating that darolutamide is widely distributed throughout the body to both intracellular and \nextracellular fluid spaces. \nDarolutamide is moderately (92%) bound to human plasma proteins without any difference between \nthe two diastereomers. The major metabolite of darolutamide, keto-darolutamide, is highly (99.8%) \nbound to plasma proteins.  \nPassage of darolutamide across the blood-brain barrier has not been studied clinically. However, brain \nexposures to darolutamide in terms of AUC0-24 are very low with 4.5% of plasma exposure after single \ndose in rats and 1.9-3.9% after repeated dose in mice. This indicates low passage of darolutamide \nacross the intact blood-brain barrier in rats and mice and a low likelihood that darolutamide crosses the \nintact blood-brain barrier in humans to a clinically relevant extent. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nThe diastereomers (S,R)-darolutamide and (S,S)-darolutamide are able to interconvert via the \nmetabolite keto-darolutamide with a preference for (S,S)-darolutamide.  \nFollowing single oral administration of 300 mg14 C-darolutamide given as an oral solution, \nketo-darolutamide is the only major metabolite with about 2-fold higher total exposure in plasma \ncompared to darolutamide. Darolutamide and keto-darolutamide accounted together for 87.4% of \nthe 14 C-radioactivity in plasma indicating that all other metabolites are of minor importance.  \nDarolutamide is metabolised primarily by oxidative metabolism mediated mainly by CYP3A4, as well \nas by direct glucuronidation mediated preferentially by UGT1A9 and UGT1A1. In addition, mainly \nthe AKR1C isoforms were shown to catalyse the reduction of keto-darolutamide to the substance \ndiastereomers. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nElimination \n \nThe effective half-life of darolutamide and keto-darolutamide in plasma of patients is approximately \n20 hours. Of the two diastereomers comprising darolutamide, (S,R)-darolutamide has a shorter \neffective half-life of 9 hours compared to (S,S)-darolutamide with an effective half-life of 22 hours. \nThe clearance of darolutamide following intravenous administration was 116 mL/min (CV: 39.7%). A \ntotal of 63.4% of substance-related material is excreted in the urine (approximately 7% unchanged), \n32.4% is excreted in the faeces. More than 95% of the dose was recovered within 7 days after \nadministration. \n \nLinearity / Non-linearity \n \nIn the dose range of 100 to 700 mg (after single dose and at steady state), the exposure to the two \ndiastereomers and the major metabolite keto-darolutamide increases linearly in a nearly dose-related \nmanner. Based on a saturated absorption, no further increase in exposure to darolutamide was \nobserved at 900 mg twice daily.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of darolutamide were observed \n(65-95 years). \n \nRenal impairment \nIn a clinical pharmacokinetic study, AUC and Cmax for darolutamide were 2.5 and 1.6-fold higher in \npatients with severe renal impairment (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate [eGFR] 15 to \n29 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared to healthy volunteers. \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates a 1.1-, 1.3- and an approximately 1.5-fold higher \nexposure (AUC) of darolutamide in patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment (eGFR \n15 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared to patients with normal renal function. \nThe pharmacokinetics of darolutamide has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease \nreceiving dialysis (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn a clinical pharmacokinetic study, Cmax and AUC for darolutamide were 1.5 and 1.9-fold higher in \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) compared to healthy volunteers. There are \nno data for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). \n \nEthnic differences \nNo clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of darolutamide were observed based on \nethnicity (White, Japanese, non-Japanese Asian, Black or African American). A population \npharmacokinetic analysis indicated a 1.4-fold increase in exposure (AUC) in Japanese patients \ncompared to patients from all other regions. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSystemic toxicity \n \nIn repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs, the main findings were changes in the male \nreproductive organs (decreases in organ weight with atrophy of the prostate and epididymides). These \neffects occurred at systemic exposures in the range of or below the anticipated human exposure (based \non AUC comparison). Additional changes to reproductive tissues included minimal increase in \nvacuolation of the pituitary gland, atrophy and secretory reduction in seminal vesicles and mammary \nglands in rats as well as testicular hypospermia, seminiferous tubule dilatation and degeneration in \ndogs. Changes in the male reproductive organs in both species were consistent with the \npharmacological activity of darolutamide and reversed or partially resolved after 4- to 8-week \nrecovery periods. \n \nEmbryotoxicity / teratogenicity \n \nStudies on developmental toxicity have not been performed. \n \nReproduction toxicity \n \nStudies on reproductive toxicity have not been performed. However, male fertility is likely to be \nimpaired based on the findings in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs, which are consistent \nwith the pharmacological activity of darolutamide. \n \nGenotoxicity and carcinogenicity  \n \nDarolutamide did not induce mutations in the microbial mutagenesis (Ames) assay. At high \nconcentrations, darolutamide did induce structural chromosome aberrations in vitro in cultured human \nlymphocytes. However, in the in vivo combined bone marrow micronucleus test and the Comet assay \nin the liver and duodenum of the rat, no genotoxicity was observed at exposures in excess of the \nmaximum human exposure. Long-term animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of \ndarolutamide have not been conducted. \n \nSafety pharmacology \n \nIn vitro, darolutamide weakly inhibited the hERG potassium current and the L-type calcium channel. \nIn vivo, in anaesthetised dogs, darolutamide slightly decreased the QT interval duration, but this effect \nwas not found in conscious dogs. \n \n \n6.

What you need to know before you take NUBEQA \n3. How to take NUBEQA \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store NUBEQA \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What NUBEQA is and what it is used for \n \nNUBEQA contains the active substance darolutamide. It is used to treat adult men with prostate \ncancer that has not spread to other parts of the body and no longer responds to medical or surgical \ntreatment that lowers testosterone (also called castration-resistant prostate cancer). \n \nHow NUBEQA works \nNUBEQA blocks the activity of male sex hormones called androgens, such as testosterone. By \nblocking these hormones, darolutamide stops prostate cancer cells from growing and dividing. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take NUBEQA \n \nDo not take NUBEQA if \n- you are allergic to darolutamide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- you are a woman who is or may become pregnant. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking NUBEQA if \n- you have problems with your kidneys \n- you have problems with your liver \n- you have any heart conditions including heart rhythm problems or if you are using medicines \n\nfor these conditions \n- you had a surgery to treat blood vessel conditions. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine is not for use in children and adolescents under 18 years. Prostate cancer does not occur \nin this age group. \n \nOther medicines and NUBEQA \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nThe following medicines may influence the effect of NUBEQA, or NUBEQA may influence the effect \nof these medicines to treat: \n- bacterial infections, such as rifampicin \n- epilepsy, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin \n- symptoms of slightly low mood and mild anxiety: St. John's wort (a herbal medicine) \n- high cholesterol, such as rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin \n- severe joint inflammation, severe cases of the skin disease psoriasis, and cancers: methotrexate \n- inflammatory bowel diseases: sulfasalazine \n \nYour doctor may therefore change the dose of the medicines that you are taking. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nNUBEQA is not for use in women. \nThis medicine could possibly have an effect on male fertility. \nFollow these advices during and for 1 week after stopping: \n- use a highly effective method of contraception to prevent pregnancy, if you are having sex with \n\na woman who can become pregnant. \n- use a condom to protect the unborn baby, if you are having sex with a pregnant woman. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThis medicine is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nNUBEQA contains lactose \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take NUBEQA \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nThe recommended dose is \n2 tablets 2 times daily \n \nYour doctor may reduce your dose to 1 tablet 2 times daily, if you have problems with your liver or \nkidneys. \n \nMethod of use \nSwallow the tablets whole, take them with food and a glass of water. \n \nYour doctor may also prescribe other medicines while you are taking NUBEQA. \n \nIf you take more NUBEQA than you should \nContinue the treatment with the next dose as scheduled. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nIf you forget to take NUBEQA \nTake your missed dose as soon as you remember before the next scheduled dose. Do not take a double \ndose to make up for 1 or more forgotten tablets. \n \nIf you stop taking NUBEQA \nDo not stop taking this medicine unless your doctor tells you to. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSide effects of NUBEQA with the following frequencies: \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n- tiredness \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n- blockage of the arteries in the heart \n- heart failure \n- rash \n- pain in arms and legs \n- pain in muscles and bones \n- broken bones \n \nVery common side effects that may show up in blood tests: \n- reduced number of a white blood cell type called neutrophils \n- increased blood levels of substances produced by the liver: bilirubin, aspartate transaminase \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
