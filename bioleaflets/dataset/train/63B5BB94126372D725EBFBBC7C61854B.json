CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBreast cancer \n \nDocetaxel Teva in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is indicated for the adjuvant \ntreatment of patients with: \n \n\n\u2022 operable node-positive breast cancer \n\u2022 operable node-negative breast cancer \n\n \nFor patients with operable node-negative breast cancer, adjuvant treatment should be restricted to \npatients eligible to receive chemotherapy according to internationally established criteria for primary \ntherapy of early breast cancer (see section 5.1). \n \nDocetaxel Teva in combination with doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not previously received cytotoxic therapy for this \ncondition. \n \nDocetaxel Teva monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or \nmetastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic therapy. Previous chemotherapy should have \nincluded an anthracycline or an alkylating agent. \n \nDocetaxel Teva in combination with trastuzumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with \nmetastatic breast cancer whose tumours over express HER2 and who previously have not received \nchemotherapy for metastatic disease. \n \nDocetaxel Teva in combination with capecitabine is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Previous therapy should \nhave included an anthracycline. \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nDocetaxel Teva is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small \ncell lung cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy. \n \nDocetaxel Teva in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of patients with \nunresectable, locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in patients who have not \npreviously received chemotherapy for this condition. \n \nProstate cancer \n \nDocetaxel Teva in combination with prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the treatment of \npatients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer. \n \nGastric adenocarcinoma \n \nDocetaxel Teva in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the treatment of \npatients with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal \njunction, who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. \n \nHead and neck cancer \n \nDocetaxel Teva in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the induction \ntreatment of patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe use of docetaxel should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and it should only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the \nuse of anticancer chemotherapy (see section 6.6). \n \nPosology \n \nFor breast, non-small cell lung, gastric, and head and neck cancers, premedication consisting of an oral \ncorticosteroid, such as dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to \ndocetaxel administration, unless contraindicated, can be used (see section 4.4).  \nFor prostate cancer, given the concurrent use of prednisone or prednisolone the recommended \npremedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel \ninfusion (see section 4.4). \n \nProphylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological toxicities. \n \nDocetaxel is administered as a one-hour infusion every three weeks. \n \nBreast cancer \nIn the adjuvant treatment of operable node-positive and node-negative breast cancer, the \nrecommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and \ncyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles (TAC regimen) (see also Dose adjustments \nduring treatment). \nFor the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, the recommended dose \nof docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 in monotherapy. In first-line treatment, docetaxel 75 mg/m2 is given in \ncombination therapy with doxorubicin (50 mg/m2). \n \nIn combination with trastuzumab the recommended dose of docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 every three weeks, \nwith trastuzumab administered weekly. In the pivotal study the initial docetaxel infusion was started \nthe day following the first dose of trastuzumab. The subsequent docetaxel doses were administered \nimmediately after completion of the trastuzumab infusion, if the preceding dose of trastuzumab was \nwell tolerated. For trastuzumab dose and administration, see trastuzumab summary of product \ncharacteristics. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nIn combination with capecitabine, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every three weeks, \ncombined with capecitabine at 1,250 mg/m2 twice daily (within 30 minutes after a meal) for 2 weeks \nfollowed by a 1-week rest period. For capecitabine dose calculation according to body surface area, \nsee capecitabine summary of product characteristics. \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \nIn chemotherapy na\u00efve patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer, the recommended dose regimen \nis docetaxel 75 mg/m2 immediately followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 30-60 minutes. For treatment \nafter failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy, the recommended dose is 75 mg/m\u00b2 as a single \nagent. \n \nProstate cancer \nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2. Prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily \nis administered continuously (see section 5.1). \n \nGastric adenocarcinoma \nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion, followed by cisplatin \n75 mg/m2, as a 1-to 3-hour infusion (both on day 1 only), followed by 5-fluorouracil 750 mg /m2 per \nday given as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 5 days, starting at the end of the cisplatin infusion. \nTreatment is repeated every three weeks. Patients must receive premedication with antiemetics and \nappropriate hydration for cisplatin administration. Prophylactic G-CSF should be used to mitigate the \nrisk of haematological toxicities (see also Dose adjustments during treatment). \n \nHead and neck cancer \nPatients must receive premedication with antiemetics and appropriate hydration (prior to and after \ncisplatin administration). Prophylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological \ntoxicities. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the TAX 323 and TAX 324 studies, \nreceived prophylactic antibiotics. \n \n\u2022 Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX 323) \n\nFor the induction treatment of inoperable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head \nand neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion \nfollowed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 1 hour, on day one, followed by 5-fluorouracil as a \ncontinuous infusion at 750 mg/m2 per day for five days. This regimen is administered every \n3 weeks for 4 cycles. Following chemotherapy, patients should receive radiotherapy. \n \n\n\u2022 Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX 324) \nFor the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced (technically unresectable, low \nprobability of surgical cure, and aiming at organ preservation) squamous cell carcinoma of the \nhead and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour \nintravenous infusion on day 1, followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered as a 30-minute to \n3 hour infusion, followed by 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2/day as a continuous infusion from day \n1 to day 4. This regimen is administered every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. Following chemotherapy, \npatients should receive chemoradiotherapy. \n\n \nFor cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose modifications, see the corresponding summary of product \ncharacteristics. \n \nDose adjustments during treatment \n \nGeneral \nDocetaxel should be administered when the neutrophil count is \u22651,500 cells/mm3. \nIn patients who experienced either febrile neutropenia, neutrophil count <500 cells/mm3 for more than \none week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions or severe peripheral neuropathy during docetaxel \ntherapy, the dose of docetaxel should be reduced from 100 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2 and/or from \n\n\n\n5 \n\n75 to 60 mg/m\u00b2. If the patient continues to experience these reactions at 60 mg/m\u00b2, the treatment \nshould be discontinued. \n \nAdjuvant therapy for breast cancer \nPrimary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive docetaxel, doxorubicin and \ncyclophosphamide (TAC) adjuvant therapy for breast cancer.  Patients who experience febrile \nneutropenia and/or neutropenic infection should have their docetaxel dose reduced to 60 mg/m2 in all \nsubsequent cycles (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  Patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis should \nhave their dose decreased to 60 mg/m\u00b2. \n \nIn combination with cisplatin \nFor patients who are dosed initially at docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in combination with cisplatin and whose \nnadir of platelet count during the previous course of therapy is <25,000 cells/mm3, or in patients who \nexperience febrile neutropenia, or in patients with serious non-haematologic toxicities, the docetaxel \ndose in subsequent cycles should be reduced to 65 mg/m2. For cisplatin dose adjustments, see the \ncorresponding summary of product characteristics. \n \nIn combination with capecitabine \n\u2022 For capecitabine dose modifications, see capecitabine summary of product characteristics. \n\u2022 For patients developing the first appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, which persists at the time of the \n\nnext docetaxel/capecitabine treatment, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0-1, and resume \nat 100% of the original dose. \n\n\u2022 For patients developing the second appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, or the first appearance of \nGrade 3 toxicity, at any time during the treatment cycle, delay treatment until resolved to \nGrade 0-1 and then resume treatment with docetaxel 55 mg/m\u00b2. \n\n\u2022 For any subsequent appearances of toxicities, or any Grade 4 toxicities, discontinue the \ndocetaxel dose. \n\n \nFor trastuzumab dose modifications, see trastuzumab summary of product characteristics. \n \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil \nIf an episode of febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection occurs despite \nG-CSF use, the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. If subsequent episodes of \ncomplicated neutropenia occur the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 60 to 45 mg/m2. In case of \nGrade 4 thrombocytopenia the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. Patients should \nnot be retreated with subsequent cycles of docetaxel until neutrophils recover to a level \n> 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level > 100,000 cells/mm3. Discontinue treatment if these \ntoxicities persist (see section 4.4). \nRecommended dose modifications for toxicities in patients treated with docetaxel in combination with \ncisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU): \n \n\nToxicity Dose adjustment \n\nDiarrhoea grade 3  First episode: reduce 5-FU dose by 20%.  \nSecond episode: then reduce docetaxel dose by 20%.  \n\nDiarrhoea grade 4  First episode: reduce docetaxel and 5-FU doses by 20%.  \nSecond episode: discontinue treatment.  \n\nStomatitis/mucositis grade 3  First episode: reduce 5-FU dose by 20%.  \nSecond episode: stop 5-FU only, at all subsequent cycles.  \nThird episode: reduce docetaxel dose by 20%.  \n\nStomatitis/mucositis grade 4  First episode: stop 5-FU only, at all subsequent cycles.  \nSecond episode: reduce docetaxel dose by 20%.  \n\n  \nFor cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose adjustments, see the corresponding summary of product \ncharacteristics. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nIn the pivotal SCCHN studies patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (including prolonged \nneutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection), it was recommended to use G-CSF to provide \nprophylactic coverage (eg, day 6-15) in all subsequent cycles. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment  \nBased on pharmacokinetic data with docetaxel at 100 mg/m\u00b2 as single agent, patients who have both \nelevations of transaminase (ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal \nrange (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 times the ULN, the recommended dose of \ndocetaxel is 75 mg/m2 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). For those patients with serum bilirubin >ULN and/or \nALT and AST >3.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase >6 times the ULN, no \ndose-reduction can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric \nadenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN \nassociated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 \u00d7 ULN, and bilirubin> 1 x ULN; for these patients, no \ndose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No \ndata are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other \nindications. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Docetaxel Teva in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in children aged 1 month to \nless than 18 years have not yet been established. \nThere is no relevant use of Docetaxel Teva in the paediatric population in the indications breast \ncancer, non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric carcinoma and head and neck cancer, not \nincluding type II and III less differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. \n \nElderly \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, there are no special instructions for use in the \nelderly. In combination with capecitabine, for patients 60 years of age or more, a starting dose \nreduction of capecitabine to 75% is recommended (see capecitabine summary of product \ncharacteristics). \n \nMethod of administration \nFor instructions on preparation and administration of the product, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nDocetaxel must not be used in patients with baseline neutrophil count of <1,500 cells/mm3. \n \nDocetaxel must not be used in patients with severe liver impairment since there is no data available \n(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nContraindications for other medicinal products also apply, when combined with docetaxel. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor breast and non-small cell lung cancers, premedication consisting of an oral corticosteroid, such as \ndexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel \nadministration, unless contraindicated, can reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well \nas the severity of hypersensitivity reactions. For prostate cancer, the premedication is oral \ndexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.2). \n \nHaematology \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nNeutropenia is the most frequent adverse reaction of docetaxel. Neutrophil nadirs occurred at a median \nof 7 days but this interval may be shorter in heavily pre-treated patients. Frequent monitoring of \ncomplete blood counts should be conducted on all patients receiving docetaxel. Patients should be \nretreated with docetaxel when neutrophils recover to a level \u22651,500 cells/mm3 (see section 4.2). \n \nIn the case of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3 for seven days or more) during a course of \ndocetaxel therapy, a reduction in dose for subsequent courses of therapy or the use of appropriate \nsymptomatic measures are recommended (see section 4.2). \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TCF), febrile \nneutropenia and neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received prophylactic \nG-CSF. Patients treated with TCF should receive prophylactic G-CSF to mitigate the risk of \ncomplicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). \nPatients receiving TCF should be closely monitored, (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC), \nfebrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received \nprimary G-CSF prophylaxis.  Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who \nreceive adjuvant therapy with TAC for breast cancer to mitigate the risk of complicated neutropenia \n(febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection).  Patients receiving TAC should \nbe closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nGastrointestinal reactions  \n \nCaution is recommended for patients with neutropenia, particularly at risk for developing \ngastrointestinal complications. Although majority of cases occurred during the first or second cycle of \ndocetaxel containing regimen, enterocolitis could develop at any time, and could lead to death as early \nas on the first day of onset. Patients should be closely monitored for early manifestations of serious \ngastrointestinal toxicity (see sections 4.2, 4.4 Haematology, and 4.8). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nPatients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions especially during the first and \nsecond infusions. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following the initiation \nof the infusion of docetaxel, thus facilities for the treatment of hypotension and bronchospasm should \nbe available. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, minor symptoms such as flushing or localised \ncutaneous reactions do not require interruption of therapy. However, severe reactions, such as severe \nhypotension, bronchospasm or generalised rash/erythema require immediate discontinuation of \ndocetaxel and appropriate therapy. Patients who have developed severe hypersensitivity reactions \nshould not be re-challenged with docetaxel. Patients who have previously experienced a \nhypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel may be at risk to develop hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel, \nincluding more severe hypersensitivity reaction. These patients should be closely monitored during \ninitiation of docetaxel therapy. \n \nCutaneous reactions \n \nLocalised skin erythema of the extremities (palms of the hands and soles of the feet) with oedema \nfollowed by desquamation has been observed. Severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by \ndesquamation which lead to interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nFluid retention \n \nPatients with severe fluid retention such as pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and ascites should be \nmonitored closely. \n \nRespiratory disorders \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nAcute respiratory distress syndrome, interstitial pneumonia/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, \npulmonary fibrosis and respiratory failure have been reported and may be associated with fatal \noutcome.  Cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant \nradiotherapy. \nIf new or worsening pulmonary symptoms develop, patients should be closely monitored, promptly \ninvestigated, and appropriately treated.  Interruption of docetaxel therapy is recommended until \ndiagnosis is available.  Early use of supportive care measures may help improve the condition.  The \nbenefit of resuming docetaxel treatment must be carefully evaluated. \n \nPatients with liver impairment \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 as single agent who have serum transaminase levels \n(ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the ULN concurrent with serum alkaline phosphatase levels \ngreater than 2.5 times the ULN, there is a higher risk of developing severe adverse reactions such as \ntoxic deaths including sepsis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage which can be fatal, febrile neutropenia, \ninfections, thrombocytopenia, stomatitis and asthenia. Therefore, the recommended dose of docetaxel \nin those patients with elevated liver function test (LFTs) is 75 mg/m2 and LFTs should be measured at \nbaseline and before each cycle (see section 4.2). \nFor patients with serum bilirubin levels >ULN and/or ALT and AST >3.5 times the ULN concurrent \nwith serum alkaline phosphatase levels >6 times the ULN, no dose-reduction can be recommended \nand docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric \nadenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN \nassociated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 \u00d7 ULN, and bilirubin> 1 x ULN; for these patients, no \ndose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No \ndata are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other \nindications. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \n \nThere are no data available in patients with severely impaired renal function treated with docetaxel. \n \nNervous system \n \nThe development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see section 4.2). \n \nCardiac toxicity \n \nHeart failure has been observed in patients receiving docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, \nparticularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin)-containing chemotherapy. This may \nbe moderate to severe and has been associated with death (see section 4.8). \n \nWhen patients are candidates for treatment with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, they \nshould undergo baseline cardiac assessment. Cardiac function should be further monitored during \ntreatment (e.g. every three months) to help identify patients who may develop cardiac dysfunction. For \nmore details see summary of product characteristics of trastuzumab. \n \nVentricular arrhythmia including ventricular tachycardia (sometimes fatal) has been reported in \npatients treated with docetaxel in combination regimens including doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil and/ or \ncyclophosphamide (see section 4.8). \nBaseline cardiac assessment is recommended. \n \nEye disorders \n \nCystoid macular oedema (CMO) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel.  Patients with \nimpaired vision should undergo a prompt and complete ophthalmologic examination.  In case CMO is \n\n\n\n9 \n\ndiagnosed, docetaxel treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated (see section \n4.8). \n \nSecond primary malignancies \n \nSecond primary malignancies have been reported when docetaxel was given in combination with \nanticancer treatments known to be associated with second primary malignancies.  Second primary \nmalignancies (including acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and non-Hodgkin \nlymphoma) may occur several months or years after docetaxel-containing therapy. Patients should be \nmonitored for second primary malignancies (see section 4.8). \n \nOthers \n \nContraceptive measures must be taken by both men and women during treatment and for men at least \n6 months after cessation of therapy (see section 4.6). \n \nThe concomitant use of docetaxel with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nclarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin and \nvoriconazole) should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \nAdditional cautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer \n \nComplicated neutropenia \nFor patients who experience complicated neutropenia (prolonged neutropenia, febrile neutropenia or \ninfection), G-CSF and dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.2). \n \nGastrointestinal reactions \nSymptoms such as early abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, diarrhoea, with or without neutropenia, \nmay be early manifestations of serious gastrointestinal toxicity and should be evaluated and treated \npromptly. \n \nCongestive heart failure (CHF) \nPatients should be monitored for symptoms of congestive heart failure during therapy and during the \nfollow up period.  In patients treated with the TAC regimen for node positive breast cancer, the risk of \nCHF has been shown to be higher during the first year after treatment (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nPatients with 4+ nodes \nAs the benefit observed in patient with 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on disease-free \nsurvival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC in patients with 4+ \nnodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis (see section 5.1). \n \nElderly \nThere are limited data available in patients > 70 years of age on docetaxel use in combination with \ndoxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. \n \nOf the 333 patients treated with docetaxel every three weeks in a prostate cancer study, 209 patients \nwere 65 years of age or greater and 68 patients were older than 75 years. In patients treated with \ndocetaxel every three weeks, the incidence of related nail changes occurred at a rate \u2265 10% higher in \npatients who were 65 years of age or greater compared to younger patients. The incidence of related \nfever, diarrhoea, anorexia, and peripheral oedema occurred at rates \u2265 10% higher in patients who were \n75 years of age or greater versus less than 65 years. \n \nAmong the 300 (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in the phase II part) \npatients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in the gastric cancer \nstudy, 74 were 65 years of age or older and 4 patients were 75 years of age or older. The incidence of \nserious adverse events was higher in older people compared to younger patients. \n\n\n\n10 \n\nThe incidence of the following adverse events (all grades): lethargy, stomatitis, neutropenic infection \noccurred at rates \u2265 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or older compared to younger \npatients. \nOlder people treated with TCF should be closely monitored. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains 25.1 % (w/w) ethanol, anhydrous (alcohol), i.e. up to 181 mg ethanol, \nanhydrous per concentrate vial, equivalent to 4.6 ml beer or 1.9 ml wine. \n \nHarmful for those suffering from alcoholism. \nTo be taken into account in pregnant or breastfeeding women, children and high-risk groups such as \npatients with liver disease, or epilepsy. \n \nConsideration should be given to possible effects on the central nervous system. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe amount of alcohol in this medicinal product may alter the effects of other medicinal products. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant \nadministration of compounds which induce, inhibit or are metabolised by (and thus may inhibit the \nenzyme competitively) cytochrome P450-3A such as ciclosporine, ketoconazole and erythromycin. As \na result, caution should be exercised when treating patients with these medicinal products as \nconcomitant therapy since there is a potential for a significant interaction. \n \nIn case of combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors, the occurrence of docetaxel adverse reactions may \nincrease, as a result of reduced metabolism. If the concomitant use of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., \nketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, \ntelithromycin and voriconazole) cannot be avoided, a close clinical surveillance is warranted and a \ndose adjustment of docetaxel may be suitable during the treatment with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor \n(see section 4.4). In a pharmacokinetic study with 7 patients, the co-administration of docetaxel with \nthe strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole leads to a significant decrease in docetaxel clearance by \n49%. \nDocetaxel pharmacokinetics in the presence of prednisone was studied in patients with metastatic \nprostate cancer. Docetaxel is metabolised by CYP3A4 and prednisone is known to induce CYP3A4.  \nNo statistically significant effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. \n \nDocetaxel is highly protein bound (>95%). Although the possible in vivo interaction of docetaxel with \nconcomitantly administered medicinal product has not been investigated formally, in vitro interactions \nwith tightly protein-bound agents such as erythromycin, diphenhydramine, propranolol, propafenone, \nphenytoin, salicylate, sulfamethoxazole and sodium valproate did not affect protein binding of \ndocetaxel. In addition, dexamethasone did not affect protein binding of docetaxel. Docetaxel did not \ninfluence the binding of digitoxin. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their \nco-administration. Limited data from a single uncontrolled study were suggestive of an interaction \nbetween docetaxel and carboplatin. When combined to docetaxel, the clearance of carboplatin was \nabout 50% higher than values previously reported for carboplatin monotherapy. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is no information on the use of docetaxel in pregnant women. Docetaxel has been shown to be \nboth embryotoxic and foetotoxic in rabbits and rats, and to reduce fertility in rats. As with other \n\n\n\n11 \n\ncytotoxic medicinal products, docetaxel may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant \nwomen. Therefore, docetaxel must not be used during pregnancy unless clearly indicated.  \n \nWomen of childbearing age receiving docetaxel should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant, and to \ninform the treating physician immediately should this occur. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nDocetaxel is a lipophilic substance but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. \nConsequently, because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast feeding must be \ndiscontinued for the duration of docetaxel therapy. \n \nContraception in males and females \n \nAn effective method of contraception should be used during treatment. \n \nFertility \n \nIn non clinical studies, docetaxel has genotoxic effects and may alter male fertility (see section 5.3). \nTherefore, men being treated with docetaxel are advised not to father a child during and up to \n6 months after treatment and to seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. The amount of \nalcohol in this medicinal product and the side effects of the product may impair the ability to drive or \nuse machines (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Therefore, patients should be warned of the potential impact \nof the amount of alcohol and the side effects of this medicinal product on the ability to drive or use \nmachines, and be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience these side effects during \ntreatment. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile for all indications \n \nThe adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of docetaxel \nhave been obtained in: \n\u2022 1,312 and 121 patients who received 100 mg/m\u00b2 and 75 mg/m\u00b2 of docetaxel as a single agent \n\nrespectively. \n\u2022 258 patients who received docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin. \n\u2022 406 patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin. \n\u2022 92 patients treated with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab. \n\u2022 255 patients who received docetaxel in combination with capecitabine. \n\u2022 332 patients who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone (clinically \n\nimportant treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\u2022 1,276 patients (744 and 532 in TAX 316 and GEICAM 9805 respectively) who received \n\ndocetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (clinically important \ntreatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n\u2022 300 gastric adenocarcinoma patients (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and \n79 patients in the phase II part) who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and \n5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n\u2022 174 and 251 head and neck cancer patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin \nand 5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n \nThese reactions were described using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (grade 3 = G3; \ngrade 3-4 = G3/4; grade 4 = G4), the COSTART and the MedDRA terms. Frequencies are defined as: \n\n\n\n12 \n\nvery common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 \nto < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions of docetaxel alone are: neutropenia (which was \nreversible and not cumulative; the median day to nadir was 7 days and the median duration of severe \nneutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was 7 days), anaemia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhoea \nand asthenia. The severity of adverse events of docetaxel may be increased when docetaxel is given in \ncombination with other chemotherapeutic agents. \n \nFor combination with trastuzumab, adverse events (all grades) reported in \u2265 10% are displayed. There \nwas an increased incidence of SAEs (40% vs. 31%) and Grade 4 AEs (34% vs. 23%) in the \ntrastuzumab combination arm compared to docetaxel monotherapy. \n \nFor combination with capecitabine, the most frequent treatment-related undesirable effects  (\u2265 5%) \nreported in a phase III study in breast cancer patients failing anthracycline treatment are presented (see \ncapecitabine summary of product characteristics). \n \nThe following adverse reactions are frequently observed with docetaxel: \n \nImmune system disorders \n \nHypersensitivity reactions have generally occurred within a few minutes following the start of the \ninfusion of docetaxel and were usually mild to moderate. The most frequently reported symptoms \nwere flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnoea and fever or chills.  \nSevere reactions were characterised by hypotension and/or bronchospasm or generalized \nrash/erythema (see section 4.4). \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nThe development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.4). Mild to moderate neuro-sensory signs are characterised by paraesthesia, dysesthesia or pain \nincluding burning. Neuro-motor events are mainly characterised by weakness. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n \nReversible cutaneous reactions have been observed and were generally considered as mild to \nmoderate. Reactions were characterised by a rash including localised eruptions mainly on the feet and \nhands (including severe hand and foot syndrome), but also on the arms, face or thorax, and frequently \nassociated with pruritus. Eruptions generally occurred within one week after the docetaxel infusion. \nLess frequently, severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by desquamation which rarely lead to \ninterruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Severe \nnail disorders are characterised by hypo- or hyperpigmentation and sometimes pain and onycholysis. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nInfusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyper pigmentation, inflammation, \nredness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis or extravasation and swelling of the vein. \nFluid retention includes events such as peripheral oedema and less frequently pleural effusion, \npericardial effusion, ascites and weight gain. The peripheral oedema usually starts at the lower \nextremities and may become generalised with a weight gain of 3 kg or more. Fluid retention is \ncumulative in incidence and severity (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions in breast cancer for Docetaxel 100 mg/m\u00b2 single agent \n\n\n\n13 \n\nMedDRA system \norgan classes  \n\nVery common adverse \nreactions  \n\nCommon adverse \nreactions   \n\nUncommon adverse \nreactions  \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nInfections (G3/4: 5.7%; \nincluding sepsis and \npneumonia, fatal in \n1.7%) \n\nInfection associated \nwith G4 neutropenia \n(G3/4: 4.6%) \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nNeutropenia (G4: \n76.4%);  \nAnaemia (G3/4: 8.9%);  \nFebrile neutropenia \n\nThrombocytopenia \n(G4: 0.2%) \n\n \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\nHypersensitivity (G3/4: \n5.3%) \n\n  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nAnorexia   \n\nNervous system \ndisorders  \n\nPeripheral sensory \nneuropathy (G3: 4.1%);  \nPeripheral motor \nneuropathy (G3/4: 4%);  \nDysgeusia (severe: \n0.07%)  \n\n  \n\nCardiac disorders  Arrhythmia (G3/4: \n0.7%) \n\nCardiac failure \n\nVascular disorders  Hypotension; \nHypertension; \nHaemorrhage \n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nDyspnoea (severe: \n2.7%) \n\n  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders  \n\nStomatitis (G3/4: 5.3%); \nDiarrhoea (G3/4: 4%); \nNausea (G3/4: 4%); \nVomiting (G3/4: 3%) \n\nConstipation (severe \n0.2%); \nAbdominal pain \n(severe 1%); \nGastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage (severe: \n0.3%) \n\nOesophagitis (severe: \n0.4%) \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nAlopecia; \nSkin reaction (G3/4: \n5.9%); \nNail disorders (severe:  \n2.6%) \n\n  \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nMyalgia (severe: 1.4%) Arthralgia  \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nFluid retention (severe: \n6.5%); \nAsthenia (severe:  \n11.2%); \nPain \n\nInfusion site reaction; \nNon-cardiac chest \npain (severe: 0.4%) \n\n \n\nInvestigations  G3/4 Blood bilirubin \nincreased (< 5%); \nG3/4 Blood alkaline \nphosphatase increased \n(< 4%);  \nG3/4 AST increased \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nMedDRA system \norgan classes  \n\nVery common adverse \nreactions  \n\nCommon adverse \nreactions   \n\nUncommon adverse \nreactions  \n\n(< 3%); \nG3/4 ALT increased \n(< 2%) \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions in breast cancer for Docetaxel 100 mg/m2 single agent \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nRare: bleeding episodes associated with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. \n \nNervous system disorders \nReversibility data are available among 35.3% of patients who developed neurotoxicity following \ndocetaxel treatment at 100 mg/m\u00b2 as single agent.

In the docetaxel plus trastuzumab arm, \n64% had received a prior anthracycline as adjuvant therapy compared with 55% in the docetaxel arm \nalone. \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nVery common: Haematological toxicity was increased in patients receiving trastuzumab and \ndocetaxel, compared with docetaxel alone (32% grade 3/4 neutropenia versus 22%, using NCI-CTC \ncriteria). Note that this is likely to be an underestimate since docetaxel alone at a dose of 100 mg/m2 is \nknown to result in neutropenia in 97% of patients, 76% grade 4, based on nadir blood counts. The \nincidence of febrile neutropenia/neutropenic sepsis was also increased in patients treated with \nHerceptin plus docetaxel (23% versus 17% for patients treated with docetaxel alone). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions in breast cancer for Docetaxel 75 mg/m\u00b2 in combination with \ncapecitabine \n \nMedDRA system organ \nclasses  \n\nVery common adverse \nreactions  \n\nCommon adverse reactions \n \n\nInfections and infestations  Oral candidiasis (G3/4: <1%) \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nNeutropenia (G3/4: 63%);

These reactions sometimes appear during the infusion of the medicinal product. \n \nEye disorders \nVery rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring \nduring infusion of the medicinal product and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been \nreported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion. Cases of lacrimation with or \nwithout conjunctivitis, as cases of lacrimal duct obstruction resulting in excessive tearing have been \nrarely reported. Cases of cystoid macular oedema (CMO) have been reported in patients treated with \ndocetaxel. \n \nEar and labyrinth disorders \nRare cases of ototoxicity, hearing impaired and/or hearing loss have been reported. \n \nCardiac disorders \nRare cases of myocardial infarction have been reported. \nVentricular arrhythmia including ventricular tachycardia (frequency not known), sometimes fatal, has \nbeen reported in patients treated with docetaxel in combination regimens including doxorubicin, 5-\nfluorouracil and/ or cyclophosphamide. \n \nVascular disorders \nVenous thromboembolic events have rarely been reported. \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nAcute respiratory distress syndrome and cases of interstitial pneumonia/pneumonitis, interstitial lung \ndisease, pulmonary fibrosis and respiratory failure sometimes fatal have rarely been reported.

In some \ncases concomitant factors may have contributed to the development of these effects. Scleroderma-like \nchanges usually preceded by peripheral lymphoedema have been reported with docetaxel.  Cases of \npermanent alopecia (frequency not known) have been reported. \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nRenal insufficiency and renal failure have been reported.  In about 20% of these cases there were no \nrisk factors for acute renal failure such as concomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products and gastro-\nintestinal disorders. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nRadiation recall phenomena have rarely been reported. \nInjection site recall reaction (recurrence of skin reaction at a site of previous extravasation following \nadministration of docetaxel at a different site) has been observed at the site of previous extravasation \n(frequency not known). \nFluid retention has not been accompanied by acute episodes of oliguria or hypotension. Dehydration \nand pulmonary oedema have rarely been reported. \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nCases of electrolyte imbalance have been reported. Cases of hyponatraemia have been reported, \nmostly associated with dehydration, vomiting and pneumonia. Hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, and \nhypocalcaemia were observed, usually in association with gastrointestinal disorders and in particular \nwith diarrhoea. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere were a few reports of overdose. There is no known antidote for docetaxel overdose. In case of \noverdose, the patient should be kept in a specialised unit and vital functions closely monitored. In \ncases of overdose, exacerbation of adverse events may be expected. The primary anticipated \ncomplications of overdose would consist of bone marrow suppression, peripheral neurotoxicity and \nmucositis. Patients should receive therapeutic G-CSF as soon as possible after discovery of overdose. \nOther appropriate symptomatic measures should be taken, as needed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Taxanes, ATC Code: L01CD 02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nDocetaxel is an antineoplastic agent which acts by promoting the assembly of tubulin into stable \nmicrotubules and inhibits their disassembly which leads to a marked decrease of free tubulin. The \nbinding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. \n \nDocetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for \nvital mitotic and interphase cellular functions. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nDocetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and \nagainst freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular \nconcentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some \nbut not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance \ngene. In vivo, docetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental anti-tumour \nactivity against advanced murine and human grafted tumours. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nBreast cancer \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n27 \n\n \nDocetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide: adjuvant therapy \n\nPatients with operable node-positive breast cancer (TAX 316) \n\nData from a multi-centre open-label randomised study support the use of docetaxel for the adjuvant \ntreatment of patients with operable node-positive breast cancer and KPS \u2265 80%, between 18 and \n70 years of age. After stratification according to the number of positive lymph nodes (1-3, 4+), \n1,491 patients were randomised to receive either docetaxel 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after \ndoxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 \nfollowed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (FAC arm). Both regimens \nwere administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-hour infusion; \nall other medicinal products were given as intravenous bolus on day one. G-CSF was administered as \nsecondary prophylaxis to patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, \nprolonged neutropenia, or infection). Patients on the TAC arm received antibiotic prophylaxis with \nciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. In \nboth arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with positive oestrogen and/or progesterone \nreceptors received tamoxifen 20 mg daily for up to 5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was prescribed \naccording to guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 69% of patients who \nreceived TAC and 72% of patients who received FAC. \nTwo interim analyses and one final analysis were performed. The first interim analysis was planned 3 \nyears after the date when half of study enrolment was done. The second interim analysis was done \nafter 400 DFS events had been recorded overall, which led to a median follow-up of 55 months. The \nfinal analysis was performed when all patients had reached their 10-year follow-up visit (unless they \nhad a DFS event or were lost to follow-up before).  Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary \nefficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) was the secondary efficacy endpoint.  \n \nA final analysis was performed with an actual median follow up of 96 months.  Significantly longer \ndisease-free survival for the TAC arm compared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. Incidence of \nrelapses at 10 years was reduced in patients receiving TAC compared to those who received FAC \n(39% versus 45%, respectively) i.e. an absolute risk reduction by 6% (p=0.0043). Overall survival at \n10 years was also significantly increased with TAC compared to FAC (76% versus 69%, respectively) \ni.e. an absolute reduction of the risk of death by 7% (p=0.002). As the benefit observed in patients \nwith 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on DFS and OS, the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC \nin patients with 4+ nodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis. \n \nOverall, the study results demonstrate a positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC. \n \nTAC-treated patient subsets according to prospectively defined major prognostic factors were \nanalysed: \n \n\n  Disease free survival Overall survival \nPatient subset \n\n \nNumber \n\nof \npatients \n\nHazard \nratio* \n\n \n\n95% CI p= Hazard \nratio* \n\n \n\n95% CI p= \n\nNo of positive \nnodes \n\n       \n\nOverall 745 0.80 0.68-0.93 0.0043 0.74 0.61-0.90 0.0020 \n1-3 467 0.72 0.58-0.91 0.0047 0.62 0.46-0.82 0.0008 \n4+ 278 0.87 0.70-1.09 0.2290 0.87 0.67-1.12 0.2746 \n\n*a hazard ratio of less than 1 indicates that TAC is associated with a longer disease-free survival and \noverall survival compared to FAC \n \nPatients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy (GEICAM 9805) \n \nData from a multi-centre open-label randomised trial support the use of Docetaxel for the adjuvant \ntreatment of patients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy. \n1,060 patients were randomised to receive either Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after \n\n\n\n28 \n\ndoxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (539 patients in TAC arm), or doxorubicin \n50 mg/m2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclosphosphamide 500 mg/m2 (521 patients in \nFAC arm), as adjuvant treatment of operable node-negative breast cancer patients with high risk of \nrelapse according to 1998 St. Gallen criteria (tumour size >2 cm and/or negative ER and PR and/or \nhigh histological/nuclear grade (grade 2 to 3) and /or age <35 years). Both regimens were administered \nonce every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-hour infusion, all other medicinal \nproducts were given intraveinously on day 1 every three weeks. Primary prophylactic G-CSF was \nmade mandatory in TAC arm after 230 patients were randomised. The incidence of Grade 4 \nneutropenia, febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection was decreased in patients who received \nprimary G-CSF prophylaxis (see section 4.8). In both arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, \npatients with ER+ and/or PgR+ tumours received tamoxifen 20 mg once a day for up to 5 years. \nAdjuvant radiation therapy was administered according to guidelines in place at participating \ninstitutions and was given to 57.3% of patients who received TAC and 51.2% of patients who received \nFAC. \n \nOne primary analysis and one updated analysis were performed. The primary analysis was done when \nall patients had a follow-up of greater than 5 years (median follow-up time of 77 months). The updated \nanalysis was performed when all patients had reached their 10-year (median follow up time of 10 \nyears and 5 months) follow-up visit (unless they had a DFS event or were lost to follow-up \npreviously). Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) \nwas the secondary efficacy endpoint. \n \nAt the median follow-up time of 77 months, significantly longer disease-free survival for the TAC arm \ncompared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. TAC-treated patients had a 32% reduction in the risk of \nrelapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% CI (0.49-0.93), p = 0.01). At the \nmedian follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 16.5% reduction in the \nrisk of relapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.84, 95% CI (0.65-1.08), \np=0.1646). DFS data were not statistically significant but were still associated with a positive trend in \nfavour of TAC. \n \nAt the median follow-up time of 77 months, overall survival (OS) was longer in the TAC arm with \nTAC-treated patients having a 24% reduction in the risk of death compared to FAC (hazard ratio = \n0.76, 95% CI (0.46-1.26, p = 0.29). However, the distribution of OS was not significantly different \nbetween the 2 groups. \nAt the median follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 9% reduction in \nthe risk of death compared to FAC-treated patients (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% CI (0.63-1.32)).  \nThe survival rate was 93.7% in the TAC arm and 91.4% in the FAC arm, at the 8-year follow-up time \npoint, and 91.3% in the TAC arm and 89% in the FAC arm, at the 10-year follow-up time point. \n \nThe positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC remained unchanged. \n \nTAC-treated patient subsets according to prospectively defined major prognostic factors were \nanalysed in the primary analysis (at the median follow-up time of 77 months) (see table below): \n \n\nSubset Analyses-Adjuvant Therapy in Patients with Node-negative Breast Cancer Study (Intent-to-\nTreat Analysis) \n\n \nPatient subset Number of patients \n\nin TAC group \nDisease Free Survival \n\nHazard ratio* 95% CI \nOverall 539 0.68 0.49-0.93 \nAge category 1 \n<50 years \n\u226550 years \n\n \n260 \n279 \n\n \n0.67 \n0.67 \n\n \n0.43-1.05 \n0.43-1.05 \n\nAge category 2 \n<35 years \n\u226535 years \n\n \n42 \n497 \n\n \n0.31 \n0.73 \n\n \n0.11-0.89 \n0.52-1.01 \n\nHormonal receptor    \n\n\n\n29 \n\nstatus \nNegative \nPositive \n\n \n195 \n344 \n\n \n0.7 \n0.62 \n\n \n0.45-1.1 \n0.4-0.97 \n\nTumour size \n<2 cm \n>2 cm \n\n \n285 \n254 \n\n \n0.69 \n0.68 \n\n \n0.43-1.1 \n0.45-1.04 \n\nHistological grade \nGrade1 (includes grade \nnot assessed) \nGrade 2 \nGrade 3 \n\n \n64 \n\n \n216 \n259 \n\n \n0.79 \n\n \n0.77 \n0.59 \n\n \n0.24-2.6 \n\n \n0.46-1.3 \n0.39-0.9 \n\nMenopausal status \nPre-Menopausal \nPost-Menopausal \n\n \n285 \n254 \n\n \n0.64 \n0.72 \n\n \n0.40-1 \n\n0.47-1.12 \n*a hazard ratio (TAC/FAC) of less than 1 indicates that TAC is associated with a longer disease free survival \ncompared to FAC. \n \nExploratory subgroup analyses for disease-free survival for patients who meet the 2009 St. Gallen \nchemotherapy criteria \u2013 (ITT population) were performed and presented here below: \n\n \n  \n\nTAC \n \n\nFAC \nHazard ratio \n(TAC/FAC) \n\n \n\nSubgroups (n=539) (n=521) (95% CI) p-value \nMeeting relative indication \nfor chemotherapya \n\n    \n\nNo 18/214 \n(8.4%) \n\n26/227 \n(11.5%) \n\n0.796  \n(0.434 - 1.459) \n\n0.4593 \n\nYes 48/325 \n(14.8%) \n\n69/294 \n(23.5%) \n\n0.606  \n(0.42 - 0.877) \n\n0.0072 \n\nTAC = docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide \nFAC = 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophospamide \nCI = confidence interval; ER = oestrogen receptor \nPR = progesterone receptor \na ER/PR-negative or Grade 3 or tumour size >5 cm \n \nThe estimated hazard ratio was using Cox proportional hazard model with treatment group as the \nfactor. \n \nDocetaxel as single agent \n\nTwo randomised phase III comparative studies, involving a total of 326 alkylating or \n392 anthracycline failure metastatic breast cancer patients, have been performed with docetaxel at the \nrecommended dose and regimen of 100 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks. \n \nIn alkylating-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to doxorubicin (75 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks). \nWithout affecting overall survival time (docetaxel 15 months vs. doxorubicin 14 months, p=0.38) or \ntime to progression (docetaxel 27 weeks vs. doxorubicin 23 weeks, p=0.54), docetaxel increased \nresponse rate (52% vs. 37%, p=0.01) and shortened time to response (12 weeks vs. 23 weeks, \np=0.007). Three docetaxel patients (2%) discontinued the treatment due to fluid retention, whereas 15 \ndoxorubicin patients (9%) discontinued due to cardiac toxicity (three cases of fatal congestive heart \nfailure). \n \nIn anthracycline-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to the combination of mitomycin C and \nvinblastine (12 mg/m\u00b2 every 6 weeks and 6 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks). Docetaxel increased response rate \n(33% vs. 12%, p<0.0001), prolonged time to progression (19 weeks vs. 11 weeks, p=0.0004) and \nprolonged overall survival (11 months vs. 9 months, p=0.01). \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nDuring these two phase III studies, the safety profile of docetaxel was consistent with the safety \nprofile observed in phase II studies (see section 4.8). \n \nAn open-label, multi-centre, randomised phase III study was conducted to compare docetaxel \nmonotherapy and paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose previous \ntherapy should have included an anthracycline. A total of 449 patients were randomised to receive \neither docetaxel monotherapy 100 mg/m\u00b2 as a 1 hour infusion or paclitaxel 175 mg/m\u00b2 as a 3 hour \ninfusion. Both regimens were administered every 3 weeks. \nWithout affecting the primary endpoint, overall response rate (32% vs 25%, p=0.10), docetaxel \nprolonged median time to progression (24.6 weeks vs 15.6 weeks; p<0.01) and median survival \n(15.3 months vs 12.7 months; p=0.03). \nMore grade 3/4 adverse events were observed for docetaxel monotherapy (55.4%) compared to \npaclitaxel (23.0%). \n \nDocetaxel in combination with doxorubicin \n \nOne large randomised phase III study, involving 429 previously untreated patients with metastatic \ndisease, has been performed with doxorubicin (50 mg/m\u00b2) in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m\u00b2) \n(AT arm) versus doxorubicin (60 mg/m\u00b2) in combination with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m\u00b2) (AC \narm). Both regimens were administered on day 1 every 3 weeks. \n \n\u2022 Time to progression (TTP) was significantly longer in the AT arm versus AC arm, p=0.0138. \n\nThe median TTP was 37.3 weeks (95% CI:33.4 - 42.1) in AT arm and 31.9 weeks (95% CI: \n27.4 - 36.0) in AC arm. \n\n\u2022 Overall response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in the AT arm versus AC arm, p=0.009. \nThe ORR was 59.3% (95% CI: 52.8 - 65.9) in AT arm versus 46.5% (95% CI: 39.8 - 53.2) in \nAC arm. \n\n \nIn this study, AT arm showed a higher incidence of severe neutropenia (90% versus 68.6%), febrile \nneutropenia (33.3% versus 10%), infection (8% versus 2.4%), diarrhoea (7.5% versus 1.4%), asthenia \n(8.5% versus 2.4%), and pain (2.8% versus 0%) than AC arm. On the other hand, AC arm showed a \nhigher incidence of severe anemia (15.8% versus 8.5%) than AT arm, and, in addition, a higher \nincidence of severe cardiac toxicity: congestive heart failure (3.8% versus 2.8%), absolute LVEF \ndecrease \u2265 20% (13.1 % versus 6.1%), absolute LVEF decrease \u2265 30% (6.2% versus 1.1%). Toxic \ndeaths occurred in 1 patient in the AT arm (congestive heart failure) and in 4 patients in the AC arm \n(1 due to septic shock and 3 due to congestive heart failure). \nIn both arms, quality of life measured by the EORTC questionnaire was comparable and stable during \ntreatment and follow-up. \n \nDocetaxel in combination with trastuzumab \n \nDocetaxel in combination with trastuzumab was studied for the treatment of patients with metastatic \nbreast cancer whose tumours over express HER2, and who previously had not received chemotherapy \nfor metastatic disease. One hundred eighty six patients were randomised to receive docetaxel \n(100 mg/m2) with or without trastuzumab; 60% of patients received prior anthracycline-based adjuvant \nchemotherapy. Docetaxel plus trastuzumab was efficacious in patients whether or not they had \nreceived prior adjuvant anthracyclines. The main test method used to determine HER2 positivity in \nthis pivotal study was immunohistochemistry (IHC). A minority of patients were tested using \nfluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). In this study, 87% of patients had disease that was IHC 3+, \nand 95% of patients entered had disease that was IHC 3+ and/or FISH positive.

In this \nstudy, 255 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel (75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous \ninfusion every 3 weeks) and capecitabine (1,250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1-week \nrest period). 256 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel alone (100 mg/ m2 as a 1 hour \nintravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Survival was superior in the docetaxel +capecitabine \ncombination arm (p=0.0126). Median survival was 442 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 352 days \n(docetaxel alone). \nThe overall objective response rates in the all-randomised population (investigator assessment) were \n41.6% (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 29.7% (docetaxel alone); p = 0.0058. Time to progressive \ndisease was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine combination arm (p<0.0001). The median time to \nprogression was 186 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 128 days (docetaxel alone). \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \n \nPatients previously treated with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy \n \nIn a phase III study, in previously treated patients, time to progression (12.3 weeks versus 7 weeks) \nand overall survival were significantly longer for docetaxel at 75 mg/m\u00b2 compared to Best Supportive \nCare. The 1-year survival rate was also significantly longer in docetaxel (40%) versus BSC (16%). \nThere was less use of morphinic analgesic (p<0.01), non-morphinic analgesics (p<0.01), other disease \nrelated medications (p=0.06) and radiotherapy (p<0.01) in patients treated with docetaxel at 75 mg/m\u00b2 \ncompared to those with BSC. \nThe overall response rate was 6.8% in the evaluable patients, and the median duration of response was \n26.1 weeks. \n \nDocetaxel in combination with platinum agents in chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients \n \nIn a phase III study, 1,218 patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, with KPS of 70% or \ngreater, and who did not receive previous chemotherapy for this condition, were randomised to either \ndocetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion immediately followed by cisplatin (Cis) 75 mg/m2 over \n30-60 minutes every 3 weeks (TCis), docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion in combination with \ncarboplatin (AUC 6 mg/ml. min) over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks, or vinorelbine (V) 25 mg/m2 \nadministered over 6-10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22 followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered on \nday 1 of cycles repeated every 4 weeks (VCis). \n \nSurvival data, median time to progression and response rates for two arms of the study are illustrated \nin the following table: \n \n TCis \n\nn=408 \n \n\nVCis \nn=404 \n\n \n\nStatistical analysis \n\nOverall survival \n(Primary end-point): \n\n   \n\n\n\n32 \n\nMedian survival (months) 11.3 10.1 Hazard ratio: 1.122 \n[97.2% CI: 0.937; 1.342]* \n\n1-year Survival (%) 46 41 Treatment difference: 5.4% \n [95% CI: -1.1; 12.0] \n\n2-year Survival (%) 21 14 Treatment difference: 6.2% \n[95% CI: 0.2; 12.3] \n\nMedian time to progression     \n(weeks): 22.0 23.0 Hazard ratio: 1.032 \n\n[95% CI: 0.876; 1.216] \nOverall response rate (%):  31.6 24.5 Treatment difference: 7.1% \n\n[95% CI: 0.7; 13.5] \n*: Corrected for multiple comparisons and adjusted for stratification factors (stage of disease and \nregion of treatment), based on evaluable patient population. \n \nSecondary end-points included change of pain, global rating of quality of life by EuroQoL-5D, Lung \nCancer Symptom Scale, and changes in Karnosfky performance status. Results on these end-points \nwere supportive of the primary end-points results. \n \nFor docetaxel/carboplatin combination, neither equivalent nor non-inferior efficacy could be proven \ncompared to the reference treatment combination VCis. \n \nProstate cancer \n \nThe safety and efficacy of docetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone in patients with \nhormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer were evaluated in a randomised multi-centre phase III \nstudy. A total of 1,006 patients with KPS\u226560 were randomised to the following treatment groups: \n\u2022 Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. \n\u2022 Docetaxel 30 mg/m2 administered weekly for the first 5 weeks in a 6 week cycle for 5 cycles. \n\u2022 Mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. \nAll 3 regimens were administered in combination with prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily, \ncontinuously. \n \nPatients who received docetaxel every three weeks demonstrated significantly longer overall survival \ncompared to those treated with mitoxantrone.

A total of 445 patients with KPS>70 were treated with either docetaxel (T) \n(75 mg/m2 on day 1) in combination with cisplatin (C) (75 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (F) \n(750 mg/m2 per day for 5 days) or cisplatin (100 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (1,000 mg/m2 per \nday for 5 days). The length of a treatment cycle was 3 weeks for the TCF arm and 4 weeks for the CF \narm. \nThe median number of cycles administered per patient was 6 (with a range of 1-16) for the TCF arm \ncompared to 4 (with a range of 1-12) for the CF arm. Time to progression (TTP) was the primary \nendpoint. The risk reduction of progression was 32.1% and was associated with a significantly longer \nTTP (p=0.0004) in favour of the TCF arm. Overall survival was also significantly longer (p=0.0201) \nin favour of the TCF arm with a risk reduction of mortality of 22.7%.

Patients treated with TCF had a longer time to 5% definitive deterioration of global \nhealth status on the QLQ-C30 questionnaire (p=0.0121) and a longer time to definitive worsening of \nKarnofsky performance status (p=0.0088) compared to patients treated with CF. \n \nHead and neck cancer \n \n\u2022 Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX323) \n\nThe safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with squamous cell \ncarcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a phase III, multi-centre, open-label, \nrandomised study (TAX323). In this study, 358 patients with inoperable locally advanced SCCHN, \nand WHO performance status 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two treatment arms. Patients on the \ndocetaxel arm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 followed by cisplatin (P) 75 mg/m2 followed by \n5-fluorouracil (F) 750 mg/m2 per day as a continuous infusion for 5 days. This regimen was \nadministered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case at least a minor response (\u2265 25% reduction in \nbidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed after 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with \na minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not \nprogress received radiotherapy (RT) according to institutional guidelines for 7 weeks (TPF/RT). \nPatients on the comparator arm received cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m2 followed by 5-fluorouracil (F) \n1000 mg/m2 per day for 5 days. This regimen was administered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case \nat least a minor response (\u2265 25% reduction in bidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed \nafter 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval \nof 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to \ninstitutional guidelines for 7 weeks (PF/RT). Locoregional therapy with radiation was delivered either \nwith a conventional fraction (1.8 Gy - 2.0 Gy once a day, 5 days per week for a total dose of \n66 to 70 Gy), or accelerated/hyperfractionated regimens of radiation therapy (twice a day, with a \nminimum interfraction interval of 6 hours, 5 days per week). A total of 70 Gy was recommended for \naccelerated regimens and 74 Gy for hyperfractionated schemes. Surgical resection was allowed \nfollowing chemotherapy, before or after radiotherapy. Patients on the TPF arm received antibiotic \nprophylaxis with ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, \nor equivalent. The primary endpoint in this study, progression-free survival (PFS), was significantly \nlonger in the TPF arm compared to the PF arm, p = 0.0042 (median PFS: 11.4 vs. 8.3 months \nrespectively) with an overall median follow up time of 33.7 months. Median overall survival was also \nsignificantly longer in favour of the TPF arm compared to the PF arm (median OS: 18.6 vs. \n14.5 months respectively) with a 28% risk reduction of mortality, p = 0.0128.

Pain intensity score improved during treatment in both groups indicating adequate \npain management \n \n\u2022 Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX324) \nThe safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced \nsquamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a randomised, multi-centre \nopen-label, phase III study (TAX324). In this study, 501 patients, with locally advanced SCCHN, and \na WHO performance status of 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two arms. The study population \ncomprised patients with technically unresectable disease, patients with low probability of surgical cure \nand patients aiming at organ preservation. The efficacy and safety evaluation solely addressed survival \nendpoints and the success of organ preservation was not formally addressed. Patients on the docetaxel \narm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m\u00b2 by intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by cisplatin (P) \n100 mg/m\u00b2 administered as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion, followed by the \ncontinuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1,000 mg/m\u00b2/day from day 1 to day 4. The cycles \nwere repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to \nreceive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) as per protocol (TPF/CRT). Patients on the comparator arm \nreceived cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m\u00b2 as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion on day 1 followed \nby the continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1,000 mg/m\u00b2/day from day 1 to day 5. The \ncycles were repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease \nwere to receive CRT as per protocol (PF/CRT). \nPatients in both treatment arms were to receive 7 weeks of CRT following induction chemotherapy \nwith a minimum interval of 3 weeks and no later than 8 weeks after start of the last cycle (day 22 to \nday 56 of last cycle). During radiotherapy, carboplatin (AUC 1.5) was given weekly as a one-hour \nintravenous infusion for a maximum of 7 doses. Radiation was delivered with megavoltage equipment \nusing once daily fractionation (2 Gy per day, 5 days per week for 7 weeks, for a total dose of \n70-72 Gy). Surgery on the primary site of disease and/or neck could be considered at anytime \nfollowing completion of CRT. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the study received \nprophylactic antibiotics. The primary efficacy endpoint in this study, overall survival (OS) was \nsignificantly longer (log-rank test, p = 0.0058) with the docetaxel-containing regimen compared to PF \n(median OS: 70.6 versus 30.1 months respectively), with a 30% risk reduction in mortality compared \nto PF (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.90) with an overall median \nfollow up time of 41.9 months. The secondary endpoint, PFS, demonstrated a 29% risk reduction of \nprogression or death and a 22 month improvement in median PFS (35.5 months for TPF and 13.1 for \n\n\n\n36 \n\nPF). This was also statistically significant with an HR of 0.71; 95% CI 0.56-0.90; log-rank test \np = 0.004.

The kinetic profile of docetaxel is dose independent and consistent \nwith a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model with half lives for the \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 phases of 4 min, \n36 min and 11.1 h, respectively. The late phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of docetaxel \nfrom the peripheral compartment.  \n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing the administration of a 100 mg/m2 dose given as a one hour infusion a mean peak plasma \nlevel of 3.7 \u03bcg/ml was obtained with a corresponding AUC of 4.6 h.\u03bcg/ml. Mean values for total body \nclearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 21 l/h/m2 and 113 l, respectively. Inter \n\n\n\n37 \n\nindividual variation in total body clearance was approximately 50%. Docetaxel is more than 95% \nbound to plasma proteins. \n \nElimination \n \nA study of 14C-docetaxel has been conducted in three cancer patients. Docetaxel was eliminated in \nboth the urine and faeces following cytochrome P450-mediated oxidative metabolism of the tert-butyl \nester group, within seven days, the urinary and faecal excretion accounted for about 6% and 75% of \nthe administered radioactivity, respectively. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in faeces is \nexcreted during the first 48 hours as one major inactive metabolite and 3 minor inactive metabolites \nand very low amounts of unchanged medicinal product. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAge and gender \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed with docetaxel in 577 patients. \nPharmacokinetic parameters estimated by the model were very close to those estimated from phase I \nstudies. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel were not altered by the age or sex of the patient.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn a small number of patients (n=23) with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver \nfunction impairment (ALT, AST \u22651.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase \u22652.5 times \nthe ULN), total clearance was lowered by 27% on average (see section 4.2).  \n \nFluid retention \nDocetaxel clearance was not modified in patients with mild to moderate fluid retention and there are \nno data available in patients with severe fluid retention. \n \nCombination therapy \n \nDoxorubicin \nWhen used in combination, docetaxel does not influence the clearance of doxorubicin and the plasma \nlevels of doxorubicinol (a doxorubicin metabolite). The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin \nand cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their coadministration. \n \nCapecitabine \nPhase I study evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and vice \nversa showed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no \neffect by docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of a relevant capecitabine metabolite 5\u2019-DFUR. \n \nCisplatin \nClearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that observed following \nmonotherapy. The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin administered shortly after docetaxel infusion is \nsimilar to that observed with cisplatin alone. \n \nCisplatin and 5-fluorouracil \nThe combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid \ntumours had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual medicinal product. \n \nPrednisone and dexamethasone \nThe effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered with standard \ndexamethasone premedication has been studied in 42 patients.  \n \nPrednisone \nNo effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \nThe carcinogenic potential of docetaxel has not been studied. \n \nDocetaxel has been shown to be mutagenic in the in vitro micronucleus and chromosome aberration \ntest in CHO-K1 cells and in the in vivo micronucleus test in the mouse. However, it did not induce \nmutagenicity in the Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay. These results are consistent \nwith the pharmacological activity of docetaxel. \n \nUndesirable effects on the testis observed in rodent toxicity studies suggest that docetaxel may impair \nmale fertility. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nConcentrate vial:  \nPolysorbate 80 \nEthanol, anhydrous \n \nSolvent vial:  \nWater for injections \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nsection 6.6. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n\u2022 18 months. \n\u2022 Premix solution: Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 8 hours when \n\nstored either between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C or at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C). From a \nmicrobiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, \nin-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would \nnormally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 to 8\u00b0C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled \nand validated aseptic conditions. \n\n\u2022 Infusion solution: Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 4 hours at \nroom temperature (below 25\u00b0C). From a microbiological point of view, the product should be \nused immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are \nthe responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 to 8\u00b0C, unless \ndilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n\n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \n\nDo not store above 25\u00b0C. \nDo not freeze. \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \nFor storage conditions of the diluted medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n\n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container  \n \nEach carton contains: \n\u2022 One vial of concentrate and, \n\u2022 One vial of solvent \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n\u2022 Docetaxel Teva 20 mg/0.72 ml concentrate for solution for infusion vial  \n6 ml clear glass Type I vial with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and a flip-off cap. \n\n \nThis vial contains 0.72 ml of a 27.73 mg/ml solution of docetaxel in polysorbate 80 (fill volume: \n24.4 mg/0.88 ml). This fill volume has been established during the development of docetaxel to \ncompensate for liquid loss during preparation of the premix due to foaming, adhesion to the \nwalls of the vial and \"dead-volume\". This overfill ensures that after dilution with the entire \ncontents of the accompanying solvent for docetaxel vial, there is a minimal extractable premix \nvolume of 2 ml containing 10 mg/ml docetaxel which corresponds to the labelled amount of \n20 mg/0.72 ml per vial. \n\n \nSolvent vial \n6 ml clear glass Type I vial with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and a flip-off cap. \n \nSolvent vial contains 1.28 ml of water for injections (fill volume: 1.71 ml). The addition of the \nentire contents of the solvent vial to the contents of the Docetaxel Teva 20 mg/0.72 ml \nconcentrate for solution for infusion vial ensures a premix concentration of 10 mg/ml docetaxel. \n\n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nDocetaxel Teva is an antineoplastic agent and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution \nshould be exercised when handling it and preparing Docetaxel solutions. The use of gloves is \nrecommended. \n \nIf Docetaxel Teva concentrate, premix solution or infusion solution should come into contact with \nskin, wash immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If Docetaxel concentrate, premix solution \nor infusion solution should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash immediately and \nthoroughly with water. \n \nPreparation for the intravenous administration \n\na) Preparation of the Docetaxel Teva premix solution (10 mg docetaxel/ml) \n\nIf the vials are stored under refrigeration, allow the required number of Docetaxel Teva boxes to stand \nat room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) for 5 minutes. \n \nUsing a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw the entire contents of the solvent for \nDocetaxel Teva vial by partially inverting the vial. \n \nInject the entire contents of the syringe into the corresponding Docetaxel Teva vial. \n \nRemove the syringe and needle and mix manually by repeated inversions for at least 45 seconds. Do \nnot shake. \n \nAllow the premix vial to stand for 5 minutes at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and then check that \nthe solution is homogenous and clear (foaming is normal even after 5 minutes due to the presence of \npolysorbate 80 in the formulation). \n \nThe premix solution contains 10 mg/ml docetaxel and should be used immediately after preparation. \nHowever the chemical and physical stability of the premix solution has been demonstrated for 8 hours \nwhen stored either between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C or at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C). \n \nb) Preparation of the infusion solution \n\nMore than one premix vial may be necessary to obtain the required dose for the patient. Based on the \nrequired dose for the patient expressed in mg, aseptically withdraw the corresponding premix volume \ncontaining 10 mg/ml docetaxel from the appropriate number of premix vials using graduated syringes \n\n\n\n40 \n\nfitted with a needle. For example, a dose of 140 mg docetaxel would require 14 ml docetaxel premix \nsolution. \n \nInject the required premix volume into a non-PVC 250 ml infusion bag or bottle containing either 5% \nglucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. \n \nIf a dose greater than 200 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so \nthat a concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. \n \nMix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. \n \nThe Docetaxel Teva infusion solution should be used within 4 hours and should be aseptically \nadministered as a 1-hour infusion under room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and normal lighting \nconditions. \n \nAs with all parenteral products, Docetaxel Teva premix solution and infusion solution should be \nvisually inspected prior to use, solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBreast cancer \n \nDocetaxel Teva in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is indicated for the adjuvant \ntreatment of patients with: \n\n\u2022 operable node-positive breast cancer \n\u2022 operable node-negative breast cancer \n\n \nFor patients with operable node-negative breast cancer, adjuvant treatment should be restricted to \npatients eligible to receive chemotherapy according to internationally established criteria for primary \ntherapy of early breast cancer (see section 5.1). \n \nDocetaxel Teva in combination with doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not previously received cytotoxic therapy for this \ncondition. \n \nDocetaxel Teva monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or \nmetastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic therapy. Previous chemotherapy should have \nincluded an anthracycline or an alkylating agent. \n \nDocetaxel Teva in combination with trastuzumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with \nmetastatic breast cancer whose tumours over express HER2 and who previously have not received \nchemotherapy for metastatic disease. \n \nDocetaxel Teva in combination with capecitabine is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Previous therapy should \nhave included an anthracycline. \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nDocetaxel Teva is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small \ncell lung cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy. \n \nDocetaxel Teva in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of patients with \nunresectable, locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in patients who have not \npreviously received chemotherapy for this condition. \n \nProstate cancer \n \nDocetaxel Teva in combination with prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the treatment of \npatients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer. \n \nGastric adenocarcinoma \n \nDocetaxel Teva in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the treatment of \npatients with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal \njunction, who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. \n \nHead and neck cancer \n \nDocetaxel Teva in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the induction \ntreatment of patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe use of docetaxel should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and it should only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the \nuse of anticancer chemotherapy (see section 6.6). \n \nPosology \n \nFor breast, non-small cell lung, gastric, and head and neck cancers, premedication consisting of an oral \ncorticosteroid, such as dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to \ndocetaxel administration, unless contraindicated, can be used (see section 4.4).  \nFor prostate cancer, given the concurrent use of prednisone or prednisolone the recommended \npremedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel \ninfusion (see section 4.4). \n \nProphylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological toxicities. \n \nDocetaxel is administered as a one-hour infusion every three weeks. \n \nBreast cancer \nIn the adjuvant treatment of operable node-positive and node-negative breast cancer, the \nrecommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and \ncyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles (TAC regimen) (see also Dose adjustments \nduring treatment). \nFor the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, the recommended dose \nof docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 in monotherapy. In first-line treatment, docetaxel 75 mg/m2 is given in \ncombination therapy with doxorubicin (50 mg/m2). \n \nIn combination with trastuzumab the recommended dose of docetaxel is 100 mg/m2 every three weeks, \nwith trastuzumab administered weekly. In the pivotal study the initial docetaxel infusion was started \nthe day following the first dose of trastuzumab. The subsequent docetaxel doses were administered \nimmediately after completion of the trastuzumab infusion, if the preceding dose of trastuzumab was \nwell tolerated. For trastuzumab dose and administration, see trastuzumab summary of product \ncharacteristics. \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \nIn combination with capecitabine, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every three weeks, \ncombined with capecitabine at 1,250 mg/m2 twice daily (within 30 minutes after a meal) for 2 weeks \nfollowed by a 1-week rest period. For capecitabine dose calculation according to body surface area, \nsee capecitabine summary of product characteristics. \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \nIn chemotherapy na\u00efve patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer, the recommended dose regimen \nis docetaxel 75 mg/m2 immediately followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 30-60 minutes. For treatment \nafter failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy, the recommended dose is 75 mg/m\u00b2 as a single \nagent. \n \nProstate cancer \nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2. Prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg orally twice daily \nis administered continuously (see section 5.1). \n \nGastric adenocarcinoma \nThe recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion, followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2, \nas a 1 to 3 hour infusion (both on day 1 only), followed by 5-fluorouracil 750 mg /m2 per day given as \na 24-hour continuous infusion for 5 days, starting at the end of the cisplatin infusion. \nTreatment is repeated every three weeks. Patients must receive premedication with antiemetics and \nappropriate hydration for cisplatin administration. Prophylactic G-CSF should be used to mitigate the \nrisk of haematological toxicities (see also Dose adjustments during treatment). \n \nHead and neck cancer \nPatients must receive premedication with antiemetics and appropriate hydration (prior to and after \ncisplatin administration). Prophylactic G-CSF may be used to mitigate the risk of haematological \ntoxicities. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the TAX 323 and TAX 324 studies, \nreceived prophylactic antibiotics. \n \n\u2022 Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX 323) \n\nFor the induction treatment of inoperable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head \nand neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion \nfollowed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 1 hour, on day one, followed by 5-fluorouracil as a \ncontinuous infusion at 750 mg/m2 per day for five days. This regimen is administered every \n3 weeks for 4 cycles. Following chemotherapy, patients should receive radiotherapy. \n \n\n\u2022 Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX 324) \nFor the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced (technically unresectable, low \nprobability of surgical cure, and aiming at organ preservation) squamous cell carcinoma of the \nhead and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour \nintravenous infusion on day 1, followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered as a 30-minute to \n3 hour infusion, followed by 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2/day as a continuous infusion from day \n1 to day 4. This regimen is administered every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. Following chemotherapy, \npatients should receive chemoradiotherapy. \n\n \nFor cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose modifications, see the corresponding summary of product \ncharacteristics. \n \nDose adjustments during treatment \n \nGeneral \nDocetaxel should be administered when the neutrophil count is \u22651,500 cells/mm3. \nIn patients who experienced either febrile neutropenia, neutrophil count <500 cells/mm3 for more than \none week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions or severe peripheral neuropathy during docetaxel \ntherapy, the dose of docetaxel should be reduced from 100 mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2 and/or from \n\n\n\n44 \n\n75 to 60 mg/m\u00b2. If the patient continues to experience these reactions at 60 mg/m\u00b2, the treatment \nshould be discontinued. \n \nAdjuvant therapy for breast cancer \nPrimary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive docetaxel, doxorubicin and \ncyclophosphamide (TAC) adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. Patients who experience febrile \nneutropenia and/or neutropenic infection should have their docetaxel dose reduced to 60 mg/m2 in all \nsubsequent cycles (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis should \nhave their dose decreased to 60 mg/m\u00b2. \n \nIn combination with cisplatin \nFor patients who are dosed initially at docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in combination with cisplatin and whose \nnadir of platelet count during the previous course of therapy is <25,000 cells/mm3, or in patients who \nexperience febrile neutropenia, or in patients with serious non-haematologic toxicities, the docetaxel \ndose in subsequent cycles should be reduced to 65 mg/m2. For cisplatin dose adjustments, see the \ncorresponding summary of product characteristics. \n \nIn combination with capecitabine \n\u2022 For capecitabine dose modifications, see capecitabine summary of product characteristics. \n\u2022 For patients developing the first appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, which persists at the time of the \n\nnext docetaxel/capecitabine treatment, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0-1, and resume \nat 100% of the original dose. \n\n\u2022 For patients developing the second appearance of Grade 2 toxicity, or the first appearance of \nGrade 3 toxicity, at any time during the treatment cycle, delay treatment until resolved to \nGrade 0-1 and then resume treatment with docetaxel 55 mg/m\u00b2. \n\n\u2022 For any subsequent appearances of toxicities, or any Grade 4 toxicities, discontinue the \ndocetaxel dose. \n\n \nFor trastuzumab dose modifications, see trastuzumab summary of product characteristics. \n \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil \nIf an episode of febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection occurs despite \nG-CSF use, the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. If subsequent episodes of \ncomplicated neutropenia occur the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 60 to 45 mg/m2. In case of \nGrade 4 thrombocytopenia the docetaxel dose should be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m2. Patients should \nnot be retreated with subsequent cycles of docetaxel until neutrophils recover to a level \n> 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level > 100,000 cells/mm3. Discontinue treatment if these \ntoxicities persist (see section 4.4). \nRecommended dose modifications for toxicities in patients treated with docetaxel in combination with \ncisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU): \n \n\nToxicity Dose adjustment \n\nDiarrhoea grade 3  First episode: reduce 5-FU dose by 20%.  \nSecond episode: then reduce docetaxel dose by 20%.  \n\nDiarrhoea grade 4  First episode: reduce docetaxel and 5-FU doses by 20%.  \nSecond episode: discontinue treatment.  \n\nStomatitis/mucositis grade 3  First episode: reduce 5-FU dose by 20%.  \nSecond episode: stop 5-FU only, at all subsequent cycles.  \nThird episode: reduce docetaxel dose by 20%.  \n\nStomatitis/mucositis grade 4  First episode: stop 5-FU only, at all subsequent cycles.  \nSecond episode: reduce docetaxel dose by 20%.  \n\n  \nFor cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose adjustments, see the corresponding summary of product \ncharacteristics. \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nIn the pivotal SCCHN studies patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (including prolonged \nneutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection), it was recommended to use G-CSF to provide \nprophylactic coverage (eg, day 6-15) in all subsequent cycles. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment  \nBased on pharmacokinetic data with docetaxel at 100 mg/m\u00b2 as single agent, patients who have both \nelevations of transaminase (ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal \nrange (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 times the ULN, the recommended dose of \ndocetaxel is 75 mg/m2 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). For those patients with serum bilirubin >ULN and/or \nALT and AST >3.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase >6 times the ULN, no \ndose-reduction can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric \nadenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN \nassociated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 \u00d7 ULN, and bilirubin> 1 x ULN; for these patients, no \ndose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No \ndata are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other \nindications. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Docetaxel Teva in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in children aged 1 month to \nless than 18 years have not yet been established. \nThere is no relevant use of Docetaxel Teva in the paediatric population in the indications breast \ncancer, non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric carcinoma and head and neck cancer, not \nincluding type II and III less differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. \n \nElderly \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, there are no special instructions for use in the \nelderly. In combination with capecitabine, for patients 60 years of age or more, a starting dose \nreduction of capecitabine to 75% is recommended (see capecitabine summary of product \ncharacteristics). \n \nMethod of administration \nFor instructions on preparation and administration of the product, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nDocetaxel must not be used in patients with baseline neutrophil count of <1,500 cells/mm3. \n \nDocetaxel must not be used in patients with severe liver impairment since there is no data available \n(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nContraindications for other medicinal products also apply, when combined with docetaxel. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor breast and non-small cell lung cancers, premedication consisting of an oral corticosteroid, such as \ndexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel \nadministration, unless contraindicated, can reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well \nas the severity of hypersensitivity reactions. For prostate cancer, the premedication is oral \ndexamethasone 8 mg, 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion (see section 4.2). \n \nHaematology \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nNeutropenia is the most frequent adverse reaction of docetaxel. Neutrophil nadirs occurred at a median \nof 7 days but this interval may be shorter in heavily pre-treated patients. Frequent monitoring of \ncomplete blood counts should be conducted on all patients receiving docetaxel. Patients should be \nretreated with docetaxel when neutrophils recover to a level \u22651,500 cells/mm3 (see section 4.2). \n \nIn the case of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3 for seven days or more) during a course of \ndocetaxel therapy, a reduction in dose for subsequent courses of therapy or the use of appropriate \nsymptomatic measures are recommended (see section 4.2). \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TCF), febrile \nneutropenia and neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received prophylactic \nG-CSF. Patients treated with TCF should receive prophylactic G-CSF to mitigate the risk of \ncomplicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). \nPatients receiving TCF should be closely monitored, (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC), \nfebrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred at lower rates when patients received \nprimary G-CSF prophylaxis. Primary G-CSF prophylaxis should be considered in patients who receive \nadjuvant therapy with TAC for breast cancer to mitigate the risk of complicated neutropenia (febrile \nneutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). Patients receiving TAC should be \nclosely monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nGastrointestinal reactions  \n \nCaution is recommended for patients with neutropenia, particularly at risk for developing \ngastrointestinal complications. Although majority of cases occurred during the first or second cycle of \ndocetaxel containing regimen, enterocolitis could develop at any time, and could lead to death as early \nas on the first day of onset. Patients should be closely monitored for early manifestations of serious \ngastrointestinal toxicity (see sections 4.2, 4.4 Haematology, and 4.8). \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nPatients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions especially during the first and \nsecond infusions. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following the initiation \nof the infusion of docetaxel, thus facilities for the treatment of hypotension and bronchospasm should \nbe available. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, minor symptoms such as flushing or localised \ncutaneous reactions do not require interruption of therapy. However, severe reactions, such as severe \nhypotension, bronchospasm or generalised rash/erythema require immediate discontinuation of \ndocetaxel and appropriate therapy. Patients who have developed severe hypersensitivity reactions \nshould not be re-challenged with docetaxel. Patients who have previously experienced a \nhypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel may be at risk to develop hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel, \nincluding more severe hypersensitivity reaction. These patients should be closely monitored during \ninitiation of docetaxel therapy. \n \nCutaneous reactions \n \nLocalised skin erythema of the extremities (palms of the hands and soles of the feet) with oedema \nfollowed by desquamation has been observed. Severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by \ndesquamation which lead to interruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nFluid retention \n \nPatients with severe fluid retention such as pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and ascites should be \nmonitored closely. \n \nRespiratory disorders \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \nAcute respiratory distress syndrome, interstitial pneumonia/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, \npulmonary fibrosis and respiratory failure have been reported and may be associated with fatal \noutcome.  Cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant \nradiotherapy. \nIf new or worsening pulmonary symptoms develop, patients should be closely monitored, promptly \ninvestigated, and appropriately treated.  Interruption of docetaxel therapy is recommended until \ndiagnosis is available.  Early use of supportive care measures may help improve the condition.  The \nbenefit of resuming docetaxel treatment must be carefully evaluated. \n \nPatients with liver impairment \n \nIn patients treated with docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 as single agent who have serum transaminase levels \n(ALT and/or AST) greater than 1.5 times the ULN concurrent with serum alkaline phosphatase levels \ngreater than 2.5 times the ULN, there is a higher risk of developing severe adverse reactions such as \ntoxic deaths including sepsis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage which can be fatal, febrile neutropenia, \ninfections, thrombocytopenia, stomatitis and asthenia. Therefore, the recommended dose of docetaxel \nin those patients with elevated liver function test (LFTs) is 75 mg/m2 and LFTs should be measured at \nbaseline and before each cycle (see section 4.2). \nFor patients with serum bilirubin levels >ULN and/or ALT and AST >3.5 times the ULN concurrent \nwith serum alkaline phosphatase levels >6 times the ULN, no dose-reduction can be recommended \nand docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. \nIn combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric \nadenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical study excluded patients with ALT and/or AST > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN \nassociated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 \u00d7 ULN, and bilirubin> 1 x ULN; for these patients, no \ndose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated. No \ndata are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated by docetaxel in combination in the other \nindications. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \n \nThere are no data available in patients with severely impaired renal function treated with docetaxel. \n \nNervous system \n \nThe development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see section 4.2). \n \nCardiac toxicity \n \nHeart failure has been observed in patients receiving docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, \nparticularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin)-containing chemotherapy. This may \nbe moderate to severe and has been associated with death (see section 4.8). \n \nWhen patients are candidates for treatment with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab, they \nshould undergo baseline cardiac assessment. Cardiac function should be further monitored during \ntreatment (e.g. every three months) to help identify patients who may develop cardiac dysfunction. For \nmore details see summary of product characteristics of trastuzumab. \n \nVentricular arrhythmia including ventricular tachycardia (sometimes fatal) has been reported in \npatients treated with docetaxel in combination regimens including doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil and/or \ncyclophosphamide (see section 4.8). \nBaseline cardiac assessment is recommended. \n \nEye disorders \n \nCystoid macular oedema (CMO) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel.  Patients with \nimpaired vision should undergo a prompt and complete ophthalmologic examination.  In case CMO is \n\n\n\n48 \n\ndiagnosed, docetaxel treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated (see section \n4.8). \n \nSecond primary malignancies \n \nSecond primary malignancies have been reported when docetaxel was given in combination with \nanticancer treatments known to be associated with second primary malignancies. Second primary \nmalignancies (including acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and non-Hodgkin \nlymphoma) may occur several months or years after docetaxel-containing therapy. Patients should be \nmonitored for second primary malignancies (see section 4.8). \n \nOthers \n \nContraceptive measures must be taken by both men and women during treatment and for men at least \n6 months after cessation of therapy (see section 4.6). \n \nThe concomitant use of docetaxel with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, \nclarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin and \nvoriconazole) should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \nAdditional cautions for use in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer \n \nComplicated neutropenia \nFor patients who experience complicated neutropenia (prolonged neutropenia, febrile neutropenia or \ninfection), G-CSF and dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.2). \n \nGastrointestinal reactions \nSymptoms such as early abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, diarrhoea, with or without neutropenia, \nmay be early manifestations of serious gastrointestinal toxicity and should be evaluated and treated \npromptly. \n \nCongestive heart failure (CHF) \nPatients should be monitored for symptoms of congestive heart failure during therapy and during the \nfollow up period.  In patients treated with the TAC regimen for node positive breast cancer, the risk of \nCHF has been shown to be higher during the first year after treatment (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nPatients with 4+ nodes \nAs the benefit observed in patient with 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on disease-free \nsurvival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC in patients with 4+ \nnodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis (see section 5.1). \n \nElderly \nThere are limited data available in patients > 70 years of age on docetaxel use in combination with \ndoxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. \n \nOf the 333 patients treated with docetaxel every three weeks in a prostate cancer study, 209 patients \nwere 65 years of age or greater and 68 patients were older than 75 years. In patients treated with \ndocetaxel every three weeks, the incidence of related nail changes occurred at a rate \u2265 10% higher in \npatients who were 65 years of age or greater compared to younger patients. The incidence of related \nfever, diarrhoea, anorexia, and peripheral oedema occurred at rates \u2265 10% higher in patients who were \n75 years of age or greater versus less than 65 years. \n \nAmong the 300 (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in the phase II part) \npatients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in the gastric cancer \nstudy, 74 were 65 years of age or older and 4 patients were 75 years of age or older. The incidence of \nserious adverse events was higher in older people compared to younger patients. \n\n\n\n49 \n\nThe incidence of the following adverse events (all grades): lethargy, stomatitis, neutropenic infection \noccurred at rates \u2265 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or older compared to younger \npatients. \nOlder people treated with TCF should be closely monitored. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains 25.1 % (w/w) ethanol, anhydrous (alcohol), i.e. up to 723 mg ethanol, \nanhydrous per concentrate vial, equivalent to 18.3 ml beer or 7.6 ml wine. \n \nHarmful for those suffering from alcoholism. \nTo be taken into account in pregnant or breastfeeding women, children and high-risk groups such as \npatients with liver disease, or epilepsy. \n \nConsideration should be given to possible effects on the central nervous system. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe amount of alcohol in this medicinal product may alter the effects of other medicinal products. \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant \nadministration of compounds which induce, inhibit or are metabolised by (and thus may inhibit the \nenzyme competitively) cytochrome P450-3A such as ciclosporine, ketoconazole and erythromycin. As \na result, caution should be exercised when treating patients with these medicinal products as \nconcomitant therapy since there is a potential for a significant interaction. \n \nIn case of combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors, the occurrence of docetaxel adverse reactions may \nincrease, as a result of reduced metabolism. If the concomitant use of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., \nketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, \ntelithromycin and voriconazole) cannot be avoided, a close clinical surveillance is warranted and a \ndose-adjustment of docetaxel may be suitable during the treatment with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor \n(see section 4.4). In a pharmacokinetic study with 7 patients, the co-administration of docetaxel with \nthe strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole leads to a significant decrease in docetaxel clearance by \n49%. \nDocetaxel pharmacokinetics in the presence of prednisone was studied in patients with metastatic \nprostate cancer. Docetaxel is metabolised by CYP3A4 and prednisone is known to induce CYP3A4. \nNo statistically significant effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. \n \nDocetaxel is highly protein bound (>95%). Although the possible in vivo interaction of docetaxel with \nconcomitantly administered medicinal product has not been investigated formally, in vitro interactions \nwith tightly protein-bound agents such as erythromycin, diphenhydramine, propranolol, propafenone, \nphenytoin, salicylate, sulfamethoxazole and sodium valproate did not affect protein binding of \ndocetaxel. In addition, dexamethasone did not affect protein binding of docetaxel. Docetaxel did not \ninfluence the binding of digitoxin. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their \nco-administration. Limited data from a single uncontrolled study were suggestive of an interaction \nbetween docetaxel and carboplatin. When combined to docetaxel, the clearance of carboplatin was \nabout 50% higher than values previously reported for carboplatin monotherapy. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is no information on the use of docetaxel in pregnant women. Docetaxel has been shown to be \nboth embryotoxic and foetotoxic in rabbits and rats, and to reduce fertility in rats. As with other \n\n\n\n50 \n\ncytotoxic medicinal products, docetaxel may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant \nwomen. Therefore, docetaxel must not be used during pregnancy unless clearly indicated.  \n \nWomen of childbearing age receiving docetaxel should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant, and to \ninform the treating physician immediately should this occur. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nDocetaxel is a lipophilic substance but it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk.  \nConsequently, because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, breast feeding must be \ndiscontinued for the duration of docetaxel therapy. \n \nContraception in males and females \n \nAn effective method of contraception should be used during treatment. \n \nFertility \n \nIn non clinical studies, docetaxel has genotoxic effects and may alter male fertility (see section 5.3). \nTherefore, men being treated with docetaxel are advised not to father a child during and up to \n6 months after treatment and to seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. The amount of \nalcohol in this medicinal product and the side effects of the product may impair the ability to drive or \nuse machines (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Therefore, patients should be warned of the potential impact \nof the amount of alcohol and the side effects of this medicinal product on the ability to drive or use \nmachines, and be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience these side effects during \ntreatment. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile for all indications \n \nThe adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of docetaxel \nhave been obtained in: \n\u2022 1,312 and 121 patients who received 100 mg/m\u00b2 and 75 mg/m\u00b2 of docetaxel as a single agent \n\nrespectively. \n\u2022 258 patients who received docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin. \n\u2022 406 patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin. \n\u2022 92 patients treated with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab. \n\u2022 255 patients who received docetaxel in combination with capecitabine. \n\u2022 332 patients who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone (clinically \n\nimportant treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\u2022 1,276 patients (744 and 532 in TAX 316 and GEICAM 9805 respectively) who received \n\ndocetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (clinically important \ntreatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n\u2022 300 gastric adenocarcinoma patients (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and \n79 patients in the phase II part) who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and \n5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n\u2022 174 and 251 head and neck cancer patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin \nand 5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). \n\n \nThese reactions were described using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (grade 3 = G3; \ngrade 3-4 = G3/4; grade 4 = G4), the COSTART and the MedDRA terms. Frequencies are defined as: \n\n\n\n51 \n\nvery common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 \nto < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions of docetaxel alone are: neutropenia (which was \nreversible and not cumulative; the median day to nadir was 7 days and the median duration of severe \nneutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was 7 days), anaemia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhoea \nand asthenia. The severity of adverse events of docetaxel may be increased when docetaxel is given in \ncombination with other chemotherapeutic agents. \n \nFor combination with trastuzumab, adverse events (all grades) reported in \u2265 10% are displayed. There \nwas an increased incidence of SAEs (40% vs. 31%) and Grade 4 AEs (34% vs. 23%) in the \ntrastuzumab combination arm compared to docetaxel monotherapy. \n \nFor combination with capecitabine, the most frequent treatment-related undesirable effects (\u2265 5%) \nreported in a phase III study in breast cancer patients failing anthracycline treatment are presented (see \ncapecitabine summary of product characteristics). \n \nThe following adverse reactions are frequently observed with docetaxel: \n \nImmune system disorders \n \nHypersensitivity reactions have generally occurred within a few minutes following the start of the \ninfusion of docetaxel and were usually mild to moderate. The most frequently reported symptoms \nwere flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnoea and fever or chills.  \nSevere reactions were characterised by hypotension and/or bronchospasm or generalized \nrash/erythema (see section 4.4). \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nThe development of severe peripheral neurotoxicity requires a reduction of dose (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.4). Mild to moderate neuro-sensory signs are characterised by paraesthesia, dysesthesia or pain \nincluding burning. Neuro-motor events are mainly characterised by weakness. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n \nReversible cutaneous reactions have been observed and were generally considered as mild to \nmoderate. Reactions were characterised by a rash including localised eruptions mainly on the feet and \nhands (including severe hand and foot syndrome), but also on the arms, face or thorax, and frequently \nassociated with pruritus. Eruptions generally occurred within one week after the docetaxel infusion. \nLess frequently, severe symptoms such as eruptions followed by desquamation which rarely lead to \ninterruption or discontinuation of docetaxel treatment were reported (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Severe \nnail disorders are characterised by hypo- or hyperpigmentation and sometimes pain and onycholysis. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nInfusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyper pigmentation, inflammation, \nredness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis or extravasation and swelling of the vein. \nFluid retention includes events such as peripheral oedema and less frequently pleural effusion, \npericardial effusion, ascites and weight gain. The peripheral oedema usually starts at the lower \nextremities and may become generalised with a weight gain of 3 kg or more. Fluid retention is \ncumulative in incidence and severity (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions in breast cancer for Docetaxel 100 mg/m\u00b2 single agent \nMedDRA system \norgan classes  \n\nVery common adverse \nreactions  \n\nCommon adverse \nreactions   \n\nUncommon adverse \nreactions  \n\n\n\n52 \n\nMedDRA system \norgan classes  \n\nVery common adverse \nreactions  \n\nCommon adverse \nreactions   \n\nUncommon adverse \nreactions  \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nInfections (G3/4: 5.7%; \nincluding sepsis and \npneumonia, fatal in \n1.7%) \n\nInfection associated \nwith G4 neutropenia \n(G3/4: 4.6%) \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nNeutropenia (G4: \n76.4%);  \nAnaemia (G3/4: 8.9%);  \nFebrile neutropenia \n\nThrombocytopenia \n(G4: 0.2%) \n\n \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\nHypersensitivity (G3/4: \n5.3%) \n\n  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nAnorexia   \n\nNervous system \ndisorders  \n\nPeripheral sensory \nneuropathy (G3: 4.1%);  \nPeripheral motor \nneuropathy (G3/4: 4%);  \nDysgeusia (severe \n0.07%)  \n\n  \n\nCardiac disorders  Arrhythmia (G3/4: \n0.7%) \n\nCardiac failure \n\nVascular disorders  Hypotension; \nHypertension; \nHaemorrhage \n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nDyspnoea (severe: \n2.7%) \n\n  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders  \n\nStomatitis (G3/4: 5.3%); \nDiarrhoea (G3/4: 4%); \nNausea (G3/4: 4%); \nVomiting (G3/4: 3%) \n\nConstipation (severe: \n0.2%); \nAbdominal pain \n(severe: 1%); \nGastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage (severe: \n0.3%) \n\nOesophagitis (severe: \n0.4%) \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nAlopecia; \nSkin reaction (G3/4: \n5.9%); \nNail disorders (severe: \n2.6%) \n\n  \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nMyalgia (severe: 1.4%) Arthralgia  \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nFluid retention (severe: \n6.5%); \nAsthenia (severe: \n11.2%); \nPain \n\nInfusion site reaction; \nNon-cardiac chest \npain (severe: 0.4%) \n\n \n\nInvestigations  G3/4 Blood bilirubin \nincreased (< 5%); \nG3/4 Blood alkaline \nphosphatase increased \n\n \n\n\n\n53 \n\nMedDRA system \norgan classes  \n\nVery common adverse \nreactions  \n\nCommon adverse \nreactions   \n\nUncommon adverse \nreactions  \n\n(< 4%);  \nG3/4 AST increased \n(< 3%); \nG3/4 ALT increased \n(< 2%) \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions in breast cancer for Docetaxel 100 mg/m2 single agent \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nRare: bleeding episodes associated with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. \n \nNervous system disorders \nReversibility data are available among 35.3% of patients who developed neurotoxicity following \ndocetaxel treatment at 100 mg/m\u00b2 as single agent.

In the docetaxel plus trastuzumab arm, \n64% had received a prior anthracycline as adjuvant therapy compared with 55% in the docetaxel arm \nalone. \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nVery common: Haematological toxicity was increased in patients receiving trastuzumab and \ndocetaxel, compared with docetaxel alone (32% grade 3/4 neutropenia versus 22%, using NCI-CTC \ncriteria). Note that this is likely to be an underestimate since docetaxel alone at a dose of 100 mg/m2 is \nknown to result in neutropenia in 97% of patients, 76% grade 4, based on nadir blood counts. The \nincidence of febrile neutropenia/neutropenic sepsis was also increased in patients treated with \nHerceptin plus docetaxel (23% versus 17% for patients treated with docetaxel alone). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions in breast cancer for Docetaxel 75 mg/m\u00b2 in combination with \ncapecitabine \n \nMedDRA system organ \nclasses  \n\nVery common adverse \nreactions  \n\nCommon adverse reactions \n\nInfections and infestations  Oral candidiasis (G3/4: < 1%) \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nNeutropenia (G3/4: 63%);

Acute myeloid leukemia and \nmyelodysplastic syndrome have been reported (frequency uncommon) in pivotal clinical studies in \nbreast cancer with TAC regimen. \n \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nBone marrow suppression and other haematologic adverse reactions have been reported. Disseminated \nintravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multi-organ failure, has been \nreported. \n \nImmune system disorders \nSome cases of anaphylactic shock, sometimes fatal, have been reported. \nHypersensitivity reactions (frequency not known) have been reported with docetaxel in patients who \npreviously experienced hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel. \n \nNervous system disorders \nRare cases of convulsion or transient loss of consciousness have been observed with docetaxel \nadministration. These reactions sometimes appear during the infusion of the medicinal product. \n \nEye disorders \nVery rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring \nduring infusion of the medicinal product and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been \nreported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion. Cases of lacrimation with or \nwithout conjunctivitis, as cases of lacrimal duct obstruction resulting in excessive tearing have been \nrarely reported. Cases of cystoid macular oedema (CMO) have been reported in patients treated with \ndocetaxel. \n \nEar and labyrinth disorders \nRare cases of ototoxicity, hearing impaired and/or hearing loss have been reported. \n \nCardiac disorders \nRare cases of myocardial infarction have been reported. \nVentricular arrhythmia including ventricular tachycardia (frequency not known), sometimes fatal, has \nbeen reported in patients treated with docetaxel in combination regimens including doxorubicin, 5-\nfluorouracil and/or cyclophosphamide. \n \nVascular disorders \nVenous thromboembolic events have rarely been reported. \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nAcute respiratory distress syndrome and cases of interstitial pneumonia/pneumonitis, interstitial lung \ndisease, pulmonary fibrosis and respiratory failure sometimes fatal have rarely been reported. Rare \ncases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant radiotherapy. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nRare cases of enterocolitis, including colitis, ischemic colitis, and neutropenic enterocolitis, have been \nreported with a potential fatal outcome (frequency not known).  \nRare occurrences of dehydration have been reported as a consequence of gastrointestinal events \nincluding enterocolitis and gastrointestinal perforation.  \nRare cases of ileus and intestinal obstruction have been reported. \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \nVery rare cases of hepatitis, sometimes fatal primarily in patients with pre-existing liver disorders, \nhave been reported. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery rare cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and bullous eruptions such as erythema multiforme, \nStevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, have been reported with docetaxel. In some \ncases concomitant factors may have contributed to the development of these effects. Scleroderma-like \nchanges usually preceded by peripheral lymphoedema have been reported with docetaxel.  Cases of \npermanent alopecia (frequency not known) have been reported. \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \nRenal and urinary disorders \nRenal insufficiency and renal failure have been reported.  In about 20% of these cases there were no \nrisk factors for acute renal failure such as concomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products and gastro-\nintestinal disorders. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nRadiation recall phenomena have rarely been reported. \nInjection site recall reaction (recurrence of skin reaction at a site of previous extravasation following \nadministration of docetaxel at a different site) has been observed at the site of previous extravasation \n(frequency not known). \n \nFluid retention has not been accompanied by acute episodes of oliguria or hypotension. Dehydration \nand pulmonary oedema have rarely been reported. \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nCases of electrolyte imbalance have been reported. Cases of hyponatraemia have been reported, \nmostly associated with dehydration, vomiting and pneumonia. Hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, and \nhypocalcaemia were observed, usually in association with gastrointestinal disorders and in particular \nwith diarrhoea. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n\nThere were a few reports of overdose. There is no known antidote for docetaxel overdose. In case of \noverdose, the patient should be kept in a specialised unit and vital functions closely monitored. In \ncases of overdose, exacerbation of adverse events may be expected. The primary anticipated \ncomplications of overdose would consist of bone marrow suppression, peripheral neurotoxicity and \nmucositis. Patients should receive therapeutic G-CSF as soon as possible after discovery of overdose. \nOther appropriate symptomatic measures should be taken, as needed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Taxanes, ATC Code: L01CD 02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nDocetaxel is an antineoplastic agent which acts by promoting the assembly of tubulin into stable \nmicrotubules and inhibits their disassembly which leads to a marked decrease of free tubulin. The \nbinding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. \n \nDocetaxel has been shown in vitro to disrupt the microtubular network in cells which is essential for \nvital mitotic and interphase cellular functions. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nDocetaxel was found to be cytotoxic in vitro against various murine and human tumour cell lines and \nagainst freshly excised human tumour cells in clonogenic assays. Docetaxel achieves high intracellular \nconcentrations with a long cell residence time. In addition, docetaxel was found to be active on some \nbut not all cell lines over expressing the p-glycoprotein which is encoded by the multidrug resistance \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n66 \n\ngene. In vivo, docetaxel is schedule independent and has a broad spectrum of experimental anti-tumour \nactivity against advanced murine and human grafted tumours. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nBreast cancer \n \nDocetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide: adjuvant therapy \n\nPatients with operable node-positive breast cancer (TAX 316) \n \nData from a multi-centre open-label randomised study support the use of docetaxel for the adjuvant \ntreatment of patients with operable node-positive breast cancer and KPS \u2265 80%, between 18 and \n70 years of age. After stratification according to the number of positive lymph nodes (1-3, 4+), \n1,491 patients were randomised to receive either docetaxel 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after \ndoxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 \nfollowed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (FAC arm). Both regimens \nwere administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-hour infusion; \nall other medicinal products were given as intravenous bolus on day one. G-CSF was administered as \nsecondary prophylaxis to patients who experienced complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia, \nprolonged neutropenia, or infection). Patients on the TAC arm received antibiotic prophylaxis with \nciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, or equivalent. In \nboth arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with positive oestrogen and/or progesterone \nreceptors received tamoxifen 20 mg daily for up to 5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was prescribed \naccording to guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 69% of patients who \nreceived TAC and 72% of patients who received FAC. \nTwo interim analyses and one final analysis were performed. The first interim analysis was planned 3 \nyears after the date when half of study enrolment was done. The second interim analysis was done \nafter 400 DFS events had been recorded overall, which led to a median follow-up of 55 months. The \nfinal analysis was performed when all patients had reached their 10-year follow-up visit (unless they \nhad a DFS event or were lost to follow-up before).  Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary \nefficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) was the secondary efficacy endpoint. \n \nA final analysis was performed with an actual median follow up of 96 months. Significantly longer \ndisease-free survival for the TAC arm compared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. Incidence of \nrelapses at 10 years was reduced in patients receiving TAC compared to those who received FAC \n(39% versus 45%, respectively) i.e. an absolute risk reduction by 6% (p=0.0043). Overall survival at \n10 years was also significantly increased with TAC compared to FAC (76% versus 69%, respectively) \ni.e. an absolute reduction of the risk of death by 7% (p=0.002).  As the benefit observed in patients \nwith 4+ nodes was not statistically significant on DFS and OS, the positive benefit/risk ratio for TAC \nin patients with 4+ nodes was not fully demonstrated at the final analysis. \n \nOverall, the study results demonstrate a positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC. \n \nTAC-treated patient subsets according to prospectively defined major prognostic factors were \nanalysed: \n \n\n  Disease free survival Overall survival \nPatient subset \n\n \nNumber \n\nof \npatients \n\nHazard \nratio* \n\n \n\n95% CI p= Hazard \nratio* \n\n \n\n95% CI p= \n\nNo of positive \nnodes \n\n       \n\nOverall 745 0.80 0.68-0.93 0.0043 0.74 0.61-0.90 0.0020 \n1-3 467 0.72 0.58-0.91 0.0047 0.62 0.46-0.82 0.0008 \n4+ 278 0.87 0.70-1.09 0.2290 0.87 0.67-1.12 0.2746 \n\n\n\n67 \n\n*a hazard ratio of less than 1 indicates that TAC is associated with a longer disease-free survival and \noverall survival compared to FAC \n \nPatients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy (GEICAM 9805) \n \nData from a multi-centre open-label randomised trial support the use of Docetaxel for the adjuvant \ntreatment of patients with operable node-negative breast cancer eligible to receive chemotherapy. \n1,060 patients were randomised to receive either Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after \ndoxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (539 patients in TAC arm), or doxorubicin \n50 mg/m2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclosphosphamide 500 mg/m2 (521 patients in \nFAC arm), as adjuvant treatment of operable node-negative breast cancer patients with high risk of \nrelapse according to 1998 St. Gallen criteria (tumour size >2 cm and/or negative ER and PR and/or \nhigh histological/nuclear grade (grade 2 to 3) and /or age <35 years). Both regimens were administered \nonce every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-hour infusion, all other medicinal \nproducts were given as intraveinously on day 1 every three weeks. Primary prophylactic G-CSF was \nmade mandatory in TAC arm after 230 patients were randomised. The incidence of Grade 4 \nneutropenia, febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection was decreased in patients who received \nprimary G-CSF prophylaxis (see section 4.8). In both arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, \npatients with ER+ and/or PgR+ tumours received tamoxifen 20 mg once a day for up to 5 years. \nAdjuvant radiation therapy was administered according to guidelines in place at participating \ninstitutions and was given to 57.3% of patients who received TAC and 51.2% of patients who received \nFAC. \n \nOne primary analysis and one updated analysis were performed. The primary analysis was done when \nall patients had a follow-up of greater than 5 years (median follow-up time of 77 months). The updated \nanalysis was performed when all patients had reached their 10-year (median follow up time of 10 \nyears and 5 months) follow-up visit (unless they had a DFS event or were lost to follow-up \npreviously). Disease-free survival (DFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint and Overall survival (OS) \nwas the secondary efficacy endpoint. \n \nAt the median follow-up time of 77 months, significantly longer disease-free survival for the TAC arm \ncompared to the FAC arm was demonstrated. TAC-treated patients had a 32% reduction in the risk of \nrelapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% CI (0.49-0.93), p=0.01). At the \nmedian follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 16.5% reduction in the \nrisk of relapse compared to those treated with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.84, 95% CI (0.65-1.08), \np=0.1646). DFS data were not statistically significant but were still associated with a positive trend in \nfavour of TAC. \n \nAt the median follow-up time of 77 months, overall survival (OS) was longer in the TAC arm with \nTAC-treated patients having a 24% reduction in the risk of death compared to FAC (hazard ratio = \n0.76, 95% CI (0.46-1.26, p=0.29). However, the distribution of OS was not significantly different \nbetween the 2 groups. \nAt the median follow up time of 10 years and 5 months, TAC-treated patients had a 9% reduction in \nthe risk of death compared to FAC-treated patients (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% CI (0.63-1.32)).  \nThe survival rate was 93.7% in the TAC arm and 91.4% in the FAC arm, at the 8-year follow-up time \npoint, and 91.3% in the TAC arm and 89% in the FAC arm, at the 10-year follow-up time point. \n \nThe positive benefit risk ratio for TAC compared to FAC remained unchanged. \n \nTAC-treated patient subsets according to prospectively defined major prognostic factors were \nanalysed in the primary analysis (at the median follow-up time of 77 months) (see table below): \n \n\nSubset Analyses-Adjuvant Therapy in Patients with Node-negative Breast Cancer Study (Intent-to-\nTreat Analysis) \n\n \nPatient subset Number of patients \n\nin TAC group \nDisease free survival \n\nHazard ratio* 95% CI \n\n\n\n68 \n\nOverall 539 0.68 0.49-0.93 \nAge category 1 \n<50 years \n>50 years \n\n \n260 \n279 \n\n \n0.67 \n0.67 \n\n \n0.43-1.05 \n0.43-1.05 \n\nAge category 2 \n<35 years \n>35 years \n\n \n42 \n497 \n\n \n0.31 \n0.73 \n\n \n0.11-0.89 \n0.52-1.01 \n\nHormonal receptor \nstatus \nNegative \nPositive \n\n \n \n\n195 \n344 \n\n \n \n\n0.7 \n0.62 \n\n \n \n\n0.45-1.1 \n0.4-0.97 \n\nTumour size \n<2 cm \n>2 cm \n\n \n285 \n254 \n\n \n0.69 \n0.68 \n\n \n0.43-1.1 \n0.45-1.04 \n\nHistological grade \nGrade1 (includes grade \nnot assessed) \nGrade 2 \nGrade 3 \n\n \n64 \n\n \n216 \n259 \n\n \n0.79 \n\n \n0.77 \n0.59 \n\n \n0.24-2.6 \n\n \n0.46-1.3 \n0.39-0.9 \n\nMenopausal status \nPre-Menopausal \nPost-Menopausal \n\n \n285 \n254 \n\n \n0.64 \n0.72 \n\n \n0.40-1 \n\n0.47-1.12 \n*a hazard ratio (TAC/FAC) of less than 1 indicates that TAC is associated with a longer disease free survival \ncompared to FAC. \n \n\nExploratory subgroup analyses for disease-free survival for patients who meet the 2009 St. Gallen \nchemotherapy criteria \u2013 (ITT population) were performed and presented here below: \n\n \n  \n\nTAC \n \n\nFAC \nHazard ratio \n(TAC/FAC) \n\n \n\nSubgroups (n=539) (n=521) (95% CI) p-value \nMeeting relative indication \nfor chemotherapy a \n\n    \n\nNo 18/214 \n(8.4%) \n\n26/227 \n(11.5%) \n\n0.796  \n(0.434 - 1.459) \n\n0.4593 \n\nYes 48/325 \n(14.8%) \n\n69/294 \n(23.5%) \n\n0.606  \n(0.42 - 0.877) \n\n0.0072 \n\nTAC = docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide \nFAC = 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophospamide \nCI = confidence interval \nER = oestrogen receptor \nPR = progesterone receptor \na ER/PR-negative or Grade 3 or tumour size >5 cm \n \nThe estimated hazard ratio was using Cox proportional hazard model with treatment group as the \nfactor. \n \nDocetaxel as single agent \nTwo randomised phase III comparative studies, involving a total of 326 alkylating or \n392 anthracycline failure metastatic breast cancer patients, have been performed with docetaxel at the \nrecommended dose and regimen of 100 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks. \n \nIn alkylating-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to doxorubicin (75 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks). \nWithout affecting overall survival time (docetaxel 15 months vs. doxorubicin 14 months, p=0.38) or \ntime to progression (docetaxel 27 weeks vs. doxorubicin 23 weeks, p=0.54), docetaxel increased \nresponse rate (52% vs. 37%, p=0.01) and shortened time to response (12 weeks vs. 23 weeks, \np=0.007). Three docetaxel patients (2%) discontinued the treatment due to fluid retention, whereas 15 \n\n\n\n69 \n\ndoxorubicin patients (9%) discontinued due to cardiac toxicity (three cases of fatal congestive heart \nfailure). \n \nIn anthracycline-failure patients, docetaxel was compared to the combination of mitomycin C and \nvinblastine (12 mg/m\u00b2 every 6 weeks and 6 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks). Docetaxel increased response rate \n(33% vs. 12%, p<0.0001), prolonged time to progression (19 weeks vs. 11 weeks, p=0.0004) and \nprolonged overall survival (11 months vs. 9 months, p=0.01). \n \nDuring these two phase III studies, the safety profile of docetaxel was consistent with the safety \nprofile observed in phase II studies (see section 4.8). \n \nAn open-label, multi-centre, randomised phase III study was conducted to compare docetaxel \nmonotherapy and paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients whose previous \ntherapy should have included an anthracycline. A total of 449 patients were randomised to receive \neither docetaxel monotherapy 100 mg/m\u00b2 as a 1 hour infusion or paclitaxel 175 mg/m\u00b2 as a 3 hour \ninfusion. Both regimens were administered every 3 weeks. \nWithout affecting the primary endpoint, overall response rate (32% vs 25%, p=0.10), docetaxel \nprolonged median time to progression (24.6 weeks vs 15.6 weeks; p<0.01) and median survival \n(15.3 months vs 12.7 months; p=0.03). \nMore grade 3/4 adverse events were observed for docetaxel monotherapy (55.4%) compared to \npaclitaxel (23.0%). \n \nDocetaxel in combination with doxorubicin \n \nOne large randomised phase III study, involving 429 previously untreated patients with metastatic \ndisease, has been performed with doxorubicin (50 mg/m\u00b2) in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m\u00b2) \n(AT arm) versus doxorubicin (60 mg/m\u00b2) in combination with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m\u00b2) (AC \narm). Both regimens were administered on day 1 every 3 weeks. \n \n\u2022 Time to progression (TTP) was significantly longer in the AT arm versus AC arm, p=0.0138. \n\nThe median TTP was 37.3 weeks (95% CI:33.4 - 42.1) in AT arm and 31.9 weeks (95% CI: \n27.4 - 36.0) in AC arm. \n\n\u2022 Overall response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in the AT arm versus AC arm, p=0.009. \nThe ORR was 59.3% (95% CI: 52.8 - 65.9) in AT arm versus 46.5% (95% CI : 39.8 - 53.2) in \nAC arm. \n\n \nIn this study, AT arm showed a higher incidence of severe neutropenia (90% versus 68.6%), febrile \nneutropenia (33.3% versus 10%), infection (8% versus 2.4%), diarrhoea (7.5% versus 1.4%), asthenia \n(8.5% versus 2.4%), and pain (2.8% versus 0%) than AC arm. On the other hand, AC arm showed a \nhigher incidence of severe anemia (15.8% versus 8.5%) than AT arm, and, in addition, a higher \nincidence of severe cardiac toxicity: congestive heart failure (3.8% versus 2.8%), absolute LVEF \ndecrease \u2265 20% (13.1 % versus 6.1%), absolute LVEF decrease \u2265 30% (6.2% versus 1.1%). Toxic \ndeaths occurred in 1 patient in the AT arm (congestive heart failure) and in 4 patients in the AC arm \n(1 due to septic shock and 3 due to congestive heart failure). \nIn both arms, quality of life measured by the EORTC questionnaire was comparable and stable during \ntreatment and follow-up. \n \nDocetaxel in combination with trastuzumab \n \nDocetaxel in combination with trastuzumab was studied for the treatment of patients with metastatic \nbreast cancer whose tumours over express HER2, and who previously had not received chemotherapy \nfor metastatic disease. One hundred eighty six patients were randomised to receive docetaxel \n(100 mg/m2) with or without trastuzumab; 60% of patients received prior anthracycline-based adjuvant \nchemotherapy. Docetaxel plus trastuzumab was efficacious in patients whether or not they had \nreceived prior adjuvant anthracyclines. The main test method used to determine HER2 positivity in \nthis pivotal study was immunohistochemistry (IHC). A minority of patients were tested using \nfluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). In this study, 87% of patients had disease that was IHC 3+, \n\n\n\n70 \n\nand 95% of patients entered had disease that was IHC 3+ and/or FISH positive.

In this \nstudy, 255 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel (75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous \ninfusion every 3 weeks) and capecitabine (1,250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1-week \nrest period). 256 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel alone (100 mg/ m2 as a 1 hour \nintravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Survival was superior in the docetaxel +capecitabine \ncombination arm (p=0.0126). Median survival was 442 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 352 days \n(docetaxel alone). \nThe overall objective response rates in the all-randomised population (investigator assessment) were \n41.6% (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 29.7% (docetaxel alone); p = 0.0058. Time to progressive \ndisease was superior in the docetaxel + capecitabine combination arm (p<0.0001). The median time to \nprogression was 186 days (docetaxel + capecitabine) vs. 128 days (docetaxel alone). \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \n \nPatients previously treated with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy \nIn a phase III study, in previously treated patients, time to progression (12.3 weeks versus 7 weeks) \nand overall survival were significantly longer for docetaxel at 75 mg/m\u00b2 compared to Best Supportive \nCare. The 1-year survival rate was also significantly longer in docetaxel (40%) versus BSC (16%). \nThere was less use of morphinic analgesic (p<0.01), non-morphinic analgesics (p<0.01), other disease-\nrelated medications (p=0.06) and radiotherapy (p<0.01) in patients treated with docetaxel at 75 mg/m\u00b2 \ncompared to those with BSC. \nThe overall response rate was 6.8% in the evaluable patients, and the median duration of response was \n26.1 weeks. \n \nDocetaxel in combination with platinum agents in chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients \n \nIn a phase III study, 1,218 patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, with KPS of 70% or \ngreater, and who did not receive previous chemotherapy for this condition, were randomised to either \ndocetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion immediately followed by cisplatin (Cis) 75 mg/m2 over \n30-60 minutes every 3 weeks (TCis), docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion in combination with \ncarboplatin (AUC 6 mg/ml. min) over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks, or vinorelbine (V) 25 mg/m2 \nadministered over 6-10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22 followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered on \nday 1 of cycles repeated every 4 weeks (VCis). \n \n\n\n\n71 \n\nSurvival data, median time to progression and response rates for two arms of the study are illustrated \nin the following table: \n \n TCis \n\nn=408 \n \n\nVCis \nn=404 \n\n \n\nStatistical analysis \n\nOverall survival \n(Primary end-point): \n\n   \n\nMedian survival (months) 11.3 10.1 Hazard ratio: 1.122 \n[97.2% CI: 0.937; 1.342]* \n\n1-year Survival (%) 46 41 Treatment difference: 5.4% \n[95% CI: -1.1; 12.0] \n\n2-year Survival (%) 21 14 Treatment difference: 6.2% \n[95% CI: 0.2; 12.3] \n\nMedian time to progression     \n(weeks): 22.0 23.0 Hazard ratio: 1.032 \n\n[95% CI: 0.876; 1.216] \nOverall response rate (%):  31.6 24.5 Treatment difference: 7.1% \n\n[95% CI: 0.7; 13.5] \n*: Corrected for multiple comparisons and adjusted for stratification factors (stage of disease and \nregion of treatment), based on evaluable patient population. \n \nSecondary end-points included change of pain, global rating of quality of life by EuroQoL-5D, Lung \nCancer Symptom Scale, and changes in Karnosfky performance status. Results on these end-points \nwere supportive of the primary end-points results. \n \nFor docetaxel/carboplatin combination, neither equivalent nor non-inferior efficacy could be proven \ncompared to the reference treatment combination VCis. \n \nProstate cancer \n \nThe safety and efficacy of docetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone in patients with \nhormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer were evaluated in a randomised multi-centre phase III \nstudy. A total of 1,006 patients with KPS\u226560 were randomised to the following treatment groups: \n\u2022 Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. \n\u2022 Docetaxel 30 mg/m2 administered weekly for the first 5 weeks in a 6 week cycle for 5 cycles. \n\u2022 Mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. \nAll 3 regimens were administered in combination with prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily, \ncontinuously. \n \nPatients who received docetaxel every three weeks demonstrated significantly longer overall survival \ncompared to those treated with mitoxantrone.

A total of 445 patients with KPS>70 were treated with either docetaxel (T) \n(75 mg/m2 on day 1) in combination with cisplatin (C) (75 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (F) \n(750 mg/m2 per day for 5 days) or cisplatin (100 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (1,000 mg/m2 per \nday for 5 days). The length of a treatment cycle was 3 weeks for the TCF arm and 4 weeks for the CF \narm. \nThe median number of cycles administered per patient was 6 (with a range of 1-16) for the TCF arm \ncompared to 4 (with a range of 1-12) for the CF arm. Time to progression (TTP) was the primary \nendpoint. The risk reduction of progression was 32.1% and was associated with a significantly longer \nTTP (p=0.0004) in favour of the TCF arm. Overall survival was also significantly longer (p=0.0201) \nin favour of the TCF arm with a risk reduction of mortality of 22.7%.

Patients treated with TCF had a longer time to 5% definitive deterioration of global \nhealth status on the QLQ-C30 questionnaire (p=0.0121) and a longer time to definitive worsening of \nKarnofsky performance status (p=0.0088) compared to patients treated with CF. \n \nHead and neck cancer \n \n\u2022 Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX323) \n\nThe safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with squamous cell \ncarcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a phase III, multi-centre, open-label, \nrandomised study (TAX323). In this study, 358 patients with inoperable locally advanced SCCHN, \nand WHO performance status 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two treatment arms. Patients on the \ndocetaxel arm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 followed by cisplatin (P) 75 mg/m2 followed by \n5-fluorouracil (F) 750 mg/m2 per day as a continuous infusion for 5 days. This regimen was \nadministered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case at least a minor response (\u2265 25% reduction in \nbidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed after 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with \na minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not \nprogress received radiotherapy (RT) according to institutional guidelines for 7 weeks (TPF/RT). \nPatients on the comparator arm received cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m2 followed by 5-fluorouracil (F) \n1000 mg/m2 per day for 5 days. This regimen was administered every three weeks for 4 cycles in case \nat least a minor response (\u2265 25% reduction in bidimensionally measured tumour size) was observed \nafter 2 cycles. At the end of chemotherapy, with a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval \nof 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to \ninstitutional guidelines for 7 weeks (PF/RT). Locoregional therapy with radiation was delivered either \nwith a conventional fraction (1.8 Gy - 2.0 Gy once a day, 5 days per week for a total dose of \n66 to 70 Gy), or accelerated/hyperfractionated regimens of radiation therapy (twice a day, with a \nminimum interfraction interval of 6 hours, 5 days per week). A total of 70 Gy was recommended for \naccelerated regimens and 74 Gy for hyperfractionated schemes. Surgical resection was allowed \nfollowing chemotherapy, before or after radiotherapy. Patients on the TPF arm received antibiotic \nprophylaxis with ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days starting on day 5 of each cycle, \nor equivalent. The primary endpoint in this study, progression-free survival (PFS), was significantly \nlonger in the TPF arm compared to the PF arm, p = 0.0042 (median PFS: 11.4 vs. 8.3 months \nrespectively) with an overall median follow up time of 33.7 months. Median overall survival was also \nsignificantly longer in favour of the TPF arm compared to the PF arm (median OS: 18.6 vs. \n14.5 months respectively) with a 28% risk reduction of mortality, p = 0.0128.

Pain intensity score improved during treatment in both groups indicating adequate \npain management. \n \n\u2022 Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX324) \nThe safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced \nsquamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a randomised, multi-centre \nopen-label, phase III, study (TAX324). In this study, 501 patients, with locally advanced SCCHN, and \na WHO performance status of 0 or 1, were randomised to one of two arms. The study population \ncomprised patients with technically unresectable disease, patients with low probability of surgical cure \nand patients aiming at organ preservation. The efficacy and safety evaluation solely addressed survival \nendpoints and the success of organ preservation was not formally addressed. Patients on the docetaxel \narm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m\u00b2 by intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by cisplatin (P) \n100 mg/m\u00b2 administered as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion, followed by the \ncontinuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1,000 mg/m\u00b2/day from day 1 to day 4. The cycles \nwere repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease were to \nreceive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) as per protocol (TPF/CRT). Patients on the comparator arm \nreceived cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m\u00b2 as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion on day 1 followed \nby the continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1,000 mg/m\u00b2/day from day 1 to day 5. The \ncycles were repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles. All patients who did not have progressive disease \nwere to receive CRT as per protocol (PF/CRT). \nPatients in both treatment arms were to receive 7 weeks of CRT following induction chemotherapy \nwith a minimum interval of 3 weeks and no later than 8 weeks after start of the last cycle (day 22 to \nday 56 of last cycle). During radiotherapy, carboplatin (AUC 1.5) was given weekly as a one-hour \nintravenous infusion for a maximum of 7 doses. Radiation was delivered with megavoltage equipment \nusing once daily fractionation (2 Gy per day, 5 days per week for 7 weeks, for a total dose of \n70-72 Gy). Surgery on the primary site of disease and/or neck could be considered at anytime \n\n\n\n75 \n\nfollowing completion of CRT. All patients on the docetaxel-containing arm of the study received \nprophylactic antibiotics. The primary efficacy endpoint in this study, overall survival (OS) was \nsignificantly longer (log-rank test, p = 0.0058) with the docetaxel-containing regimen compared to PF \n(median OS: 70.6 versus 30.1 months respectively), with a 30% risk reduction in mortality compared \nto PF (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.90) with an overall median \nfollow up time of 41.9 months. The secondary endpoint, PFS, demonstrated a 29% risk reduction of \nprogression or death and a 22 month improvement in median PFS (35.5 months for TPF and 13.1 for \nPF). This was also statistically significant with an HR of 0.71; 95% CI 0.56-0.90; log-rank test \np = 0.004.

The kinetic profile of docetaxel is dose independent and consistent \nwith a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model with half lives for the \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 phases of 4 min, \n36 min and 11.1 h, respectively. The late phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of docetaxel \nfrom the peripheral compartment.  \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing the administration of a 100 mg/m2 dose given as a one hour infusion a mean peak plasma \nlevel of 3.7 \u03bcg/ml was obtained with a corresponding AUC of 4.6 h.\u03bcg/ml. Mean values for total body \nclearance and steady-state volume of distribution were 21 l/h/m2 and 113 l, respectively. Inter \nindividual variation in total body clearance was approximately 50%. Docetaxel is more than 95% \nbound to plasma proteins. \n \nElimination \n \nA study of 14C-docetaxel has been conducted in three cancer patients. Docetaxel was eliminated in \nboth the urine and faeces following cytochrome P450-mediated oxidative metabolism of the tert-butyl \nester group, within seven days, the urinary and faecal excretion accounted for about 6% and 75% of \nthe administered radioactivity, respectively. About 80% of the radioactivity recovered in faeces is \nexcreted during the first 48 hours as one major inactive metabolite and 3 minor inactive metabolites \nand very low amounts of unchanged medicinal product. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nAge and gender \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed with docetaxel in 577 patients. \nPharmacokinetic parameters estimated by the model were very close to those estimated from phase I \nstudies. The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel were not altered by the age or sex of the patient.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn a small number of patients (n=23) with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver \nfunction impairment (ALT, AST \u22651.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase \u22652.5 times \nthe ULN), total clearance was lowered by 27% on average (see section 4.2).  \n \nFluid retention \nDocetaxel clearance was not modified in patients with mild to moderate fluid retention and there are \nno data available in patients with severe fluid retention. \n \nCombination therapy \n \nDoxorubicin \nWhen used in combination, docetaxel does not influence the clearance of doxorubicin and the plasma \nlevels of doxorubicinol (a doxorubicin metabolite). The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, doxorubicin \nand cyclophosphamide were not influenced by their coadministration. \n \nCapecitabine \nPhase I study evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and vice \nversa showed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no \neffect by docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of a relevant capecitabine metabolite 5\u2019-DFUR. \n \nCisplatin \nClearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that observed following \nmonotherapy. The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin administered shortly after docetaxel infusion is \nsimilar to that observed with cisplatin alone. \n \nCisplatin and 5-fluorouracil \nThe combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid \ntumours had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual medicinal product. \n \nPrednisone and dexamethasone \n\n\n\n77 \n\nThe effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered with standard \ndexamethasone premedication has been studied in 42 patients.  \n \nPrednisone \nNo effect of prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was observed. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of docetaxel has not been studied. \n \nDocetaxel has been shown to be mutagenic in the in vitro micronucleus and chromosome aberration \ntest in CHO-K1 cells and in the in vivo micronucleus test in the mouse. However, it did not induce \nmutagenicity in the Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay. These results are consistent \nwith the pharmacological activity of docetaxel. \n \nUndesirable effects on the testis observed in rodent toxicity studies suggest that docetaxel may impair \nmale fertility. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nConcentrate vial:  \nPolysorbate 80 \nEthanol, anhydrous \n \nSolvent vial:  \nWater for injections \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nsection 6.6. \n \n6.3 Shelf-life \n \n\u2022 18 months. \n\u2022 Premix solution: Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 8 hours when \n\nstored either between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C or at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C). From a \nmicrobiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, \nin-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would \nnormally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 to 8\u00b0C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled \nand validated aseptic conditions. \n\n\u2022 Infusion solution: Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 4 hours at \nroom temperature (below 25\u00b0C). From a microbiological point of view, the product should be \nused immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are \nthe responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 to 8\u00b0C, unless \ndilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n\n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage and other handling \n \n\nDo not store above 25\u00b0C. \nDo not freeze. \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \nFor storage conditions of the diluted medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n\n \n\n\n\n78 \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nEach carton contains: \n\u2022 One vial of concentrate and, \n\u2022 One vial of solvent \n \n\u2022 Docetaxel Teva 80 mg/2.88 ml concentrate for solution for infusion vial  \n 15 ml clear glass Type I vial with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and a flip-off cap. \n\n \nThis vial contains 2.88 ml of a 27.73 mg/ml solution of docetaxel in polysorbate 80 (fill volume: \n94.4 mg/3.40 ml). This fill volume has been established during the development of docetaxel to \ncompensate for liquid loss during preparation of the premix due to foaming, adhesion to the \nwalls of the vial and \"dead-volume\". This overfill ensures that after dilution with the entire \ncontents of the accompanying solvent for docetaxel vial, there is a minimal extractable premix \nvolume of 8 ml containing 10 mg/ml docetaxel which corresponds to the labelled amount of \n80 mg/2.88 ml per vial. \n \nSolvent vial \n15 ml clear glass Type I vial with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and a flip-off cap. \n \nSolvent vial contains 5.12 ml of water for injections (fill volume: 6.29 ml). The addition of the \nentire contents of the solvent vial to the contents of the Docetaxel Teva 80 mg/2.88 ml \nconcentrate for solution for infusion vial ensures a premix concentration of 10 mg/ml docetaxel. \n\n \n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nDocetaxel Teva is an antineoplastic agent and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution \nshould be exercised when handling it and preparing Docetaxel solutions. The use of gloves is \nrecommended. \n \nIf Docetaxel Teva concentrate, premix solution or infusion solution should come into contact with \nskin, wash immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If Docetaxel concentrate, premix solution \nor infusion solution should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash immediately and \nthoroughly with water. \n \nPreparation for the intravenous administration \n\na) Preparation of the Docetaxel Teva premix solution (10 mg docetaxel/ml) \n\nIf the vials are stored under refrigeration, allow the required number of Docetaxel Teva boxes to stand \nat room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) for 5 minutes. \n \nUsing a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw the entire contents of the solvent for \nDocetaxel Teva vial by partially inverting the vial. \n \nInject the entire contents of the syringe into the corresponding Docetaxel Teva vial. \n \nRemove the syringe and needle and mix manually by repeated inversions for at least 45 seconds. Do \nnot shake. \n \nAllow the premix vial to stand for 5 minutes at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and then check that \nthe solution is homogenous and clear (foaming is normal even after 5 minutes due to the presence of \npolysorbate 80 in the formulation). \n \nThe premix solution contains 10 mg/ml docetaxel and should be used immediately after preparation. \nHowever the chemical and physical stability of the premix solution has been demonstrated for 8 hours \nwhen stored either between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C or at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C). \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \nb) Preparation of the infusion solution \n\nMore than one premix vial may be necessary to obtain the required dose for the patient. Based on the \nrequired dose for the patient expressed in mg, aseptically withdraw the corresponding premix volume \ncontaining 10 mg/ml docetaxel from the appropriate number of premix vials using graduated syringes \nfitted with a needle. For example, a dose of 140 mg docetaxel would require 14 ml docetaxel premix \nsolution. \n \nInject the required premix volume into a non-PVC 250 ml infusion bag or bottle containing either 5% \nglucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. \n \nIf a dose greater than 200 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so \nthat a concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. \n \nMix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. \n \nThe Docetaxel Teva infusion solution should be used within 4 hours and should be aseptically \nadministered as a 1-hour infusion under room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and normal lighting \nconditions. \n \nAs with all parenteral products, Docetaxel Teva premix solution and infusion solution should be \nvisually inspected prior to use, solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n\n \n \n\n7.

FORMULATION \n\nDocetaxel Teva 20 mg/0.72 ml concentrate for solution for infusion is a clear viscous, yellow to \nbrown-yellow solution containing 27.73 mg/ml docetaxel in polysorbate 80. The solvent for Docetaxel \nTeva is water for injections. \n \n \n2. PRESENTATION \n\nDocetaxel Teva is supplied as single-dose vials. \n \nEach box contains one Docetaxel Teva vial (20 mg/0.72 ml) and one corresponding solvent for \nDocetaxel Teva vial in a carton. \n \nDocetaxel Teva vials should not be stored above 25\u00b0C and should be protected from light. \nDocetaxel Teva should not be used after the expiry date shown on the carton and vials. \n \n2.1 Docetaxel Teva 20 mg/0.72 ml vial: \n\n\u2022 The Docetaxel Teva 20 mg/0.72 ml vial is a 6 ml clear glass vial with a bromobutyl rubber \nstopper and a flip-off cap. \n\n \n\u2022 The Docetaxel Teva 20 mg/0.72 ml vial contains a solution of docetaxel in polysorbate 80 at a \n\nconcentration of 27.73 mg/ml. \n \n\u2022 Each vial contains 20 mg/0.72 ml of a 27.73 mg/ml solution of docetaxel in polysorbate 80 (fill \n\nvolume: 24.4 mg/0.88 ml). This volume has been established during the development of \ndocetaxel to compensate for liquid loss during preparation of the premix (see section 4) due to \nfoaming, adhesion to the walls of the vial and \"dead-volume\". This overfill ensures that after \ndilution with the entire contents of the accompanying solvent for docetaxel vial, there is a \nminimal extractable premix volume of 2 ml containing 10 mg/ml docetaxel which corresponds \nto the labelled amount of 20 mg/0.72 ml per vial. \n\n \n2.2 Solvent for Docetaxel Teva 20 mg/0.72 ml  vial: \n\n\u2022 The solvent for Docetaxel Teva 20 mg/0.72 ml vial is a 6 ml clear glass vial with a bromobutyl \nrubber stopper and a flip-off cap. \n\n \n\u2022 The solvent for Docetaxel Teva composition is water for injections. \n \n\u2022 Each solvent vial contains 1.28 ml of water for injections (fill volume: 1.71 ml). The addition of \n\nthe entire contents of the solvent vial to the contents of the Docetaxel Teva 20 mg/0.72 ml \nconcentrate for solution for infusion vial ensures a premix concentration of 10 mg/ml docetaxel. \n\n \n \n3. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SAFE HANDLING \n \n\n\n\n103 \n\nDocetaxel Teva is an antineoplastic agent and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution \nshould be exercised when handling it and preparing Docetaxel Teva solutions. The use of gloves is \nrecommended. \n \nIf Docetaxel Teva concentrate, premix solution or infusion solution should come into contact with \nskin, wash immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If Docetaxel Teva concentrate, premix \nsolution or infusion solution should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash immediately \nand thoroughly with water. \n \n \n4. PREPARATION FOR THE INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION \n\n4.1 Preparation of the Docetaxel Teva premix solution (10 mg docetaxel/ml) \n \n4.1.1  If the vials are stored under refrigeration, allow the required number of Docetaxel Teva boxes \nto stand at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) for 5 minutes. \n \n4.1.2  Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw the entire contents of the solvent for \n\nDocetaxel Teva vial by partially inverting the vial. \n \n\n4.1.3 Inject the entire contents of the syringe into the corresponding Docetaxel Teva vial. \n \n4.1.4  Remove the syringe and needle and mix manually by repeated inversions for at least 45 \n\nseconds. Do not shake. \n \n4.1.4 Allow the premix vial to stand for 5 minutes at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and then \n\ncheck that the solution is homogenous and clear (foaming is normal even after 5 minutes due \nto the presence of polysorbate 80 in the formulation). \n \nThe premix solution contains 10 mg/ml docetaxel and should be used immediately after \npreparation. However the chemical and physical stability of the premix solution has been \ndemonstrated for 8 hours when stored either between +2\u00b0C and +8\u00b0C or at room temperature \n(below 25\u00b0C). \n\n \n \n \n4.2 Preparation of the infusion solution \n \n4.2.1  More than one premix vial may be necessary to obtain the required dose for the patient. Based \n\non the required dose for the patient expressed in mg, aseptically withdraw the corresponding \npremix volume containing 10 mg/ml docetaxel from the appropriate number of premix vials \nusing graduated syringes fitted with a needle. For example, a dose of 140 mg docetaxel would \nrequire 14 ml docetaxel premix solution. \n\n \n4.2.2 Inject the required premix volume into a 250 ml non-PVC infusion bag or bottle containing \n\neither 5% glucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. If a dose \ngreater than 200 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so \nthat a concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. \n\n \n4.2.3 Mix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. \n \n4.2.4  The Docetaxel Teva infusion solution should be used within 4 hours and should be aseptically \n\nadministered as a 1-hour infusion under room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and normal lighting \nconditions. \n\n \n4.2.5 As with all parenteral products, Docetaxel Teva premix solution and infusion solution should \n\nbe visually inspected prior to use, solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. \n\n\n\n104 \n\n \n \n \n5. DISPOSAL \n \nAll materials that have been utilised for dilution and administration should be disposed of according to \nstandard procedures.  Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater.  Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use.  These measures will help protect the environment. \n\n\n\n105 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nDocetaxel Teva 80 mg/2.88 ml concentrate and solvent for solution for infusion \ndocetaxel \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

FORMULATION \n\nDocetaxel Teva 80 mg/2.88 ml concentrate for solution for infusion is a clear viscous, yellow to \nbrown-yellow solution containing 27.73 mg/ml docetaxel in polysorbate 80. The solvent for Docetaxel \nTeva is water for injections. \n \n \n2. PRESENTATION \n\nDocetaxel Teva is supplied as single-dose vials. \n \nEach box contains one Docetaxel Teva vial (80 mg/2.88 ml) and one corresponding solvent for \nDocetaxel Teva vial in a carton. \n \nDocetaxel Teva vials should not be stored above 25\u00b0C and should be protected from light. \nDocetaxel Teva should not be used after the expiry date shown on the carton and vials. \n \n \n2.1 Docetaxel Teva 80 mg/2.88 ml vial: \n\n\u2022 The Docetaxel Teva 80 mg/2.88 ml vial is a 15 ml clear glass vial with a bromobutyl rubber \nstopper and a flip-off cap. \n\n \n\u2022 The Docetaxel Teva 80 mg/2.88 ml vial contains a solution of docetaxel in polysorbate 80 at a \n\nconcentration of 27.73 mg/ml. \n \n\nEach vial contains 80 mg/2.88 ml of a 27.73 mg/ml solution of docetaxel in polysorbate 80 (fill \nvolume: 94.4 mg/3.40 ml). This volume has been established during the development of \ndocetaxel to compensate for liquid loss during preparation of the premix (see section 4) due to \nfoaming, adhesion to the walls of the vial and \"dead-volume\". This overfill ensures that after \ndilution with the entire contents of the accompanying solvent for docetaxel vial, there is a \nminimal extractable premix volume of 8 ml containing 10 mg/ml docetaxel which corresponds \nto the labelled amount of 80 mg/2.88 ml per vial. \n\n \n2.2 Solvent for Docetaxel Teva 80 mg/2.88 ml vial: \n\n\u2022 The solvent for Docetaxel Teva 80 mg/2.88 ml vial is a 15 ml clear glass vial with a bromobutyl \nrubber stopper and a flip-off cap. \n\n \n\u2022 The solvent for Docetaxel Teva composition is water for injections. \n \n\nEach solvent vial contains 5.12 ml of water for injections (fill volume: 6.29 ml). The addition of \nthe entire contents of the solvent vial to the contents of the Docetaxel Teva 80 mg/2.88 ml \nconcentrate for solution for infusion vial ensures a premix concentration of 10 mg/ml docetaxel. \n\n \n \n3. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SAFE HANDLING \n \n\n\n\n114 \n\nDocetaxel Teva is an antineoplastic agent and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution \nshould be exercised when handling it and preparing Docetaxel Teva solutions. The use of gloves is \nrecommended. \n \nIf Docetaxel Teva concentrate, premix solution or infusion solution should come into contact with \nskin, wash immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If Docetaxel Teva concentrate, premix \nsolution or infusion solution should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash immediately \nand thoroughly with water. \n \n \n4. PREPARATION FOR THE INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION \n\n4.1 Preparation of the Docetaxel Teva premix solution (10 mg docetaxel/ml) \n \n4.1.1 If the vials are stored under refrigeration, allow the required number of Docetaxel Teva boxes \n\nto stand at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) for 5 minutes. \n \n\n4.1.2 Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw the entire contents of the solvent for \nDocetaxel Teva vial by partially inverting the vial. \n \n\n4.1.3 Inject the entire contents of the syringe into the corresponding Docetaxel Teva vial. \n \n4.1.4 Remove the syringe and needle and mix manually by repeated inversions for at least 45 \n\nseconds. Do not shake. \n \n4.1.5 Allow the premix vial to stand for 5 minutes at room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and then \n\ncheck that the solution is homogenous and clear (foaming is normal even after 5 minutes due \nto the presence of polysorbate 80 in the formulation). \n \nThe premix solution contains 10 mg/ml docetaxel and should be used immediately after \npreparation. However the chemical and physical stability of the premix solution has been \ndemonstrated for 8 hours when stored either between +2\u00b0C and +8\u00b0C or at room temperature \n(below 25\u00b0C). \n\n \n \n \n4.2 Preparation of the infusion solution \n \n4.2.1 More than one premix vial may be necessary to obtain the required dose for the patient. Based \n\non the required dose for the patient expressed in mg, aseptically withdraw the corresponding \npremix volume containing 10 mg/ml docetaxel from the appropriate number of premix vials \nusing graduated syringes fitted with a needle. For example, a dose of 140 mg docetaxel would \nrequire 14 ml docetaxel premix solution. \n\n \n4.2.2 Inject the required premix volume into a 250 ml non-PVC infusion bag or bottle containing \n\neither 5% glucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. If a dose \ngreater than 200 mg of docetaxel is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so \nthat a concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded. \n\n \n4.2.3 Mix the infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking motion. \n \n4.2.4  The Docetaxel Teva infusion solution should be used within 4 hours and should be aseptically \n\nadministered as a 1-hour infusion under room temperature (below 25\u00b0C) and normal lighting \nconditions. \n\n \n4.2.5 As with all parenteral products, Docetaxel Teva premix solution and infusion solution should \n\nbe visually inspected prior to use, solutions containing a precipitate should be discarded. \n \n\n\n\n115 \n\n \n \n5. DISPOSAL \n \nAll materials that have been utilised for dilution and administration should be disposed of according to \nstandard procedures.  Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater.  Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use.  These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
