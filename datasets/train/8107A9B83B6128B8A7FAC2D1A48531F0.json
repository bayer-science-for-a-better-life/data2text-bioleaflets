This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nUDENYCA 6 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 6 mg of pegfilgrastim * in 0.6 ml solution for injection. The \nconcentration is 10 mg/ml based on protein content only**. \n \n*The active substance is a covalent conjugate of filgrastim produced in Escherichia coli cells by \nrecombinant DNA technology with polyethylene glycol (PEG). \n** The concentration is 20 mg/ml if the PEG moiety is included. \n \nThe potency of this medicinal product should not be compared to the potency of another pegylated or \nnon-pegylated protein of the same therapeutic class. For more information, see section 5.1 \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach pre--filled syringe contains 30 mg sorbitol  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection.  \n \nClear, colourless solution for injection. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nReduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients \ntreated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia \nand myelodysplastic syndromes). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPegfilgrastim therapy should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in oncology and/or \nhaematology. \n \nPosology \nOne 6 mg dose (a single pre-filled syringe) of pegfilgrastim is recommended for each chemotherapy \ncycle, given at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy. \n \nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim in children has not yet been established. Currently available \ndata are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \n\n\n\n3 \n\nNo dose change is recommended in patients with renal impairment, including those with end stage \nrenal disease. \n \nMethod of administration  \nPegfilgrastim is injected subcutaneously. The injections should be given into the thigh, abdomen or \nupper arm. For instructions on handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section \n6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trade name of the \nadministered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nLimited clinical data suggest a comparable effect on time to recovery of severe neutropenia for \npegfilgrastim to filgrastim in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (see section 5.1). \nHowever, the long-term effects of pegfilgrastim have not been established in acute myeloid leukaemia; \ntherefore, it should be used with caution in this patient population. \n \nG-CSF can promote growth of myeloid cells in vitro and similar effects may be seen on some \nnon-myeloid cells in vitro.  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim have not been investigated in patients with myelodysplastic \nsyndrome, chronic myelogenous leukaemia, and in patients with secondary Acute Myeloid Leukaemia \n(AML); therefore, it should not be used in such patients. Particular care should be taken to distinguish \nthe diagnosis of blast transformation of chronic myeloid leukaemia from acute myeloid leukaemia.  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim administration in de novo AML patients aged < 55 years with \ncytogenetics t(15;17) have not been established. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim have not been investigated in patients receiving high dose \nchemotherapy. This medicinal product should not be used to increase the dose of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy beyond established dosage regimens. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim for the mobilisation of blood progenitor cells in patients or \nhealthy donors has not been adequately evaluated.  \n \nIncreased haematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been \nassociated with transient positive bone imaging findings. This should be considered when interpreting \nbone-imaging results. \n \nPulmonary adverse reactions \nPulmonary adverse reactions, in particular interstitial pneumonia, have been reported after G-CSF \nadministration. Patients with a recent history of pulmonary infiltrates or pneumonia may be at higher \nrisk (see section 4.8). \n \nThe onset of pulmonary signs such as cough, fever, and dyspnoea in association with radiological \nsigns of pulmonary infiltrates, and deterioration in pulmonary function along with increased neutrophil \ncount may be preliminary signs of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). In such \ncircumstances pegfilgrastim should be discontinued at the discretion of the physician and the \nappropriate treatment given (see section 4.8). \n \nGlomerulonephritis \n\n\n\n4 \n\nGlomerulonephritis has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim and pegfilgrastim. Generally, \nevents of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose reduction or withdrawal of filgrastim and \npegfilgrastim. Urinalysis monitoring is recommended. \n \nCapillary leak syndrome  \nCapillary leak syndrome has been reported after G-CSF administration and is characterised by \nhypotension, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema and hemoconcentration. Patients who develop symptoms of \ncapillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard symptomatic treatment, \nwhich may include a need for intensive care (see section 4.8). \n \nAortitis \nAortitis has been reported after G-CSF administration in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. The \nsymptoms experienced included fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory \nmarkers (e.g. C-reactive protein and white blood cell count). In most cases aortitis was diagnosed by \nCT scan and generally resolved after withdrawal of G-CSF (see also section 4.8). \n \nSplenomegaly and splenic rupture \nUncommon but generally asymptomatic cases of splenomegaly and uncommon cases of splenic \nrupture, including some fatal cases, have been reported following administration of pegfilgrastim (see \nsection 4.8). Therefore, spleen size should be carefully monitored (e.g. clinical examination, \nultrasound). A diagnosis of splenic rupture should be considered in patients reporting left upper \nabdominal pain or shoulder tip pain. \n \nThrombocytopenia and anaemia \nTreatment with pegfilgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia because full \ndose myelosuppressive chemotherapy is maintained on the prescribed schedule. Regular monitoring of \nplatelet count and haematocrit is recommended. Special care should be taken when administering \nsingle or combination chemotherapeutic agents which are known to cause severe thrombocytopenia. \n \nSickle cell anaemia  \nSickle cell crises have been associated with the use of pegfilgrastim in patients with sickle cell trait or \nsickle cell disease (see section 4.8). Therefore, physicians should use caution when prescribing \npegfilgrastim in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease, should monitor appropriate clinical \nparameters and laboratory status and be attentive to the possible association of this medicine with \nsplenic enlargement and vaso-occlusive crisis. \n \nLeukocytosis  \nWhite blood cell (WBC) counts of 100 x 109/l or greater have been observed in less than 1% of \npatients receiving pegfilgrastim. No adverse events directly attributable to this degree of leukocytosis \nhave been reported. Such elevation in white blood cells is transient, typically seen 24 to 48 hours after \nadministration and is consistent with the pharmacodynamic effects of this medicine. Consistent with \nthe clinical effects and the potential for leukocytosis, a WBC count should be performed at regular \nintervals during therapy. If leukocyte counts exceed 50 x 109/l after the expected nadir, this medicine \nshould be discontinued immediately. \n \nHypersensitivity \nHypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reactions, occurring on initial or subsequent treatment have \nbeen reported in patients treated with pegfilgrastim. Permanently discontinue pegfilgrastim in patients \nwith clinically significant hypersensitivity. Do not administer pegfilgrastim to patients with a history \nof hypersensitivity to pegfilgrastim or filgrastim. If a serious allergic reaction occurs, appropriate \ntherapy should be administered, with close patient follow-up over several days. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome \nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, has been reported rarely in \nassociation with pegfilgrastim treatment. If the patient has developed SJS with the use of \npegfilgrastim, treatment with pegfilgrastim must not be restarted in this patient at any time.  \n \nImmunogenicity  \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Rates of generation of \nantibodies against pegfilgrastim is generally low. Binding antibodies do occur as expected with all \nbiologics; however, they have not been associated with neutralising activity at present.  \n \nPegfilgrastim contains sorbitol. Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) should not take/be \ngiven this medicinal product. \n \nPegfilgrastim contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per 6 mg dose, that is to say, essentially \n'sodium-free'. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDue to the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy, \npegfilgrastim should be administered at least 24 hours after administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. \nIn clinical trials, pegfilgrastim has been safely administered 14 days before chemotherapy. \nConcomitant use of pegfilgrastim with any chemotherapy agent has not been evaluated in patients. In \nanimal models concomitant administration of pegfilgrastim and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or other \nantimetabolites has been shown to potentiate myelosuppression. \n \nPossible interactions with other haematopoietic growth factors and cytokines have not been \nspecifically investigated in clinical trials.  \n \nThe potential for interaction with lithium, which also promotes the release of neutrophils, has not been \nspecifically investigated. There is no evidence that such an interaction would be harmful. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim have not been evaluated in patients receiving chemotherapy \nassociated with delayed myelosuppression e.g., nitrosoureas. \n \nSpecific interaction or metabolism studies have not been performed, however, clinical trials have not \nindicated an interaction of pegfilgrastim with any other medicinal products.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of pegfilgrastim in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). UDENYCA is not recommended during \npregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \nThere is insufficient information on the excretion of pegfilgrastim/ metabolites in human milk, a risk \nto the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from UDENYCA therapy taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.  \n \nFertility \nPegfilgrastim did not affect reproductive performance or fertility in male or female rats at cumulative \nweekly doses approximately 6 to 9 times higher than the recommended human dose (based on body \nsurface area) (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nUDENYCA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were bone pain (very common) and musculoskeletal \npain (common). Bone pain was generally of mild to moderate severity, transient and could be \ncontrolled in most patients with standard analgesics.  \n \nHypersensitivity-type reactions, including skin rash, urticaria, angioedema, dyspnoea, erythaema, \nflushing, and hypotension occurred on initial or subsequent treatment with pegfilgrastim (uncommon). \nSerious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis can occur in patients receiving pegfilgrastim \n(uncommon) (see section 4.4). \n \nCapillary Leak Syndrome, which can be life-threatening if treatment is delayed, has been reported as \nuncommon in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy following administration of G-CSFs; see \nsection 4.4 and section \u201cDescription of selected adverse reactions\u201d below. \n \nAortitis [rare frequency] (see section 4.4). \n \nSplenomegaly, generally asymptomatic, is uncommon.  \n \nSplenic rupture including some fatal cases is uncommonly reported following administration of \npegfilgrastim (see section 4.4).  \n \nUncommon pulmonary adverse reactions including interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, \npulmonary infiltrates and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported. Uncommonly, cases have resulted in \nrespiratory failure or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which may be fatal (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nIsolated cases of sickle cell crises have been reported in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell \ndisease (uncommon in sickle cell patients) (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe data in the table below describe adverse reactions reported from clinical trials and spontaneous \nreporting. The adverse reactions are ranked under heading of frequency using the following \nconvention: very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\uf0b31/1,000 to <1/100), rare \n(\uf0b31/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nMedDRA  \nsystem organ class \n\nAdverse reactions \nVery common  Common  Uncommon  Rare  Very rare  \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic system \ndisorders \n\n  Thrombocytopenia1 \nLeukocytosis1 \n\nSickle cell crisis2;  \nSplenomegaly2;  \nSplenic rupture2 \n\n    \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n    Hypersensitivity \nreactions;  \nAnaphylaxis  \n\n    \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\n    Elevations in uric \nacid  \n\n    \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache1         \n\nVascular disorders     Capillary leak \nsyndrome1 \n\n Aortitis2   \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n    Acute Respiratory \nDistress Syndrome2;  \nPulmonary adverse \nreactions (interstitial \npneumonia, \npulmonary oedema, \npulmonary infiltrates \nand pulmonary \nfibrosis)  \nHaemoptysis \n\nPulmonary \nhaemorrhage2  \n \n\n  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea1         \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n    Sweet's syndrome \n(acute febrile \ndermatosis)1,2;  \nCutaneous \nvasculitis1,2 \n\nStevens-\nJohnson \nsyndrome \n\n  \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nBone pain  Musculoskeletal \npain (myalgia, \narthralgia, pain in \nextremity, back pain, \nmusculo-skeletal \npain, neck pain)  \n\n      \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\n    Glomerulonephritis2     \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administrative \nsite conditions \n\n  Injection site pain1 \nNon-cardiac chest \npain \n\nInjection site \nreactions2 \n\n    \n\nInvestigations     Elevations in lactate \ndehydrogenase and \nalkaline \nphosphatase1;  \nTransient elevations \nin LFT's for ALT or \nAST1 \n\n    \n\n1 See section \u201cDescription of selected adverse reactions\u201d below. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n2 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not observed in \nrandomised, controlled clinical trials in adults. The frequency category was estimated from a statistical \ncalculation based upon 1,576 patients receiving pegfilgrastim in nine randomised clinical trials. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nUncommon cases of Sweet's syndrome have been reported, although in some cases underlying \nhaematological malignancies may play a role.  \n \nUncommon events of cutaneous vasculitis have been reported in patients treated with pegfilgrastim. \nThe mechanism of vasculitis in patients receiving pegfilgrastim is unknown. \n \nInjection site reactions, including injection site erythaema (uncommon) as well as injection site pain \n(common) have occurred on initial or subsequent treatment with pegfilgrastim. \n \nCommon cases of leukocytosis (White Blood Count [WBC] > 100 x 109/L) have been reported (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nReversible, mild to moderate elevations in uric acid and alkaline phosphatase, with no associated \nclinical effects, were uncommon; reversible, mild to moderate elevations in lactate dehydrogenase, \nwith no associated clinical effects, were uncommon in patients receiving pegfilgrastim following \ncytotoxic chemotherapy.  \n \nNausea and headaches were very commonly observed in patients receiving chemotherapy. \n \nUncommon elevations in liver function tests (LFTs) for ALT (alanine aminotransferase) or AST \n(aspartate aminotransferase), have been observed in patients after receiving pegfilgrastim following \ncytotoxic chemotherapy. These elevations are transient and return to baseline. \n \nCommon cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported. \n \nCases of capillary leak syndrome have been reported in the post marketing setting with G-CSF use. \nThese have generally occurred in patients with advanced malignant diseases, sepsis, taking multiple \nchemotherapy medicinal products or undergoing apheresis (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe experience in children is limited. A higher frequency of serious adverse reactions in younger \nchildren aged 0-5 years (92%) has been observed compared to older children aged 6-11 and \n12-21 years respectively (80% and 67%) and adults. The most common adverse reaction reported was \nbone pain (see section 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSingle doses of 300 \u00b5g/kg have been administered subcutaneously to a limited number of healthy \nvolunteers and patients with non-small cell lung cancer without serious adverse reactions. The adverse \nevents were similar to those in subjects receiving lower doses of pegfilgrastim. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, colony stimulating factor; ATC Code: L03AA13 \n \nHuman G-CSF is a glycoprotein, which regulates the production and release of neutrophils from the \nbone marrow. Pegfilgrastim is a covalent conjugate of recombinant human G-CSF (r-met-Hu-G-CSF) \nwith a single 20 kd polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule. Pegfilgrastim is a sustained duration form of \nfilgrastim due to decreased renal clearance. Pegfilgrastim and filgrastim have been shown to have \nidentical modes of action, causing a marked increase in peripheral blood neutrophil counts within \n24 hours, with minor increases in monocytes and/or lymphocytes. Similarly to filgrastim, neutrophils \nproduced in response to pegfilgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of \nchemotactic and phagocytic function. As with other haematopoietic growth factors, G-CSF has shown \nin vitro stimulating properties on human endothelial cells. G-CSF can promote growth of myeloid \ncells, including malignant cells, in vitro and similar effects may be seen on some non-myeloid cells in \nvitro. \n \nIn two randomised, double-blind, pivotal studies in patients with high risk stage II-IV breast cancer \nundergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin and docetaxel, use of \npegfilgrastim, as a single once per cycle dose, reduced the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of \nfebrile neutropenia similarly to that observed with daily administrations of filgrastim (a median of \n11 daily administrations). In the absence of growth factor support, this regimen has been reported to \nresult in a mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia of 5 to 7 days, and a 30-40% incidence of febrile \nneutropenia. In one study (n = 157), which used a 6 mg fixed dose of pegfilgrastim the mean duration \nof grade 4 neutropenia for the pegfilgrastim group was 1.8 days compared with 1.6 days in the \nfilgrastim group (difference 0.23 days, 95% CI -0.15, 0.63). Over the entire study, the rate of febrile \nneutropenia was 13% of pegfilgrastim-treated patients compared with 20% of filgrastim-treated \npatients (difference 7%, 95% CI of -19%, 5%). In a second study (n = 310), which used a \nweight-adjusted dose (100 \u03bcg/kg), the mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia for the pegfilgrastim \ngroup was 1.7 days, compared with 1.8 days in the filgrastim group (difference 0.03 days, 95% \nCI -0.36, 0.30). The overall rate of febrile neutropenia was 9% of patients treated with pegfilgrastim \nand 18% of patients treated with filgrastim (difference 9%, 95% CI of -16.8%,-1.1%). \n \nIn a placebo-controlled, double blind study in patients with breast cancer the effect of pegfilgrastim on \nthe incidence of febrile neutropenia was evaluated following administration of a chemotherapy \nregimen associated with a febrile neutropenia rate of 10-20% (docetaxel 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for \n4 cycles). Nine hundred and twenty eight patients were randomised to receive either a single dose of \npegfilgrastim or placebo approximately 24 hours (Day 2) after chemotherapy in each cycle. The \nincidence of febrile neutropenia was lower for patients randomised to receive pegfilgrastim compared \nwith placebo (1% versus 17%, p < 0.001). The incidence of hospitalisations and IV anti-infective use \nassociated with a clinical diagnosis of febrile neutropenia was lower in the pegfilgrastim group \ncompared with placebo (1% versus 14%, p < 0.001; and 2% versus 10%, p < 0.001). \n \nA small (n = 83), Phase II, randomised, double-blind study in patients receiving chemotherapy for de \nnovo acute myeloid leukaemia compared pegfilgrastim (single dose of 6 mg) with filgrastim, \nadministered during induction chemotherapy. Median time to recovery from severe neutropenia was \nestimated as 22 days in both treatment groups. Long term outcome was not studied (see section 4.4).  \n \nIn a phase II (n = 37) multicentre, randomised, open-label study of paediatric sarcoma patients \nreceiving 100 \u03bcg/kg pegfilgrastim following cycle 1 of vincristine, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide \n(VAdriaC/IE) chemotherapy, a longer duration of severe neutropenia (neutrophils < 0.5 x 109) was \nobserved in younger children aged 0-5 yrs (8.9 days) compared to older children aged 6-11 years and \n12-21 years (6 days and 3.7 days, respectively) and adults. Additionally a higher incidence of febrile \nneutropenia was observed in younger children aged 0-5 yrs (75%) compared to older children aged \n6-11 years and 12-21 years (70% and 33%, respectively) and adults (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nAfter a single subcutaneous dose of pegfilgrastim, the peak serum concentration of pegfilgrastim \noccurs at 16 to 120 hours after dosing and serum concentrations of pegfilgrastim are maintained \nduring the period of neutropenia after myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The elimination of \npegfilgrastim is non-linear with respect to dose; serum clearance of pegfilgrastim decreases with \nincreasing dose. Pegfilgrastim appears to be mainly eliminated by neutrophil mediated clearance, \nwhich becomes saturated at higher doses. Consistent with a self-regulating clearance mechanism, the \nserum concentration of pegfilgrastim declines rapidly at the onset of neutrophil recovery (see \nFigure 1). \n \nFigure 1.  Profile of median pegfilgrastim serum concentration and absolute neutrophil count \n  (ANC) in chemotherapy treated patients after a single 6 mg injection \n\n \n \nDue to the neutrophil-mediated clearance mechanism, the pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim is not \nexpected to be affected by renal or hepatic impairment. In an open label, single dose study (n = 31) \nvarious stages of renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease, had no impact on the \npharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim. \n \nElderly  \nLimited data indicate that the pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim in elderly subjects (> 65 years) is \nsimilar to that in adults.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim were studied in 37 paediatric patients with sarcoma, who \nreceived 100 \u03bcg/kg pegfilgrastim after the completion of VAdriaC/IE chemotherapy. The youngest \nage group (0-5 years) had a higher mean exposure to pegfilgrastim (AUC) (\u00b1 Standard Deviation) \n(47.9 \u00b1 22.5 \u03bcg\u00b7hr/ml) than older children aged 6-11 years and 12-21 years (22.0  \u00b1 13.1 \u03bcg hr/ml and \n29.3 \u00b1 23.2 \u03bcg\u00b7hr/ml, respectively) (see section 5.1). With the exception of the youngest age group \n(0-5 years), the mean AUC in paediatric subjects appeared similar to that for adult patients with \nhigh-risk stage II-IV breast cancer and receiving 100 \u03bcg/kg pegfilgrastim after the completion of \ndoxorubicin/docetaxel (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data from conventional studies of repeated dose toxicity revealed the expected \npharmacological effects including increases in leukocyte count, myeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow, \nextramedullary haematopoiesis and splenic enlargement.  \n \nThere were no adverse effects observed in offspring from pregnant rats given pegfilgrastim \nsubcutaneously, but in rabbits pegfilgrastim has been shown to cause embryo/foetal toxicity (embryo \n\n\n\n11 \n\nloss) at cumulative doses approximately 4 times the recommended human dose, which were not seen \nwhen pregnant rabbits were exposed to the recommended human dose. In rat studies, it was shown that \npegfilgrastim may cross the placenta. Studies in rats indicated that reproductive performance, fertility, \noestrous cycling, days between pairing and coitus, and intrauterine survival were unaffected by \npegfilgrastim given subcutaneously. The relevance of these findings for humans is not known.  \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n22 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nUDENYCA 6 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \npegfilgrastim \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What UDENYCA is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use UDENYCA  \n3. How to use UDENYCA  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store UDENYCA \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What UDENYCA is and what it is used for \n \nUDENYCA contains the active substance pegfilgrastim. Pegfilgrastim is a protein produced by \nbiotechnology in bacteria called E. coli followed by conjugation with polyethylene glycol (PEG) It \nbelongs to a group of proteins called cytokines. The protein part is very similar to a natural protein \nproduced by your own body. \n \nThe medicinal product is used to reduce the duration of low white blood cell count (neutropenia) and \nthe occurrence of low white blood cell count with a fever (febrile neutropenia) which can be caused by \nthe use of cytotoxic chemotherapy (medicines that destroy rapidly growing cells). White blood cells \nare important as they help your body fight infection. These cells are very sensitive to the effects of \nchemotherapy which can cause the number of these cells in your body to decrease. If white blood cells \nfall to a low level there may not be enough left in the body to fight bacteria and you may have an \nincreased risk of infection. \n \nYour doctor has given you UDENYCA to encourage your bone marrow (part of the bone which makes \nblood cells) to produce more white blood cells that help your body fight infection. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use UDENYCA \n \nDo not use UDENYCA \n- if you are allergic to pegfilgrastim, filgrastim, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine.  \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using UDENYCA if you: \n\n\n\n23 \n\n\u2022 experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing, \nswelling of the face (anaphylaxis), redness and flushing, skin rash and itchy skin \n\n\u2022 experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing. This can be a sign of Acute Respiratory \nDistress Syndrome (ARDS) \n\n\u2022 have any of the following or combination of the following side effects:  \n- swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, difficulty \n\nbreathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness \nThese could be symptoms of condition called \u201cCapillary Leak Syndrome\u201d which causes blood to \nleak from the small blood vessels into your body. See section 4. \n\n\u2022 get left upper abdominal pain or pain at the tip of your shoulder. This may be a sign of a problem \nwith your spleen (splenomegaly) \n\n\u2022 have recently had a serious lung infection (pneumonia), fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema), \ninflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease) or an abnormal chest x-ray (lung infiltration) \n\n\u2022 are aware of any altered blood cell counts (e.g. increase in white blood cells or anaemia) or \ndecreased blood platelet counts, which reduces the ability of your blood to clot \n(thrombocytopenia). Your doctor may want to monitor you more closely \n\n\u2022 have sickle cell anaemia. Your doctor may monitor your condition more closely \n\u2022 have sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the face, lips, \n\ntongue or other parts of the body, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing. These could \nbe signs of a severe allergic reaction \n\n\u2022 Inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the \nbody) has been reported rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors. The symptoms can include \nfever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory markers. Tell your doctor if \nyou experience these symptoms \n \n\nYour doctor will check your blood and urine regularly as UDENYCA can harm the tiny filters inside \nyour kidneys (glomerulonephritis).  \n \nSevere skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) have been reported with the use of UDENYCA. \nStop using UDENYCA and seek medical attention immediately if you notice any of the symptoms \ndescribed in section 4. \n \nYou should talk to your doctor about your risks of developing cancers of the blood. If you develop or \nare likely to develop cancers of the blood, you should not use UDENYCA, unless instructed by your \ndoctor. \n \nLoss of response to pegfilgrastim \nIf you experience a loss of response or decrease in response with pegfilgrastim treatment, your doctor \nwill investigate the reasons why including whether you have developed antibodies which neutralise \npegfilgrastim\u2019s activity. \n \nOther medicines and UDENYCA \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. UDENYCA has not been tested \nin pregnant women.

glycol (peg) it belongs to a group of proteins called cytokines. the protein part is very similar to a natural protein produced by your own body. the medicinal product is used to reduce the duration of low white blood cell count (neutropenia) and the occurrence of low white blood cell count with a fever (febrile neutropenia) which can be caused by the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy (medicines that destroy rapidly growing cells). white blood cells are important as they help your body fight infection. these cells are very sensitive to the effects of chemotherapy which can cause the number of these cells in your body to decrease. if white blood cells fall to a low level there may not be enough left in the body to fight bacteria and you may have an increased risk of infection. your doctor has given you udenyca to encourage your bone marrow (part of the bone which makes blood cells) to produce more white blood cells that help your body fight infection.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text":
