NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nAVONEX 30 micrograms/0.5 ml solution for injection. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach 0.5 ml pre-filled syringe contains 30 micrograms (6 million IU) of interferon beta-1a. \n \nThe concentration is 30 micrograms per 0.5 ml. \n \nUsing the World Health Organisation (WHO) International Standard for Interferon, 30 micrograms of \nAVONEX contain 6 million IU of antiviral activity. The activity against other standards is not known. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nClear and colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAVONEX is indicated for the treatment of  \n \n\u2022 Patients diagnosed with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). In clinical trials, this was \n\ncharacterised by two or more acute exacerbations (relapses) in the previous three-years without \nevidence of continuous progression between relapses; AVONEX slows the progression of \ndisability and decreases the frequency of relapses. \n\n \n\u2022 Patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if it is severe \n\nenough to warrant treatment with intravenous corticosteroids, if alternative diagnoses have been \nexcluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple \nsclerosis (see section 5.1). \n\n \nAVONEX should be discontinued in patients who develop progressive MS. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the \ndisease. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults: The recommended dosage for the treatment of relapsing MS is 30 micrograms (0.5 ml \nsolution), administered by intramuscular (IM) injection once a week (see section 6.6). No additional \nbenefit has been shown by administering a higher dose (60 micrograms) once a week. \n \nTitration: To help patients reduce the incidence and severity of flu-like symptoms (see section 4.8), \ntitration can be performed at the initiation of treatment. Titration using the pre-filled syringe can be \n\n\n\n3 \n\nachieved by initiating therapy on \u00bc dose increments per week reaching the full dose (30 \nmicrograms/week) by the fourth week.  \n \nAn alternative titration schedule can be achieved by initiating therapy on approximately a \u00bd dose of \nAVONEX once a week before increasing to the full dose. In order to obtain adequate efficacy, a dose \nof 30 micrograms once a week should be reached and maintained after the initial titration period.  \n \nThe AVOSTARTCLIP titration kit is designed for use with the pre-filled syringe only. It can be used \nto achieve the \u00bc or \u00bd dose increments. Each AVOSTARTCLIP should be used once and then \ndiscarded along with any remaining AVONEX in the syringe. \n \nPrior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is \nadvised to decrease flu-like symptoms associated with AVONEX administration. These symptoms are \nusually present during the first few months of treatment. \n \nPaediatric population: The safety and efficacy of AVONEX in adolescents aged 12 to 16 years have \nnot yet been established. Currently available data are described in section 4.8 and 5.1 but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of AVONEX in children below 12 years of age have not yet been established.  \nNo data are available \n \nElderly: Clinical studies did not include a sufficient number of patients aged 65 and over to determine \nwhether they respond differently than younger patients. However, based on the mode of clearance of \nthe active substance there are no theoretical reasons for any requirement for dose adjustments in the \nelderly. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe intramuscular injection site should be varied each week (see section 5.3). \n \nDoctors may prescribe a 25 mm, 25 gauge needle to patients for whom such a needle is appropriate to \nadminister an intramuscular injection. \n \nAt the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Patients should be \nclinically evaluated after two years of treatment and longer-term treatment should be decided on an \nindividual basis by the treating physician. Treatment should be discontinued if the patient develops \nchronic progressive MS. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any \n\nexcipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Patients with current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nAVONEX should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive \ndisorders, in particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and \nsuicidal ideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in \n\n\n\n4 \n\nassociation with interferon use. Patients should be advised to immediately report any symptoms of \ndepression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. \n \nPatients exhibiting depression should be monitored closely during therapy and treated appropriately. \nCessation of therapy with AVONEX should be considered (see also sections 4.3 and 4.8). \n \nAVONEX should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those \nreceiving treatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with \nanti-epileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8).  \n \nCaution should be used and close monitoring considered when administering AVONEX to patients \nwith severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. \n \nThrombotic microangiopathy (TMA): Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as \nthrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal \ncases, have been reported with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points \nduring treatment and may occur several weeks to several years after starting treatment with interferon \nbeta. Early clinical features include thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous \nsystem symptoms (e.g. confusion, paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings \nsuggestive of TMA include decreased platelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) \ndue to haemolysis and schistocytes (erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical \nfeatures of TMA are observed, further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and \nrenal function is recommended. If TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering \nplasma exchange) and immediate discontinuation of AVONEX is recommended.  \n \nNephrotic Syndrome: Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including \ncollapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), \nmembranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have \nbeen reported during treatment with interferon-beta products. Events were reported at various time \npoints during treatment and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon beta. Periodic \nmonitoring of early signs or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is \nrecommended, especially in patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic \nsyndrome is required and discontinuation of treatment with AVONEX should be considered. \n \nHepatic injury including elevated serum hepatic enzyme levels, hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis and \nhepatic failure has been reported with interferon beta in post-marketing (see section 4.8). In some \ncases, these reactions have occurred in the presence of other medicinal products that have been \nassociated with hepatic injury. The potential of additive effects from multiple medicinal products or \nother hepatotoxic agents (e.g. alcohol) has not been determined. Patients should be monitored for \nsigns of hepatic injury and caution exercised when interferons are used concomitantly with other \nmedicinal products associated with hepatic injury. \n \nPatients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely \nmonitored for worsening of their clinical condition during treatment with AVONEX. Flu-like \nsymptoms associated with AVONEX therapy may prove stressful to patients with underlying cardiac \nconditions. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. Therefore, in addition to those \nlaboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with MS, complete and differential white \nblood cell counts, platelet counts, and blood chemistry, including liver function tests, are \nrecommended during AVONEX therapy. Patients with myelosuppression may require more intensive \nmonitoring of complete blood cell counts, with differential and platelet counts. \n \nPatients may develop antibodies to AVONEX. The antibodies of some of those patients reduce the \nactivity of interferon beta-1a in vitro (neutralising antibodies). Neutralising antibodies are associated \nwith a reduction in the in vivo biological effects of AVONEX and may potentially be associated with \n\n\n\n5 \n\na reduction of clinical efficacy. It is estimated that the plateau for the incidence of neutralising \nantibody formation is reached after 12 months of treatment. Recent clinical studies with patients \ntreated up to three years with AVONEX suggest that approximately 5% to 8% develop neutralising \nantibodies. \n \nThe use of various assays to detect serum antibodies to interferons limits the ability to compare \nantigenicity among different products. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal interaction studies have been performed in humans. \n \nThe interaction of AVONEX with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not \nbeen studied systematically. The clinical studies indicate that MS patients can receive AVONEX and \ncorticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. \n \nInterferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes \nin humans and animals. The effect of high-dose AVONEX administration on P450-dependent \nmetabolism in monkeys was evaluated and no changes in liver metabolising capabilities were \nobserved. Caution should be exercised when AVONEX is administered in combination with \nmedicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic \ncytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. some classes of antiepileptics and antidepressants. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nA large amount of data (more than 1000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post-marketing \nexperience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre-conception exposure to \ninterferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of \nexposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use \nwas contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when pregnancy was detected \nand/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very limited.  \n \nBased on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion.  \nThe risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be \nevaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. \n \nIf clinically needed, the use of Avonex may be considered during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding  \n \nLimited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1a into breast milk, together with the \nchemical / physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1a \nexcreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are \nanticipated.  \n \nAvonex can be used during breast-feeding.  \n \nFertility \n \nFertility and developmental studies in rhesus monkeys have been carried out with a related form of \ninterferon beta 1a. At very high doses, anovulatory and abortifacient effects in test animals were \nobserved (see section 5.3).  \nNo information is available on the effects of interferon beta-1a on male fertility. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects of AVONEX on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \nCentral nervous system-related adverse reactions may have a minor influence on the ability to drive \nand use machines in susceptible patients (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with AVONEX therapy is related to flu-like \nsymptoms. The most commonly reported flu-like symptoms are myalgia, fever, chills, sweating, \nasthenia, headache and nausea. Titrating AVONEX at the initiation of therapy has demonstrated a \nreduction in the severity and incidence of flu-like symptoms. Flu-like symptoms tend to be most \nprominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency with continued treatment. \n \nTransient neurological symptoms that may mimic MS exacerbations may occur following injections. \nTransient episodes of hypertonia and/or severe muscular weakness that prevent voluntary movements \nmay occur at any time during treatment. These episodes are of limited duration, temporally related to \nthe injections and may recur after subsequent injections. In some cases these symptoms are associated \nwith flu-like symptoms. \n \nThe frequencies of adverse reactions are expressed in patient-years, according to the following \ncategories: \n \nVery common (\u22651/10 patient-years); \nCommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10 patient-years); \nUncommon (\u22651/1, 000 to <1/100 patient-years); \nRare (\u22651/10, 000 to <1/1,000 patient-years); \nVery rare (<1/10,000 patient-years); \nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nPatient-time is the sum of individual units of time that the patient in the study has been exposed to \nAVONEX before experiencing the adverse reaction. For example, 100 person-years could be \nobserved in 100 patients who were on treatment for one year or in 200 patients who were on treatment \nfor half a year. \n \nAdverse reactions identified from studies (clinical trials and observational studies, with a period of \nfollow-up ranging from two years to six years) and other adverse reactions identified through \nspontaneous reporting from the market, with unknown frequency, are provided in the table below. \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nInvestigations \n

treatment. \n \n3A syncope episode may occur after AVONEX injection, it is normally a single episode that usually \nappears at the beginning of the treatment and does not recur with subsequent injections. \n \nPulmonary arterial hypertension \n \nCases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. \nEvents were reported at various time points including up to several years after starting treatment with \ninterferon beta. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nLimited published data suggest that the safety profile in adolescents from 12 to 16 years of age \nreceiving AVONEX 30 micrograms IM once per week is similar to that seen in adults. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. However, in case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised \nfor observation and appropriate supportive treatment given. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic Group: Interferons, ATC code: L03 AB07. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\n \nInterferons are a family of naturally occurring proteins that are produced by eukaryotic cells in \nresponse to viral infection and other biological inducers. Interferons are cytokines that mediate \nantiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory activities. Three major forms of interferons have \nbeen distinguished: alpha, beta, and gamma. Interferons alpha and beta are classified as Type I \ninterferons, and interferon gamma is a Type II interferon. These interferons have overlapping but \nclearly distinguishable biological activities. They can also differ with respect to their cellular sites of \nsynthesis. \n \nInterferon beta is produced by various cell types including fibroblasts and macrophages. Natural \ninterferon beta and AVONEX (interferon beta-1a) are glycosylated and have a single N-linked \ncomplex carbohydrate moiety. Glycosylation of other proteins is known to affect their stability, \nactivity, biodistribution, and half-life in blood. However, the effects of interferon beta that are \ndependent on glycosylation are not fully defined. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAVONEX exerts its biological effects by binding to specific receptors on the surface of human cells. \nThis binding initiates a complex cascade of intracellular events that leads to the expression of \nnumerous interferon-induced gene products and markers. These include MHC Class I, Mx protein, \n2\u2019 / 5\u2019-oligoadenylate synthetase, \u03b22-microglobulin, and neopterin. Some of these products have been \nmeasured in the serum and cellular fractions of blood collected from patients treated with AVONEX. \nAfter a single intramuscular dose of AVONEX, serum levels of these products remain elevated for at \nleast four days and up to one week. \n \nWhether the mechanism of action of AVONEX in MS is mediated by the same pathway as the \nbiological effects described above is not known because the pathophysiology of MS is not well \nestablished. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe effects of lyophilised AVONEX in the treatment of MS were demonstrated in a \nplacebo-controlled study of 301 patients (AVONEX n=158, placebo n=143) with relapsing MS \ncharacterised by at least 2 exacerbations in the previous 3 years or at least one exacerbation per year \nprior to entry when the duration of the disease was less than 3 years. Patients with an EDSS of 1.0 to \n3.5 at entry were included in the clinical trial. Due to the design of the study, patients were followed \nfor variable lengths of time. 150 AVONEX-treated patients completed one year on study and 85 \ncompleted two years on study. In the study, the cumulative percentage of patients who developed \ndisability progression (by Kaplan-Meier life table analysis) by the end of two years was 35% for \nplacebo-treated patients and 22% for AVONEX-treated patients. Disability progression was measured \nas an increase in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 1.0 point, sustained for at least six \nmonths. It was also shown that there was a one-third reduction in annual relapse rate. This latter \nclinical effect was observed after more than one year of treatment. \n \nA double-blind randomised dose comparison study of 802 relapsing MS patients (AVONEX \n30 micrograms n=402, AVONEX 60 micrograms n=400) has shown no statistically significant \ndifferences or trends between the 30 micrograms and the 60 micrograms doses of AVONEX in \nclinical and general MRI parameters. \n \nThe effects of AVONEX in the treatment of MS were also demonstrated in a randomised double-blind \nstudy performed with 383 patients (AVONEX n=193, placebo n=190) with a single demyelinating \nevent associated with at least two compatible brain MRI lesions. A reduction of the risk of \nexperiencing a second event was noted in the AVONEX treatment group. An effect on MRI \nparameters was also seen. The estimated risk of a second event was 50% in three years and 39% in \ntwo years in the placebo group and 35% (three years) and 21% (two years) in the AVONEX group. In \na post-hoc analysis, those patients with a baseline MRI with at least one Gd-enhancing lesion and nine \n\n\n\n11 \n\nT2 lesions had a two-year risk of suffering a second event of 56% in the placebo group and 21% in \nthe AVONEX treatment group. However, the impact of early treatment with AVONEX is unknown \neven in this high-risk subgroup as the study was mainly designed to assess the time to the second \nevent rather than the long-term evolution of the disease. Furthermore, for the time-being there is no \nwell established definition of a high risk patient although a more conservative approach is to accept at \nleast nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least one new T2 or one new \nGd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least three months after the initial scan. In any case, \ntreatment should only be considered for patients classified at high risk. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nLimited data of the efficacy/safety of AVONEX 15 micrograms IM once per week (n=8) as compared \nto no treatment (n=8) with follow up for 4 years showed results in line to those seen in adults, \nalthough the EDSS scores increased in the treated group over the 4 year follow-up thus indicating \ndisease progression. No direct comparison with the dose currently recommended in adults is available. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic profile of AVONEX has been investigated indirectly with an assay that \nmeasures interferon antiviral activity. This assay is limited in that it is sensitive for interferon but \nlacks specificity for interferon beta. Alternative assay techniques are not sufficiently sensitive. \n \nFollowing intramuscular administration of AVONEX, serum antiviral activity levels peak between 5 \nand 15 hours post-dose and decline with a half-life of approximately 10 hours. With appropriate \nadjustment for the rate of absorption from the injection site, the calculated bioavailability is \napproximately 40%. The calculated bioavailability is greater without such adjustments. Subcutaneous \nadministration cannot be substituted for intramuscular administration. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nCarcinogenesis: No carcinogenicity data for interferon beta-1a are available in animals or humans. \n \nChronic Toxicity: In a 26-week repeated dose toxicity study in rhesus monkeys by intramuscular route \nonce per week, administered in combination with another immunomodulating agent, an anti CD40 \nligand monoclonal antibody, no immune response toward interferon beta-1a and no signs of toxicity \nwere demonstrated. \n \nLocal Tolerance: Intramuscular irritation has not been evaluated in animals following repeated \nadministration to the same injection site. \n \nMutagenesis: Limited but relevant mutagenesis tests have been carried out. The results have been \nnegative. \n \nImpairment of Fertility: Fertility and developmental studies in rhesus monkeys have been carried out \nwith a related form of interferon beta-1a. At very high doses, anovulatory and abortifacient effects in \ntest animals were observed. Similar reproductive dose-related effects have also been observed with \nother forms of alpha and beta interferons. No teratogenic effects or effects on foetal development have \nbeen observed, but the available information on the effects of interferon beta-1a in the peri- and \npostnatal periods is limited. \n \nNo information is available on the effects of interferon beta-1a on male fertility. \n \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n6.

The activity against other standards is not known. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection in pre-filled pen. \n \nClear and colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAVONEX is indicated for the treatment of  \n \n\u2022 Patients diagnosed with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). In clinical trials, this was \n\ncharacterised by two or more acute exacerbations (relapses) in the previous three-years without \nevidence of continuous progression between relapses; AVONEX slows the progression of \ndisability and decreases the frequency of relapses. \n\n \n\u2022 Patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if it is severe \n\nenough to warrant treatment with intravenous corticosteroids, if alternative diagnoses have been \nexcluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple \nsclerosis (see section 5.1). \n\n \nAVONEX should be discontinued in patients who develop progressive MS. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the \ndisease. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults: The recommended dosage for the treatment of relapsing MS is 30 micrograms (0.5 ml \nsolution), administered by intramuscular (IM) injection once a week (see section 6.6).  No additional \nbenefit has been shown by administering a higher dose (60 micrograms) once a week. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nTitration: To help patients reduce the incidence and severity of flu-like symptoms (see section 4.8), \ntitration can be performed at the initiation of treatment. Titration using the pre-filled syringe can be \nachieved by initiating therapy on \u00bc dose increments per week reaching the full dose (30 \nmicrograms/week) by the fourth week.  \n \nAn alternative titration schedule can be achieved by initiating therapy on approximately a \u00bd dose of \nAVONEX once a week before increasing to the full dose. In order to obtain adequate efficacy, a dose \nof 30 micrograms  once a week should be reached and maintained after the initial titration period.  \nOnce a full dose is achieved patients may begin using AVONEX PEN.   \n \nPrior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is \nadvised to decrease flu-like symptoms associated with AVONEX administration. These symptoms are \nusually present during the first few months of treatment. \n \nPaediatric population: The safety and efficacy of AVONEX in adolescents aged 12 to 16 years have \nnot yet been established. Currently available data are described in section 4.8 and 5.1 but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of AVONEX in children below 12 years of age have not yet been established. \nNo data are available. \n \nElderly: Clinical studies did not include a sufficient number of patients aged 65 and over to determine \nwhether they respond differently than younger patients. However, based on the mode of clearance of \nthe active substance there are no theoretical reasons for any requirement for dose adjustments in the \nelderly. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nAt the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Patients should be \nclinically evaluated after two years of treatment and longer-term treatment should be decided on an \nindividual basis by the treating physician. Treatment should be discontinued if the patient develops \nchronic progressive MS. \n \nAVONEX PEN is a pre-filled pen, intended for single use, and should only be used following \nadequate training. \n \nThe recommended intramuscular injection site using the AVONEX PEN is the upper, outer thigh \nmuscle. The injection site should be varied each week. \n \nFor administration of AVONEX via the AVONEX PEN, the instructions in the package leaflet should \nbe followed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any \n\nexcipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Patients with current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nAVONEX should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive \ndisorders, in particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and \nsuicidal ideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in \nassociation with interferon use. Patients should be advised to immediately report any symptoms of \ndepression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. \n \nPatients exhibiting depression should be monitored closely during therapy and treated appropriately. \nCessation of therapy with AVONEX should be considered (see also sections 4.3 and 4.8). \n \nAVONEX should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those \nreceiving treatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with \nanti-epileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8).  \n \nCaution should be used and close monitoring considered when administering AVONEX to patients \nwith severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. \n \nThrombotic microangiopathy (TMA): Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as \nthrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal \ncases, have been reported with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points \nduring treatment and may occur several weeks to several years after starting treatment with interferon \nbeta. Early clinical features include thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous \nsystem symptoms (e.g. confusion, paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings \nsuggestive of TMA include decreased platelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) \ndue to haemolysis and schistocytes (erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical \nfeatures of TMA are observed, further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and \nrenal function is recommended. If TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering \nplasma exchange) and immediate discontinuation of AVONEX is recommended.  \n \nNephrotic Syndrome: Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including \ncollapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), \nmembranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have \nbeen reported during treatment with interferon-beta products. Events were reported at various time \npoints during treatment and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon beta. Periodic \nmonitoring of early signs or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is \nrecommended, especially in patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic \nsyndrome is required and discontinuation of treatment with AVONEX should be considered. \n \nHepatic injury including elevated serum hepatic enzyme levels, hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis and \nhepatic failure has been reported with interferon beta in post-marketing (see section 4.8). In some \ncases, these reactions have occurred in the presence of other medicinal products that have been \nassociated with hepatic injury. The potential of additive effects from multiple medicinal products or \nother hepatotoxic agents (e.g. alcohol) has not been determined. Patients should be monitored for \nsigns of hepatic injury and caution exercised when interferons are used concomitantly with other \nmedicinal products associated with hepatic injury. \n \nPatients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely \nmonitored for worsening of their clinical condition during treatment with AVONEX. Flu-like \nsymptoms associated with AVONEX therapy may prove stressful to patients with underlying cardiac \nconditions. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. Therefore, in addition to those \nlaboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with MS, complete and differential white \nblood cell counts, platelet counts, and blood chemistry, including liver function tests, are \nrecommended during AVONEX therapy. Patients with myelosuppression may require more intensive \nmonitoring of complete blood cell counts, with differential and platelet counts. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nPatients may develop antibodies to AVONEX. The antibodies of some of those patients reduce the \nactivity of interferon beta-1a in vitro (neutralising antibodies). Neutralising antibodies are associated \nwith a reduction in the in vivo biological effects of AVONEX and may potentially be associated with \na reduction of clinical efficacy. It is estimated that the plateau for the incidence of neutralising \nantibody formation is reached after 12 months of treatment. Recent clinical studies with patients \ntreated up to three years with AVONEX suggest that approximately 5% to 8% develop neutralising \nantibodies. \n \nThe use of various assays to detect serum antibodies to interferons limits the ability to compare \nantigenicity among different products. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal interaction studies have been performed in humans. \n \nThe interaction of AVONEX with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not \nbeen studied systematically. The clinical studies indicate that MS patients can receive AVONEX and \ncorticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. \n \nInterferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes \nin humans and animals. The effect of high-dose AVONEX administration on P450-dependent \nmetabolism in monkeys was evaluated and no changes in liver metabolising capabilities were \nobserved. Caution should be exercised when AVONEX is administered in combination with \nmedicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic \ncytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. some classes of antiepileptics and antidepressants. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nA large amount of data (more than 1000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post-marketing \nexperience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre-conception exposure to \ninterferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of \nexposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use \nwas contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when pregnancy was detected \nand/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very limited.  \n \nBased on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion.  \nThe risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be \nevaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. \n \nIf clinically needed, the use of Avonex may be considered during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding  \n \nLimited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1a into breast milk, together with the \nchemical / physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1a \nexcreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are \nanticipated.  \n \nAvonex can be used during breast-feeding.  \n \n \nFertility \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nFertility and developmental studies in rhesus monkeys have been carried out with a related form of \ninterferon beta-1a. At very high doses, anovulatory and abortifacient effects in test animals were \nobserved (see section 5.3).  \nNo information is available on the effects of interferon beta-1a on male fertility. \n \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects of AVONEX on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \nCentral nervous system-related adverse reactions may have a minor influence on the ability to drive \nand use machines in susceptible patients (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with AVONEX therapy is related to flu-like \nsymptoms. The most commonly reported flu-like symptoms are myalgia, fever, chills, sweating, \nasthenia, headache and nausea. Titrating AVONEX at the initiation of therapy has demonstrated a \nreduction in the severity and incidence of flu-like symptoms. Flu-like symptoms tend to be most \nprominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency with continued treatment. \n \nTransient neurological symptoms that may mimic MS exacerbations may occur following injections. \nTransient episodes of hypertonia and/or severe muscular weakness that prevent voluntary movements \nmay occur at any time during treatment. These episodes are of limited duration, temporally related to \nthe injections and may recur after subsequent injections. In some cases these symptoms are associated \nwith flu-like symptoms. \n \nThe frequencies of adverse reactions are expressed in patient-years, according to the following \ncategories: \n \nVery common (\u22651/10 patient-years); \nCommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10 patient-years); \nUncommon (\u22651/1, 000 to <1/100 patient-years); \nRare (\u22651/10, 000 to <1/1,000 patient-years); \nVery rare (<1/10,000 patient-years); \nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nPatient-time is the sum of individual units of time that the patient in the study has been exposed to \nAVONEX before experiencing the adverse reaction. For example, 100 person-years could be \nobserved in 100 patients who were on treatment for one year or in 200 patients who were on treatment \nfor half a year. \n \nAdverse reactions identified from studies (clinical trials and observational studies, with a period of \nfollow-up ranging from two years to six years) and other adverse reactions identified through \nspontaneous reporting from the market, with unknown frequency, are provided in the table below. \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n19

subsequent injections. \n \nPulmonary arterial hypertension \n \nCases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. \nEvents were reported at various time points including up to several years after starting treatment with \ninterferon beta. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nLimited published data suggest that the safety profile in adolescents from 12 to 16 years of age \nreceiving AVONEX 30 micrograms IM once per week is similar to that seen in adults. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. However, in case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised \nfor observation and appropriate supportive treatment given. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic Group: Interferons, ATC code: L03 AB07. \n \nInterferons are a family of naturally occurring proteins that are produced by eukaryotic cells in \nresponse to viral infection and other biological inducers. Interferons are cytokines that mediate \nantiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory activities. Three major forms of interferons have \nbeen distinguished: alpha, beta, and gamma. Interferons alpha and beta are classified as Type I \ninterferons, and interferon gamma is a Type II interferon. These interferons have overlapping but \nclearly distinguishable biological activities. They can also differ with respect to their cellular sites of \nsynthesis. \n \nInterferon beta is produced by various cell types including fibroblasts and macrophages. Natural \ninterferon beta and AVONEX (interferon beta-1a) are glycosylated and have a single N-linked \ncomplex carbohydrate moiety. Glycosylation of other proteins is known to affect their stability, \nactivity, biodistribution, and half-life in blood. However, the effects of interferon beta that are \ndependent on glycosylation are not fully defined. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAVONEX exerts its biological effects by binding to specific receptors on the surface of human cells. \nThis binding initiates a complex cascade of intracellular events that leads to the expression of \nnumerous interferon-induced gene products and markers. These include MHC Class I, Mx protein, \n2\u2019 / 5\u2019-oligoadenylate synthetase, \u03b22-microglobulin, and neopterin. Some of these products have been \nmeasured in the serum and cellular fractions of blood collected from patients treated with AVONEX. \nAfter a single intramuscular dose of AVONEX, serum levels of these products remain elevated for at \nleast four days and up to one week. \n \nWhether the mechanism of action of AVONEX in MS is mediated by the same pathway as the \nbiological effects described above is not known because the pathophysiology of MS is not well \nestablished. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe effects of lyophilised AVONEX in the treatment of MS were demonstrated in a \nplacebo-controlled study of 301 patients (AVONEX n=158, placebo n=143) with relapsing MS \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n23 \n\ncharacterised by at least 2 exacerbations in the previous 3 years or at least one exacerbation per year \nprior to entry when the duration of the disease was less than 3 years. Patients with an EDSS of 1.0 to \n3.5 at entry were included in the clinical trial. Due to the design of the study, patients were followed \nfor variable lengths of time. 150 AVONEX-treated patients completed one year on study and 85 \ncompleted two years on study. In the study, the cumulative percentage of patients who developed \ndisability progression (by Kaplan-Meier life table analysis) by the end of two years was 35% for \nplacebo-treated patients and 22% for AVONEX-treated patients. Disability progression was measured \nas an increase in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 1.0 point, sustained for at least six \nmonths. It was also shown that there was a one-third reduction in annual relapse rate. This latter \nclinical effect was observed after more than one year of treatment. \n \nA double-blind randomised dose comparison study of 802 relapsing MS patients (AVONEX \n30 micrograms n=402, AVONEX 60 micrograms n=400) has shown no statistically significant \ndifferences or trends between the 30 micrograms and the 60 micrograms doses of AVONEX in \nclinical and general MRI parameters. \n \nThe effects of AVONEX in the treatment of MS were also demonstrated in a randomised double-blind \nstudy performed with 383 patients (AVONEX n=193, placebo n=190) with a single demyelinating \nevent associated with at least two compatible brain MRI lesions. A reduction of the risk of \nexperiencing a second event was noted in the AVONEX treatment group. An effect on MRI \nparameters was also seen. The estimated risk of a second event was 50% in three years and 39% in \ntwo years in the placebo group and 35% (three years) and 21% (two years) in the AVONEX group. In \na post-hoc analysis, those patients with a baseline MRI with at least one Gd-enhancing lesion and nine \nT2 lesions had a two-year risk of suffering a second event of 56% in the placebo group and 21% in \nthe AVONEX treatment group. However, the impact of early treatment with AVONEX is unknown \neven in this high-risk subgroup as the study was mainly designed to assess the time to the second \nevent rather than the long-term evolution of the disease. Furthermore, for the time-being there is no \nwell established definition of a high risk patient although a more conservative approach is to accept at \nleast nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least one new T2 or one new \nGd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least three months after the initial scan. In any case, \ntreatment should only be considered for patients classified at high risk. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nLimited data of the efficacy/safety of AVONEX 15 micrograms IM once per week (n=8) as compared \nto no treatment (n=8) with follow up for 4 years showed results in line to those seen in adults, \nalthough the EDSS scores increased in the treated group over the 4 year follow-up thus indicating \ndisease progression. No direct comparison with the dose currently recommended in adults is available. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic profile of AVONEX has been investigated indirectly with an assay that \nmeasures interferon antiviral activity. This assay is limited in that it is sensitive for interferon but \nlacks specificity for interferon beta. Alternative assay techniques are not sufficiently sensitive. \n \nFollowing intramuscular administration of AVONEX, serum antiviral activity levels peak between 5 \nand 15 hours post-dose and decline with a half-life of approximately 10 hours. With appropriate \nadjustment for the rate of absorption from the injection site, the calculated bioavailability is \napproximately 40%. The calculated bioavailability is greater without such adjustments. Subcutaneous \nadministration cannot be substituted for intramuscular administration. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nCarcinogenesis: No carcinogenicity data for interferon beta-1a are available in animals or humans. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nChronic Toxicity: In a 26-week repeated dose toxicity study in rhesus monkeys by intramuscular route \nonce per week, administered in combination with another immunomodulating agent, an anti CD40 \nligand monoclonal antibody, no immune response toward interferon beta-1a and no signs of toxicity \nwere demonstrated. \n \nLocal Tolerance: Intramuscular irritation has not been evaluated in animals following repeated \nadministration to the same injection site. \n \nMutagenesis: Limited but relevant mutagenesis tests have been carried out. The results have been \nnegative. \n \nImpairment of Fertility: Fertility and developmental studies in rhesus monkeys have been carried out \nwith a related form of interferon beta-1a. At very high doses, anovulatory and abortifacient effects in \ntest animals were observed. Similar reproductive dose-related effects have also been observed with \nother forms of alpha and beta interferons. No teratogenic effects or effects on foetal development have \nbeen observed, but the available information on the effects of interferon beta-1a in the peri- and \npostnatal periods is limited. \n \nNo information is available on the effects of interferon beta-1a on male fertility. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n(Notes information) \n \nThis leaflet is changed from time to time. \nPlease check every time you get your prescription refilled to see if the leaflet has been updated. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1.

Contents of the pack and other information \n7. How to inject AVONEX \n \n \n1 What AVONEX is and what it is used for \n \nWhat AVONEX is \n \nThe active substance in Avonex is a protein called interferon beta-1a. Interferons are natural \nsubstances made in your body to help protect you from infections and diseases. The protein in Avonex \nis made up of exactly the same ingredients as interferon beta that is found in the human body.  \n \nWhat AVONEX is used for \n \nAvonex is used to treat Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Treatment with Avonex can help to prevent you \nfrom getting worse, although it will not cure MS. \n \nEveryone has their own set of MS symptoms. These can include: \n- Feeling off-balance or light headed, walking problems, stiffness and muscle spasms, tiredness, \n\nnumbness in the face, arms or legs \n- Acute or chronic pain, bladder and bowel problems, sexual problems and problems seeing \n\nthings \n- Difficulty in thinking and concentrating, depression. \nMS also tends to flare up from time to time: this is called a relapse. \n \n\n\n\n44 \n\n(Notes information) \n \nAvonex works best when you use it at the same time, once a week, on a regular basis. \nDo not stop your Avonex treatment without speaking to your neurologist. \n \n \nAvonex can help to reduce the number of relapses that you have and slow down the disabling \neffects of MS. Your doctor will advise you for how long you can use Avonex or when to stop. \n \nHow AVONEX works \n \nMultiple sclerosis is linked to nerve (brain or spinal cord) damage. In MS, your body\u2019s defence \nsystem reacts against its own myelin \u2013 the \u2018insulation\u2019 that surrounds nerve fibres. When myelin is \ndamaged, the messages between the brain and other parts of the body are disrupted. This is what \ncauses the symptoms of MS. Avonex seems to work by stopping your body\u2019s defence system from \nattacking the myelin. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use AVONEX \n \nDo not use AVONEX \n \n- If you are allergic to interferon beta or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- If you have severe depression or think about committing suicide. \n \nTalk to a doctor straight away if any of these apply to you. \n \n(Notes information) \n \nAvonex and allergic reactions. Because Avonex is based on a protein, there is a small chance of an \nallergic reaction. \n \nMore about depression. If you have severe depression or thoughts about suicide, you must not use \nAvonex. \nIf you have depression, your doctor may still prescribe Avonex for you, but it's important to let your \ndoctor know if you have had depression or any similar problems affecting your moods. \n \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor before using Avonex if you have or have had in the past: \n- Depression or problems affecting your moods \n- Thoughts about committing suicide. \nChanges to your mood, thoughts about suicide, feeling unusually sad, anxious or worthless, should be \nreported to your doctor immediately. \n- Epilepsy or other seizure disorders not controlled by medication \n- Serious kidney or liver problems \n- A low number of white blood cells or platelets, which can cause an increased risk of \n\ninfection, bleeding or anaemia \n- Heart problems, which can cause symptoms such as chest pain (angina), particularly after any \n\nactivity; swollen ankles, shortness of breath (congestive heart failure); or an irregular heartbeat \n(arrhythmias). \n\nTalk to your doctor if you have any of these conditions, or if they worsen whilst taking Avonex. \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nBlood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots could \naffect your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting Avonex.  \n \nYour doctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your \nkidneys. \n \nTell your doctor you are using Avonex: \n- If you are having a blood test. Avonex may interfere with the results. \n\n \n \n(Notes information) \n \nSometimes you will need to remind other medical staff that you are being treated with Avonex. \nFor example, if you are prescribed other medicines, or if you have a blood test, Avonex may affect the \nother medicines or the test result. \n \n \nOther medicines and AVONEX \n \nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines, especially \nthose used to treat epilepsy or depression. Avonex may affect other medicines or be affected by them. \nThis includes any other medicines including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  \n\nNo harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Avonex can be used during \nbreast-feeding. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nIf you feel dizzy, do not drive. Avonex makes some people feel dizzy. If this happens to you, or if \nyou get any other side effects that could affect your ability, do not drive or use machines. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of AVONEX \n \nThis medicine is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. It contains less than 23 mg (1 mmol) sodium in each \nweekly dose. \n \n \n3. How to use AVONEX \n \nThe recommended dose  \n \nOne injection of Avonex, once a week. \nTry to use Avonex at the same time on the same day each week. \n \nNot for children \nAvonex is not to be used in children below the age of 12 years. \n \nIf you have decided to start treatment with Avonex, your doctor may provide you with an Avostartclip \ntitration kit. The Avostartclip attaches to the syringe and enables you to gradually increase your dose \nof Avonex when you first start treatment. This is to limit flu-like symptoms which some people \n\n\n\n46 \n\nexperience when they start using Avonex. Your doctor or nurse will help you use the Avostartclip \ntitration kit.  \n \n(Notes information) \n \nStarting Avonex \nIf you are new to Avonex, your doctor may advise you to gradually increase your dose so that you can \nadjust to the effects of Avonex before taking the full dose. You will be provided with an Avostartclip \ntitration kit. Avostartclips can be attached onto the syringe enabling a reduced dose of Avonex to be \ninjected at the start of treatment. Each Avostartclip should be used once and then discarded along with \nany remaining Avonex. For further details on use, speak with your doctor.    \n \n \nInjecting yourself \n \nYou can inject Avonex yourself without the help of your doctor, if they have trained you to do this. \nThe instructions on how to inject yourself are at the end of this leaflet (see section 7, How to inject \nAVONEX). \n \nIf you have trouble handling the syringe, ask your doctor who may be able to help. \n \n(Notes information) \n \nThere are more details on how to inject Avonex at the end of this leaflet. \n \nAlternate needle: \nYour pack of Avonex already includes a needle for injection. It may be possible for your doctor to \nprescribe you a shorter and thinner needle, depending on your body type. Talk to your doctor to see if \nthis is appropriate for you. \n \nIf you have problems handling the syringe, talk to your doctor about using a syringe grip. This is a \nspecially designed holder to help you with injecting Avonex. \n \n \nHow long to use AVONEX \n \nYour doctor will tell you how long you need to keep using Avonex. It is important to continue using \nAvonex regularly. Do not make changes unless your doctor tells you. \n \nIf you inject more than you should \n \nYou should only have one injection of Avonex, once a week. If you have used more than one injection \nof Avonex in a three-day period, contact your doctor or pharmacist straight away for advice. \n \nIf you miss an injection \n \nIf you miss your usual weekly dose, inject a dose as soon as you can. Then leave a week before \nusing Avonex again. Continue injecting on this new day every week. If you have a preferred day for \nusing Avonex, talk to your doctor about managing the dose, to get back to your preferred day. Do not \nuse two injections to make up for a missed injection. \n \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n \n(Notes information) \n \nAlthough the list of possible side effects can seem worrying, it\u2019s possible that you may not have any \nof them. \n \n \nSerious side effects: get medical help \n \nSerious allergic reactions \nIf you get any of these: \n- Swelling of the face, lips or tongue \n- Difficulty breathing \n- A rash. \nCall a doctor immediately.

Symptoms may include increased \nbruising, bleeding, fever, extreme weakness, headache, dizziness or light-headedness.  Your \ndoctor may find changes in your blood and the function of your kidneys. \n\n \nIf any of the effects trouble you, talk to your doctor. \n \nOther side effects  \n \n(Notes information) \n \nThese effects have been seen in people using Avonex, but we do not know how likely they are to \nhappen. \n \n \n- An underactive or overactive thyroid \n- Nervousness or anxiety, emotional instability, irrational thoughts or hallucinations (seeing or \n\nhearing things that are not real), confusion or suicide \n- Numbness, dizziness, seizures or fits and migraines \n- An awareness of your heartbeat (palpitations), a rapid or irregular heartbeat, or heart problems \n\nwhich would have the following symptoms: a reduced ability to exercise, inability to lie flat in \nbed, shortness of breath or swollen ankles \n\n- Liver problems as described above \n- Nettle rash or blister-like rash, itching, worsening of psoriasis if you have it \n- Swelling or bleeding at the site of injection, or chest pain after an injection \n- Gaining or losing weight \n- Changes to test results, including changes to liver function tests. \n- Pulmonary arterial hypertension: A disease of severe narrowing of the blood vessels in the \n\nlungs resulting in high blood pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the \n\n\n\n49 \n\nlungs. Pulmonary arterial hypertension has been seen at various time points during treatment, \nincluding several years after starting treatment with interferon beta-products. \n \n\nIf any of the effects trouble you, talk to your doctor. \n \nEffects of the injection \n- Feeling faint: Your first injection of Avonex may be given by your doctor. It may make you \n\nfeel faint. You may even actually faint. This is unlikely to happen again. \n- Just after an injection, your muscles may feel tense or very weak \u2013 as though you are \n\nhaving a relapse. This is rare. It only happens when you inject and the effects soon pass. They \nmay happen any time after starting on Avonex. \n\n- If you notice any irritation or skin problems after an injection, talk to your doctor. \n \nFlu-like symptoms \n \n(Notes information) \n \nThree simple ways to help reduce the impact of flu-like symptoms: \n\n1. Use your Avonex injection just before bedtime. This may allow you to sleep through the \neffects. \n\n2. Take paracetamol or ibuprofen half an hour before your Avonex injection and continue \ntaking it for up to a day. Speak to your doctor or pharmacist about a suitable dose. \n\n3. If you have a fever, drink plenty of water to keep you hydrated. \n \n\n \n \nSome people find that after injecting Avonex, they feel like they have flu. Signs are: \n- Headache \n- Muscle aches \n- Chills or a fever. \n \nThese symptoms are not really flu. \nYou can\u2019t pass it on to anyone else. They are more common when you first start using Avonex. Your \ndoctor may provide you with an Avostartclip titration kit which enables you to gradually increase \nyour dose at the start of treatment to help limit flu-like symptoms.

How to inject AVONEX \n \nYou should have had training in how to inject Avonex  \nThese notes are a reminder. If there\u2019s anything you\u2019re not sure about, check with your doctor or \npharmacist. \n \nWhere to inject \n \n\u2022 Avonex is injected into a muscle, for example, the upper thigh muscle. Injection of Avonex \n\ninto the buttocks is not recommended. \n\u2022 Use a different injection site each week. This means less risk of irritation to your skin and \n\nmuscle. \n\u2022 Do not use any area of skin that is bruised, sore, or infected, or if there is an open wound. \n \n\n \n \nA. Getting Ready \n \n1. Remove one sealed plastic tray from the refrigerator \n\n- Check the expiry date on the lid of the tray. Do not use it if it is out-of-date. \n- Peel back the paper lid completely. Check the blister tray contains one pre-filled syringe \n\nand one injection needle (see picture \u201cContents of the plastic tray\u201d). \n \n\n2.  Leave the syringe to warm up \n- Leave it at room temperature for half an hour. This makes the injection more \n\ncomfortable than injecting straight from a refrigerator.  \nTip: Do not use external heat sources such as hot water to warm the syringe. \n \n\n3.  Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry them. \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n4. Prepare alcohol wipes and sticking plasters (not supplied) if you need them.  \n \n\nFind a clean, hard surface to lay out the items needed for your injection. Lay the tray down \non it. \n\n \n \nB. Preparing the injection \n \n1 \n\n \n\nCheck the liquid in the syringe \nIt should be clear and colourless. If the solution is cloudy, coloured \nor contains any floating particles, do not use the pre-filled syringe. \n\n2 \n\n \n\nRemove the syringe cap \nThe syringe has a white tamper-evident cap. \nMake sure the cap is intact and has not been opened. \nIf it looks like it has been opened, do not use that syringe. \nHold the syringe so that the white cap is facing up.  \nBend the cap at a right angle until it snaps off. \nDo not touch the connection port.  \nDo not push on the plunger. \n\n \n3 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFit the needle  \nOpen needle to expose the connection port. Keep the cover on.  \nPress the needle onto the syringe. \nTurn it clockwise until it locks into place. \n\nTip: Make sure the injection needle is firmly attached to the syringe. \nOtherwise it may leak.  \nIf you have been told to gradually increase your dose of Avonex, you \nmay need to use an Avostartclip titration kit provided by your doctor. \nFor further details, speak with your doctor  \nNow pull off the plastic needle cover. Do not twist it. \n\nTip: If you twist the needle cover to remove it, you may accidentally \nremove the needle as well. \n\n \n\n\n\n54 \n\nC. Giving the injection \n \n1 \n\n \n\nClean and stretch the injection site \nIf you need to, use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin at the injection \nsite you\u2019ve chosen. Allow the skin to dry. \nWith one hand, stretch the skin around the injection site. \nRelax your muscle. \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\nMake the injection \nInsert the injection needle with a quick dart-like thrust at right \nangles to the skin, into the muscle. \nThe needle must go all the way in. \nPress the plunger slowly until the syringe is empty. \nIf you are using a syringe that has an Avostartclip attached, you will \nreceive a lower dose of Avonex.  \nThe syringe will not empty.  \n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nPull the needle out  \nKeep the skin stretched tightly or squeeze the skin around the \ninjection site, and pull out the needle. \nIf you use alcohol wipes, hold one on the injection site. \nPut a plaster over the site of injection if you need to. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDispose of the rubbish properly \n \nAfter you have finished each injection, put the needle and syringe into a \nspecial container (such as a sharps bin), not in ordinary rubbish. \nIf you have used the Avostartclip, the syringe (and the Avostartclip) must \nbe thrown away afterwards.  The unused portion of Avonex must not be \nused. \nWaste paper and used wipes can be put in an ordinary rubbish bin. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n55 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nAVONEX 30 micrograms/0.5ml solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n(Interferon beta-1a) \n\nPre-filled pen \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \nEven if you have used Avonex before, some of the information may have changed. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n(Notes information) \n \nThis leaflet is changed from time to time. \nPlease check every time you get your prescription refilled to see if the leaflet has been updated. \n \n \n(Notes information) \n \nIf there\u2019s anything you\u2019re not sure about, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \nIn this leaflet\u2026 \nThe right hand pages have the information you will need to use Avonex Pen properly. \nOn each left hand page you\u2019ll find useful tips and explanations on how to get the best from your \nmedicine. \nInside the back cover there\u2019s a fold-out chart with everything you need to make injections with your \nAvonex Pen. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet  \n\n1.

Contents of the pack and other information \n7. How to inject AVONEX PEN \n\n \n \n1 What AVONEX is and what it is used for \n \n(Notes information) \nAvonex works best when you use it: \n- at the same time \n- once a week \n- on a regular basis \nDo not stop your Avonex treatment without speaking to your neurologist. \n \n\n\n\n56 \n\nWhat AVONEX is \n \nAvonex Pen is used to inject Avonex. The active substance in Avonex is a protein called interferon \nbeta-1a. Interferons are natural substances made in your body to help protect you from infections and \ndiseases. The protein in Avonex is made up of exactly the same ingredients as interferon beta that is \nfound in the human body.  \n \nWhat AVONEX is used for \n \nAvonex is used to treat Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Treatment with Avonex can help to prevent you \nfrom getting worse, although it will not cure MS. \n \nEveryone has their own set of MS symptoms. These can include: \n- Feeling off-balance or light headed, walking problems, stiffness and muscle spasms, tiredness, \n\nnumbness in the face, arms or legs \n- Acute or chronic pain, bladder and bowel problems, sexual problems and problems seeing \n\nthings \n- Difficulty in thinking and concentrating, depression. \nMS also tends to flare up from time to time: this is called a relapse. \n \nAvonex can help to reduce the number of relapses that you have and slow down the disabling \neffects of MS. Your doctor will advise you for how long you can use Avonex or when to stop. \n \nHow AVONEX works \n \nMultiple sclerosis is linked to nerve (brain or spinal cord) damage. In MS, your body\u2019s defence \nsystem reacts against its own myelin \u2013 the \u2018insulation\u2019 that surrounds nerve fibres. When myelin is \ndamaged, the messages between the brain and other parts of the body are disrupted. This is what \ncauses the symptoms of MS. Avonex seems to work by stopping your body\u2019s defence system from \nattacking the myelin. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use AVONEX \n \n(Notes information) \nAvonex and allergic reactions \nBecause Avonex is based on a protein, there is a small chance of an allergic reaction. \n \nMore about depression \nIf you have severe depression or thoughts about suicide, you must not use Avonex. \nIf you have depression, your doctor may still prescribe Avonex for you, but it\u2019s important to let your \ndoctor know if you have had depression or any similar problems affecting your moods. \n \nDo not use AVONEX: \n \n- If you are allergic to interferon beta or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- If you have severe depression or think about committing suicide. \n \nTalk to a doctor straight away if any of these apply to you. \n  \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor before using Avonex if you have or have had in the past: \n- Depression or problems affecting your moods \n\n\n\n57 \n\n- Thoughts about committing suicide. \nChanges to your mood, thoughts about suicide, feeling unusually sad, anxious or worthless, should be \nreported to your doctor immediately. \n- Epilepsy or other seizure disorders not controlled by medication \n- Serious kidney or liver problems \n- A low number of white blood cells or platelets, which can cause an increased risk of \n\ninfection, bleeding or anaemia \n- Heart problems, which can cause symptoms such as chest pain (angina), particularly after any \n\nactivity; swollen ankles, shortness of breath (congestive heart failure); or an irregular heartbeat \n(arrhythmias). \n\nTalk to your doctor if you have any of these conditions, or if they worsen whilst taking Avonex. \n \nBlood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots could \naffect your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting Avonex.  \n \nYour doctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your \nkidneys. \n \nTell your doctor you are using Avonex: \n- If you are having a blood test. Avonex may interfere with the results. \n \n(Notes information) \n \nSometimes you will need to remind other medical staff that you are being treated with Avonex. \nFor example, if you are prescribed other medicines, or if you have a blood test, Avonex may affect the \nother medicines or the test result. \n \n \nOther medicines and AVONEX \n \nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines, especially \nthose used to treat epilepsy or depression. Avonex may affect other medicines or be affected by them. \nThis includes any medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  \n\nNo harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Avonex can be used during \nbreast-feeding. \n\nDriving and using machines \n \nIf you feel dizzy, do not drive. Avonex makes some people feel dizzy. If this happens to you, or if \nyou get any other side effects that could affect your ability, do not drive or use machines. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Avonex \n \nThis medicine is essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. It contains less than 23 mg (1 mmol) sodium in each \nweekly dose. \n \n \n\n\n\n58 \n\n3. How to use  AVONEX PEN \n \n(Notes information) \n \nThere are more details on how to inject using the Avonex Pen: \nIn the fold-out section at the back of this leaflet. \n \nThe recommended weekly dose  \nOne injection using Avonex Pen, once a week. \nTry to use Avonex at the same time on the same day each week. \n \nNot for children \nAvonex is not to be used in children below the age of 12 years. \n \nInjecting yourself \n \nYou can inject Avonex yourself using the Avonex Pen without the help of your doctor, if they have \ntrained you to do this. The instructions on how to inject yourself are at the end of this leaflet (see \nsection 7, How to inject AVONEX PEN). \n \nIf you have trouble handling the Avonex Pen, ask your doctor who may be able to help. \n \nHow long to use AVONEX \n \nYour doctor will tell you how long you need to keep using Avonex. It is important to continue using \nAvonex regularly. Do not make changes unless your doctor tells you. \n \nIf you inject more than you should \n \nYou should inject using only one Avonex Pen, once a week. If you have used more than one Avonex \nPen in a three-day period, contact your doctor or pharmacist straight away for advice. \n \nIf you miss an injection \n \nIf you miss your usual weekly dose, inject a dose as soon as you can. Then leave a week before \nusing Avonex Pen again. Continue injecting on this new day every week.

How to inject AVONEX PEN \n\n \nAvonex Pen (single use) \n \nPack contents \u2013 Avonex Pen, needle and Avonex Pen cover \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nAvonex Pen \u2013 prepared for injection \n \n\n \n \nAvonex Pen \u2013 after injection \n(prepared for disposal) \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \nYou should have had training in how to use your Avonex Pen.  \nThese notes are a reminder. If there's anything you're not sure about or you have a problem, check \nwith your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \nWhere to inject \n(Notes information) \nUse a different injection site each week \nThe best area is the upper, outer thigh muscle.  \nAlternate the left and right thighs. \nKeep a note of where you have injected each week. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\u2022 Avonex is injected into a muscle, the best area is the upper, outer thigh muscle as shown in \n\nthe diagram opposite. Injection of Avonex into the buttocks is not recommended. \n\u2022 Use a different injection site each week. This means less risk of irritation to your skin and \n\nmuscle. \n\u2022 Do not use any area of skin that is bruised, sore, or infected, or if there is an open wound. \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n(Notes information) \n \nTurn over \n \n \nA. Getting ready \n \n1. Take one Avonex Pen out of the refrigerator \n\nCheck the pack contains one Avonex Pen, one needle and one pen cover. \n \nDo not shake Avonex Pen. \n \nCheck the expiry date on the Avonex Pen label.  \nDo not use if it is out-of-date. \n \n\n2. Leave Avonex Pen to warm up \nLeave it at room temperature for half an hour. This makes the injection more comfortable \nthan using straight from the refrigerator.  \nTip: Do not use external heat sources such as hot water to warm Avonex Pen. \n \n\n3. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry them. \n \n4. Prepare alcohol wipes and sticking plasters (not supplied) if you need them.  \n \n5. Find a clean, hard surface to lay out the items needed for your injection.  \n \n(Notes information) \n \nFold out \n \n \n\n\n\n66 \n\nB. Preparing Avonex Pen \n \n1  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1 Remove the tamper-evident cap \nMake sure the cap is intact and has not been opened. If it \nlooks like it has been opened, do not use that Avonex Pen. \n\u2022 Hold Avonex Pen so that the cap is pointing up. \n\u2022 Bend the cap at a right angle until it snaps off.  \n\u2022 Do not touch the exposed glass tip. \n\nTip: Place the pen down on the table before beginning step 2. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n2 Fit the needle \n\u2022 Avonex Pen has been designed to function only with the \n\nsupplied needle.  \n\u2022 Peel off the foil from the base of the needle cover. \n\u2022 Attach the needle by pressing it onto the glass pen tip. \n\nKeep the pen upright. \n\u2022 Do not remove the needle cover. \n\u2022 Gently, turn the needle clockwise until it is firmly \n\nattached, otherwise the needle may leak. You may not \nget the full dose if it leaks. \n\nTip: The needle cover will come off automatically during step 3, \nbelow. \n \n\n3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n3 Extend the injector shield \n\u2022 Hold the body of the pen firmly with one hand. Point the \n\nneedle cover away from you and anyone else. \n\u2022 Use your other hand, and with one quick motion pull up \n\nthe injector shield (grooved area) over the needle until \nthe needle is fully covered. \n\n\u2022 The plastic needle cover will \u201cpop\u201d off. \nTip: Do not press the blue activation button at the same time. \n\n4  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n4 Check the injector shield is extended correctly \n\u2022 Check the injector shield is fully extended. A small \n\nrectangular area will be visible next to the oval display \nwindow. This is the safety lock. \n\n\n\n67 \n\n5  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n5 Check the liquid \n\u2022 Look through the oval display window. The liquid should \n\nbe clear and colourless. \nIf the solution is cloudy, coloured or contains any floating \nparticles, do not use this pen. \nAir bubble(s) are normal. \n\n \nC. Using Avonex Pen \n \n1  1 Clean the injection site \n\nIf you need to, use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin at the injection \nsite you\u2019ve chosen. Allow the skin to dry. \nTip: The best area is the upper, outer thigh. \n \n\n2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2 Place Avonex Pen on the skin \n\u2022 Hold the body of the pen at a right angle to the injection site with \n\none hand. Make sure the windows of the pen are visible. \nTip: Take care not to press the blue activation button too early. \n\u2022 Firmly press the body of the pen down onto the skin to release the \n\nsafety lock. \n\u2022 Check the safety lock is released. The small rectangular window \n\narea will disappear. Avonex Pen is now ready to inject. \nTip: Continue to hold the pen firmly on the skin. \n \n \n \n \n\n3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3 Give the injection \n\u2022 Press the blue activation button with your thumb to start the \n\ninjection. \nYou will hear a \u201cclick\u201d indicating the injection process has begun. Do \nnot lift the pen away from your skin. \n\u2022 Continue to hold the pen on your skin and count slowly for a full \n\n10 seconds. \n\u2022 After 10 seconds pull the pen straight out to remove the needle \n\nfrom the injection site.  \n\u2022 Apply pressure to the injection site for a few seconds. If there is \n\nany blood at the site, wipe it off. \n \n\n4  \n \n \n \n\n4 Confirm injection delivery \n\u2022 Check the circular display window. The window will now \n\nappear yellow when the full dose has been delivered. \n\u2022 Do not re-use the Avonex Pen. It is for a single use only. \n\n \n\n\n\n68 \n\n5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n5 Disposal \n\u2022 Place the pen cover on a flat, hard surface.  \n\nTip: Do not hold the pen cover. You may get a needle injury. \n\u2022 Insert needle directly into the pen cover.  \n\u2022  Firmly press until you hear a \u201cclick\u201d to seal the needle. You may \n\nneed to use both hands. Once the pen is sealed there is no risk of \ninjury. \n\n\u2022 Dispose of rubbish properly. Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist \nshould provide you with instructions on how to dispose of your used \nAvonex Pen, for example into a sharps bin. Always follow your local \nguidelines.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA. MANUFACTURER OF THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVE SUBSTANCE AND MANUFACTURER RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tB.

(notes information) avonex works best when you use it at the same time, once a week, on a regular basis. do not stop your avonex treatment without speaking to your neurologist. avonex can help to reduce the number of relapses that you have and slow down the disabling effects of ms. your doctor will advise you for how long you can use avonex or when to stop. how avonex works multiple sclerosis is linked to nerve (brain or spinal cord) damage. in ms, your body's defence system reacts against its own myelin the 'insulation' that surrounds nerve fibres. when myelin is damaged, the messages
