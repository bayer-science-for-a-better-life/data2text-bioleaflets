NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nLivensa 300 micrograms/24 hours transdermal patch \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach patch of 28 cm2 contains 8.4 mg testosterone and provides 300 micrograms of testosterone per \n24 hours. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTransdermal patch. \n \nThin, clear, oval matrix-type transdermal patch consisting of three layers: a translucent backing film, \nan adhesive matrix drug layer, and a protective release liner that is removed prior to application. Each \npatch surface is stamped with T001. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nLivensa is indicated for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in bilaterally \noophorectomised and hysterectomised (surgically induced menopause) women receiving concomitant \nestrogen therapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended daily dose of testosterone is 300 micrograms. This is achieved by applying the \npatch twice weekly on a continuous basis. The patch should be replaced with a fresh patch every 3 to \n4 days. Only one patch is to be worn at a time. \nLivens \nConcomitant estrogen treatment \nThe appropriate use and restrictions associated with estrogen therapy should be considered before \nLivensa therapy is initiated and during routine re-evaluation of treatment. Continued use of Livensa is \nonly recommended while concomitant use of estrogen is considered appropriate (i.e. the lowest \neffective dose for the shortest possible duration).  \n \nPatients treated with conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) are not recommended to use Livensa, as \nefficacy has not been demonstrated (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nDuration of treatment \nLivensa treatment response should be evaluated within 3-6 months of initiation, to determine if \ncontinued therapy is appropriate. Patients who do not experience a meaningful benefit should be re-\nevaluated and discontinuation of therapy be considered.  \n \nAs the efficacy and safety of Livensa have not been evaluated in studies of longer duration than 1 year, \nit is recommended that an appraisal of the treatment is undertaken every 6 months. \n \n\n 2\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nNo studies have been conducted in patients with renal insufficiency. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nElderly \nLivensa is recommended for use in surgically menopausal women up to the age of 60. Consistent with \nthe prevalence of HSDD, there are limited data above the age of 60.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Livensa in the paediatric population. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nThe adhesive side of the patch should be applied to a clean, dry area of skin on the lower abdomen \nbelow the waist. A particular application site should be rotated with an interval of at least 7 days \nbetween applications. Patches should not be applied to the breasts or other body regions. A skin site \nwith minimal wrinkling and not covered by tight clothing is recommended. The site should not be oily, \ndamaged, or irritated. To prevent interference with the adhesive properties of Livensa, no creams, \nlotions or powder should be applied to the skin where the patch is to be applied. \n \nThe patch should be applied immediately after opening the sachet and removing both parts of the \nprotective release liner. The patch should be pressed firmly in place for about 10 seconds, making sure \nthere is good contact with the skin, especially around the edges. If an area of the patch lifts, pressure \nshould be applied to that area. If the patch detaches prematurely, it may be reapplied. If the same patch \ncannot be reapplied, a new patch should be applied to another location. In either case, the original \ntreatment regimen should be maintained. The patch is designed to remain in place during a shower, \nbath, swimming or exercising. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \nKnown, suspected or past history of cancer of the breast or known or suspected estrogen-dependent \nneoplasia, or any other condition consistent with the contraindications for the use of estrogen. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \nSpecial warnings \n \nAndrogenic reactions \nAt regular intervals during treatment, physicians should monitor patients for potential androgenic \nundesirable reactions (e.g. acne, changes in hair growth or hair loss). Patients should be advised to self \nassess for androgenic undesirable effects. Signs of virilisation, such as voice deepening, hirsutism or \nclitoromegaly, may be irreversible and discontinuation of treatment should be considered. In clinical \ntrials these reactions were reversible in the majority of patients (see section 4.8). \n \nHypersensitivity \nSevere skin erythema, local oedema and blistering may occur due to hypersensitivity to the patch at \nthe site of application. Use of the patch should be discontinued if this occurs. \n \nLong-term safety, including breast cancer \nThe safety of Livensa has not been evaluated in double blind placebo controlled studies of longer than \n1 year duration. There is little information on long-term safety, including effects on breast tissue, the \ncardiovascular system and increase in insulin resistance. \n\n 3\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\nData in the literature regarding the influence of testosterone on the risk of breast cancer in women are \nlimited, inconclusive and conflicting. The long-term effect of testosterone treatment on the breast is \ncurrently unknown, therefore patients should be carefully monitored with regard to breast cancer in \naccordance with currently accepted screening practises and individual patient needs. \n \nCardiovascular disease \nPatients with known cardiovascular disease have not been studied. Patients with cardiovascular risk \nfactors, in particular hypertension, and patients with known cardiovascular disease should be carefully \nmonitored, specifically regarding changes in blood pressure and weight. \n \nDiabetic patients \nIn diabetic patients the metabolic effects of testosterone may decrease blood glucose and therefore \ninsulin requirements. Patients with diabetes mellitus have not been studied. \n \nEndometrial effects \nLittle information is available on the effects of testosterone on the endometrium. The limited data \nevaluating the effect of testosterone on the endometrium neither allow conclusions nor reassurances on \nthe incidence of endometrial cancer. \n \nOedema \nOedema (with or without congestive heart failure) may be a serious complication from high doses of \ntestosterone or other anabolic steroids in patients with pre-existing cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. \nHowever, this is not expected from the low dose of testosterone delivered by the Livensa patch. \n \nPrecautions for use \n \nLivensa should not be used in naturally menopausal women \nEfficacy and safety of Livensa in naturally menopausal women with HSDD on concomitant estrogen, \nwith or without progestogen, have not been evaluated. Livensa is not recommended in naturally \nmenopausal women. \n \nLivensa should not be used in women on concomitant CEE \nWhereas Livensa is indicated with concomitant estrogen therapy, the subgroup of patients receiving \noral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) did not demonstrate a significant improvement in sexual \nfunction. Therefore, Livensa should not be used in women on concomitant CEE (see sections 4.2 and \n5.1). \n \nThyroid hormone levels \nAndrogens may decrease levels of thyroxin-binding globulin, resulting in decreased total T4 serum \nlevels and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone levels remain unchanged, \nhowever, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. When testosterone is given concomitantly with \nanticoagulants, the anticoagulant effect may increase. Patients receiving oral anticoagulants require \nclose monitoring, especially when testosterone therapy is started or stopped. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nLivensa must not be used in women who are or may become pregnant.  \n \nTestosterone may induce virilising effects on the female foetus when administered to a pregnant \nwoman. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nIn case of inadvertent exposure during pregnancy, use of Livensa must be discontinued. \n\n 4\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n \nBreastfeeding \nLivensa must not be used by breast-feeding women. \n \nFertility \nNo data is available of the effect of Livensa on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nLivensa has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, patients should be \ninformed that migraine, insomnia, disturbance in attention and diplopia have been reported during \ntreatment with Livensa. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe adverse reaction most often reported (30.4 %) was application site reactions. The majority of these \nadverse reactions consisted of mild erythema and itching and did not result in patient withdrawal. \n \nHirsutism was also very commonly reported. Most reports concerned the chin and upper lip, were mild \n(≥ 90 %), and less than 1 % of all patients withdrew from the studies due to hirsutism. Hirsutism was \nreversible in the majority of patients. \n \nOther androgenic reactions commonly reported were acne, voice deepening and alopecia. More than \n90 % of these reports were considered mild. These reactions were reversible in the majority of \npatients. Less than 1 % of patients withdrew from the studies because of any of these reactions. All \nother common adverse reactions resolved in the majority of patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nDuring 6-month double blind exposure the following adverse reactions occurred in the treatment group \n(n=549) at a greater incidence than placebo (n=545) and were assessed by the investigators as possibly \nor probably related to Livensa treatment. If an adverse reaction occurred at a higher frequency in the \nintegrated phase III studies (Livensa patients n=1,498, placebo patients n=1,297), this frequency is \nreported in the table. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), \nuncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), or very rare (< 1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nMedDRA  \nSystem organ class \n\nVery common \n \n\nCommon \n \n\nUncommon \n \n\nInfections and infestations   Sinusitis \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\n  Abnormal clotting factor \n\nImmune system disorders   Hypersensitivity \nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\n  Increased appetite \n\nPsychiatric disorders  Insomnia Agitation, anxiety \nNervous system disorders  Migraine Disturbance in attention, \n\ndysgeusia, impaired balance, \nhyperaesthesia, oral \nparaesthesia, transient \nischemic attack \n\nEye disorders   Diplopia, eye redness  \nCardiac disorders   Palpitations \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\n Voice \ndeepening \n\nNasal congestion, throat \ntightness \n\n 5\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\nMedDRA  \nSystem organ class \n\nVery common \n \n\nCommon \n \n\nUncommon \n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  Abdominal \npain \n\nDiarrhoea, dry mouth, \nnausea  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nHirsutism Acne, alopecia Eczema, increased sweating, \nrosacea \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\n  Arthritis \n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders \n\n Breast pain  Breast cyst, clitoral \nengorgement, enlarged \nclitoris, genital pruritus, \nvaginal burning sensation \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nApplication site \nreaction \n(erythema, \nitching) \n\n Anasarca, asthenia, chest \ntightness, chest discomfort \n\nInvestigations  Increased \nweight  \n\nAbnormal blood fibrinogen, \nincreased heart rate, \nincreased alanine \naminotransferase, increased \naspartate aminotransferase, \nincreased blood bilirubin, \nabnormal liver function test, \nincreased blood triglycerides \n\n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe mode of administration of Livensa makes overdose unlikely. Removal of the patch results in a \nrapid decrease in serum testosterone levels (see section 5.2). \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, androgens, ATC \ncode: G03BA03 \n \nMechanism of action \nTestosterone, the primary circulating androgen in women, is a naturally occurring steroid, secreted by \nthe ovaries and adrenal glands. In premenopausal women, the rate of production of testosterone is 100 \nto 400 micrograms/24 hours, of which half is contributed by the ovary as either testosterone or a \nprecursor. Serum levels of androgens fall as women age. In women, who have undergone bilateral \noophorectomy, serum levels of testosterone decline by approximately 50 % within days after surgery. \n \nLivensa is a transdermal therapy for HSDD, which improves sexual desire while achieving \ntestosterone concentrations compatible with premenopausal levels. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nTwo multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled six month studies in 562 (INTIMATE SM1) and \n533 (INTIMATE SM2) oophorectomised and hysterectomised women (surgically induced \nmenopause), aged 20 to 70 years, with HSDD on concomitant estrogen were used to evaluate the \nefficacy and safety of Livensa. Total satisfying sexual activity (primary endpoint), sexual desire, and \ndistress associated with low sexual desire (secondary endpoints) were evaluated with validated \ninstruments. \n\n 6\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n \nIn the combined study analysis at 24 weeks, the difference in the mean frequency of total satisfying \nepisodes between Livensa and placebo was 1.07 per 4 weeks. \n \nA significantly higher percentage of women who received Livensa reported a benefit in the three \nendpoints, that they considered clinically meaningful compared to women who received placebo. In \nthe combined phase III data, excluding patients taking oral CEE, in whom there was no significant \nimprovement in sexual function, 50.7 % of women (n=274) treated with Livensa and 29.4 % of those \ntreated with placebo (n=269) were responders with regard to total satisfying sexual activity (primary \nendpoint), when a responder was predefined as having an increase in the 4-week frequency of \nsatisfying activities of > 1. \n \nEffects of Livensa were observed at 4 weeks after initiation of therapy (the first measured time point) \nand at all monthly efficacy time points thereafter. \n \nEfficacy versus placebo was significant across a range of subgroups which included patients separated \nby the following baseline characteristics: age (all subgroups up to age 65 years); body weight (up to \n80 kg) and oophorectomy (up to 15 years ago). \n \nSubgroup analyses suggested that the route and type of concomitant estrogen (transdermal oestradiol, \noral conjugated equine estrogen (CEE), oral non-CEE) can influence patient response. A responder \nanalysis of the pivotal phase II and III studies showed significant improvements in all three major \nclinical endpoints versus placebo in patients on concomitant transdermal and oral non-CEE estrogens. \nHowever, the subgroup of patients receiving oral CEE did not demonstrate a significant improvement \nin sexual activity compared to placebo (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nTestosterone from Livensa is transported across intact skin by a passive diffusion process that is \nprimarily controlled by permeation across the stratum corneum. Livensa is designed to systemically \ndeliver 300 micrograms/day. Following application of the patch on abdominal skin, maximum serum \nconcentrations of testosterone are reached within 24-36 hours, with a wide inter-individual variability. \nSerum concentrations of testosterone attain steady-state by the application of the second patch when \napplied in a twice-a-week regimen. Livensa did not influence serum concentrations of sex hormone \nbinding globulin (SHBG), estrogens or adrenal hormones. \n \nSerum concentrations of testosterone and SHBG in patients receiving Livensa in clinical safety and \nefficacy studies \nHormone Baseline Week 24 Week 52 \n N Mean (SEM) N Mean (SEM) N Mean (SEM) \nFree testosterone \n(pg/ml) \n\n544 0.92 (0.03) 412 4.36 (0.16) 287 4.44 (0.31) \n\nTotal testosterone \n(ng/dl) \n\n547 17.6 (0.4) 413 79.7 (2.7) 288 74.8 (3.6) \n\nDHT (ng/dl) 271 7.65 (0.34) 143 20.98 (0.98) 169 21.04 (0.97) \nSHBG (nmol/l) 547  91.7 (2.5) 415 93.9 (2.8) 290 90.0 (3.6) \nDHT = dihydrotestosterone, SHBG = sex hormone binding globulin \nSEM = Standard Error of the Mean \n \nDistribution \nIn women, circulating testosterone is primarily bound in the serum to SHBG (65-80 %) and to albumin \n(20-30 %) leaving only about 0.5-2 % as the free fraction. The affinity of binding to serum SHBG is \nrelatively high and the SHBG bound fraction is regarded as not contributing to biological activity. \nBinding to albumin is of relatively low affinity and is reversible. The albumin-bound fraction and the \nunbound fraction are collectively termed ‘bioavailable’ testosterone. The amount of SHBG and \nalbumin in serum and the total testosterone concentration determine the distribution of free and \n\n 7\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\nbioavailable testosterone. Serum concentration of SHBG is influenced by the route of administration \nof concomitant estrogen therapy. \n \nBiotransformation \nTestosterone is metabolised primarily in the liver. Testosterone is metabolised to various \n17-ketosteroids and further metabolism results in inactive glucuronides and other conjugates. The \nactive metabolites of testosterone are estradiol and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT has a greater \naffinity to SHBG than does testosterone. DHT concentrations increased in parallel with testosterone \nconcentrations during Livensa treatment. There were no significant differences in serum estradiol and \nestrone levels in patients treated with Livensa for up to 52 weeks compared to baseline. \n \nOn removal of an Livensa patch, testosterone serum concentrations return to near baseline values \nwithin 12 hours due to its short terminal exponential half-life (approximately 2 hours). There was no \nevidence of accumulation of testosterone over 52 weeks of treatment. \n \nElimination \nTestosterone is mainly excreted in the urine as glucuronic and sulphuric acid conjugates of \ntestosterone and its metabolites. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nToxicological studies of testosterone have only revealed effects which can be explained based on the \nhormone profile. \n \nTestosterone has been found to be nongenotoxic. Non-clinical studies on a relationship between \ntestosterone treatment and cancer suggest that high doses may promote tumour growth in sex organs, \nmammary glands and liver in laboratory animals. The significance of these data for the use of Livensa \nin patients is not known. \n \nTestosterone has a masculinising effect on female rat foetuses when dosed subcutaneously at 0.5 or \n1 mg/day (as the propionate ester) to pregnant rats during organogenesis.   \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even \n\nif their symptoms are the same as yours. \n- If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \nIn this leaflet: \n1. What Livensa is and what it is used for \n2. Before you use Livensa \n3. How to use Livensa \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Livensa \n6. Further information \n \n \n1. WHAT LIVENSA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nLivensa is a transdermal patch which constantly releases small amounts of testosterone that is \nabsorbed through your skin into the bloodstream. The testosterone in Livensa is the same hormone as \nthat produced naturally in men and women. \n \nAfter removal of the ovaries, testosterone drops to half of the levels compared to before the operation. \nDecrease in testosterone has been associated with low sexual desire, reduced sexual thoughts and \nreduced sexual arousal. All or any of these problems can cause personal distress or relationship \ndifficulties. The medical term for this condition is Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder, also known as \nHSDD. \n \nLivensa is used to treat HSDD. \nLivensa is intended for use by women up to the age of 60 years who: \n- have a low sexual desire which is causing distress or concern, and \n-  have had both of their ovaries removed, and \n-  have had their womb removed (hysterectomy), and \n-  are receiving estrogen therapy. \n \nIt may take longer than one month for you to notice an improvement. If you have not experienced a \npositive effect of Livensa within 3-6 months, you should inform your doctor, who will suggest that \ntreatment be discontinued. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE LIVENSA \n \nDo not use Livensa \n-  if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to testosterone or any of the other ingredients of Livensa (see \n\nsection ‘Further information’ at the end of this leaflet). \n-  if you know that you have had in the past, currently have, or think that you might have, breast \n\ncancer or any other cancer which your doctor has described as being caused or stimulated by the \nfemale hormone estrogen, also called ‘estrogen-dependent’ cancers. \n\n-  if you have other conditions that your doctor may consider not appropriate for the use of \nestrogen and/or testosterone. \n\n 19\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n \nTake special care with Livensa \n-  if you have a history of heart, liver or kidney disease. Oedema may be a serious complication \n\nfrom high doses of testosterone, however, this is not expected from low dose of testosterone \ndelivered by the Livensa patch. \n\n-  if you have cancer of the lining of the womb (endometrial cancer), be aware that there is little \ninformation available on the effects of testosterone on the lining of the womb (endometrium). \n\n-  if you are diabetic, as testosterone may lower blood glucose levels. \n-  if you have a history of excessive adult acne, body or facial hair, hair loss, enlargement of the \n\nclitoris or voice deepening or hoarseness. \n \nIf you have any of the above, tell your doctor before you start to use Livensa. Your doctor will advise \nyou on what you should do. \n \nThe efficacy of Livensa is reduced if your estrogen therapy is of a certain type (‘conjugated equine \nestrogens’). Therefore, you need to discuss your type of estrogen with your doctor, who could advise \nyou which type of estrogen is suitable together with Livensa. \n \nIf you stop estrogen therapy you must also stop using Livensa. Keep in mind that estrogens should be \nadministered for the shortest possible duration.  \n \nUse Livensa only as long as you experience a positive effect of the treatment. There is no information \non the safety of Livensa beyond 12 months. \n \nThere are limited data about the use in women above the age of 60. Livensa is intended for use by \nwomen up to the age of 60 years who have had both their ovaries and their womb removed.  \n \nIt is not known whether Livensa increases the risk of breast cancer and endometrium cancer. Your \ndoctor will carefully monitor you with regard to breast cancer and endometrium cancer. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nLivensa is not for use in children and adolescents. \n \nTaking other medicines \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without prescription. \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking blood-thinning (anticoagulant) treatment. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \nLivensa is only indicated for women in their menopause after the ovaries and uterus have been \nremoved. Do not use Livensa if you are, or suspect that you may be pregnant or are able to become \npregnant, because it may cause harm to the unborn child. \nDo not use Livensa in case of breast-feeding because it may cause harm to the child. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYou can drive and use machines while using Livensa. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE LIVENSA \n \nAlways use Livensa exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure of the instructions or if you want any more information. The usual dose \nis one patch twice weekly (each 3 to 4 days), see below ‘How and when to change your patch’. The \nactive substance is released from the patch constantly over 3 to 4 days (corresponding to 300 \nmicrograms per 24 hours) and is absorbed through your skin. \n\n 20\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n \nWhere to stick the patch \n-  Stick the patch onto your lower abdomen, below your waist. Do not stick the patch on the \n\nbreasts or bottom. \n \n\n  \n \n\nMake sure that your skin at the application site is: \n clean and dry (free of lotions, moisturisers, and powders) \n as smooth as possible (no major creases or skin folds) \n not cut or irritated (free of rashes or other skin problems) \n unlikely to be rubbed by clothing excessively \n preferably free from hair. \n\n \n-  When changing your patch, stick the new patch on to a different area of the skin of your \n\nabdomen, otherwise you are more likely to cause skin irritation. \n \n-  Only one patch is to be worn at a time. \n \n-  If you are also using estrogen patches, make sure that the Livensa patch and the estrogen patch \n\ndo not overlap. \n \n-  For at least one week after removing a patch, do not place a new patch in the same area. \n \nHow to stick on the patch \nStep 1 Tear open the sachet. Do not use scissors as you may accidentally damage the patch. Remove \n\nthe patch. Apply the patch immediately after removing it from the sachet. \n \n\n \n \nStep 2 While holding the patch, remove half of the protective liner that covers the sticky part of the \n\npatch. Avoid touching the sticky side of the patch with your fingers. \n \n\n \n \n\n 21\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\nStep 3 Apply the sticky side of the patch to the selected area onto your skin. Press the sticky side of \nthe patch firmly into place for about 10 seconds. \n\n \n\n \n \nStep 4 Fold back the patch and carefully remove the other half of the liner. Press the entire patch \n\nfirmly against your skin with the palm of your hand for about 10 seconds. Use your fingers to \nmake sure the edges of the patch stick to the skin. If an area of the patch lifts, apply pressure to \nthat area. \n\n \n\n \n \n \nHow and when to change your patch \n- You will need to change your patch every 3 to 4 days, which means using two patches each \n\nweek. This will mean that you wear one patch for 3 days and the other for 4 days. Decide which \ntwo days each week you are going to change your patch, and change the patch on the same two \ndays each week.   \n\n \nFor example: If you decide to start treatment on a Monday, then you have to change your patch \nalways on a Thursday and a Monday. \n \n\no Sunday + Wednesday \n Monday + Thursday \no Tuesday + Friday \no Wednesday + Saturday \no Thursday + Sunday \no Friday + Monday \no Saturday + Tuesday \n\n \n As a reminder, mark on the outer carton your chosen patch-change days. \n \n-  On the patch-change day, remove the used patch and immediately stick the new patch on to a \n\ndifferent area of skin of your abdomen. Continue your treatment for as long as your doctor \nadvises. \n\n \n-  Fold the used patch in half, sticking the patch to itself, and discard it in a safe way in order to \n\nkeep it away from children (e.g. in a rubbish bin). Medicines should not be disposed of via \nwastewater (do not flush it down the toilet). Ask your pharmacist how to dispose of medicines \nno longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n\n \nWhat about showering, bathing and exercising? \nYou may shower, bath, swim and exercise as normal while wearing the patch. The patch is designed to \nremain in place during these times. However, do not scrub the area where the patch has been placed \ntoo hard. \n \nWhat about sunbathing? \nAlways make sure your patch is covered by clothing. \n\n 22\n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\n \nWhat if your patch becomes loose, lifts at the edges or falls off? \nIf a patch does begin to come off, you may be able to make it stick again by pressing on it firmly. If \nyou cannot get the patch to stick successfully, remove the loose patch and use a new patch. Then \ncontinue with your regular schedule of patch-change days, even if this means discarding a patch after \nyou have worn it for less than 3-4 days. \n \nIf you use more patches than you should \nIf you have applied more than one patch at a time \nRemove all the patches sticking on to your skin and consult your doctor or pharmacist for further \ninformation on how to continue treatment with Livensa. Overdosing with Livensa is unlikely when \nused as directed, because once the patch is taken off testosterone is quickly removed by the body. \n \nIf you forget to use a patch \nIf you forget to change your patch \nChange your patch as soon as you remember, and then continue with your regular schedule of patch-\nchange days, even if this means discarding a patch after you have worn it for less than 3-4 days. \nReturning to your regular schedule will help you remember when to change your patch. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Livensa can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nTell your doctor immediately: \n- if you experience hair loss (a common side effect which may affect up to 1 in 10 people), \n\nenlargement of the clitoris (an uncommon side effect which may affect up to 1 in 100 people), \nan increase in the amount of hair on the chin or upper lip (a very common side effect which may \naffect more than 1 in 10 people), voice deepening or hoarseness (a common side effect), \nalthough these side effects may be mild. They are usually reversible if Livensa treatment is \ndiscontinued. \n\n \nYou should self assess for increased acne (a common side effect), increased hair growth on your \nface, loss of hair, deepening of your voice or enlargement of your clitoris, which all could be \nsigns of side effects of testosterone, which is the active substance in Livensa. \n\n \n-  if you notice any skin reactions at the site of application (a very common side effect) such as \n\nredness, oedema, or blistering.

It is a CHMP concern that the data from the THIN (The Health \nImprovement Database) study suggests that approx 70% of the users are outside indication. \n \nThe CHMP decided that the MAH should continue to submit 6 monthly PSURs. \n \nTherefore, based on the safety profile in Livensa, which requires the submission of 6 monthly PSURs, \nthe CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit one additional renewal application in 5 years time. \n\nMe\ndi\ncin\n\nal\n p\nro\n\ndu\nct\n n\no \nlo\nng\n\ner\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
