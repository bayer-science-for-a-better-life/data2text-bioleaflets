This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nEnhertu 100 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne vial of powder for concentrate for solution for infusion contains 100 mg of trastuzumab \nderuxtecan. After reconstitution, one vial of 5 mL solution contains 20 mg/mL of trastuzumab \nderuxtecan (see section 6.6). \n \nTrastuzumab deruxtecan is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that contains a humanised \nanti-HER2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) with the same amino acid sequence as trastuzumab, \nproduced by mammalian (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells, covalently linked to DXd, an exatecan \nderivative and a topoisomerase I inhibitor, via a tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker. Approximately \n8 molecules of deruxtecan are attached to each antibody molecule. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nWhite to yellowish-white lyophilised powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEnhertu as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic \nHER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nEnhertu should be prescribed by a physician and administered under the supervision of a healthcare \nprofessional experienced in the use of anticancer medicinal products. In order to prevent medicinal \nproduct errors, it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the medicinal product being \nprepared and administered is Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan) and not trastuzumab or trastuzumab \nemtansine. \n \nEnhertu should not be substituted with trastuzumab or trastuzumab emtansine. \n \nPatients treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan should have documented HER2-positive tumour status, \ndefined as a score of 3 + by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or a ratio of \u2265 2.0 by in situ hybridization \n(ISH) or by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assessed by a CE-marked in vitro diagnostic \n(IVD) medical device. If a CE-marked IVD is not available, the HER2 status should be assessed by an \nalternate validated test. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of Enhertu is 5.4 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks \n(21-day cycle) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  \n \nThe initial dose should be administered as a 90-minute intravenous infusion. If the prior infusion was \nwell tolerated, subsequent doses of Enhertu may be administered as 30-minute infusions. Antiemetics \nmay be administered in accordance with local medical practice as per patient tolerance for prophylaxis \nor management. \n \nThe infusion rate of Enhertu should be slowed or interrupted if the patient develops infusion-related \nsymptoms. Enhertu should be permanently discontinued in case of severe infusion reactions. \n \nDose modifications \n \nManagement of adverse reactions may require temporary interruption, dose reduction, or treatment \ndiscontinuation of Enhertu per guidelines provided in Tables 1 and 2. \n \nEnhertu dose should not be re-escalated after a dose reduction is made. \n \nTable 1: Dose reduction schedule \n\nDose reduction schedule \n(Starting dose is 5.4 mg/kg) \n\nDose to be administered \n\nFirst dose reduction 4.4 mg/kg \nSecond dose reduction 3.2 mg/kg \nRequirement for further dose reduction Discontinue treatment \n\n \nTable 2: Dose modifications for adverse reactions \nAdverse reaction Severity Treatment modification \nInterstitial lung \ndisease \n(ILD)/pneumonitis \n\nAsymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis \n(Grade 1) \n \n\nInterrupt Enhertu until resolved to \nGrade 0, then: \n\u2022 if resolved in 28 days or less from \n\ndate of onset, maintain dose. \n\u2022 if resolved in greater than 28 days \n\nfrom date of onset, reduce dose \none level (see Table 1). \n\n\u2022 consider corticosteroid treatment \nas soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (see section 4.4). \n\nSymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis \n(Grade 2 or greater) \n \n\n\u2022 Permanently discontinue Enhertu. \n\u2022 Promptly initiate corticosteroid \n\ntreatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (see \nsection 4.4). \n\nNeutropenia Grade 3 (less than 1.0-0.5 \u00d7 109/L) \u2022 Interrupt Enhertu until resolved to \nGrade 2 or less, then maintain \ndose. \n\nGrade 4 (less than 0.5 \u00d7 109/L) \u2022 Interrupt Enhertu until resolved to \nGrade 2 or less. \n\n\u2022 Reduce dose by one level (see \nTable 1). \n\nFebrile neutropenia Absolute neutrophil count of less \nthan 1.0 \u00d7 109/L and temperature \ngreater than 38.3 \u00b0C or a sustained \ntemperature of 38 \u00b0C or greater for \nmore than one hour. \n\n\u2022 Interrupt Enhertu until resolved. \n\u2022 Reduce dose by one level (see \n\nTable 1). \n\n\n\n4 \n\nAdverse reaction Severity Treatment modification \nLeft ventricular \nejection fraction \n(LVEF) decreased \n\nLVEF greater than 45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is \n10% to 20% \n\n\u2022 Continue treatment with Enhertu. \n\nLVEF \n40% to 45% \n\nAnd absolute \ndecrease from \nbaseline is less than \n10% \n\n\u2022 Continue treatment with Enhertu. \n\u2022 Repeat LVEF assessment within \n\n3 weeks. \n\nAnd absolute \ndecrease from \nbaseline is \n10% to 20% \n\n\u2022 Interrupt Enhertu. \n\u2022 Repeat LVEF assessment within \n\n3 weeks. \n\u2022 If LVEF has not recovered to within \n\n10% from baseline, permanently \ndiscontinue Enhertu. \n\n\u2022 If LVEF recovers to within 10% \nfrom baseline, resume treatment \nwith Enhertu at the same dose. \n\nLVEF less than 40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline is greater \nthan 20% \n\n\u2022 Interrupt Enhertu \n\u2022 Repeat LVEF assessment within \n\n3 weeks. \n\u2022 If LVEF of less than 40% or \n\nabsolute decrease from baseline of \ngreater than 20% is confirmed, \npermanently discontinue Enhertu. \n\nSymptomatic congestive heart \nfailure (CHF) \n\n\u2022 Permanently discontinue Enhertu. \n\nToxicity grades are in accordance with National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for \nAdverse Events Version 4.03 (NCI-CTCAE v.4.03). \n \nDelayed or missed dose \n \nIf a planned dose is delayed or missed, it should be administered as soon as possible without waiting \nuntil the next planned cycle. The schedule of administration should be adjusted to maintain a 3-week \ninterval between doses. The infusion should be administered at the dose and rate the patient tolerated \nin the most recent infusion. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment of Enhertu is required in patients aged 65 years or older. Limited data are \navailable in patients \u2265 75 years of age. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (creatinine clearance [CLcr] \u2265 60 and \n< 90 mL/min) or moderate (CLcr \u2265 30 and < 60 mL/min) renal impairment (see section 5.2). The \npotential need for dose adjustment in patients with severe renal impairment cannot be determined due \nto insufficient data. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD has been observed in patients with \nmoderate renal impairment. Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment should be monitored \ncarefully (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 times upper limit of normal \n(ULN), irrespective of aspartate transaminase (AST) value. The potential need for dose adjustment in \n\n\n\n5 \n\npatients with total bilirubin > 1.5 times ULN, irrespective of AST value, cannot be determined due to \ninsufficient data; therefore, these patients should be monitored carefully (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Enhertu in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have not \nbeen established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nEnhertu is for intravenous use. It must be reconstituted and diluted by a healthcare professional and \nadministered as an intravenous infusion. Enhertu must not be administered as an intravenous push or \nbolus. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIn order to prevent medicinal product errors, it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the \nmedicinal product being prepared and administered is Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan) and not \ntrastuzumab or trastuzumab emtansine. \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nInterstitial lung disease/pneumonitis \n \nCases of interstitial lung disease (ILD), and/or pneumonitis, have been reported with Enhertu (see \nsection 4.8). Fatal outcomes have been observed. Patients should be advised to immediately report \ncough, dyspnoea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Patients should be \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of ILD/pneumonitis. Evidence of ILD/pneumonitis should be \npromptly investigated. Patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis should be evaluated by radiographic \nimaging, preferably a computed tomography (CT) scan. Consultation with a pulmonologist should be \nconsidered. For asymptomatic (Grade 1) ILD/pneumonitis, consider corticosteroid treatment (e.g. \n\u2265 0.5 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). Enhertu should be withheld until recovery to Grade 0 and \nmay be resumed according to instructions in Table 2 (see section 4.2). For symptomatic \nILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), promptly initiate corticosteroid treatment (e.g. \u2265 1 mg/kg \nprednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days or until complete resolution of clinical \nand chest CT findings. Then gradually taper for at least 4 weeks. Enhertu should be permanently \ndiscontinued in patients who are diagnosed with any symptomatic (Grade 2 or greater) \nILD/pneumonitis (see section 4.2). Patients with a history of ILD/pneumonitis may be at increased risk \nof developing ILD/pneumonitis. \n \nNeutropenia \n \nCases of neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, were reported in clinical studies of Enhertu. \nComplete blood counts should be monitored prior to initiation of Enhertu and prior to each dose, and \nas clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, Enhertu may require dose interruption or \nreduction (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nLeft ventricular ejection fraction decrease \n \nLeft ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies. In the \n234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received Enhertu \n5.4 mg/kg, three cases (1.3%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease, of which 2 (0.9%) were Grade 2 and 1 \n(0.4%) was Grade 3, were reported. Observed frequency of LVEF decreased based on laboratory \nparameters (echocardiogram or multigated acquisition [MUGA] scanning) was 37 (16.9%); all were \nGrade 2. No decreases of LVEF to less than 40% or absolute decrease from baseline of greater than \n20% were observed. Treatment with Enhertu has not been studied in patients with LVEF less than \n50% prior to initiation of treatment (see section 4.8). \n \nStandard cardiac function testing (echocardiogram or MUGA scanning) should be performed to assess \nLVEF prior to initiation of Enhertu and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. \nEnhertu should be permanently discontinued if LVEF of less than 40% or absolute decrease from \nbaseline of greater than 20% is confirmed. Enhertu should be permanently discontinued in patients \nwith symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) (see section 4.2). \n \nEmbryo-foetal toxicity \n \nEnhertu can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports, use \nof trastuzumab, a HER2 receptor antagonist, during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios \nmanifesting as fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. Based on \nfindings in animals and its mechanism of action, the topoisomerase I inhibitor component of Enhertu, \nDXd, can also cause embryo-foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see section 4.6). \n \nThe pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential should be verified prior to the initiation of \nEnhertu. The patient should be informed of the potential risks to the foetus. Females of reproductive \npotential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months \nfollowing the last dose of Enhertu. Male patients with female partners of reproductive potential should \nbe advised to use effective contraception during treatment with Enhertu and for at least 4 months after \nthe last dose of Enhertu (see section 4.6). \n \nPatients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment \n \nThere are limited data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and no data in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment. As metabolism and biliary excretion are the primary routes of elimination \nof the topoisomerase I inhibitor, DXd, Enhertu should be administered with caution in patients with \nmoderate and severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCo-administration with ritonavir, an inhibitor of OATP1B, CYP3A and P-gp, or with itraconazole, a \nstrong inhibitor of CYP3A and P-gp, resulted in no clinically meaningful (approximately 10-20%) \nincrease in exposures of trastuzumab deruxtecan or the released topoisomerase I inhibitor, DXd. No \ndose adjustment is required during co-administration of trastuzumab deruxtecan with medicinal \nproducts that are inhibitors of CYP3A or OATP1B or P-gp transporters (see section 5.2). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n \nPregnancy status of women of childbearing potential should be verified prior to initiation of Enhertu. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with Enhertu and \nfor at least 7 months following the last dose. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nMen with female partners of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment \nwith Enhertu and for at least 4 months following the last dose. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no available data on the use of Enhertu in pregnant women. However, trastuzumab, a \nHER2 receptor antagonist, can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In \npost-marketing reports, use of trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios in \nsome cases manifested as fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. \nBased on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, the topoisomerase I inhibitor component of \nEnhertu, DXd, can be expected to cause embryo-foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman \n(see section 5.3). \n \nAdministration of Enhertu to pregnant women is not recommended, and patients should be informed \nof the potential risks to the foetus before they become pregnant. Women who become pregnant must \nimmediately contact their doctor. If a woman becomes pregnant during treatment with Enhertu or \nwithin 7 months following the last dose of Enhertu, close monitoring is recommended. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known if trastuzumab deruxtecan is excreted in human milk. Human IgG is secreted in human \nmilk, and the potential for absorption and serious adverse reactions to the infant is unknown. \nTherefore, women should not breast-feed during treatment with Enhertu or for 7 months after the last \ndose. A decision should be made to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue treatment taking into \naccount the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and/or benefit of treatment with Enhertu for the \nmother. \n \nFertility \n \nNo dedicated fertility studies have been conducted with trastuzumab deruxtecan. Based on results \nfrom animal toxicity studies, Enhertu may impair male reproductive function and fertility. It is not \nknown whether trastuzumab deruxtecan or its metabolites are found in seminal fluid. Before starting \ntreatment, male patients should be advised to seek counselling on sperm storage. Male patients must \nnot freeze or donate sperm throughout the treatment period, and for at least 4 months after the final \ndose of Enhertu. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nEnhertu may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be \nadvised to use caution when driving or operating machinery in case they experience fatigue, headache \nor dizziness during treatment with Enhertu (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reactions were nausea (79.9%), fatigue (60.3%), vomiting (48.7%), \nalopecia (46.2%), constipation (35.9%), decreased appetite (34.6%), anaemia (33.8%), neutropenia \n(32.5%), diarrhoea (30.8%), thrombocytopenia (23.1%), cough (21.4%), leukopenia (20.5%), and \nheadache (20.1%).  \n \nThe most common National Cancer Institute \u2013 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \n(NCI-CTCAE v.4.03) Grade \u2265 3 adverse reactions were neutropenia (18.8%), anaemia (9.0%), nausea \n(6.8%), fatigue (6.4%), leukopenia (5.6%), lymphopenia (5.1%), vomiting (4.3%), thrombocytopenia \n(4.3%), hypokalaemia (3.4%), interstitial lung disease (ILD, 3.0%), diarrhoea (2.6%), febrile \nneutropenia (1.7%), dyspnoea (1.7%), abdominal pain (1.3%), decreased appetite (1.3%), and alanine \naminotransferase increased (1.3%). In 2.6% of patients, ILD led to death. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nDose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 27% of patients treated with Enhertu. The \nmost frequent adverse reactions associated with dose interruption were neutropenia (14.5%), anaemia \n(3.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (3.0%), leukopenia (3.0%), ILD (2.6%), thrombocytopenia \n(2.6%), and fatigue (2.1%). Dose reductions occurred in 15% of patients treated with Enhertu. The \nmost frequent adverse reactions associated with dose reduction were fatigue (3.8%), nausea (3.4%), \nand neutropenia (3.4%). Discontinuation of therapy due to an adverse reaction occurred in 12% of \npatients treated with Enhertu. The most frequent adverse reaction associated with permanent \ndiscontinuation was ILD (9.4%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe safety of Enhertu has been evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of Enhertu 5.4 mg/kg in \nclinical studies. The median duration of exposure to Enhertu was 9.8 months (range: \n0.7 to 37.1 months). \n \nThe adverse reactions in patients who received at least one dose of Enhertu in clinical studies are \npresented in Table 3. The adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and \ncategories of frequency. Frequency categories are defined as: very common (\u2265 1/10), common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare \n(< 1/10,000), and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 3: Adverse reactions in patients treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan \n\nSystem organ class/preferred term or grouped term Frequency \n\nInfections and infestations \n\nUpper respiratory tract infectiona Very common \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nNeutropeniab Very common \n\nAnaemiac Very common \n\nLeukopeniad Very common \n\nLymphopeniae Very common \n\nThrombocytopeniaf Very common \n\nFebrile neutropenia Common \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nHypokalaemia Very common \n\nDecreased appetite Very common \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nHeadacheg Very common \n\nDizziness Very common \n\nEye disorders \n\nDry eye Very common \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nInterstitial lung diseaseh Very common \n\n\n\n9 \n\nSystem organ class/preferred term or grouped term Frequency \n\nDyspnoea Very common \n\nCough Very common \n\nEpistaxis Very common \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nNausea  Very common \n\nVomiting Very common \n\nDiarrhoea Very common \n\nAbdominal paini Very common \n\nConstipation Very common \n\nStomatitisj Very common \n\nDyspepsia  Very common \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nAlopecia Very common \n\nRashk Very common \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nFatiguel Very common \n\nInvestigations \n\nAlanine aminotransferase increased Very common \n\nAspartate aminotransferase increased Very common \n\nEjection fraction decreasedm Very common \n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications \n\nInfusion-related reactionsn Common \na Includes influenza, influenza-like illness, and upper respiratory tract infection. \nb Includes neutropenia and neutrophil count decreased. \nc Includes anaemia, haemoglobin decreased, red blood cell count decreased, and haematocrit decreased. \nd Includes leukopenia and white blood cell count decreased. \ne Includes lymphopenia and lymphocyte count decreased. \nf Includes thrombocytopenia and platelet count decreased. \ng Includes headache, sinus headache, and migraine. \nh Interstitial lung disease includes events that were adjudicated as ILD: pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, \n\nrespiratory failure, organising pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, lung infiltration, lymphangitis, and \nalveolitis. \n\ni Includes abdominal discomfort, gastrointestinal pain, abdominal pain, abdominal pain lower, and \nabdominal pain upper. \n\nj Includes stomatitis, aphthous ulcer, mouth ulceration, oral mucosa erosion, and oral mucosal blistering. \nk Includes rash, rash pustular, and rash maculopapular. \nl Includes fatigue and asthenia. \nm Includes laboratory parameters of LVEF decrease (n = 37) and/or preferred terms of ejection fraction \n\ndecreased (n = 3), cardiac failure (n = 1) and cardiac failure congestive (n = 1). \nn Cases of infusion-related reactions include infusion-related reaction (n = 4), hypersensitivity (n = 1), and \n\nflushing (n = 1). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInterstitial lung disease \nIn clinical studies (n = 234), ILD occurred in 15.0% of patients. Most ILD cases were Grade 1 (3.0%), \nGrade 2 (8.5%) or Grade 3 (0.4%). Grade 5 events occurred in 3.0% of patients. Median time to first \nonset was 5.5 months (range: 1.2 to 20.8) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nNeutropenia \nIn clinical studies (n = 234), a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 32.5% of patients and \n18.8% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time of onset was 53 days (range: 8 days to 18.0 months), and \nmedian duration of the first event was 22 days (range: 2 days to 9.0 months). Febrile neutropenia was \nreported in 1.7% of patients (see section 4.2). \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Across all doses evaluated in \nclinical studies, 0.6% (4/640) of evaluable patients developed antibodies against trastuzumab \nderuxtecan following treatment with Enhertu. There was no association between development of \nantibodies and allergic-type reactions. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSafety has not been established in this population. \n \nElderly \n \nOf the 234 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with Enhertu 5.4 mg/kg, 26% were \n65 years or older and 5% were 75 years or older. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse \nreactions observed in patients aged 65 years or older (49%) as compared to younger patients (39%), \nleading to more discontinuations due to adverse reactions. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe maximum tolerated dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan has not been determined. In clinical studies, \nsingle doses higher than 8.0 mg/kg have not been tested. In case of overdose, patients must be closely \nmonitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment \ninitiated. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: trastuzumab deruxtecan, ATC code: L01XC41 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nEnhertu, trastuzumab deruxtecan, is a HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate. The antibody is a \nhumanised anti-HER2 IgG1 attached to deruxtecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor (DXd) bound by a \ntetrapeptide-based cleavable linker. The antibody-drug conjugate is stable in plasma. The function of \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\nthe antibody portion is to bind to HER2 expressed on the surface of certain tumour cells. After \nbinding, the trastuzumab deruxtecan complex then undergoes internalisation and intracellular linker \ncleavage by lysosomal enzymes that are upregulated in cancer cells. Upon release, the \nmembrane-permeable DXd causes DNA damage and apoptotic cell death. DXd, an exatecan \nderivative, is approximately 10 times more potent than SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. \n \nIn vitro studies indicate that the antibody portion of trastuzumab deruxtecan, which has the same \namino acid sequence as trastuzumab, also binds to Fc\u03b3RIIIa and complement C1q. The antibody \nmediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in human breast cancer cells that \noverexpress HER2. In addition, the antibody inhibits signalling through the phosphatidylinositol \n3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway in human breast cancer cells that overexpress HER2. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nThe efficacy and safety of Enhertu were studied in DESTINY-Breast01, a multicentre, open-label, \nsingle-arm Phase 2 study that enrolled patients with HER2-positive, unresectable and/or metastatic \nbreast cancer who had received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens, including trastuzumab \nemtansine (100%), trastuzumab (100%), and pertuzumab (65.8%). Archival breast tumour samples \nwere required to show HER2 positivity defined as HER2 IHC 3+ or ISH-positive. The study excluded \npatients with a history of treated ILD or ILD at screening, patients with untreated or symptomatic \nbrain metastases, and patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease. Patients enrolled \nhad at least 1 measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). \nEnhertu was administered by intravenous infusion at 5.4 mg/kg once every three weeks until disease \nprogression, death, withdrawal of consent, or unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy outcome \nmeasure was confirmed objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST v1.1 in the intent-to-treat \n(ITT) population as evaluated by independent central review. The secondary efficacy outcome \nmeasure was duration of response (DOR). \n \nOf the 184 patients enrolled in DESTINY-Breast01, baseline demographic and disease characteristics \nwere: median age 55 years (range: 28 to 96); 65 years or older (23.9%); female (100%); White \n(54.9%), Asian (38.0%), Black or African-American (2.2%); Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group \n(ECOG) performance status 0 (55.4%) or 1 (44.0%); hormone receptor status (positive: 52.7%); \npresence of visceral disease (91.8%); previously treated and stable brain metastases (13.0%); median \nnumber of prior therapies in the metastatic setting: 5 (range: 2 to 17); sum of diameters of target \nlesions (< 5 cm: 42.4%, \u2265 5 cm: 50.0%). \n \nAn earlier analysis (median duration of follow-up 11.1 months [range: 0.7 to 19.9 months]) showed a \nconfirmed objective response rate of 60.9% (95% CI: 53.4, 68.0) with 6.0% being complete \nresponders and 54.9% being partial responders; 36.4% had stable disease, 1.6% had progressive \ndisease and 1.1% were not evaluable. Median duration of response at that time was 14.8 months \n(95% CI: 13.8, 16.9) with 81.3% of responders having a response of \u2265 6 months (95% CI: 71.9, 87.8). \nEfficacy results from an updated data cutoff with median duration of follow-up of 20.5 months (range: \n0.7 to 31.4 months) are shown in Table 4. \n \nTable 4: Efficacy results in DESTINY-Breast01 (intent-to-treat analysis set) \n\n DESTINY-Breast01 \nN = 184 \n\nConfirmed objective response rate (95% CI)*\u2020 61.4% (54.0, 68.5) \n\nComplete response (CR) 6.5% \n\nPartial response (PR) 54.9% \n\nDuration of response\u2021  \n\nMedian, months (95% CI) 20.8 (15.0, NR) \n% with duration of response \u2265 6 months (95% \nCI)\u00a7 81.5% (72.2, 88.0) \n\n\n\n12 \n\nORR 95% CI calculated using Clopper-Pearson method \nCI = confidence interval \n95% CIs calculated using Brookmeyer-Crowley method \n*Confirmed responses (by blinded independent central review) were defined as a recorded response of either \nCR/PR, confirmed by repeat imaging not less than 4 weeks after the visit when the response was first observed. \n\u2020Of the 184 patients, 35.9% had stable disease, 1.6% had progressive disease and 1.1% were not evaluable. \n\u2021Includes 73 patients with censored data \n\u00a7Based on Kaplan-Meier estimation \nNR = not reached \n\n \nConsistent anti-tumour activity was observed across pre-specified subgroups based on prior \npertuzumab therapy and hormone receptor status. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies in all \nsubsets of the paediatric population in breast cancer (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called \u2018conditional approval\u2019 scheme. This \nmeans that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. \nThe European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every \nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nTrastuzumab deruxtecan is administered intravenously. There have been no studies performed with \nother routes of administration. \n \nDistribution \n \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the volume of distribution of the central compartment \n(Vc) of trastuzumab deruxtecan and topoisomerase I inhibitor, DXd, were estimated to be 2.77 L and \n27.4 L, respectively. \n \nIn vitro, the mean human plasma protein binding of DXd was approximately 97%. \n \nIn vitro, the blood to plasma concentration ratio of DXd was approximately 0.6. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nTrastuzumab deruxtecan undergoes intracellular cleavage by lysosomal enzymes to release the DXd. \n \nThe humanised HER2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody is expected to be degraded into small peptides and \namino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. \n \nIn vitro metabolism studies in human liver microsomes indicate that DXd is metabolised mainly by \nCYP3A4 via oxidative pathways. \n \nElimination \n \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following intravenous administration of trastuzumab \nderuxtecan in patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, the clearance of trastuzumab \nderuxtecan was estimated to be 0.42 L/day and the clearance of DXd was 19.2 L/h. In cycle 3, the \napparent elimination half-life (t1/2) of trastuzumab deruxtecan and released DXd was approximately \n7 days. Moderate accumulation (approximately 35% in cycle 3 compared to cycle 1) of trastuzumab \nderuxtecan was observed. \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \nFollowing intravenous administration of DXd to rats, the major excretion pathway was faeces via the \nbiliary route. DXd was the most abundant component in urine, faeces, and bile. Following single \nintravenous administration of trastuzumab deruxtecan (6.4 mg/kg) to monkeys, unchanged released \nDXd was the most abundant component in urine and faeces. DXd excretion was not studied in \nhumans. \n \nIn vitro interactions \n \nEffects of Enhertu on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products \nIn vitro studies indicate DXd does not inhibit major CYP450 enzymes including CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, \n2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A. In vitro studies indicate that DXd does not inhibit OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, \nOCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2-K, P-gp, BCRP, or BSEP transporters. \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of Enhertu \nIn vitro, DXd was a substrate of P-gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE2-K, MRP1, and BCRP.  \nNo clinically meaningful interaction is expected with medicinal products that are inhibitors of \nMATE2-K, MRP1, P-gp, OATP1B1, or BCRP transporters (see section 4.5). \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nThe exposure of trastuzumab deruxtecan and released DXd when administered intravenously \nincreased in proportion to dose in the 3.2 mg/kg to 8.0 mg/kg dose range (approximately \n0.6 to 1.5 times the recommended dose) with low to moderate inter-subject variability. Based on \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis, inter-subject variability in trastuzumab deruxtecan and DXd \nelimination clearances was approximately 25% and for central volume of distribution was \napproximately 16% and 42%, respectively. The intra-subject variability in trastuzumab deruxtecan and \nDXd AUC values (area under the serum concentration versus time curve) was approximately 8% and \n14%, respectively. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis, age (23-96 years), race, ethnicity, sex and body weight \ndid not have a clinically meaningful effect on exposure of trastuzumab deruxtecan or released DXd. \n \nElderly \nThe population PK analysis showed that age (range: 23-96 years) did not affect the PK of trastuzumab \nderuxtecan. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dedicated renal impairment study was conducted. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis \nincluding patients with mild (creatinine clearance [CLcr] \u2265 60 and <90 mL/min) or moderate \n(CLcr \u2265 30 and <60 mL/min) renal impairment (estimated by Cockcroft-Gault), the pharmacokinetics \nof the released DXd was not affected by mild or moderate renal impairment as compared to normal \nrenal function (CLcr \u2265 90 mL/min). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dedicated hepatic impairment study was conducted. Based on population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis, the impact of changes on pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients with total \nbilirubin \u2264 1.5 times ULN, irrespective of AST level, is not clinically meaningful. There are \ninsufficient data for patients with total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 times ULN, irrespective of AST level, to \ndraw conclusions, and no data is available for patients with total bilirubin > 3 times ULN, irrespective \nof AST level (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nPaediatric population \nNo studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab deruxtecan in \nchildren or adolescents. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn animals, toxicities were observed in lymphatic and haematopoietic organs, intestines, kidneys, \nlungs, testes and skin following the administration of trastuzumab deruxtecan at exposure levels of the \ntopoisomerase I inhibitor (DXd) below clinical plasma exposure. In these animals, antibody-drug \nconjugate (ADC) exposure levels were similar or above clinical plasma exposure. \n \nDXd was clastogenic in both an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay and an in vitro Chinese \nhamster lung chromosome aberration assay and was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse \nmutation assay. \n \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with trastuzumab deruxtecan. \n \nDedicated fertility studies have not been conducted with trastuzumab deruxtecan. Based on results \nfrom general animal toxicity studies, trastuzumab deruxtecan may impair male reproductive function \nand fertility. \n \nThere were no animal reproductive or developmental toxicity studies conducted with trastuzumab \nderuxtecan. Based on results from general animal toxicity studies, trastuzumab deruxtecan and DXd \nwere toxic to rapidly dividing cells (lymphatic/haematopoietic organs, intestine, or testes), and DXd \nwas genotoxic, suggesting the potential for embryotoxicity and teratogenicity. \n \n \n6.

What Enhertu is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Enhertu is \n \nEnhertu is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance trastuzumab deruxtecan. One part of \nthe medicine is a monoclonal antibody that attaches specifically to cells that have the protein HER2 on \ntheir surface (HER2-positive), as some breast cancer cells do. The other active part of Enhertu is DXd, \na substance that can kill cancer cells. Once the medicine has attached to HER2-positive cancer cells, \nthe DXd enters the cells and kills them. \n \nWhat Enhertu is used for \n \nEnhertu is used to treat adults who have: \n\u2022 HER2-positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed \n\nby surgery, and \n\u2022 tried at least two other treatments specifically for HER2-positive breast cancer. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Enhertu \n \nYou must not be given Enhertu \n \n\u2022 if you are allergic to trastuzumab deruxtecan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n \n\nIf you are not sure if you are allergic, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Enhertu. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Enhertu, or during treatment, if you have: \n\n\n\n28 \n\n\u2022 cough, shortness of breath, fever, or other new or worsening breathing problems. These may be \nsymptoms of a serious and potentially fatal lung disease called interstitial lung disease. \n\n\u2022 chills, fever, sores in your mouth, stomach pain or pain when urinating. These may be \nsymptoms of an infection caused by a reduced number of white blood cells called neutrophils. \n\n\u2022 new or worsening shortness of breath, cough, tiredness, swelling of ankles or legs, irregular \nheartbeat, sudden weight gain, dizziness, or loss of consciousness. These may be symptoms of a \ncondition in which your heart cannot pump blood well enough (decreased left ventricular \nejection fraction). \n\n\u2022 liver problems. Your doctor may have to monitor your liver while you are taking this medicine. \n  \nYour doctor will carry out tests before and during treatment with Enhertu. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nEnhertu is not recommended for anyone under the age of 18 years. This is because there is no \ninformation on how well it works in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Enhertu \n \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding, contraception and fertility \n \n\u2022 Pregnancy \n\nEnhertu is not recommended during pregnancy because this medicine may harm the unborn \nbaby. \nSpeak with your doctor immediately if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are \nplanning to become pregnant before or during treatment. \n\n \n\u2022 Breast-feeding  \n\nYou should not breast-feed during treatment with Enhertu and for at least 7 months after your \nlast dose. This is because it is not known whether Enhertu passes into breast milk. Talk to your \ndoctor about this. \n\n \n\u2022 Contraception \n\nUse effective contraception (birth control) to avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with \nEnhertu.  \n \nWomen taking Enhertu should continue contraception for at least 7 months after the last dose of \nEnhertu.  \n \nMen taking Enhertu whose partner may become pregnant should use effective contraception: \n- during treatment and \n- for at least 4 months after the last dose of Enhertu. \n\n \nTalk to your doctor about the best contraception for you. Also talk to your doctor before you \nstop your contraception. \n\n \n\u2022 Fertility \n\nIf you are a man being treated with Enhertu, you should not father a child for 4 months after \ntreatment and take advice on conserving sperm before treatment because the medicine may \nreduce your fertility. Therefore, discuss this with your doctor before starting treatment. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nEnhertu is not likely to reduce your ability to drive or use machines. Be careful if you feel tired, dizzy, \nor have a headache. \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n \n3.

Calculate the dose (mg), the total volume of \n\nreconstituted Enhertu solution required, and the number of vial(s) of Enhertu needed. \n\u2022 Reconstitute each 100 mg vial using a sterile syringe to slowly inject 5 mL of water for injection \n\ninto each vial to obtain a final concentration of 20 mg/mL. \n\u2022 Swirl the vial gently until completely dissolved. Do not shake. \n\u2022 Inspect the reconstituted solution for particulates and discolouration. The solution should be \n\nclear and colourless to light yellow. Do not use if visible particles are observed or if the solution \nis cloudy or discoloured. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n33 \n\n\u2022 If not used immediately, store the reconstituted Enhertu vials in a refrigerator at 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C for \nup to 24 hours from the time of reconstitution, protected from light. Do not freeze. \n\n\u2022 The reconstituted product contains no preservative and is intended for single use only. \n \nDilution \n\u2022 Dilute the calculated volume of reconstituted Enhertu in an infusion bag containing 100 mL of \n\n5% glucose solution. Do not use sodium chloride solution. An infusion bag made of \npolyvinylchloride or polyolefin (copolymer of ethylene and polypropylene) is recommended. \n\n\u2022 Gently invert the infusion bag to thoroughly mix the solution. Do not shake. \n\u2022 Cover the infusion bag to protect from light. \n\u2022 If not used immediately, store at room temperature for up to 4 hours including preparation and \n\ninfusion or in a refrigerator at 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C for up to 24 hours, protected from light. Do not \nfreeze. \n\n\u2022 Discard any unused portion left in the vial. \n \nAdministration \n\u2022 If the prepared infusion solution was stored refrigerated (2 \u00baC to 8 \u00baC), it is recommended that \n\nthe solution be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature prior to administration, protected \nfrom light. \n\n\u2022 Administer Enhertu as an intravenous infusion only with a 0.20 or 0.22 micron in-line \npolyethersulfone (PES) or polysulfone (PS) filter. \n\n\u2022 The initial dose should be administered as a 90-minute intravenous infusion. If the prior \ninfusion was well tolerated, subsequent doses of Enhertu may be administered as 30-minute \ninfusions. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. \n\n\u2022 Do not mix Enhertu with other medicinal products or administer other medicinal products \nthrough the same intravenous line. \n\n \nDisposal \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX IV \n\nCONCLUSIONS ON THE GRANTING OF THE CONDITIONAL MARKETING \nAUTHORISATION PRESENTED BY THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY \n\n\n\n35 \n\nConclusions presented by the European Medicines Agency on: \n\n\u2022 Conditional marketing authorisation \n\nThe CHMP having considered the application is of the opinion that the risk-benefit balance is \nfavourable to recommend the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation as further explained \nin the European Public Assessment Report. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
