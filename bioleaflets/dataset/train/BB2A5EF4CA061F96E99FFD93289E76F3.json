NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nTrajenta 5 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach tablet contains 5 mg of linagliptin.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet).\n\n8 mm diameter round, light red film-coated tablet debossed with \"D5\" on one side and the Boehringer \nIngelheim logo on the other. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTrajenta is indicated in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise to \nimprove glycaemic control as:\nmonotherapy\n\u2022 when metformin is inappropriate due to intolerance, or contraindicated due to renal impairment.\ncombination therapy\n\u2022 in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes, including insulin, \n\nwhen these do not provide adequate glycaemic control (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for available \ndata on different combinations).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nThe dose of linagliptin is 5 mg once daily. When linagliptin is added to metformin, the dose of \nmetformin should be maintained, and linagliptin administered concomitantly.\nWhen linagliptin is used in combination with a sulphonylurea or with insulin, a lower dose of the \nsulphonylurea or insulin, may be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4)\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal impairment\nFor patients with renal impairment, no dose adjustment for linagliptin is required. \n\nHepatic impairment\nPharmacokinetic studies suggest that no dose adjustment is required for patients with hepatic \nimpairment but clinical experience in such patients is lacking.\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on age.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of linagliptin in children and adolescents has not yet been established. No data \nare available.\n\n\n\n3\n\nMethod of administration \nThe tablets can be taken with or without a meal at any time of the day. If a dose is missed, it should be \ntaken as soon as the patient remembers. A double dose should not be taken on the same day.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nGeneral\nLinagliptin should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic \nketoacidosis.\n\nHypoglycaemia\nLinagliptin alone showed a comparable incidence of hypoglycaemia to placebo.\nIn clinical trials of linagliptin as part of combination therapy with medicinal products not known to \ncause hypoglycaemia (metformin), rates of hypoglycaemia reported with linagliptin were similar to \nrates in patients taking placebo.\n\nWhen linagliptin was added to a sulphonylurea (on a background of metformin), the incidence of \nhypoglycaemia was increased over that of placebo (see section 4.8). \n\nSulphonylureas and insulin are known to cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, caution is advised when \nlinagliptin is used in combination with a sulphonylurea and/or insulin. A dose reduction of the \nsulphonylurea or insulin may be considered (see section 4.2).\n\nAcute pancreatitis\nUse of DPP-4 inhibitors has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. Acute \npancreatitis has been observed in patients taking linagliptin. In a cardiovascular and renal safety study \n(CARMELINA) with median observation period of 2.2 years, adjudicated acute pancreatitis was \nreported in 0.3% of patients treated with linagliptin and in 0.1% of patients treated with placebo.\nPatients should be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is \nsuspected, Trajenta should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, Trajenta should not be \nrestarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of pancreatitis.\n\nBullous pemphigoid\nBullous pemphigoid has been observed in patients taking linagliptin. In the CARMELINA study, \nbullous pemphigoid was reported in 0.2% of patients on treatment with linagliptin and in no patient on \nplacebo. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, Trajenta should be discontinued.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIn vitro assessment of interactions\nLinagliptin is a weak competitive and a weak to moderate mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP isozyme \nCYP3A4, but does not inhibit other CYP isozymes. It is not an inducer of CYP isozymes.\nLinagliptin is a P-glycoprotein substrate, and inhibits P-glycoprotein mediated transport of digoxin \nwith low potency. Based on these results and in vivo interaction studies, linagliptin is considered \nunlikely to cause interactions with other P-gp substrates.\n\nIn vivo assessment of interactions\nEffects of other medicinal products on linagliptin\nClinical data described below suggest that the risk for clinically meaningful interactions by co-\nadministered medicinal products is low.\n\n\n\n4\n\nRifampicin: multiple co-administration of 5 mg linagliptin with rifampicin, a potent inductor of \nP-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, resulted in a 39.6% and 43.8% decreased linagliptin steady-state AUC \nand Cmax, respectively, and about 30% decreased DPP-4 inhibition at trough. Thus, full efficacy of \nlinagliptin in combination with strong P-gp inducers might not be achieved, particularly if these are \nadministered long-term. Co-administration with other potent inducers of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, \nsuch as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin has not been studied.\n\nRitonavir: co-administration of a single 5 mg oral dose of linagliptin and multiple 200 mg oral doses \nof ritonavir, a potent inhibitor of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, increased the AUC and Cmax of \nlinagliptin approximately twofold and threefold, respectively. The unbound concentrations, which are \nusually less than 1% at the therapeutic dose of linagliptin, were increased 4-5-fold after co-\nadministration with ritonavir. Simulations of steady-state plasma concentrations of linagliptin with and \nwithout ritonavir indicated that the increase in exposure will be not associated with an increased \naccumulation. These changes in linagliptin pharmacokinetics were not considered to be clinically \nrelevant. Therefore, clinically relevant interactions would not be expected with other P-\nglycoprotein/CYP3A4 inhibitors. \n\nMetformin: co-administration of multiple three times daily doses of 850 mg metformin with 10 mg \nlinagliptin once daily did not clinical meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin in healthy \nvolunteers.\n\nSulphonylureas: the steady-state pharmacokinetics of 5 mg linagliptin was not changed by \nconcomitant administration of a single 1.75 mg dose glibenclamide (glyburide).\n\nEffects of linagliptin on other medicinal products\nIn clinical studies, as described below, linagliptin had no clinically relevant effect on the \npharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, warfarin, digoxin or oral contraceptives \nproviding in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing medicinal product interactions with \nsubstrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, P-glycoprotein, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).\n\nMetformin: co-administration of multiple daily doses of 10 mg linagliptin with 850 mg metformin, an \nOCT substrate, had no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin in healthy volunteers. \nTherefore, linagliptin is not an inhibitor of OCT-mediated transport. \n\nSulphonylureas: co-administration of multiple oral doses of 5 mg linagliptin and a single oral dose of \n1.75 mg glibenclamide (glyburide) resulted in clinically not relevant reduction of 14% of both AUC \nand Cmax of glibenclamide. Because glibenclamide is primarily metabolised by CYP2C9, these data \nalso support the conclusion that linagliptin is not a CYP2C9 inhibitor. Clinically meaningful \ninteractions would not be expected with other sulphonylureas (e.g., glipizide, tolbutamide, and \nglimepiride) which, like glibenclamide, are primarily eliminated by CYP2C9. \n\nDigoxin: co-administration of multiple daily doses of 5 mg linagliptin with multiple doses of 0.25 mg \ndigoxin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin in healthy volunteers. Therefore, linagliptin \nis not an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein-mediated transport in vivo.\n\nWarfarin: multiple daily doses of 5 mg linagliptin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of S(-) or R(+) \nwarfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate, administered in a single dose.\n\nSimvastatin: multiple daily doses of linagliptin had a minimal effect on the steady-state \npharmacokinetics of simvastatin, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, in healthy volunteers. Following \nadministration of a supratherapeutic dose of 10 mg linagliptin concomitantly with 40 mg of \nsimvastatin daily for 6 days, the plasma AUC of simvastatin was increased by 34%, and the plasma \nCmax by 10%.\n\nOral contraceptives: co-administration with 5 mg linagliptin did not alter the steady-state \npharmacokinetics of levonorgestrel or ethinylestradiol.\n\n\n\n5\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThe use of linagliptin has not been studied in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct \nor indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary \nmeasure, it is preferable to avoid the use of linagliptin during pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nAvailable pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of linagliptin/metabolites in milk. A \nrisk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from linagliptin therapy taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\nNo studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted for linagliptin. Animal studies do not \nindicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nLinagliptin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However patients \nshould be alerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia especially when combined with sulphonylurea and/or \ninsulin.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nIn the pooled analysis of the placebo-controlled trials, the overall incidence of adverse events in \npatients treated with placebo was similar to linagliptin 5 mg (63.4% versus 59.1%).\nDiscontinuation of therapy due to adverse events was higher in patients who received placebo as \ncompared to linagliptin 5 mg (4.3% versus 3.4%).\n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction was \u201chypoglycaemia\u201d observed under the triple \ncombination, linagliptin plus metformin plus sulphonylurea 14.8% versus 7.6% in placebo.\n\nIn the placebo-controlled studies 4.9% of patients experienced \u201chypoglycaemia\u201d as an adverse \nreaction under linagliptin. Of these, 4.0% were mild and 0.9% were moderate and 0.1% were \nclassified as severe in intensity. Pancreatitis was reported more often in patients randomized to \nlinagliptin (7 events in 6,580 patients receiving linagliptin versus 2 events in 4,383 patients receiving \nplacebo).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nDue to the impact of the background therapy on adverse reactions (e.g. on hypoglycaemias), adverse \nreactions were analysed based on the respective treatment regimens (monotherapy, add-on to \nmetformin, add-on to meformin plus sulphonylurea, and add-on to insulin).\n\nThe placebo-controlled studies included studies where linagliptin was given as\n\n- monotherapy with short-term duration of up to 4 weeks\n- monotherapy with \u2265 12 week duration\n- add-on to metformin\n- add-on to metformin + sulphonylurea\n- add on to metformin and empagliflozin\n- add-on to insulin with or without metformin\n\nAdverse reactions classified by system organ class and MedDRA preferred terms reported in patients \nwho received 5 mg linagliptin in double-blind studies as monotherapy or as add-on therapy are \npresented in the table below (see table 1).\n\n\n\n6\n\nThe adverse reactions are listed by absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common \n(\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 \nto < 1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) or not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nTable 1 Adverse reactions reported in patients who received linagliptin 5 mg daily as \nmonotherapy or as add-on therapies in clinical trial and from post-marketing experience\n\nSystem organ class\nAdverse reaction\n\nFrequency of adverse reaction\n\nInfections and infestations\n\nNasopharyngitis uncommon\n\nImmune system disorders\n\nHypersensitivity\n(e.g. bronchial hyperreactivity)\n\nuncommon\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\n\nHypoglycaemia 1 very common\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\n\nCough uncommon\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\n\nPancreatitis rare #\n\nConstipation 2 uncommon\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\n\nAngioedema* rare\n\nUrticaria* rare\n\nRash* uncommon\n\nBullous pemphigoid rare #\n\nInvestigations\n\nAmylase increased uncommon\n\nLipase increased** common\n\n* Based on post-marketing experience \n** Based on lipase elevations >3xULN observed in clinical trials\n# Based on Linagliptin cardiovascular and renal safety study (CARMELINA), see also below\n1 Adverse reaction observed in combination with metformin plus sulphonylurea\n2\n\nAdverse reaction observed in combination with insulin\n\n\n\n7\n\nLinagliptin cardiovascular and renal safety study (CARMELINA)\nThe CARMELINA study evaluated the cardiovascular and renal safety of linagliptin versus placebo in \npatients with type 2 diabetes and with increased CV risk evidenced by a history of established \nmacrovascular or renal disease (see section 5.1). The study included 3494 patients treated with \nlinagliptin (5 mg) and 3485 patients treated with placebo. Both treatments were added to standard of\ncare targeting regional standards for HbA1c and CV risk factors. The overall incidence of adverse \nevents and serious adverse events in patients receiving linagliptin was similar to that in patients \nreceiving placebo. Safety data from this study was in line with previous known safety profile of \nlinagliptin.\n\nIn the treated population, severe hypoglycaemic events (requiring assistance) were reported in 3.0% of \npatients on linagliptin and in 3.1% on placebo. Among patients who were using sulfonylurea at \nbaseline, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was 2.0% in linagliptin-treated patients and 1.7% in \nplacebo treated patients. Among patients who were using insulin at baseline, the incidence of severe \nhypoglycaemia was 4.4% in linagliptin-treated patients and 4.9% in placebo treated patients.\n\nIn the overall study observation period adjudicated acute pancreatitis was reported in 0.3% of patients \ntreated with linagliptin and in 0.1% of patients treated with placebo.\n\nIn the CARMELINA study, bullous pemphigoid was reported in 0.2% of patients treated with \nlinagliptin and in no patient treated with placebo.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\nDuring controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 600 mg linagliptin \n(equivalent to 120 times the recommended dose) were generally well tolerated. There is no experience \nwith doses above 600 mg in humans.\n\nTherapy\nIn the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e.g., remove \nunabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring and institute clinical \nmeasures if required.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, ATC \ncode: A10BH05\n\nMechanism of action\nLinagliptin is an inhibitor of the enzyme DPP-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase 4, EC 3.4.14.5) an enzyme \nwhich is involved in the inactivation of the incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP (glucagon-like peptide1, \nglucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). These hormones are rapidly degraded by the enzyme \nDPP-4. Both incretin hormones are involved in the physiological regulation of glucose homeostasis. \nIncretins are secreted at a low basal level throughout the day and levels rise immediately after meal \nintake. GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin biosynthesis and secretion from pancreatic beta cells in the \npresence of normal and elevated blood glucose levels. Furthermore GLP-1 also reduces glucagon \nsecretion from pancreatic alpha cells, resulting in a reduction in hepatic glucose output. Linagliptin \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8\n\nbinds very effectively to DPP-4 in a reversible manner and thus leads to a sustained increase and a \nprolongation of active incretin levels. Linagliptin glucose-dependently increases insulin secretion and \nlowers glucagon secretion thus resulting in an overall improvement in the glucose homeostasis. \nLinagliptin binds selectively to DPP-4 and exhibits a > 10,000 fold selectivity versus DPP-8 or DPP-9 \nactivity in vitro.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n8 phase III randomised controlled trials involving 5,239 patients with type 2 diabetes, of which 3,319 \nwere treated with linagliptin were conducted to evaluate efficacy and safety. These studies had 929 \npatients of 65 years and over who were on linagliptin. There were also 1,238 patients with mild renal \nimpairment, and 143 patients with moderate renal impairment on linagliptin. Linagliptin once daily \nproduced clinically significant improvements in glycaemic control, with no clinically relevant change \nin body weight. The reductions in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were similar across different \nsubgroups including gender, age, renal impairment and body mass index (BMI). Higher baseline \nHbA1c was associated with a greater reduction in HbA1c. There was a significant difference in \nreduction in HbA1c between Asian patients (0.8%) and White patients (0.5%) in the pooled studies. \n\nLinagliptin as monotherapy in patients ineligible for metformin\nThe efficacy and safety of linagliptin monotherapy was evaluated in a double-blind placebo-controlled \nstudy of 24 weeks duration. Treatment with once daily linagliptin at 5 mg provided a significant \nimprovement in HbA1c (-0.69% change compared to placebo), in patients with baseline HbA1c of \napproximately 8%. Linagliptin also showed significant improvements in fasting plasma glucose \n(FPG), and 2-hour post-prandial glucose (PPG) compared to placebo. The observed incidence of \nhypoglycaemia in patients treated with linagliptin was similar to placebo.\n\nThe efficacy and safety of linagliptin monotherapy was also evaluated in patients for whom metformin \ntherapy is inappropriate, due to intolerability or contraindicated due to renal impairment, in a double-\nblind placebo-controlled study of 18 weeks duration. Linagliptin provided significant improvements in \nHbA1c, (-0.57% change compared to placebo), from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.09%. Linagliptin also \nshowed significant improvements in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared to placebo. The observed \nincidence of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with linagliptin was similar to placebo. \n\nLinagliptin as add-on to metformin therapy\nThe efficacy and safety of linagliptin in combination with metformin was evaluated in a double-blind \nplacebo-controlled study of 24 weeks duration. Linagliptin provided significant improvements in \nHbA1c, (-0.64% change compared to placebo), from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8%. Linagliptin also \nshowed significant improvements in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-hour post-prandial glucose \n(PPG) compared to placebo. The observed incidence of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with \nlinagliptin was similar to placebo. \n\nLinagliptin as add-on to a combination of metformin and sulphonylurea therapy\nA placebo-controlled study of 24 weeks in duration was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety \nof linagliptin 5 mg to placebo, in patients not sufficiently treated with a combination with metformin \nand a sulphonylurea. Linagliptin provided significant improvements in HbA1c (-0.62% change \ncompared to placebo), from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.14%. Linagliptin also showed significant \nimprovements in patients fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-hour post-prandial glucose (PPG), \ncompared to placebo.\n\nLinagliptin as add-on to a combination of metformin and empagliflozin therapy\nIn patients inadequately controlled with metformin and empagliflozin (10 mg (n=247) or 25 mg \n(n=217)), 24-weeks treatment with add-on therapy of linagliptin 5 mg provided adjusted mean HbA1c\nreductions from baseline by -0.53% (significant difference to add-on placebo -0.32% (95% CI -0.52, \n-0.13) and -0.58% (significant difference to add-on placebo -0.47% (95% CI -0.66; -0.28), \nrespectively. A statistically significant greater proportion of patients with a baseline HbA1c \u22657.0% and \ntreated with linagliptin 5 mg achieved a target HbA1c of <7% compared to placebo.\n\n\n\n9\n\nLinagliptin as add-on to insulin therapy\nThe efficacy and safety of the addition of linagliptin 5 mg to insulin alone or in combination with \nmetformin and/or pioglitazone has been evaluated in a double-blind placebo-controlled study of \n24 weeks duration. Linagliptin provided significant improvements in HbA1c (-0.65% compared to \nplacebo) from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.3%. Linagliptin also provided significant improvements in \nfasting plasma glucose (FPG), and a greater proportion of patients achieved a target HbA1c of < 7.0%, \ncompared to placebo. This was achieved with a stable insulin dose (40.1 IU). Body weight did not \ndiffer significantly between the groups. Effects on plasma lipids were negligible. The observed \nincidence of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with linagliptin was similar to placebo (22.2% \nlinagliptin; 21.2% placebo).\n\nLinagliptin 24 month data, as add-on to metformin in comparison with glimepiride \nIn a study comparing the efficacy and safety of the addition of linagliptin 5 mg or glimepiride (mean \ndose 3 mg) in patients with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy, mean reductions \nin HbA1c were -0.16% with linagliptin (mean baseline HbA1c 7.69%) and -0.36% with glimepiride \n(mean baseline HbA1c 7.69%.) with a mean treatment difference of 0.20% (97.5% CI: 0.09, 0.299). \nThe incidence of hypoglycaemia in the linagliptin group (7.5%) was significantly lower than that in \nthe glimepiride group (36.1%). Patients treated with linagliptin exhibited a significant mean decrease \nfrom baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients administered \nglimepiride (-1.39 vs +1.29 kg). \n\nLinagliptin as add-on therapy in patients with severe renal impairment, 12 week placebo-controlled \ndata (stable background) and 40 week placebo-controlled extension (adjustable background) \nThe efficacy and safety of linagliptin was also evaluated in type 2 diabetes patients with severe renal \nimpairment in a double-blind study versus placebo for 12 weeks duration, during which background \nglycaemic therapies were kept stable. Most patients (80.5%) received insulin as background therapy, \nalone or in combination with other oral anti-diabetics such as sulphonylurea, glinide and pioglitazone. \nThere was a further follow up 40 week treatment period during which dose adjustments in antidiabetes \nbackground therapies were allowed. \n\nLinagliptin provided significant improvements in HbA1c (-0.59 % change compared to placebo after \n12 weeks), from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.2%. The observed difference in HbA1c over placebo was -\n0.72% after 52 weeks.\n\nBody weight did not differ significantly between the groups. The observed incidence of \nhypoglycaemia in patients treated with linagliptin was higher than placebo, due to an increase in \nasymptomatic hypoglycaemic events. There was no difference between groups in severe \nhypoglycaemic events.\n\nLinagliptin as add-on therapy in elderly (age \u2265 70 years) with type 2 diabetes \nThe efficacy and safety of linagliptin in elderly (age \u2265 70years) with type 2 diabetes was evaluated in a \ndouble-blind study of 24 weeks duration. Patients received metformin and/or sulphonylurea and/or \ninsulin as background therapy. Doses of background antidiabetic medicinal products were kept stable \nduring the first 12 weeks, after which adjustments were permitted. Linagliptin provided significant \nimprovements in HbA1c (-0.64 % change compared to placebo after 24 weeks), from a mean baseline \nHbA1c of 7.8%. Linagliptin also showed significant improvements in fasting plasma glucose (FPG)\ncompared to placebo. Body weight did not differ significantly between the groups.\n\nLinagliptin cardiovascular and renal safety study (CARMELINA)\nCARMELINA was a randomized study in 6979 patients with type 2 diabetes with increased CV risk \nevidenced by a history of established macrovascular or renal disease who were treated with linagliptin \n5 mg (3494) or placebo (3485) added to standard of care targeting regional standards for HbA1c, CV \nrisk factors and renal disease. The study population included 1211 (17.4%) patients \u2265 75 years of age \nand 4348 (62.3%) patients with renal impairment. Approximately 19% of the population had eGFR \n\u226545 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 28% of the population had eGFR \u226530 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 15% \nhad eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean HbA1c at baseline was 8.0%.\n\n\n\n10\n\nThe study was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority for the primary cardiovascular endpoint which \nwas a composite of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death or a non-fatal myocardial infarction \n(MI) or a non-fatal stroke (3P-MACE). The renal composite endpoint was defined as renal death or \nsustained end stage renal disease or sustained decrease of 40% or more in eGFR.\n\nAfter a median follow up of 2.2 years, linagliptin, when added to usual care, did not increase the risk \nof major adverse cardiovascular events or renal outcome events. There was no increased risk in \nhospitalization for heart failure which was an additional adjudicated endpoint observed compared to \nusual care without linagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes (see table 2).\n\nTable 2 Cardiovascular and renal outcomes by treatment group in the CARMELINA study\n\nLinagliptin 5mg Placebo Hazard \nRatio\n\nNumber of \nSubjects (%)\n\nIncidence \nRate per 1000 \n\nPY*\n\nNumber of \nSubjects (%)\n\nIncidence \nRate per 1000 \n\nPY*\n\n(95% CI)\n\nNumber of patients 3494 3485\nPrimary CV \ncomposite \n(Cardiovascular \ndeath, non-fatal MI, \nnon-fatal stroke)\n\n434 (12.4) 57.7 420 (12.1) 56.3 1.02 (0.89, \n1.17)**\n\nSecondary renal \ncomposite (renal \ndeath, ESRD, 40% \nsustained decrease \nin eGFR)\n\n327 (9.4) 48.9 306 (8.8) 46.6 1.04 (0.89, \n1.22)\n\nAll-cause mortality 367 (10.5) 46.9 373 (10.7) 48.0 0.98 (0.84, \n1.13)\n\nCV death 255 (7.3) 32.6 264 (7.6) 34 0.96 (0.81, \n1.14)\n\nHospitalization for \nheart failure\n\n209 (6.0) 27.7 226 (6.5) 30.4 0.90 (0.74, \n1.08)\n\n* PY=patient years\n** Test on non-inferiority to demonstrate that the upper bound of the 95% CI for the hazard ratio is less than 1.3\n\nIn analyses for albuminuria progression (change from normoalbuminuria to micro- or \nmacroalbuminuria, or from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria) the estimated hazard ratio was \n0.86 (95% CI 0.78, 0.95) for linagliptin versus placebo. \n\nLinagliptin cardiovascular safety study (CAROLINA)\nCAROLINA was a randomized study in 6033 patients with early type 2 diabetes and increased CV \nrisk or established complications who were treated with linagliptin 5 mg (3023) or glimepiride 1-4mg \n(3010) added to standard of care (including background therapy with metformin in 83% of patients) \ntargeting regional standards for HbA1c and CV risk factors. The mean age for study population was \n64 years and included 2030 (34%) patients \u2265 70 years of age. The study population included \n2089 (35%) patients with cardiovascular disease and 1130 (19%) patients with renal impairment with \nan eGFR < 60ml/min/1.73m2 at baseline. The mean HbA1c at baseline was 7.15%.\n\nThe study was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority for the primary cardiovascular endpoint which \nwas a composite of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death or a non-fatal myocardial infarction \n(MI) or a non-fatal stroke (3P-MACE). \n\n\n\n11\n\nAfter a median follow up of 6.25 years, linagliptin did not increase the risk of major adverse \ncardiovascular events (see table 3) as compared to glimepiride.

After oral administration of a 5 mg dose to healthy volunteers or patients, \nlinagliptin was rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations (median Tmax) occurring 1.5 hours \npost-dose.\n\nPlasma concentrations of linagliptin decline in a triphasic manner with a long terminal half-life \n(terminal half-life for linagliptin more than 100 hours), that is mostly related to the saturable, tight \nbinding of linagliptin to DPP-4 and does not contribute to the accumulation of the medicinal product. \nThe effective half-life for accumulation of linagliptin, as determined from oral administration of \nmultiple doses of 5 mg linagliptin, is approximately 12 hours. After once daily dosing of 5 mg \nlinagliptin, steady-state plasma concentrations are reached by the third dose. Plasma AUC of \nlinagliptin increased approximately 33% following 5 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first \ndose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for linagliptin AUC were small \n(12.6% and 28.5%, respectively). Due to the concentration dependent binding of linagliptin to DPP-4, \nthe pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on total exposure is not linear; indeed total plasma AUC of \nlinagliptin increased in a less than dose-proportional manner while unbound AUC increases in a \nroughly dose-proportional manner. The pharmacokinetics of linagliptin was generally similar in \nhealthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\n\n12\n\nAbsorption\nThe absolute bioavailability of linagliptin is approximately 30%. Co-administration of a high-fat meal \nwith linagliptin prolonged the time to reach Cmax by 2 hours and lowered Cmax by 15% but no influence \non AUC 0-72h was observed. No clinically relevant effect of Cmax and Tmax changes is expected; \ntherefore linagliptin may be administered with or without food. \n\nDistribution\nAs a result of tissue binding, the mean apparent volume of distribution at steady-state following a \nsingle 5 mg intravenous dose of linagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 1,110 litres, indicating \nthat linagliptin extensively distributes to the tissues. Plasma protein binding of linagliptin is \nconcentration-dependent, decreasing from about 99% at 1 nmol/l to 75-89% at \u226530 nmol/l, reflecting \nsaturation of binding to DPP-4 with increasing concentration of linagliptin. At high concentrations, \nwhere DPP-4 is fully saturated, 70-80% of linagliptin was bound to other plasma proteins than DPP-4, \nhence 30-20% were unbound in plasma.\n\nBiotransformation\nFollowing a [14C] linagliptin oral 10 mg dose, approximately 5% of the radioactivity was excreted in \nurine. Metabolism plays a subordinate role in the elimination of linagliptin. One main metabolite with \na relative exposure of 13.3% of linagliptin at steady-state was detected which was found to be \npharmacologically inactive and thus does not contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of \nlinagliptin.\n\nExcretion\nFollowing administration of an oral [14C] linagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 85% of \nthe administered radioactivity was eliminated in faeces (80%) or urine (5%) within 4 days of dosing. \nRenal clearance at steady-state was approximately 70 ml/min.\n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal impairment\nA multiple-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin (5 mg \ndose) in patients with varying degrees of chronic renal insufficiency compared to normal healthy \ncontrol subjects. The study included patients with renal insufficiency classified on the basis of \ncreatinine clearance as mild (50 to <80 ml/min), moderate (30 to <50 ml/min), and severe (<30 \nml/min), as well as patients with ESRD on hemodialysis. In addition patients with T2DM and severe \nrenal impairment (<30 ml/min) were compared to T2DM patients with normal renal function. \nCreatinine clearance was measured by 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance measurements or estimated \nfrom serum creatinine based on the Cockcroft-Gault formula. CrCl = (140 \u2013 age) x weight/72 x serum \ncreatinine [x 0.85 for females], where age is in years, weight in kg, and serum creatinine is in mg/dl. \nUnder steady-state conditions, linagliptin exposure in patients with mild renal impairment was \ncomparable to healthy subjects. In moderate renal impairment, a moderate increase in exposure of \nabout 1.7 fold was observed compared with control. Exposure in T2DM patients with severe RI was \nincreased by about 1.4 fold compared to T2DM patients with normal renal function. Steady-state \npredictions for AUC of linagliptin in patients with ESRD indicated comparable exposure to that of \npatients with moderate or severe renal impairment. In addition, linagliptin is not expected to be \neliminated to a therapeutically significant degree by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Therefore, no \ndosage adjustment of linagliptin is necessary in patients with any degree of renal insufficiency. \n\nHepatic impairment\nIn non-diabetic patients with mild moderate and severe hepatic insufficiency (according to the Child-\nPugh classification), mean AUC and Cmax of linagliptin were similar to healthy matched controls \nfollowing administration of multiple 5 mg doses of linagliptin. No dosage adjustment for linagliptin is \nproposed for diabetic patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment. \n\nBody Mass Index (BMI)\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary based on BMI. BMI had no clinically relevant effect on the \npharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of Phase I and Phase \n\n\n\n13\n\nII data. The clinical trials before marketing authorisation have been performed up to a BMI equal to 40 \nkg/m2.\n\nGender\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary based on gender. Gender had no clinically relevant effect on the \npharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of Phase I and Phase \nII data. \n\nElderly\nNo dosage adjustment is required based on age up to 80 years, as age did not have a clinically relevant \nimpact on the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of \nPhase I and Phase II data. Older subjects (65 to 80, oldest patient was 78 years) had comparable \nplasma concentrations of linagliptin compared to younger subjects. \n\nPaediatric population\nA paediatric Phase 2 study examined the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 1 mg and 5 mg \nlinagliptin in children and adolescents \u226510 to <18 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The \nobserved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses were consistent with those found in adult \nsubjects. Linagliptin 5 mg showed superiority over 1 mg with regard to trough DPP-4 inhibition (72% \nvs 32%, p=0.0050) and a numerically larger reduction with regard to adjusted mean change from \nbaseline in HbA1c (-0.63% vs -0.48%, n.s.). Due to the limited nature of the data set the results should \nbe interpreted cautiously.\n\nRace\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary based on race. Race had no obvious effect on the plasma \nconcentrations of linagliptin based on a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, \nincluding patients of Caucasian, Hispanic, African, and Asian origin. In addition the pharmacokinetic \ncharacteristics of linagliptin were found to be similar in dedicated phase I studies in Japanese, Chinese \nand Caucasian healthy volunteers. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nLiver, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract are the principal target organs of toxicity in mice and rats at \nrepeat doses of linagliptin of more than 300 times the human exposure.\nIn rats effects on reproductive organs, thyroid and the lymphoid organs were seen at more than 1,500 \ntimes human exposure. Strong pseudo-allergic reactions were observed in dogs at medium doses, \nsecondarily causing cardiovascular changes, which were considered dog-specific. Liver, kidneys, \nstomach, reproductive organs, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes were target organs of toxicity in \nCynomolgus monkeys at more than 450 times human exposure. At more than 100 times human \nexposure, irritation of the stomach was the major finding in these monkeys.\n\nLinagliptin and its main metabolite did not show a genotoxic potential.\nOral 2 year carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice revealed no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats or \nmale mice. A significantly higher incidence of malignant lymphomas only in female mice at the \nhighest dose (> 200 times human exposure) is not considered relevant for humans (explanation: non-\ntreatment related but due to highly variable background incidence). Based on these studies there is no \nconcern for carcinogenicity in humans.\n\nThe NOAEL for fertility, early embryonic development and teratogenicity in rats was set at >900 \ntimes the human exposure. The NOAEL for maternal-, embryo-fetal-, and offspring toxicity in rats \nwas 49 times human exposure. No teratogenic effects were observed in rabbits at >1,000 times human \nexposure. A NOAEL of 78 times human exposure was derived for embryo-fetal toxicity in rabbits, and \nfor maternal toxicity the NOAEL was 2.1 times human exposure. Therefore, it is considered unlikely \nthat linagliptin affects reproduction at therapeutic exposures in humans.\n\n\n\n14\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible\n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet:\n1. What Trajenta is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take Trajenta\n3. How to take Trajenta\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Trajenta\n6. Contents of the pack and other information.\n\n1. What Trajenta is and what it is used for\n\nTrajenta contains the active substance linagliptin which belongs to a group of medicines called \u201coral \nanti-diabetics\u201d. Oral anti-diabetics are used to treat high blood sugar levels. They work by helping the \nbody reduce the level of sugar in your blood.\n\nTrajenta is used for \u2018type 2 diabetes\u2019 in adults, if the disease cannot be adequately controlled with one \noral anti-diabetic medicine (metformin or sulphonylureas) or diet and exercise alone. Trajenta may be \nused together with other anti-diabetic medicines e.g. metformin, sulphonylureas (e.g. glimepiride, \nglipizide), empagliflozin, or insulin.\n\nIt is important to keep following the advice about diet and exercise that you have been given by your\ndoctor or nurse.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Trajenta\n\nDo not take Trajenta\n- if you are allergic to linagliptin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Trajenta if you:\n\uf0b7 have type 1 diabetes (your body does not produce any insulin) or diabetic ketoacidosis (a \n\ncomplication of diabetes with high blood sugar, rapid weight loss, nausea or vomiting). Trajenta\nshould not be used to treat these conditions.\n\n\uf0b7 are taking an anti-diabetic medicine known as a \u2018sulphonylurea\u2019(e.g. glimepiride, glipizide), \nyour doctor may want to reduce your dose of sulphonylurea when you take it together with \nTrajenta in order to avoid your blood sugar going too low.\n\n\uf0b7 have had allergic reactions to any other medicines that you take to control the amount of sugar \nin your blood.\n\n\uf0b7 have or have had a disease of the pancreas.\n\n\n\n26\n\nIf you have symptoms of acute pancreatitis, like persistent, severe stomach ache (abdominal pain), you \nshould consult your doctor.\n\nIf you encounter blistering of the skin it may be a sign for a condition called bullous pemphigoid. \nYour doctor may ask you to stop Trajenta.\n\nDiabetic skin lesions are a common complication of diabetes. You are advised to follow the \nrecommendations for skin and foot care that you are given by your doctor or nurse.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nTrajenta is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years.\n\nOther medicines and Trajenta\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nIn particular, you should tell your doctor if you are using medicines containing any of the following \nactive substances:\n\uf0b7 Carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin. These may be used to control fits (seizures) or \n\nchronic pain.\n\uf0b7 Rifampicin. This is an antibiotic used to treat infections such as tuberculosis.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nIt is unknown if Trajenta is harmful to the unborn child. Therefore, it is preferable to avoid using\nTrajenta if you are pregnant.\nIt is not known if Trajenta passes into human breast milk. A decision must be made by your doctor \nwhether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Trajenta therapy.\n\nDriving and using machines\nTrajenta has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\nTaking Trajenta in combination with medicines called sulphonylureas and/or insulin can cause too low \nblood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia), which may affect your ability to drive and use machines or work \nwithout safe foothold. However, more frequent blood glucose testing might be recommended to \nminimise the risk for hypoglycaemia, especially when Trajenta is combined with sulphonylurea and/or \ninsulin.\n\n3. How to take Trajenta\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.\n\nThe recommended dose of Trajenta is one 5 mg tablet once a day.\n\nYou can take Trajenta with or without food.\n\nYour doctor may prescribe Trajenta together with another oral anti-diabetic medicine. Remember to \ntake all medicines as directed by your doctor to achieve the best results for your health.\n\nIf you take more Trajenta than you should\nIf you take more Trajenta than you should, talk to a doctor immediately.\n\n\n\n27\n\nIf you forget to take Trajenta\n\uf0b7 If you forget to take a dose of Trajenta, take it as soon as you remember it. However, if it is \n\nnearly time for the next dose, skip the missed dose.\n\uf0b7 Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Never take two doses on the same \n\nday.\n\nIf you stop taking Trajenta\nDo not stop taking Trajenta without first consulting your doctor.
