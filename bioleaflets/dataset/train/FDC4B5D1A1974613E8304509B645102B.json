CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nSegluromet is indicated in adults aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to \ndiet and exercise to improve glycaemic control:\n\n\u2022 in patients not adequately controlled on their maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone\n\n\u2022 in patients on their maximally tolerated doses of metformin in addition to other medicinal \nproducts for the treatment of diabetes\n\n\u2022 in patients already being treated with the combination of ertugliflozin and metformin as separate \ntablets.\n\n(For study results with respect to combinations and effects on glycaemic control, see sections 4.4, 4.5 \nand 5.1.)\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose is one tablet twice daily. The dosage should be individualised on the basis of \nthe patient\u2019s current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability using the recommended daily dose of \n5 mg or 15 mg of ertugliflozin, while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of \nmetformin.\n\nIn patients with volume depletion, correcting this condition prior to initiation of Segluromet is \nrecommended (see section 4.4).\n\nIf a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers. Patients should not take two \ndoses of Segluromet at the same time.\n\nAdults with normal renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] \u2265 90 ml/min)\n\nFor patients inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy or metformin in combination with \nother glucose-lowering medicinal products, including insulin \nThe recommended starting dose of Segluromet should provide ertugliflozin 2.5 mg twice daily (5 mg \ndaily dose) and the dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken. In patients tolerating a \ntotal daily dose of ertugliflozin 5 mg, the dose can be increased to a total daily dose of ertugliflozin \n15 mg if additional glycaemic control is needed. \n\nFor patients switching from separate tablets of ertugliflozin and metformin\nPatients switching from separate tablets of ertugliflozin (5 mg or 15 mg total daily dose) and \nmetformin to Segluromet should receive the same daily dose of ertugliflozin and metformin already \nbeing taken or the nearest therapeutically appropriate dose of metformin.\n\nWhen Segluromet is used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, a lower dose of \ninsulin or the insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see \nsections 4.4, 4.5, and 4.8).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\nA GFR should be assessed before initiation of treatment with metformin-containing products and at \nleast annually thereafter. In patients at increased risk of further progression of renal impairment and in \nthe elderly, renal function should be assessed more frequently, e.g., every 3-6 months.\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nInitiation of this medicinal product is not recommended in patients with a GFR less than 60 ml/min\n(see section 4.4).\n\nThe maximum daily dose of metformin should preferably be divided into 2-3 daily doses. Factors that \nmay increase the risk of lactic acidosis (see section 4.4) should be reviewed before considering \ninitiation of metformin in patients with GFR < 60 ml/min. \n\nIf no adequate strength of Segluromet is available, individual monocomponents should be used instead \nof the fixed-dose combination.\n\nGFR ml/min Metformin Ertugliflozin\n\n60-89 Maximum daily dose is 3,000 mg.\nDose reduction may be considered in \nrelation to declining renal function.\n\nMaximum daily dose is 15 mg.\n\n45-59 Maximum daily dose is 2,000 mg.\nThe starting dose is at most half of the \nmaximum dose.\n\nInitiation is not recommended in \npatients with a glomerular \nfiltration rate less than 60 ml/min\n(see section 4.4).\n\nDiscontinue when GFR is \npersistently less than 45 ml/min.\n\n30-44 Maximum daily dose is 1,000 mg.\nThe starting dose is at most half of the \nmaximum dose.\n\nNot recommended.\n\n< 30 Metformin is contraindicated. Not recommended.\n\nHepatic impairment\nSegluromet is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nElderly (\u2265 65 years old)\nElderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Because renal function abnormalities \ncan occur after initiating ertugliflozin, and metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the \nkidneys, Segluromet should be used with caution in the elderly. Regular assessment of renal function \nis necessary to aid in prevention of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, particularly in elderly \npatients (see section 4.4). Renal function and risk of volume depletion should be taken into account \n(see sections 4.4 and 4.8).\nThere is limited experience with Segluromet in patients \u2265 75 years of age.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Segluromet in children under 18 years of age have not been established. No \ndata are available.\n\nMethod of administration\nSegluromet should be taken orally twice daily with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal adverse \nreactions associated with metformin. In case of swallowing difficulties, the tablet could be broken or \ncrushed as it is an immediate-release dosage form.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1;\n- any type of acute metabolic acidosis (such as lactic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]);\n- diabetic pre coma;\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\n- severe renal failure (GFR less than 30 ml/min), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or patients on \ndialysis (see section 4.4);\n\n- acute condition with the potential to alter renal function, such as:\n- dehydration,\n- severe infection,\n- shock;\n\n- acute or chronic disease that may cause tissue hypoxia, such as:\n- cardiac or respiratory failure,\n- recent myocardial infarction,\n- shock;\n\n- hepatic impairment;\n- acute alcohol intoxication, alcoholism.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nGeneral\nSegluromet should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.\n\nLactic acidosis\nLactic acidosis, a very rare but serious metabolic complication, most often occurs at acute worsening \nof renal function or cardiorespiratory illness or sepsis. Metformin accumulation occurs at acute \nworsening of renal function and increases the risk of lactic acidosis. \n\nIn case of dehydration (severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever or reduced fluid intake), metformin should be \ntemporarily discontinued and contact with a health care professional is recommended.\n\nMedicinal products that can acutely impair renal function (such as antihypertensives, diuretics and \nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) should be initiated with caution in metformin-\ntreated patients. Other risk factors for lactic acidosis are excessive alcohol intake, hepatic \ninsufficiency, inadequately controlled diabetes, ketosis, prolonged fasting and any conditions \nassociated with hypoxia, as well as concomitant use of medicinal products that may cause lactic \nacidosis (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).\n\nPatients and/or care-givers should be informed of the risk of lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is \ncharacterised by acidotic dyspnoea, abdominal pain, muscle cramps, asthenia and hypothermia \nfollowed by coma. In case of suspected symptoms, the patient should stop taking metformin and seek \nimmediate medical attention. Diagnostic laboratory findings are decreased blood pH (< 7.35), \nincreased plasma lactate levels (> 5 mmol/l) and an increased anion gap and lactate/pyruvate ratio.\n\nAdministration of iodinated contrast agents\nIntravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents may lead to contrast-induced nephropathy, \nresulting in metformin accumulation and an increased risk of lactic acidosis. Segluromet should be \ndiscontinued prior to or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until at least 48 hours \nafter, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable (see sections 4.2 and \n4.5).\n\nRenal function\nThe efficacy of ertugliflozin is dependent on renal function, and efficacy is reduced in patients who \nhave moderate renal impairment and likely absent in patients with severe renal impairment (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nSegluromet should not be initiated in patients with a GFR below 60 ml/min. Segluromet should be \ndiscontinued when GFR is persistently below 45 ml/min due to a reduction of efficacy. \n\nGFR should be assessed before treatment initiation and regularly thereafter (see section 4.2). More \nfrequent renal function monitoring is recommended in patients with a GFR below 60 ml/min. \n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nMetformin is contraindicated in patients with GFR < 30 ml/min and should be temporarily \ndiscontinued in the presence of conditions that alter renal function (see section 4.3).\n\nSurgery\nSegluromet must be discontinued at the time of surgery under general, spinal, or epidural anaesthesia. \nTherapy may be restarted no earlier than 48 hours following surgery or resumption of oral nutrition \nand provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable.\n\nHypotension/Volume depletion\nErtugliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to intravascular volume contraction. \nTherefore, symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiating Segluromet (see section 4.8),\nparticularly in patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or a CrCl less \nthan 60 ml/min), elderly patients (\u2265 65 years), patients on diuretics, or patients on anti-hypertensive \ntherapy with a history of hypotension. Before initiating Segluromet, volume status should be assessed \nand corrected if indicated. Monitor for signs and symptoms after initiating therapy.\n\nDue to its mechanism of action, ertugliflozin induces an osmotic diuresis and increases serum \ncreatinine and decreases eGFR. Increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR were greater in \npatients with moderate renal impairment (see section 4.8).\n\nIn case of conditions that may lead to fluid loss (e.g., gastrointestinal illness), careful monitoring of \nvolume status (e.g., physical examination, blood pressure measurements, laboratory tests including \nhaematocrit) and electrolytes is recommended for patients receiving ertugliflozin. Temporary \ninterruption of treatment with Segluromet should be considered until the fluid loss is corrected.\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis\nRare cases of DKA, including life-threatening and fatal cases, have been reported in clinical trials and \npost-marketing in patients treated with sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and cases \nhave been reported in clinical trials with ertugliflozin. In a number of cases, the presentation of the \ncondition was atypical with only moderately increased blood glucose values, below 14 mmol/l \n(250 mg/dl). It is not known if DKA is more likely to occur with higher doses of ertugliflozin.\n\nThe risk of diabetic ketoacidosis must be considered in the event of non-specific symptoms such as \nnausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, difficulty breathing, confusion, unusual \nfatigue, or sleepiness. Patients should be assessed for ketoacidosis immediately if these symptoms \noccur, regardless of blood glucose level.\n\nIn patients where DKA is suspected or diagnosed, treatment with Segluromet should be discontinued \nimmediately.\n\nTreatment should be interrupted in patients who are hospitalised for major surgical procedures or acute \nserious medical illnesses. Monitoring of ketones is recommended in these patients. Measurement of \nblood ketone levels is preferred to urine. Treatment with Segluromet may be restarted when the ketone \nvalues are normal and the patient\u2019s condition has stabilised.\n\nBefore initiating Segluromet, factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis should \nbe considered.\n\nPatients who may be at higher risk of DKA include patients with a low beta-cell function reserve (e.g., \ntype 2 diabetes patients with low C-peptide or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or\npatients with a history of pancreatitis), patients with conditions that lead to restricted food intake or \nsevere dehydration, patients for whom insulin doses are reduced and patients with increased insulin \nrequirements due to acute medical illness, surgery, or alcohol abuse. SGLT2 inhibitors should be used \nwith caution in these patients.\n\nRestarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients with previous DKA while on SGLT2 inhibitor \ntreatment is not recommended, unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved.\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Segluromet in patients with type 1 diabetes have not been established and \nSegluromet should not be used for treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes. Limited data from \nclinical trials suggest that DKA occurs with common frequency when patients with type 1 diabetes are \ntreated with SGLT2 inhibitors.\n\nLower limb amputations \nIn an ongoing clinical study of ertugliflozin added to existing therapy in type 2 diabetes patients with a \nhistory of established cardiovascular disease, an approximately 1.2-1.6-fold increase in cases of lower \nlimb amputation (primarily of the toe) has been observed in patients treated with ertugliflozin. An \nincrease in cases of lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has also been observed in long-term \nclinical studies with another SGLT2 inhibitor. As an underlying mechanism has not been established, \nrisk factors, apart from general risk factors, for amputation are unknown.\n\nBefore initiating ertugliflozin/metformin, consider factors in the patient history that may increase the \nrisk for amputation. As precautionary measures, consideration should be given to carefully monitoring \npatients with a higher risk for amputation events and counselling patients about the importance of \nroutine preventative foot care and maintaining adequate hydration. Consideration may also be given to \nstopping treatment with ertugliflozin/metformin in patients who develop events which may precede \namputation such as lower-extremity skin ulcer, infection, osteomyelitis or gangrene.\n\nHypoglycaemia with concomitant use of insulin and insulin secretagogues\nErtugliflozin may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an \ninsulin secretagogue, which are known to cause hypoglycaemia (see section 4.8). Therefore, a lower \ndose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia when \nused in combination with Segluromet (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).\n\nGenital mycotic infections\nErtugliflozin increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. In trials with SGLT2 inhibitors, patients \nwith a history of genital mycotic infections and uncircumcised males were more likely to develop \ngenital mycotic infections (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored and treated appropriately.\n\nUrinary tract infections\nUrinary glucose excretion may be associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infections.\nThe incidence of urinary tract infections was not notably different in the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg \ngroups (4.0% and 4.1%) and the placebo group (3.9%). Most of the events were mild or moderate and \nno serious case was reported. Temporary interruption of ertugliflozin should be considered when \ntreating pyelonephritis or urosepsis.\n\nNecrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier\u2019s gangrene) \nPost-marketing cases of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum, (also known as Fournier\u2019s gangrene), \nhave been reported in female and male patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. This is a rare but serious and \npotentially life-threatening event that requires urgent surgical intervention and antibiotic treatment. \n\nPatients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience a combination of symptoms of \npain, tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, with fever or malaise. Be aware \nthat either uro-genital infection or perineal abscess may precede necrotising fasciitis. If Fournier\u2019s \ngangrene is suspected, Segluromet should be discontinued and prompt treatment (including antibiotics \nand surgical debridement) should be instituted. \n\nElderly patients\nElderly patients may be at an increased risk of volume depletion. Patients 65 years and older treated \nwith ertugliflozin had a higher incidence of adverse reactions related to volume depletion compared to \nyounger patients. The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age \nbecause elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than \nyounger patients. Segluromet is expected to have diminished efficacy in elderly patients with renal \nimpairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. \n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nCardiac failure \nExperience in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I-II is limited, and there is no experience in \nclinical studies with ertugliflozin in NYHA class III-IV.\n\nUrine laboratory assessments\nDue to the mechanism of action of ertugliflozin, patients taking Segluromet will test positive for \nglucose in their urine. Alternative methods should be used to monitor glycaemic control.\n\nInterference with 1,5 anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) assay\nMonitoring glycaemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are \nunreliable in assessing glycaemic control in patients taking medicines containing an SGLT2 inhibitor. \nAlternative methods should be used to monitor glycaemic control.\n\nSodium\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with Segluromet have not been performed; however, such \nstudies have been conducted with ertugliflozin and metformin, the individual active substances of \nSegluromet.\n\nErtugliflozin\n\nPharmacodynamic interactions\n\nDiuretics\nErtugliflozin may add to the diuretic effect of diuretics and may increase the risk of dehydration and \nhypotension (see section 4.4).\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulphonylureas, cause hypoglycaemia. Ertugliflozin may \nincrease the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin \nsecretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce \nthe risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with Segluromet (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.8). \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions\n\nEffects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin\nMetabolism by UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 is the primary clearance mechanism for ertugliflozin. \n\nInteraction studies conducted in healthy subjects, using a single dose design, suggest that the \npharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin are not altered by sitagliptin, metformin, glimepiride, or simvastatin.\n\nMultiple-dose administration of rifampin (a UGT and CYP inducer) decreases ertugliflozin AUC and \nCmax by 39% and 15%, respectively. This decrease in exposure is not considered clinically relevant and \ntherefore, no dose adjustment is recommended. A clinically relevant effect with other inducers (e.g., \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) is not expected. \n\nThe impact of UGT inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin has not been studied clinically, \nbut potential increase in ertugliflozin exposure due to UGT inhibition is not considered to be clinically \nrelevant.\n\n \n\n\n\n9\n\nEffects of ertugliflozin on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products\nInteraction studies conducted in healthy volunteers suggest that ertugliflozin had no clinically relevant \neffect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin, metformin, and glimepiride.\n\nCoadministration of simvastatin with ertugliflozin resulted in a 24% and 19% increase in AUC and \nCmax of simvastatin, respectively, and 30% and 16% increase in AUC and Cmax of simvastatin acid, \nrespectively. The mechanism for the small increases in simvastatin and simvastatin acid is unknown \nand is not perpetrated through OATP inhibition by ertugliflozin. These increases are not considered to \nbe clinically meaningful.\n\nMetformin\n\nConcomitant use not recommended\n\nAlcohol\nAlcohol intoxication is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in cases of \nfasting, malnutrition or hepatic impairment.\n\nIodinated contrast agents\nSegluromet must be discontinued prior to or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted \nuntil at least 48 hours after, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable \n(see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nCombinations requiring precautions for use\nSome medicinal products can adversely affect renal function, which may increase the risk of lactic \nacidosis, e.g., NSAIDs, including selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX) II inhibitors, \nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and diuretics, \nespecially loop diuretics. When starting or using such products in combination with metformin, close \nmonitoring of renal function is necessary.\n\nOrganic cation transporters (OCT)\nMetformin is a substrate of both transporters OCT1 and OCT2.\n\nCoadministration of metformin with \n\uf0b7 Inhibitors of OCT1 (such as verapamil) may reduce efficacy of metformin. \n\uf0b7 Inducers of OCT1 (such as rifampicin) may increase gastrointestinal absorption and efficacy of \n\nmetformin.\n\uf0b7 Inhibitors of OCT2 (such as cimetidine, dolutegravir, ranolazine, trimethoprime, vandetanib, \n\nisavuconazole) may decrease the renal elimination of metformin and thus lead to an increase in \nmetformin plasma concentration.\n\n\uf0b7 Inhibitors of both OCT1 and OCT2 (such as crizotinib, olaparib) may alter efficacy and renal \nelimination of metformin.\n\nCaution is therefore advised, especially in patients with renal impairment, when these drugs are \ncoadministered with metformin, as metformin plasma concentration may increase. If needed, dose \nadjustment of metformin may be considered as OCT inhibitors/inducers may alter the efficacy of \nmetformin.\n\nGlucocorticoids (given by systemic and local routes), beta 2 agonists, and diuretics have intrinsic \nhyperglycaemic activity. The patient should be informed and more frequent blood glucose monitoring \nperformed, especially at the beginning of treatment with such medicinal products. If necessary, the \ndose of the antihyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other \nmedicinal product and on its discontinuation.\n\n \n\n\n\n10\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no data from the use of Segluromet in pregnant women. \n\nA limited amount of data suggests the use of metformin in pregnant women is not associated with an \nincreased risk of congenital malformations. Animal studies with metformin do not indicate harmful \neffects with respect to pregnancy, embryonic or foetal development, parturition or post-natal \ndevelopment (see section 5.3).\n\nThere are limited data from the use of ertugliflozin in pregnant women. Based on results from animal \nstudies, ertugliflozin may affect renal development and maturation (see section 5.3). Therefore, \nSegluromet should not be used during pregnancy. \n\nBreast-feeding\nThere is no information regarding the presence of ertugliflozin in human milk, the effects on the \nbreast-fed infant, or the effects on milk production. Metformin is present in human breast milk.\nErtugliflozin and metformin are present in the milk of lactating rats. Ertugliflozin caused effects in the\noffspring of lactating rats.\n\nPharmacologically mediated effects were observed in juvenile rats treated with ertugliflozin (see\nsection 5.3). Since human kidney maturation occurs in utero and during the first 2 years of life when \nexposure from breast-feeding may occur, a risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Segluromet \nshould not be used during breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\nThe effect of Segluromet on fertility in humans has not been studied. No effects of ertugliflozin or \nmetformin on fertility were observed in animal studies (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nSegluromet has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be \nalerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia when Segluromet is used in combination with insulin or an insulin \nsecretagogue and to the elevated risk of adverse reactions related to volume depletion, such as postural \ndizziness (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.8). \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nErtugliflozin and Metformin\nThe safety of concomitantly administered ertugliflozin and metformin has been evaluated in \n1,083 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated for 26 weeks in a pool of two placebo-controlled \ntrials: as ertugliflozin add on therapy to metformin and as ertugliflozin add-on therapy to sitagliptin \nand metformin (see section 5.1). The incidence and type of adverse reactions in these two trials were \nsimilar to the adverse reactions seen with ertugliflozin. There were no additional adverse reactions \nidentified in the pooling of these two placebo-controlled trials that included metformin relative to the \nthree placebo-controlled studies with ertugliflozin (see below).\n\nErtugliflozin\n\nPool of placebo-controlled trials\nThe primary assessment of safety was conducted in a pool of three 26-week, placebo-controlled trials. \nErtugliflozin was used as monotherapy in one trial and as add-on therapy in two trials (see \nsection 5.1). These data reflect exposure of 1,029 patients to ertugliflozin with a mean exposure \nduration of approximately 25 weeks. Patients received ertugliflozin 5 mg (N=519), ertugliflozin 15 mg \n(N=510), or placebo (N=515) once daily.\n\n \n\n\n\n11\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions across the clinical program were vulvovaginal mycotic \ninfection, and other female genital mycotic infections. Serious diabetic ketoacidosis occurred rarely. \nSee \u201cDescription of selected adverse reactions\u201d for frequencies and see section 4.4.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions listed below are classified according to frequency and system organ class (SOC). \nFrequency categories are defined according to the following convention: very common (\u2265 1/10), \ncommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions \n\nSystem Organ Class\nFrequency\n\nAdverse Reaction\n\nInfections and infestations\n\nVery common\n\nCommon\n\nNot known\n\nVulvovaginal mycotic infection and other female genital \nmycotic infections*,\u2020,1\n\nBalanitis candida and other male genital mycotic \ninfections*,\u2020,1\n\nNecrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier\u2019s gangrene)*\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\n\nCommon\n\nRare\n\nVery rare\n\nHypoglycaemia*,\u2020,1\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis*,\u2020,1\n\nLactic acidosis*,2, Vitamin B12 deficiency\n\u2021,2\n\nNervous system disorders\nCommon Taste disturbance2\n\nVascular disorders\nCommon Volume depletion*,\u2020,1\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nVery common Gastrointestinal symptoms\u00a7,2\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\nVery rare Liver function test abnormal2, Hepatitis2\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\nVery rare Erythema2, Pruritus2, Urticaria2\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\nCommon\n\nUncommon\n\nIncreased urination\u00b6,1\n\nDysuria1, Blood creatinine increased/Glomerular filtration \nrate decreased\u2020,1\n\nReproductive system and breast disorders\nCommon Vulvovaginal pruritus1\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nCommon Thirst#,1\n\nInvestigations\nCommon Serum lipids changed\u00de,1, Haemoglobin increased\u00df,1, BUN \n\nincreased\u00e0,1\n1 Adverse reaction with ertugliflozin.\n2 Adverse reaction with metformin.\n* See Section 4.4.\n\u2020 See subsections below for additional information.\n\u2021 Long-term treatment with metformin has been associated with a decrease in vitamin B12 absorption, which may very \n\nrarely result in clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency (e.g., megaloblastic anaemia).\n\n \n\n\n\n12\n\n\u00a7 Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and loss of appetite occur most \nfrequently during initiation of therapy and resolve spontaneously in most cases.\n\n\u00b6\nIncludes: pollakiuria, micturition urgency, polyuria, urine output increased, and nocturia.\n\n#\nIncludes: thirst and polydipsia.\n\n\u00de Mean percent changes from baseline for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg versus placebo, respectively, were LDL-C 5.8% \nand 8.4% versus 3.2%; total cholesterol 2.8% and 5.7% versus 1.1%; however, HDL-C 6.2% and 7.6% versus 1.9%.\nMedian percent changes from baseline for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg versus placebo, respectively, were\ntriglycerides -3.9% and -1.7% versus 4.5%.\n\n\u00df The proportion of subjects having at least 1 increase in haemoglobin > 2.0 g/dL was higher in the ertugliflozin 5 mg and \n15 mg groups (4.7% and 4.1%, respectively) compared to the placebo group (0.6%).\n\n\u00e0 The proportion of subjects having any occurrence of BUN values \u2265 50% increase and value >ULN was numerically \nhigher in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group and higher in the 15 mg group (7.9% and 9.8%, respectively) relative to the \nplacebo group (5.1%).\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nVolume depletion (ertugliflozin)\nErtugliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to intravascular volume contraction and \nadverse reactions related to volume depletion. In the pool of placebo-controlled studies, the incidence \nof adverse events related to volume depletion (dehydration, dizziness postural, presyncope, syncope, \nhypotension, and orthostatic hypotension) was low (< 2%) and not notably different across the \nertugliflozin and placebo groups. In the subgroup analyses in the broader pool of Phase 3 studies, \nsubjects with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, subjects \u2265 65 years of age and subjects on diuretics had a \nhigher incidence of volume depletion in the ertugliflozin groups relative to the comparator group (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). In subjects with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence was 5.1%, 2.6%, and \n0.5% for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, and the comparator group and for subjects with \neGFR 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence was 6.4%, 3.7%, and 0% respectively.\n\nHypoglycaemia (ertugliflozin)\nIn the pool of placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of documented hypoglycaemia was increased \nfor ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg (5.0% and 4.5%) compared to placebo (2.9%). In this population, the \nincidence of severe hypoglycaemia was 0.4% in each group. When ertugliflozin was used as \nmonotherapy, the incidence of hypoglycaemic events in the ertugliflozin groups was 2.6% in both \ngroups and 0.7% in the placebo group. When used as add-on to metformin, the incidence of \nhypoglycaemic events was 7.2% in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, 7.8% in the ertugliflozin 15 mg \ngroup and 4.3% in the placebo group.\n\nWhen ertugliflozin was added to metformin and compared to sulphonylurea, the incidence of \nhypoglycaemia was higher for the sulphonylurea (27%) compared to ertugliflozin (5.6% and 8.2% for \nertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg, respectively). \n\nIn patients with moderate renal impairment taking insulins, SU, or meglitinides as background \nmedication, documented hypoglycaemia was 36%, 27% and 36% for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin \n15 mg, and placebo, respectively (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.5).\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis (ertugliflozin)\nAcross the clinical program for ertugliflozin, ketoacidosis was identified in 3 of 3,409 (0.1%) \nertugliflozin-treated patients and 0.0% of comparator-treated patients (see section 4.4).\n\nBlood creatinine increased/Glomerular filtration rate decreased and renal-related events\n(ertugliflozin)\nInitial increases in mean creatinine and decreases in mean eGFR in patients treated with ertugliflozin \nwere generally transient during continuous treatment. Patients with moderate renal impairment at \nbaseline had larger mean changes that did not return to baseline at Week 26; these changes reversed\nafter treatment discontinuation.\n\nRenal-related adverse reactions (e.g., acute kidney injury, renal impairment, acute prerenal failure) \nmay occur in patients treated with ertugliflozin, particularly in patients with moderate renal \n\n \n\n\n\n13\n\nimpairment where the incidence of renal-related adverse reactions was 2.5%, 1.3%, and 0.6% in \npatients treated with ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, and placebo, respectively.\n\nGenital mycotic infections (ertugliflozin)\nIn the pool of three placebo-controlled clinical trials, female genital mycotic infections (e.g., genital \ncandidiasis, genital infection fungal, vaginal infection, vulvitis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, vulvovaginal \nmycotic infection, vulvovaginitis) occurred in 9.1%, 12%, and 3.0% of females treated with \nertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, and placebo, respectively. In females, discontinuation due to \ngenital mycotic infections occurred in 0.6% and 0% of patients treated with ertugliflozin and placebo, \nrespectively (see section 4.4).\n\nIn the same pool, male genital mycotic infections (e.g., balanitis candida, balanoposthitis, genital \ninfection, genital infection fungal) occurred in 3.7%, 4.2%, and 0.4% of males treated with \nertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, and placebo, respectively. Male genital mycotic infections \noccurred more commonly in uncircumcised males. In males, discontinuations due to genital mycotic \ninfections occurred in 0.2% and 0% of patients treated with ertugliflozin and placebo, respectively. In \nrare instances, phimosis was reported and sometimes circumcision was performed (see section 4.4).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nIn the event of an overdose with Segluromet, employ the usual supportive measures (e.g., remove \nunabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute \nsupportive treatment) as dictated by the patient\u2019s clinical status.\n\nErtugliflozin\nErtugliflozin did not show any toxicity in healthy subjects at single oral doses up to 300 mg and \nmultiple doses up to 100 mg daily for 2 weeks. No potential acute symptoms and signs of overdose \nwere identified. Removal of ertugliflozin by haemodialysis has not been studied.\n\nMetformin\nOverdose of metformin hydrochloride has occurred, including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 g. \nHypoglycaemia was reported in approximately 10% of cases, but no causal association with \nmetformin hydrochloride has been established. Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately \n32% of metformin overdose cases (see section 4.4). Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must \nbe treated in a hospital. Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 ml/min under good \nhaemodynamic conditions. Therefore, haemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated drug \nfrom patients in whom metformin overdose is suspected.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, combinations of oral blood glucose lowering \ndrugs, ATC code: A10BD23.\n\nMechanism of action\nSegluromet combines two antihyperglycaemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to \nimprove glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: ertugliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor, and \nmetformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n14\n\nErtugliflozin\nSGLT2 is the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular \nfiltrate back into the circulation. Ertugliflozin is a potent, selective, and reversible inhibitor of SGLT2. \nBy inhibiting SGLT2, ertugliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal \nthreshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.\n\nMetformin\nMetformin is an antihyperglycaemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 \ndiabetes, lowering both basal and post-prandial plasma glucose. Its pharmacologic mechanisms of \naction are different from other classes of oral antihyperglycaemic agents. Metformin decreases hepatic \nglucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by \nincreasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilisation. Unlike sulphonylureas, metformin does not \nproduce hypoglycaemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects, except in special \ncircumstances (see section 4.5), and does not cause hyperinsulinaemia. With metformin therapy, \ninsulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response \nmay actually decrease.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nErtugliflozin\n\nUrinary glucose excretion and urinary volume\nDose-dependent increases in the amount of glucose excreted in urine were observed in healthy \nsubjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus following single- and multiple-dose \nadministration of ertugliflozin. Dose-response modelling indicates that ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg \nresult in near maximal urinary glucose excretion (UGE) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, \nproviding 87% and 96% of maximal inhibition, respectively.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nErtugliflozin in combination with metformin\nThe efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in combination with metformin have been studied in \n4 multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled, Phase 3 clinical \nstudies involving 3,643 patients with type 2 diabetes. Across the four studies, the racial distribution \nranged from 66.2% to 80.3% White, 10.6% to 20.3% Asian, 1.9% to 10.3% Black, and 4.5% to 7.4% \nother. Hispanic or Latino patients comprised 15.6% to 34.5% of the population. The mean age of the \npatients across these four studies ranged from 55.1 to 59.1 years (range 21 years to 86 years); 15.6% to \n29.9% of patients were \u226565 years of age and 0.6% to 3.8% were \u226575 years of age.\n\nErtugliflozin as add-on combination therapy with metformin\nA total of 621 patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy \n(\u2265 1,500 mg/day) participated in a randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, 26-week, placebo-\ncontrolled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in combination with metformin. \nPatients were randomised to ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, or placebo administered once \ndaily in addition to continuation of background metformin therapy (see Table 2).\n\n \n\n\n\n15\n\nTable 2: Results at Week 26 from a placebo-controlled study for ertugliflozin used in \ncombination with metformin*\n\nErtugliflozin 5 mg Ertugliflozin 15 mg Placebo\n\nHbA1c (%) N = 207 N = 205 N = 209\n\nBaseline (mean) 8.1 8.1 8.2\n\nChange from baseline (LS mean\u2020) -0.7 -0.9 -0.0\n\nDifference from placebo (LS mean\u2020, 95% CI) -0.7\u2021 (-0.9, -0.5) -0.9\u2021 (-1.1, -0.7)\n\nPatients [N (%)] with HbA1c < 7% 73 (35.3)\u00a7 82 (40.0)\u00a7 33 (15.8)\n\nBody Weight (kg) N = 207 N = 205 N = 209\n\nBaseline (mean) 84.9 85.3 84.5\n\nChange from baseline (LS mean\u2020) -3.0 -2.9 -1.3\n\nDifference from placebo (LS mean\u2020, 95% CI) -1.7\u2021 (-2.2, -1.1) -1.6\u2021 (-2.2, -1.0)\n\n* N includes all randomised, treated patients who had at least one measurement of the outcome variable.\n\u2020 Least squares means adjusted for treatment, time, prior antihyperglycaemic medication (metformin monotherapy or \n\nmetformin + another AHA), baseline eGFR (continuous), menopausal status randomisation stratum (men, premenopausal \nwomen, women who are perimenopausal or < 3 years postmenopausal, women who are \uf0b3 3 years postmenopausal) and the \ninteraction of time by treatment.\n\n\u2021 p\uf0a3 0.001 compared to placebo.\n\u00a7 p< 0.001 compared to placebo (based on adjusted odds ratio comparisons from a logistic regression model using multiple\n\nimputation for missing data values).\n\nFactorial study with ertugliflozin and sitagliptin as add-on combination therapy with metformin\nA total of 1,233 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, \n26-week, active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg in \ncombination with sitagliptin 100 mg compared to the individual components.

Ertugliflozin does not exhibit time-dependent pharmacokinetics and accumulates in \nplasma up to 10-40% following multiple dosing.\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing single-dose oral administration of 5 mg and 15 mg of ertugliflozin, peak plasma \nconcentrations (median Tmax) of ertugliflozin occur at 1 hour post-dose under fasted conditions. \nPlasma Cmax and AUC of ertugliflozin increase in a dose-proportional manner following single doses \nfrom 0.5 mg to 300 mg and following multiple doses from 1 mg to 100 mg. The absolute oral \nbioavailability of ertugliflozin following administration of a 15-mg dose is approximately 100%. \n\nAdministration of ertugliflozin with a high-fat and high-calorie meal decreases ertugliflozin Cmax by \n29% and prolongs Tmax by 1 hour, but does not alter AUC as compared with the fasted state. The \nobserved effect of food on ertugliflozin pharmacokinetics is not considered clinically relevant, and \nertugliflozin may be administered with or without food. In Phase 3 clinical trials, ertugliflozin was \nadministered without regard to meals.\n\nThe effects of a high-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin and metformin when \nadministered as Segluromet tablets are comparable to those reported for the individual tablets. Food \nhad no meaningful effect on AUCinf of ertugliflozin or metformin, but reduced mean ertugliflozin Cmax\nby approximately 41% and metformin Cmax by approximately 29% compared to the fasted condition.\n\nErtugliflozin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) \ntransporters.\n\n \n\n\n\n19\n\nDistribution\nThe mean steady-state volume of distribution of ertugliflozin following an intravenous dose is 86 l. \nPlasma protein binding of ertugliflozin is 93.6% and is independent of ertugliflozin plasma \nconcentrations. Plasma protein binding is not meaningfully altered in patients with renal or hepatic \nimpairment. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio of ertugliflozin is 0.66.\n\nErtugliflozin is not a substrate of organic anion transporters (OAT1, OAT3), organic cation \ntransporters (OCT1, OCT2), or organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1, OATP1B3) in \nvitro.\n\nBiotransformation\nMetabolism is the primary clearance mechanism for ertugliflozin. The major metabolic pathway for \nertugliflozin is UGT1A9 and UGT2B7-mediated O-glucuronidation to two glucuronides that are \npharmacologically inactive at clinically relevant concentrations. CYP-mediated (oxidative) \nmetabolism of ertugliflozin is minimal (12%).\n\nElimination\nThe mean systemic plasma clearance following an intravenous 100 \u00b5g dose was 11 l/hr. The mean \nelimination half-life in type 2 diabetic patients with normal renal function was estimated to be \n17 hours based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Following administration of an oral \n[14C]-ertugliflozin solution to healthy subjects, approximately 41% and 50% of the drug-related \nradioactivity was eliminated in faeces and urine, respectively. Only 1.5% of the administered dose was \nexcreted as unchanged ertugliflozin in urine and 34% as unchanged ertugliflozin in faeces, which is \nlikely due to biliary excretion of glucuronide metabolites and subsequent hydrolysis to parent.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\nIn a Phase 1 clinical pharmacology study in patients with type 2 diabetes and mild, moderate, or \nsevere renal impairment (as determined by eGFR), following a single-dose administration of 15 mg \nertugliflozin, the mean increases in AUC of ertugliflozin were \u2264 1.7-fold, compared to subjects with \nnormal renal function. These increases in ertugliflozin AUC are not considered clinically relevant. \nThere were no clinically meaningful differences in the ertugliflozin Cmax values among the different \nrenal function groups. The 24-hour urinary glucose excretion declined with increasing severity of renal \nimpairment (see section 4.4). The plasma protein binding of ertugliflozin was unaffected in patients \nwith renal impairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\nModerate hepatic impairment (based on the Child-Pugh classification) did not result in an increase in \nexposure of ertugliflozin. The AUC of ertugliflozin decreased by approximately 13%, and Cmax\ndecreased by approximately 21% compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. This decrease in \nertugliflozin exposure is not considered clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in \npatients with Child-Pugh class C (severe) hepatic impairment. The plasma protein binding of \nertugliflozin was unaffected in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.\n\nPaediatric population\nNo studies with ertugliflozin have been performed in paediatric patients.\n\nEffects of age, body weight, gender and race\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, body weight, gender, and race do not have a \nclinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin.\n\n \n\n\n\n20\n\nDrug Interactions\n\nIn vitro assessment of ertugliflozin\nIn in vitro studies, ertugliflozin and ertugliflozin glucuronides did not inhibit or inactivate CYPs 1A2, \n2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2B6, 2D6, or 3A4, and did not induce CYPs 1A2, 2B6, or 3A4. Ertugliflozin and \nertugliflozin glucuronides did not inhibit the activity of UGTs 1A6, 1A9 or 2B7 in vitro. Ertugliflozin \nwas a weak inhibitor of UGTs 1A1 and 1A4 in vitro at higher concentrations that are not clinically \nrelevant. Ertugliflozin glucuronides had no effect on these isoforms. Overall, ertugliflozin is unlikely \nto affect the pharmacokinetics of concurrently administered drugs eliminated by these enzymes.\n\nErtugliflozin or ertugliflozin glucuronides do not meaningfully inhibit P-gp, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3 \ntransporters or transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 at clinically relevant \nconcentrations in vitro. Overall, ertugliflozin is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of concurrently \nadministered medications that are substrates of these transporters.\n\nMetformin\n\nAbsorption\nThe absolute bioavailability of a metformin hydrochloride 500-mg tablet given under fasting \nconditions is approximately 50-60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin hydrochloride \ntablets 500 mg to 1,500 mg, and 850 mg to 2,550 mg, indicate that there is a lack of dose \nproportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in \nelimination. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin hydrochloride tablets, steady-\nstate plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24-48 hours and are generally <1 \u00b5g/ml. \nDuring controlled clinical trials of metformin, maximum metformin plasma levels did not exceed \n5 \u00b5g/mL, even at maximum doses.\n\nFood decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by \napproximately a 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax), a 25% lower area under the \nplasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), and a 35-minute prolongation of time to peak plasma \nconcentration (Tmax) following administration of a single 850-mg tablet of metformin with food, \ncompared to the same tablet strength administered fasting. The clinical relevance of these decreases is \nunknown.\n\nDistribution\nThe apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of metformin \nhydrochloride tablets 850 mg averaged 654 \u00b1 358 l. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins. \nMetformin partitions into erythrocytes. \n\nBiotransformation\nMetformin is excreted unchanged in the urine. No metabolites have been identified in humans.\n\nElimination\nRenal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that \ntubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, \napproximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, \nwith a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\nIn patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and \nthe renal clearance is decreased in proportion to the decrease in eGFR (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic insufficiency.\n\n \n\n\n\n21\n\nEffects of age, body weight, gender and race\nLimited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest \nthat total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and Cmax is increased, \ncompared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin \npharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function.\n\nMetformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between normal subjects and \npatients with type 2 diabetes when analysed according to gender. Similarly, in controlled clinical \nstudies in patients with type 2 diabetes, the antihyperglycaemic effect of metformin was comparable in \nmales and females.\n\nNo studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. In \ncontrolled clinical studies of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes, the antihyperglycaemic effect \nwas comparable in Whites (n=249), Blacks (n=51), and Hispanics (n=24).\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, acute toxicity, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential.\n\nGeneral toxicity\n\nErtugliflozin\nRepeat-dose oral toxicity studies were conducted in mice, rats, and dogs for up to 13, 26, and \n39 weeks, respectively. Signs of toxicity that were considered adverse were generally observed at \nexposures greater than or equal to 77 times the human unbound exposure (AUC) at the maximum \nrecommended human dose (MRHD) of 15 mg/day. Most toxicity was consistent with pharmacology \nrelated to urinary glucose loss and included decreased body weight and body fat, increased food \nconsumption, diarrhoea, dehydration, decreased serum glucose and increases in other serum \nparameters reflective of increased protein metabolism, gluconeogenesis and electrolyte imbalances, \nand urinary changes such as polyuria, glucosuria, and calciuria. Microscopic changes related to \nglucosuria and/or calciuria observed only in rodents included dilatation of renal tubules, hypertrophy \nof zona glomerulosa in adrenal glands (rats), and increased trabecular bone (rats). Except for emesis, \nthere were no adverse toxicity findings in dogs at 379 times the human unbound exposure (AUC) at \nthe MRHD of 15 mg/day.\n\nCarcinogenesis\n\nErtugliflozin\nIn the 2-year mouse carcinogenicity study, ertugliflozin was administered by oral gavage at doses of 5, \n15, and 40 mg/kg/day. There were no ertugliflozin-related neoplastic findings at doses up to \n40 mg/kg/day (approximately 41 times human unbound exposure at the MRHD of 15 mg/day based on \nAUC). In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, ertugliflozin was administered by oral gavage at doses \nof 1.5, 5, and 15 mg/kg/day. Ertugliflozin-related neoplastic findings included an increased incidence \nof benign adrenal medullary pheochromocytoma in male rats at 15 mg/kg/day. This finding was \nattributed to carbohydrate malabsorption leading to altered calcium homeostasis and was not \nconsidered relevant to human risk. The no-observed-effect level (NOEL) for neoplasia was\n5 mg/kg/day (approximately 16 times human unbound exposure at the MRHD of 15 mg/day).\n\nMetformin\nLong-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and \nmice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1,500 mg/kg/day, \nrespectively. These doses are both approximately four times the maximum recommended human daily \ndose of 2,000 mg based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with \nmetformin was found in either male or female mice. Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential \nobserved with metformin in male rats. There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stromal \nuterine polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day.\n\n \n\n\n\n22\n\nMutagenesis\n\nErtugliflozin\nErtugliflozin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the microbial \nreverse mutation, in vitro cytogenetic (human lymphocytes), and in vivo rat micronucleus assays.\n\nMetformin\nThere was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin in the following in vitro tests: Ames test \n(S. typhimurium), gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), or chromosomal aberrations test \n(human lymphocytes). Results in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test were also negative.\n\nReproductive toxicology\n\nErtugliflozin\nIn the rat fertility and embryonic development study, male and female rats were administered \nertugliflozin at 5, 25, and 250 mg/kg/day. No effects on fertility were observed at 250 mg/kg/day \n(approximately 386 times human unbound exposure at the MRHD of 15 mg/day based on AUC \ncomparisons). Ertugliflozin did not adversely affect developmental outcomes in rats and rabbits at \nmaternal exposures that were 239 and 1,069 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum \nclinical dose of 15 mg/day, based on AUC. At a maternally toxic dose in rats (250 mg/kg/day), lower \nfoetal viability and a higher incidence of a visceral malformation were observed at maternal exposure \nthat was 510 times the maximum clinical dose of 15 mg/day.\n\nIn the pre- and post-natal development study, decreased post-natal growth and development were \nobserved in rats administered ertugliflozin gestation day 6 through lactation day 21 at \n\u2265 100 mg/kg/day (estimated 239 times the human exposure at the maximum clinical dose of \n15 mg/day, based on AUC). Sexual maturation was delayed in both sexes at 250 mg/kg/day (estimated \n620 times the MRHD at 15 mg/day, based on AUC).\n\nWhen ertugliflozin was administered to juvenile rats from post-natal day (PND) 21 to PND 90, a \nperiod of renal development corresponding to the late second and third trimesters of human pregnancy, \nincreased kidney weights, dilatation of the renal pelvis and tubules, and renal tubular mineralization \nwere seen at an exposure 13 times the maximum clinical dose of 15 mg/day, based on AUC. Effects \non bone (shorter femur length, increased trabecular bone in the femur) as well as effects of delayed \npuberty were observed at an exposure 817 times the MHRD of 15 mg/day based on AUC. The effects \non kidney and bone did not fully reverse after the 1-month recovery period.\n\nMetformin\nFertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses as high as \n600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately three times the maximum recommended human daily dose \nbased on body surface area comparisons. Metformin did not adversely affect developmental outcomes \nwhen administered to rats and rabbits at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. This represents an exposure of \nabout 2 and 6 times the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 2,000 mg based on \nbody surface area comparisons for rats and rabbits, respectively. Determination of foetal \nconcentrations demonstrated a partial placental barrier to metformin.\n\n \n\n\n\n23\n\n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n\uf0b7 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n\uf0b7 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.\n\uf0b7 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n\uf0b7 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Segluromet is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Segluromet\n3. How to take Segluromet\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Segluromet\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Segluromet is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Segluromet is\nSegluromet contains two active substances, ertugliflozin and metformin.\n\uf0b7 Ertugliflozin belongs to a group of medicines called sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2)\n\ninhibitors.\n\uf0b7 Metformin belongs to a group of medicines called biguanides.\n\nWhat Segluromet is used for\n\uf0b7 Segluromet lowers blood sugar levels in adult patients (aged 18 years and older) with type 2 \n\ndiabetes.\n\uf0b7 Segluromet can be used instead of taking both ertugliflozin and metformin as separate tablets. \n\uf0b7 Segluromet can be used alone or with some other medicines that lower blood sugar. \n\uf0b7 You need to keep following your food and exercise plan while taking Segluromet.\n\nHow Segluromet works\n\uf0b7 Ertugliflozin works by blocking the SGLT2 protein in your kidneys. This causes blood sugar to \n\nbe removed in your urine.\n\uf0b7 Metformin works by inhibiting sugar (glucose) production in the liver. \n\nWhat is type 2 diabetes?\nType 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin or the insulin that \nyour body produces does not work as well as it should. Your body can also make too much sugar. \nWhen this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical problems,\nlike heart disease, kidney disease, blindness and poor circulation.\n\n \n\n\n\n52\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Segluromet\n\nDo not take Segluromet\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to ertugliflozin or metformin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6).\n\uf0b7 if you have severely reduced kidney function or need dialysis.\n\uf0b7 if you have uncontrolled diabetes, with, for example, severe hyperglycaemia (high blood \n\nglucose), nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid weight loss, lactic acidosis (see \u201cRisk of lactic \nacidosis\u201d below) or ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a condition in which substances called \u2018ketone \nbodies\u2019 accumulate in the blood and which can lead to diabetic pre-coma. Symptoms include \nstomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness, or your breath developing an unusual fruity \nsmell.\n\n\uf0b7 if you have a severe infection or are dehydrated.\n\uf0b7 if you have recently had a heart attack or have severe circulatory problems, such as \u2018shock\u2019 or \n\nbreathing difficulties.\n\uf0b7 if you have liver problems.\n\uf0b7 if you drink alcohol to excess (either regularly or from time to time).\nDo not take Segluromet if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before \ntaking Segluromet. \n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before and while taking Segluromet, if you:\n\uf0b7 have kidney problems.\n\uf0b7 have or have had yeast infections of the vagina or penis.\n\uf0b7 have ever had serious heart disease or if you have had a stroke.\n\uf0b7 have type 1 diabetes. Segluromet should not be used to treat this condition.\n\uf0b7 take other diabetes medicines; you are more likely to get low blood sugar with certain \n\nmedicines.\n\uf0b7 might be at risk of dehydration (for example, if you are taking medicines that increase urine \n\nproduction [diuretics] lower blood pressure or if you are over 65 years old). Ask about ways to \nprevent dehydration.\n\n\uf0b7 experience rapid weight loss, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, fast and \ndeep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, a sweet \nor metallic taste in your mouth or a different odour to your urine or sweat, contact a doctor or \nthe nearest hospital straight away. These symptoms could be a sign of \u201cdiabetic ketoacidosis\u201d \u2013\na problem you can get with diabetes because of increased levels of \u201cketone bodies\u201d in your \nurine or blood, seen in tests. The risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with \nprolonged fasting, excessive alcohol consumption, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin \ndose, or a higher need of insulin due to major surgery or serious illness.\n\n\uf0b7 have had a lower limb amputation.\n\nIt is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice regarding foot care and \nadequate hydration given by your healthcare professional. You should notify your doctor immediately \nif you notice any wounds or discolouration, or if you experience any tenderness or pain in your feet. \nSome studies indicate that taking ertugliflozin may have contributed to an increase in cases of lower \nlimb amputation (mainly of the toe).\n\nTalk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness, \nredness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or feeling \ngenerally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even life-threatening \ninfection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier\u2019s gangrene which destroys the tissue \nunder the skin. Fournier\u2019s gangrene has to be treated immediately.\n\n \n\n\n\n53\n\nWhen this medicine is used in combination with insulin or medicines that increase insulin release from \nthe pancreas, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may reduce the dose of your \ninsulin or other medicine.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nRisk of lactic acidosis\nSegluromet may cause a very rare, but very serious side effect called lactic acidosis, particularly if \nyour kidneys are not working properly. The risk of developing lactic acidosis is also increased with \nuncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or alcohol intake, dehydration (see further \ninformation below), liver problems and any medical conditions in which a part of the body has a \nreduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart disease).\nIf any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions.\n\nStop taking Segluromet for a short time if you have a condition that may be associated with \ndehydration (significant loss of body fluids) such as severe vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, exposure to \nheat or if you drink less fluid than normal. Talk to your doctor for further instructions.\n\nStop taking Segluromet and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately if you \nexperience some of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition may lead to coma.\nSymptoms of lactic acidosis include:\n\uf0b7 vomiting\n\uf0b7 stomach ache (abdominal pain)\n\uf0b7 muscle cramps\n\uf0b7 a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness\n\uf0b7 difficulty in breathing\n\uf0b7 reduced body temperature and heartbeat\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital.\n\nIf you need to have major surgery you must stop taking Segluromet during and for some time after the \nprocedure. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with \nSegluromet.\n\nDuring treatment with Segluromet, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once a year or \nmore frequently if you are elderly and/or if you have worsening kidney function.\n\nUrine glucose\nBecause of how Segluromet works, your urine will test positive for sugar (glucose) while you are on \nthis medicine.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nChildren and adolescents below 18 years should not take this medicine. It is not known if this \nmedicine is safe and effective when used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.\n\nOther medicines and Segluromet\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n\nYou may need more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests, or your doctor may need to \nadjust the dose of Segluromet. In particular, tell your doctor:\n\uf0b7 if you are taking medicines which increase urine production (diuretics).\n\uf0b7 if you are taking other medicines that lower the sugar in your blood, such as insulin or\n\nmedicines that increase insulin release from the pancreas.\n\uf0b7 if you are taking medicines used to treat pain and inflammation (NSAID and COX-2-inhibitors, \n\nsuch as ibuprofen and celecoxib).\n\n \n\n\n\n54\n\n\uf0b7 if you are taking certain medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors and \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists).\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), tell your doctor.\n\nIf you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for \nexample, in the context of an X-ray or scan, you must stop taking Segluromet before or at the time of \nthe injection. Your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with \nSegluromet.\n\nSegluromet with alcohol\nAvoid excessive alcohol intake while taking Segluromet since this may increase the risk of lactic \nacidosis (see section \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d).\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nIt is not known if Segluromet can harm your unborn baby. If you are pregnant, talk with your doctor \nabout the best way to control your blood sugar while you are pregnant. You should not use Segluromet\nif you are pregnant.\n\nIt is not known if Segluromet passes into breast milk. Talk with your doctor about the best way to feed \nyour baby if you take this medicine. You should not use Segluromet if you are breast-feeding.\n\nDriving and using machines\nThis medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Taking this \nmedicine in combination with insulin or medicines that increase insulin release from the pancreas can \ncause blood sugar levels to drop too low (hypoglycaemia), which may cause symptoms such as \nshaking, sweating and change in vision, and may affect your ability to drive and use machines. Do not \ndrive or use any tools or machines if you feel dizzy while taking Segluromet.\n\nSegluromet contains sodium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\n3. How to take Segluromet\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what segluromet is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "what segluromet is segluromet contains two active substances, ertugliflozin and metformin. ertugliflozin belongs to a group of medicines called sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (sglt2) inhibitors. metformin belongs to a group of medicines called biguanides. what segluromet is used for segluromet lowers blood sugar levels in adult patients (aged 18 years and older) with type 2 diabetes. segluromet can be used instead of taking both ertugliflozin and metformin as separate tablets. segluromet can be used alone or with some other medicines that lower blood sugar. you need to keep following your food and exercise plan while taking segluromet. how segluromet works ertugliflozin works by blocking the sglt2 protein in your kidneys. this causes blood sugar to be removed in your urine. metformin works by inhibiting sugar (glucose) production in the liver. what is type 2 diabetes? type 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin or the insulin that your body produces does not work as well as it should. your body can also make too much sugar. when this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. this can lead to serious medical problems, like heart disease, kidney disease, blindness and poor circulation.", "Entity_Recognition":

these symptoms could be a sign of \"diabetic ketoacidosis\" a problem you can get with diabetes because of increased levels of \"ketone bodies\" in your urine or blood, seen in tests. the risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis may be increased with prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol consumption, dehydration, sudden reductions in insulin dose, or a higher need of insulin due to major surgery or serious illness. have had a lower limb amputation. it is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice regarding foot care and adequate hydration given by your

other medicine. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. risk of lactic acidosis segluromet may cause a very rare, but very serious side effect called lactic acidosis, particularly if your kidneys are not working properly. the risk of developing lactic acidosis is also increased with uncontrolled diabetes, serious infections, prolonged fasting or alcohol intake, dehydration (see further information below), liver problems and any medical conditions in which a part of the body has a reduced supply of oxygen (such as acute severe heart disease). if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor for further instructions. stop taking segluromet for a short time if you have a condition that may be associated with dehydration

segluromet and contact a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately if you experience some of the symptoms of lactic acidosis, as this condition may lead to coma. symptoms of lactic acidosis include: vomiting stomach ache (abdominal pain) muscle cramps a general feeling of not being well with severe tiredness difficulty in breathing reduced body temperature and heartbeat lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital. if you need to have major surgery you must stop taking segluromet during and for some time after the procedure. your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with segluromet. during treatment with segluromet, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once a year or more frequently if you are elderly

medicines and segluromet tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. you may need more frequent blood glucose and kidney function tests, or your doctor may need to adjust the dose of segluromet. in particular, tell your doctor: if you are taking medicines which increase urine production (diuretics). if you are taking other medicines that lower the sugar in your blood, such as insulin or medicines that increase insulin release from the pancreas. if you are taking medicines used to treat pain and inflammation (nsaid and cox-2-inhibitors, such as ibuprofen and celecoxib). if you are taking certain medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure (ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor antagonists). if any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), tell your doctor. if you need to have an injection of a contrast medium that contains iodine into your bloodstream, for example, in the context of an x-ray or scan, you must stop taking segluromet before or at the time of the injection. your doctor will decide when you must stop and when to restart your treatment with segluromet. segluromet with alcohol

cause blood sugar levels to drop too low (hypoglycaemia), which may cause symptoms such as shaking, sweating and change in vision, and may affect your ability to drive and use machines. do not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel dizzy while taking segluromet. segluromet contains sodium this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially
