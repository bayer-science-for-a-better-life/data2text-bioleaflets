QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains neratinib maleate, equivalent to 40 mg neratinib. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see Section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nOval, red film-coated tablet with ‘W104’ debossed on one side. Tablet dimensions are 10.5 mm x \n4.3 mm with thickness of 3.1 mm. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indication \n \nNerlynx is indicated for the extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early-stage hormone \nreceptor positive HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer and who completed adjuvant \ntrastuzumab-based therapy less than one year ago. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNerlynx treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the administration \nof anti-cancer medicinal products. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of Nerlynx is 240 mg (six 40 mg tablets) taken orally once daily, \ncontinuously for one year. Nerlynx should be taken with food, preferably in the morning. Patients \nshould initiate treatment within 1 year after completion of trastuzumab therapy. \n \nDose modifications for adverse reactions \nNerlynx dose modification is recommended based on individual safety and tolerability. Management \nof some adverse reactions may require dose interruption and/or dose reduction as shown in Table 1, \nTable 2, Table 3, and Table 4. \n \nDiscontinue Nerlynx for patients who: \n\n• Fail to recover to Grade 0 to 1 from treatment-related toxicity, \n• For toxicities that result in a treatment delay > 3 weeks, or  \n• For patients that are unable to tolerate 120 mg daily  \n\n \nAdditional clinical situations may result in dose adjustments as clinically indicated (e.g. intolerable \ntoxicities, persistent Grade 2 adverse reactions, etc.). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nTable 1: Nerlynx dose modifications for adverse reactions \n\nDose level  Nerlynx dose  \n\nRecommended starting dose 240 mg daily \n\nFirst dose reduction 200 mg daily \n\nSecond dose reduction 160 mg daily \n\nThird dose reduction 120 mg daily \n\nTable 2: Nerlynx dose modifications and management – general toxicities* \n\nSeverity of toxicity† Action \n\nGrade 3  Stop Nerlynx until recovery to Grade 0-1 or baseline within 3 weeks \nof stopping treatment. Then resume Nerlynx at the next lower dose \nlevel. If grade 3 toxicity does not recover within 3 weeks, \ndiscontinue Nerlynx permanently. \n\nGrade 4 Discontinue Nerlynx permanently. \n*  Refer to Table 3 and Table 4 below for management of diarrhoea and hepatotoxicity \n†  Per CTCAE v4.0 \n \nDose modifications for diarrhoea \nDiarrhoea management requires the correct use of an anti-diarrhoeal medicinal product, dietary \nchanges, and appropriate dose modifications of Nerlynx.  Guidelines for adjusting doses of Nerlynx in \nthe setting of diarrhoea are shown in Table 3. \n \n\nTable 3: Dose modifications for diarrhoea \n\nSeverity of diarrhoea* Action \n\n• Grade 1 diarrhoea [increase of \n< 4 stools per day over baseline] \n\n• Grade 2 diarrhoea [increase of \n4-6 stools per day over baseline] \nlasting < 5 days \n\n• Grade 3 diarrhoea [increase of \n≥ 7 stools per day over baseline; \nincontinence; hospitalization indicated; \nlimiting self-care activities of daily \nliving] lasting ≤ 2 days \n\n• Adjust anti-diarrhoeal treatment \n• Diet modifications \n• Fluid intake of ~2 L should be maintained to \n\navoid dehydration \n• Once event resolves to Grade 0-1 or baseline, \n\nconsider restarting anti-diarrhoeal prophylaxis, if \nappropriate with each subsequent Nerlynx \nadministration (refer to section 4.4).  \n\n\n\n4 \n\nSeverity of diarrhoea* Action \n\n• Any grade with complicated features† \n• Grade 2 diarrhoea lasting 5 days or \n\nlonger‡ \n• Grade 3 diarrhoea lasting between \n\n2 days and 3 weeks‡ \n\n• Interrupt Nerlynx treatment \n• Diet modifications \n• Fluid intake of ~2 L should be maintained to \n\navoid dehydration \n• If diarrhoea resolves to Grade 0-1 in one week or \n\nless, then resume Nerlynx treatment at the same \ndose.  \n\n• If diarrhoea resolves to Grade 0-1 in longer than \none week, then resume Nerlynx treatment at \nreduced dose (see Table 1). \n\n• Once event resolves to Grade 0-1 or baseline, \nconsider restarting anti-diarrhoeal prophylaxis, if \nappropriate with each subsequent Nerlynx \nadministration (refer to section 4.4). \n\n• If grade 3 diarrhoea persists longer than 3weeks, \ndiscontinue Nerlynx permanently. \n\n• Grade 4 diarrhoea [life-threatening \nconsequences; urgent intervention \nindicated] \n\n• Permanently discontinue Nerlynx treatment \n\n• Diarrhoea recurs to Grade 2 or higher \nat 120 mg per day \n\n• Permanently discontinue Nerlynx treatment \n\n* Per CTCAE v4.0 \n† Complicated features include dehydration, fever, hypotension, renal failure, or Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia \n‡ Despite being treated with optimal medical therapy \n \nDose modifications for hepatotoxicity \nGuidelines for dose adjustment of Nerlynx in the event of liver toxicity are shown in Table 4. \n(see Section 4.4). \n \n\nTable 4: Dose modifications for hepatotoxicity \n\nSeverity of hepatotoxicity*  Action \n\n• Grade 3 ALT (>5-20 x ULN) \nOR \n\n• Grade 3 bilirubin (>3-10 x ULN) \n\n• Stop Nerlynx until recovery to Grade 0-1 \n• Evaluate alternative causes \n• Resume Nerlynx at the next lower dose level if \n\nrecovery to Grade 0-1 occurs within 3 weeks. If \nGrade 3 ALT or bilirubin occurs again despite \none dose reduction, permanently discontinue \nNerlynx. \n\n• If grade 3 hepatotoxicity persists longer than 3 \nweeks, discontinue Nerlynx permanently \n\n• Grade 4 ALT (>20 x ULN) \nOR \n\n• Grade 4 bilirubin (>10 x ULN) \n\n• Permanently discontinue Nerlynx \n• Evaluate alternative causes \n\nULN=Upper Limit Normal; ALT= Alanine Aminotransferase  \n*  Per CTCAE v4.0 \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nMissed dose \nMissed doses should not be replaced and treatment should resume with the next scheduled daily dose \n(see Section 4.9). \n \nGrapefruit and pomegranate  \nConcomitant administration of neratinib with grapefruit or pomegranate /grapefruit or \npomegranate juice is not recommended (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.5) \n \nUse of CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors \nIf the inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce Nerlynx dose: \n\n- to 40 mg (one 40 mg tablet) taken once daily with a strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor. \n- to 40 mg (one tablet) taken once daily with a moderate CYP3A4/P-gp. If well tolerated, \n\nincrease to 80 mg for at least 1 week, then to 120 mg for at least 1 weeks, and to 160 mg as a \nmaximal daily dose. Patient should be monitored carefully, especially GI effect including \ndiarrhea and hepatotoxicity.  \n\nAfter discontinuation of a strong or moderate CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor, resume previous dose of \nNerlynx 240 mg (see Section 4.4, Section 4.5 and Section 5.2).  \n \nH2-receptor antagonists and antacids \nIf  H2-receptor antagonists are used, Nerlynx should be taken at least 2 hours before or 10 hours after \nthe intake of the H2-receptor antagonist. Separate dosing of Nerlynx and antacids by at least 3 hours \nshould be applied (see Section 4.4, Section 4.5 and Section 5.2). \n \nSpecial populations  \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Nerlynx has not \nbeen studied in patients with severe renal impairment including patients on dialysis. Treatment of \npatients with severe renal impairment or on dialysis is not recommended (see Section 5.2). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with Child-Pugh A or B (mild to moderate) hepatic \nimpairment (see Section 5.2). \n \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required. There is no data in patients ≥85 years of age. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Nerlynx in the paediatric population in the indication breast cancer. \n \nMethod of administration \nNerlynx is for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole preferably with water and should not \nbe crushed or dissolved, and should be taken with food, preferably in the morning (see Section 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in Section 6.1. \n \nCo-administration with the following medical products that are strong inducers of the CYP3A4/P-gp \nisoform of cytochrome P450, such as (see Section 4.5 and Section 5.2): \n\n• carbamazepine, phenytoin (antiepileptics) \n• St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (herbal product) \n• rifampicin (antimycobacterial) \n\n \nSevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) (see Section 5.2). \n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDiarrhoea \nDiarrhoea has been reported during treatment with Nerlynx (see Section 4.2 and Section 4.8). The \ndiarrhoea may be severe and associated with dehydration. \n \nDiarrhoea generally occurs early during the first or second week of treatment with Nerlynx and may \nbe recurrent. \n \nPatients should be instructed to initiate prophylactic treatment with an anti-diarrhoeal medicinal \nproduct with the first dose of Nerlynx, and maintain regular dosing of the anti-diarrhoeal medicinal \nproduct during the first 1-2 months of Nerlynx treatment, titrating to 1-2 bowel movements per day. \n \nElderly \nElderly patients (≥65 years of age) are at a higher risk of renal insufficiency and dehydration which \nmay be a complication of diarrhoea and these patients should be carefully monitored. \n \nPatients with a significant chronic gastrointestinal disorder \nPatients with a significant chronic gastrointestinal disorder with diarrhoea as a major symptom were \nnot included in the pivotal study, and should be carefully monitored. \n \nRenal impairment \nPatients with renal impairment are at a higher risk of complications of dehydration if they develop \ndiarrhoea, and these patients should be carefully monitored (see Section 4.2 and Section 5.2).  \n \nLiver function \nHepatotoxicity has been reported in patients treated with Nerlynx. Liver function tests including \nalanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin should be \nmonitored at 1 week, then monthly for the first 3 months and every 6 weeks thereafter while on \ntreatment or as clinically indicated (see Section 4.2). \n \nPatients who experience ≥ Grade 3 diarrhoea requiring IV fluid treatment or any signs or symptoms of \nhepatotoxicity, such as worsening of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, right upper quadrant pain or  \ntenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia, should be evaluated for changes in liver function tests. \nFractionated bilirubin and prothrombin time should also be collected during hepatotoxicity evaluation. \n \nLeft ventricular function \nLeft ventricular dysfunction has been associated with HER2 inhibition. Nerlynx has not been studied \nin patients with less than lower limit of normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or with \nsignificant cardiac history. In patients with known cardiac risk factors, conduct cardiac monitoring, \nincluding assessment of LVEF, as clinically indicated. \n \nProton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists and antacids \nTreatments that increase gastrointestinal pH may lower the absorption of neratinib, thus decreasing \nsystemic exposure. Co-administration with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is not recommended (see \nSection 4.5 and Section 5.2). \nIn case of H2-receptor antagonists or antacids, modalities of administration should be adapted (see \nSection 4.2, Section 4.5 and Section 5.2). \n \nPregnancy \nNeratinib may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women (see Section 4.6). \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nNerlynx is associated with skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Patients with symptomatic skin and \nsubcutaneous tissue disorders should be carefully monitored (see Section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nConcomitant treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp \nConcomitant treatment with strong or moderate CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors is not recommended due \nto risk of increased exposure to neratinib. If the inhibitor can not be avoided, Nerlynx dose adjustment \nshould be applied (see Section 4.2, Section 4.5 and Section 5.2). \n \nGrapefruit or pomegranate juice should be avoided during treatment with Nerlynx (see Section 4.2 \nand Section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant treatment with moderate inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp \nConcomitant treatment with moderate CYP3A4 and P-gp inducer is not recommended as it may lead \nto a loss of neratinib efficacy (see Section 4.5 and Section 5.2). \n \nConcomitant treatment with substrates of P-gp \nPatients who are treated concomitantly with therapeutic agents with a narrow therapeutic window \nwhose absorption involves P-gp transporters in the gastrointestinal tract should be carefully monitored \n(see Section 4.5 and Section 5.2). \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other substances on neratinib \n \nNeratinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and is a P-gp substrate. \n \nCYP3A4/P-gp inducers \nClinical study demonstrated that concomitant use of strong CYP3A4/P-gp inducers significantly \ndecreased neratinib exposure, therefore concurrent use of neratinib with strong CYP3A4/P-gp \ninducers is contraindicated (e.g. strong inducers: phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, or herbal \npreparations containing St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)). Concurrent use of neratinib with \nmoderate CYP3A4/P-gp inducers is not recommended as it may also lead to lose of efficacy (e.g. \nmoderate inducers: bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, phenobarbital, primidone, dexamethasone) (see \nSection 4.3 and Section 5.2). \n \nCYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors \nClinical study and model-based predictions have demonstrated that concomitant use of strong or \nmoderate CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors significantly increased neratinib systemic exposure, therefore, \nconcomitant use of neratinib with strong and moderate CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors is not \nrecommended (e.g. strong inhibitors: atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, \nsaquinavir, lopinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, troleandomycin, voriconazole, \nand cobicistat; moderate inhibitors: ciprofloxacin,  cyclosporine, diltiazem, fluconazole, \nerythromycin, fluvoxamine and verapamil).  If the inhibitor can not be avoided, Nerlynx dose \nadjustement shoud be applied (see Section 4.2, Section 4.4 and Section 5.2). \n \nGrapefruit/pomegranate or grapefruit/pomegranate juice may also increase neratinib plasma \nconcentrations and should be avoided (see Section 4.2 and Section 4.4). \n \nProton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists and antacids \nThe in-vitro solubility of neratinib is pH-dependent. Concomitant treatment with substances that \nincrease gastric pH may lower the absorption of neratinib, thus decreasing systemic exposure. Co-\nadministration with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is not recommended (e.g. omeprazole or \nlansoprazole) (see Section 4.4 and Section 5.2). \n \nNerlynx should be taken at least 2 hours before or 10 hours after the intake of the H2-receptor \nantagonist (see Section 4.2, Section 4.4 and Section 5.2). \nSeparate dosing of Nerlynx and antacids by at least 3 hours (see Section 4.2, Section 4.4 and Section \n5.2). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nAntidiarreal loperamide \nClinical study have demonstrated that there were no clinically significant differences in the \nexposure of subjects to neratinib with or without concurrent dosing with loperamide (see Section \n5.2).  \n \nEffects of neratinib on other substances \n \nHormonal contraceptives \nIt is currently unknown whether Nerlynx reduces the effectiveness of systemically acting hormonal \ncontraceptives. Therefore, women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives should add a \nbarrier method (see Section 4.6). \n \nP-glycoprotein efflux transporters \nIn-vitro studies demonstrated that neratinib is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux \ntransporters. This has been confirmed by clinical study using digoxin as probe substrate leading to an \nincrease of 54 and 32% in Cmax and AUC, respectively. This might be clinically relevant for \npatients who are treated concomitantly with therapeutic agents with a narrow therapeutic window \nwhose absorption involves P-gp transporters in the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. digoxin, colchicine, \ndabigatran, phenytoin, statins, cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, tacrolimus). They should be \ncarefully monitored (see Section 4.4 and Section 5.2). \n \nBreast cancer resistance protein efflux transporter \nNeratinib may inhibit breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) at intestinal level as suggested by in \nvitro studies. A clinical study with BCRP substrates has not been conducted. As co-administration of \nneratinib with BCRP substrates may lead to an increase of their exposure, patients who are treated \nwith BCRP substrates (e.g., rosuvastatin, sulfasalazine and irinotecan) should be monitored carefully \n(Section 5.2). \n \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in females and males \nBased on findings in animals, neratinib may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women. \nWomen should avoid becoming pregnant while taking Nerlynx and for up to 1 month after ending \ntreatment. Therefore, women of child-bearing potential must use highly effective contraceptive \nmeasures while taking Nerlynx and for 1 month after stopping treatment. \n \nIt is currently unknown whether neratinib may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting \nhormonal contraceptives, and therefore women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives \nshould add a barrier method. \n \nMen should use a barrier method of contraception during treatment and for 3 months after stopping \ntreatment. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of Nerlynx in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nembryo-foetal lethality and foetal morphological anomalies (see Section 5.3). The potential risk for \nhumans is unknown. Nerlynx should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the \nwoman requires treatment with neratinib. \n \nIf neratinib is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking Nerlynx, the \npatient should be informed of the potential hazard to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether neratinib is excreted in human milk. A risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be \nexcluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Nerlynx, \n\n\n\n9 \n\ntaking into account the importance of Nerlynx to the mother and the benefit of breast-feeding to the \nchild. \n \nFertility \nNo fertility studies in women or men have been conducted. No significant changes in fertility \nparameters in male and female rats were detected in dosing up to 12 mg/kg/day (see Section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNerlynx has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue, dizziness, \ndehydration, and syncope have been reported as adverse reactions with neratinib. The clinical status \nof the patient should be considered when assessing the patient’s ability to perform tasks that require \njudgment, motor, or cognitive skills. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most common adverse reactions of any grade were diarrhoea (93.6%), nausea (42.5%), fatigue \n(27.3%), vomiting (26.8%), abdominal pain (22.7%), rash (15.4%), decreased appetite (13.7%), \nabdominal pain upper (13.2%), stomatitis (11.2%), and muscle spasms (10.0%). \n \nThe most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions were diarrhoea (Grade 3, 36.9% and Grade 4, 0.2%) \nand vomiting (Grade 3, 3.4% and Grade 4, 0.1%). \n \nAdverse reactions reported as serious included diarrhoea (1.9%), vomiting (1.3%), dehydration \n(1.1%), nausea (0.5%), alanine aminotransferase increased (0.4%), aspartate aminotransferase \nincreased (0.4%), abdominal pain (0.3%), fatigue (0.3%) and decreased appetite (0.2%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe table below lists adverse reactions observed with neratinib based on the assessment of pooled \ndata from 1,710 patients. \n \nThe MedDRA frequency convention and system organ class database has been utilised for the \nclassification of frequency:  \nVery common (≥ 1/10) \nCommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) \nUncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100)  \nRare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000)  \nVery rare (< 1/10,000) \nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nTable 5: Adverse drug reactions due to Nerlynx in monotherapy breast cancer \nstudies \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse Drug Reaction \nInfections and infestations Common Urinary tract infection \nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nVery Common Decreased appetite \nCommon Dehydration \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders Common Epistaxis \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery Common \n\nDiarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, abdominal \npain, abdominal pain upper, and \nstomatitis1 \n\nCommon Abdominal distension, dry mouth and dyspepsia \n\n\n\n10 \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse Drug Reaction \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Common \nAlanine aminotransferase increased, and \naspartate aminotransferase increased \n\nUncommon Blood bilirubin increased \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nVery Common Rash2 \n\nCommon Nail disorder\n3,  skin fissures and dry \n\nskin \nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders Very Common Muscle spasms \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Common Blood creatinine increased Uncommon Renal failure  \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions Very common Fatigue \n\nInvestigations Common Weight decreased \n1 Includes stomatitis, aphthous stomatitis, mouth ulceration, oral mucosal blistering, and mucosal \ninflammation. \n2 Includes rash, rash erythematous, rash follicular, rash generalised, rash pruritic, and rash pustular. \n3 Includes nail disorder, paronychia, onychoclasis, and nail discolouration. \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nDiarrhoea \nOf the 1,660 patients treated with Nerlynx monotherapy without loperamide prophylaxis, 94.6% \nexperienced at least 1 episode of diarrhoea. Grade 3 diarrhoea was reported in 37.5% of Nerlynx \npatients. 0.2% of patients had diarrhoea classified as Grade 4. Diarrhoea led to hospitalisation in 1.9% \nof Nerlynx-treated patients. \n \nDiarrhoea generally occurred in the first month, with 83.6% of patients reporting this toxicity in the \nfirst week, 46.9% in the second week, 40.2% in the third week and 43.2% in the fourth week (median \ntime to first onset was 2 days). \n \nThe median duration of a single episode of any grade diarrhoea was 2 days. The median cumulative \nduration of any grade diarrhoea was 59 days and the median cumulative duration of Grade 3 diarrhoea \nwas 5 days. \nDiarrhoea was also the most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation, 14.4 % of patients \ntreated with Nerlynx without loperamide prophylaxis discontinued treatment due to diarrhoea. Dose \nreductions occurred in 24.7% of Nerlynx-treated patients. \n \nRash \nIn the Nerlynx monotherapy group, 16.7% of patients experienced rash. The incidence of Grade 1 and \nGrade 2 was 13.3% and 2.9% respectively; 0.4% of Nerlynx-treated patients experienced Grade 3 \nrash. \n \nNail disorders \nIn the Nerlynx monotherapy group, 7.8% patients experience nail disorders. The incidence of Grade 1 \nand Grade 2 was 6.2% and 1.4% respectively. There were 0.2% of Nerlynx treated patients who \nexperienced Grade 3 nail disorder. \n \nBoth rash and nail disorders led to treatment discontinuation in 0.6% of Nerlynx-treated patients. \n \nHepatotoxicity \nHepatic-associated adverse reactions in the pivotal phase III study, ExteNET (3004), were reported \nmore frequently in the Nerlynx arm compared to the placebo arm (12.4% vs. 6.6%), due primarily to \nalanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (8.5% vs. 3.2%), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \nincreased (7.4 vs 3.3%) and blood alkaline phosphatase increased (2.1% vs. 1.1%). Grade 3 adverse \nreactions were reported in 1.6% vs 0.5% and Grade 4 adverse reactions were reported in 0.2% vs. \n0.1%, Nerlynx- and placebo-treated patients, respectively. Grade 3 ALT increased was reported in \n\n\n\n11 \n\n1.1% vs 0.2% and Grade 4 ALT increased was reported in 0.2% vs 0.0% of Nerlynx- vs placebo-\ntreated patients. Grade 3 AST increased was reported in 0.5% vs 0.3% and Grade 4 AST increased \nwas reported in 0.2% vs 0.0%, of Nerlynx- vs placebo-treated patients. There was no Grade 3 or 4 \nadverse reactions of blood bilirubin increased. \n \nOther special populations \n \nElderly \nIn the pivotal phase III study, ExteNET (3004), the mean age was 52 years in the Nerlynx arm, \n1236 patients were <65 years, 172 were ≥65 years, of whom 25 were 75 years or older. \n \nThere was a higher frequency of treatment discontinuations due to adverse reactions in the ≥65 years \nage group than <65 years age group; in the Nerlynx arm, the respective percentages were 44.8% \ncompared with 25.2%, respectively. \n \nThe incidence of serious adverse reactions in the Nerlynx arm vs placebo arm was 7.0% vs. 5.7% \n(<65 years-old) and 9.9% vs. 8.1% (≥65 years-old). The serious adverse reactions most frequently \nreported in the ≥65 years-old group were vomiting (2.3%), diarrhoea (1.7%), dehydration (1.2%), and \nrenal failure (1.2%). \n \nTreatment-emergent adverse reactions leading to hospitalisation in the Nerlynx arms versus the \nplacebo arm was 6.3% vs 4.9% in the <65 years-old group and 8.7% vs. 8.1% in the ≥65 years-old \ngroup. \n \nEffect of race  \nIn the pivotal phase III study, ExteNET (3004), the frequency of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events \n(TEAEs) in the Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders System Organ Class (SOC) in Asian patients treated \nwith Nerlynx was higher than in Caucasian patients (56.4% vs. 34.5%) but comparable in placebo \npatients (24.9% vs. 22.8%). Pooled safety data of 1710 patients treated with Nerlynx monotherapy \nshowed a higher incidence of dermatologic toxicities in Asian patients (57.1%) versus Caucasian \npatients (34.6%). \n \nIn the analysis of pooled safety data, the majority of TEAEs in the Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders \nSOC in Asians were Grade 1 (43.3%) and Grade 2 (12.3%); in Caucasians, the incidence of Grade 1 \nand Grade 2 events was 25.6% and 7.8%, respectively. The frequency of Grade 3 events was similar \nbetween Asians and Caucasians (1.6% vs. 1.0%). There was no difference in frequency of SAEs in \nthe Skin SOC between Asian and Caucasian subgroups. The most common TEAEs in the Skin SOC \nthat occurred more frequently in Asian patients than in Caucasian patients were rash (29.4% vs. \n13.5%), Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (9.9% vs. 1.0%), and dermatitis acneiform (6.0 \nvs. 1.0%). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no specific antidote, and the benefit of haemodialysis in the treatment of Nerlynx overdose is \nunknown. In the event of an overdose, administration should be withheld and general supportive \nmeasures undertaken. \n \nIn the clinical trial setting, adverse reactions associated with overdose were most commonly \ndiarrhoea, with or without nausea, vomiting and dehydration. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nIn a dose escalation study in healthy volunteers, single oral doses of Nerlynx up to 800 mg were \nadministered. The frequency and severity of gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea, abdominal pain, \nnausea and vomiting) appeared to be dose-related. Single doses of Nerlynx greater than 800 mg have \nnot been administered in the clinical studies. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, protein kinase \ninhibitors, ATC code: L01XE45 \n \nMechanism of action \nNeratinib is an irreversible pan–erythroblastic leukaemia viral oncogene homolog (ERBB) tyrosine \nkinase inhibitor (TKI) that blocks mitogenic growth factor signal transduction through covalent, high \naffinity binding to the ATP binding site of 3 epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs): EGFR \n(encoded by ERBB1), HER2 (encoded by ERBB2), and HER4 (encoded by ERBB4) or their active \nheterodimers with HER3 (encoded by ERBB3). This results in sustained inhibition of these growth \npromoting pathways with HER2-amplified or over-expressed, or HER2-mutant breast cancers. \nNeratinib binds to the HER2 receptor, reduces EGFR and HER2 autophosphorylation, downstream \nMAPK and AKT signaling pathways, and potently inhibits tumour cell proliferation in vitro. \nNeratinib inhibited EGFR and/or HER2-expressing carcinoma cell lines with a cellular IC50 \n<100 nM. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nIn the multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pivotal phase III study, ExteNET \n(3004), 2,840 women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer (as confirmed locally by assay) \nwho had completed adjuvant treatment with trastuzumab were randomised 1:1 to receive either \nNerlynx or placebo daily for one year. The median age in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population was \n52 years (59.9% was ≥50 years old, 12.3% was ≥65 years old); 81.0% were Caucasian, 2.6% black or \nAfrican American, 13.6% Asian and 2.9% other. At baseline, 57.7% had hormone receptor positive \ndisease (defined as ER-positive and/or PgR-positive), 27.2% were node negative, 41.5% had one to \nthree positive nodes and 29.4% had four or more positive nodes. Approximately 10% of patients had \nStage I tumours, approximately 40% had Stage II tumours and approximately 30% had Stage III \ntumours. Median time from the last adjuvant trastuzumab treatment to randomization was 4.5 months. \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was invasive disease-free survival (iDFS). Secondary endpoints of \nthe study included disease-free survival (DFS) including ductal carcinoma in situ (DFS-DCIS), time \nto distant recurrence (TTDR), distant disease-free survival (DDFS), cumulative incidence of central \nnervous system recurrence and overall survival (OS). \n \nThe primary analysis of the study after 2 years post-randomisation demonstrated that Nerlynx \nsignificantly reduced the risk of invasive disease recurrence or death by 33% (HR=0.67 with 95% CI \n(0.49, 0.91), two-sided p = 0.011) in the ITT population. \n\n\n\n13 \n\nTable 6: Primary 2-year efficacy results – ITT and hormone receptor positive \npopulations who were less than one year from completion of trastuzumab \ntherapy \n\nVariable Estimated 2 year event free rates1 (%) \n\nHazard \nratio \n\n(95% CI)2 \nP-value3 \n\n ITT population \n\n Nerlynx \n(N=1420) \n\nPlacebo \n(N=1420) \n\n  \n\nInvasive disease-free survival 94.2 91.9 0.67 \n(0.49, 0.91) \n\n0.011 \n\nDisease-free survival including ductal \ncarcinoma in situ \n\n94.2 91.3 0.62 \n(0.46, 0.84) \n\n0.002 \n\nDistant disease-free survival 95.3 94.0 0.75 \n(0.53, 1.06) \n\n0.110 \n\nTime to distant recurrence 95.5 94.2 0.74 \n(0.52, 1.06) \n\n0.102 \n\nCNS recurrence 0.92 1.16 – 0.586 \n\n Hormone receptor positive population who were \nless than one year from completion of trastuzumab \n\n Nerlynx \n(N=671) \n\nPlacebo \n(N=668) \n\nHazard \nratio \n\n(95% CI)4 \nP-value5 \n\nInvasive disease-free survival 95.3 90.9 0.50 \n(0.31, 0.78) \n\n0.003 \n\nDisease-free survival including ductal \ncarcinoma in situ \n\n95.3 90.1 0.45 \n(0.28, 0.71) \n\n<0.001 \n\nDistant disease-free survival 96.1 93.0 0.53 \n(0.31, 0.88) \n\n0.015 \n\nTime to distant recurrence 96.3 93.3 0.53 \n(0.30, 0.89) \n\n0.018 \n\nCNS recurrence 0.34 1.01 – 0.189 \nCNS = central nervous system. \n1 Event-free rates for all endpoints, except for CNS recurrence for which cumulative incidence is reported. \n2 Stratified Cox proportional hazards model  \n3 Stratified 2-sided log-rank test for all endpoints, except for CNS recurrence for which Gray’s method was \nused. \n4 Unstratified Cox proportional hazards model \n5 Unstratified 2-sided log-rank test for all endpoints, except for CNS recurrence for which Gray’s method was \nused. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier plot of invasive disease-free survival – hormone receptor \npositive population who were less than one year from completion of \ntrastuzumab therapy \n\n \n\n \n \nApproximately 75% of patients were re-consented for extended follow-up beyond 24 months. \nObservations with missing data were censored at the last date of assessment.

A single dose of 240 mg \nneratinib taken with food increased Cmax and AUC by approximately 17% and 23%, respectively, \ncompared with administration in the fasting state. A single oral dose of 240 mg neratinib taken with a \nmeal high in fat increased both Cmax and AUC by approximately 100%. In a mass balance study, the \ntotal recovery (urinary and fecal excretion) of intact neratinib and metabolites demonstrates that the \nfraction absorbed for neratinib is at least 10% and likely more than 20%. Moreover, model-based \npredictions suggested an overall absorbed fraction from the gut (fa) of 26%. \nIn vitro neratinib solubility is pH-dependent. Treatments that increase gastrointestinal pH may lower \nthe absorption of neratinib, thus decreasing systemic exposure.  \n \nDistribution \nBinding of neratinib to human plasma proteins, including covalent binding to human serum albumin \n(HSA), was greater than 98% and independently of the tested neratinib concentration. Neratinib \nbound predominantly to HSA and human alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AAG). Binding of M6 main \nmetabolite (M6) to human plasma proteins was  greater than 99% and independently of the tested M6 \nconcentrations. \nIn vitro studies demonstrated that neratinib is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (see Section 4.2, \nSection 4.3, Section 4.4 and Section 4.5) and BCRP. In vitro studies demonstrated that neratinib and \n\n\n\n16 \n\nits main metabolite M6 are not substrates of hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1*1a and OATP1B3 \nat 10 µM.  \n \nBiotransformation \nNeratinib is metabolised primarily in liver microsomes by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by flavin-\ncontaining monooxygenase (FMO). \n \nPreliminary metabolite profiling in human plasma indicates that after oral administration, neratinib \nundergoes oxidative metabolism through CYP3A4. Circulating metabolites include neratinib pyridine \nN-oxide (M3), N-desmethyl neratinib (M6), neratinib dimethylamine N-oxide (M7) and traces of \nhydroxyl neratinib N-oxide and neratinib bis-N-oxide (M11). Neratinib represents the most prominent \ncomponent in plasma and amongst circulating metabolites (M2, M3, M6, M7 and M11) none is above \n8% of neratinib plus metabolite total exposure after oral administration of neratinib. The neratinib \nmetabolites M3, M6, M7 and M11 were shown to have similar potencies to neratinib in either in vitro \nenzyme (binding assays) or cell based assays against cells expressing ERBB1, ERBB2 (HER2) and \nERBB4. \nBased on steady state exposures, neratinib provides the majority of pharmacological activity (73%), \nwith 20% provided by exposure to M6, 6% provided by M3, and negligible contribution (<1%) from \nM7 and M11 AUC. \n \nElimination \nFollowing single doses of neratinib, the mean apparent plasma half-life of neratinib was 17 hours in \npatients.  \n \nExcretion of neratinib is primary via the faeces \nFollowing the administration of a single radiolabelled dose of 240 mg neratinib oral solution, 95.5% \nand 0.96% of the administered dose was recovered in the faeces and urine, respectively.  \n \nThe excretion was rapid and complete, with most of the dose recovered in faeces within 48 hours and \n96.5% of total radioactivity recovered in excreta after 8 days.  \nUnchanged neratinib was the most abundant species in excreta accounting for 62.1% of total dose \nrecovered in excreta. The most abundant metabolites in faeces were M6 (19.7% of administered \ndose), followed by M2, M3 and M7, all below 10% of administered dose.  \n \nMedicinal product interactions \n \nEffect of CYP3A4/P-gp inducer on neratinib \nFollowing concomitant administration of 240 mg neratinib with repeated doses of 600 mg rifampicin, \na strong CYP3A4/P-gp inducer, neratinib exposures were significantly decreased by 76% and 87% for \nCmax and AUC, respectively, compared with neratinib administration alone (see Section 4.3 and \nSection 4.5). \n \nEffect of CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor on neratinib \nCo-administration of a single oral dose of 240 mg of neratinib in the presence of ketoconazole \n(400 mg once daily for 5 days), a strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor, increased neratinib systemic \nexposure by 3.2- and 4.8-fold for Cmax and AUC, respectively, compared with neratinib administered \nalone.  \nModel-based predictions suggested that co-administration of a single oral dose of 240 mg of neratinib \nin the presence of fluconazole (200 mg once daily for 8 days), a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, \nincreased neratinib systemic exposure by 1.3- and 1.7-fold for Cmax and AUC, compared with \nneratinib administered alone. \nModel-based predictions suggested that co-administration of a single oral dose of 240 mg of neratinib \nin the presence of verapamil (120 mg twice daily for 8 days), a moderate CYP3A4/strong P-gp \ninhibitor, increased neratinib systemic exposure by 3.0- and 4.0-fold for Cmax and AUC, compared \nwith neratinib administered alone (see Section 4.2, Section 4.4 and Section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nEffect of gastric pH modifiers on neratinib \nCo-administration of lansoprazole or ranitidine (1x300 mg) with a 240 mg single dose of neratinib in \nhealthy volunteers resulted in a decreased neratinib exposure by around 70% or 50%, respectively. \nThe magnitude of ranitidine interaction on neratinib AUC was reduced by around 25%, by staggering \nthe administration of ranitidine (2x150 mg) 2 hours after neratinib administration (see Section 4.2, \nSection 4.4 and Section 4.5). \n \nEffect of other treatment on neratinib \nThere were no apparent clinically relevant drug-drug interactions observed for neratinib when \nadministered concomitantly with capecitabine, paclitaxel, trastuzumab, vinorelbine, or antidiarrheals \n(loperamide) (see Section 4.5).  \n \nEffect of neratinib on CYP substrates  \nNeratinib and metabolite M6 were not potent direct inhibitors of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, \nor 3A4. Time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 by neratinib and M6 could not be \nexcluded. \nNeratinib did not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, or 3A4. \n \nEffect of neratinib on transporters  \nThere was no clinically relevant inhibition of human BSEP efflux transporter activity in vitro, with a \nreported IC50 value of > 10 µM. Neratinib at 10 µM appeared to inhibit the BCRP efflux transporter \nwhich could be clinically relevant at intestinal level (see Section 4.5).  \nIn in vitro studies, neratinib was an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporters, which was \nfurther confirmed in a clinical study. Multiple oral doses of neratinib 240 mg increase digoxin \nexposures (54 and 32% increase in Cmax and AUC, respectively) with no impact on its renal clearance \nlevel (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.5). \nNeratinib produced no inhibitory activity towards the uptake transporters, OATP1B1*1a, OATP1B3, \nOAT1, OAT3 and OCT2, with reported IC50 values were > 10µM. Neratinib produced inhibitory \nactivity in OCT1 uptake transporter, with an IC50 of 2.9 µM. \n \nSpecial population \n \nRenal impairment \nPharmacokinetic studies in patients with renal impairment or undergoing dialysis have not been \ncarried out. Population pharmacokinetic modelling revealed that creatinine clearance did not explain \nthe variability between patients, hence, no dose modifications are recommended for patients with mild \nto moderate renal impairment (see Section 4.2 and Section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNeratinib is extensively metabolised in the liver. In subjects with severe pre-existing hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh Class C) without cancer, the clearance of neratinib was decreased by 36% \nand exposure to neratinib increased by about 3-fold as compared to healthy volunteers (see Section \n4.2 and Section 4.3). \n \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to \nclinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: \n \nCarcinogenesis, mutagenesis \nNerlynx was neither clastogenic nor mutagenic in the standard battery of genotoxicity studies.  \n \nNeratinib metabolites M3, M6, M7 and M11 are negative in the standard battery of in vitro \ngenotoxicity studies. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nA 6-month carcinogenicity study in Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice and the rat 2-year data showed no signs \nof carcinogenic potential. \n \nReproductive toxicity \nIn rabbits, there were no effects on mating or the ability of animals to become pregnant, but embryo-\nfoetal lethality and foetal morphologic anomalies (e.g. domed head, dilation of brain ventricles and \nmisshapen anterior fontanelles and enlarged anterior and/or posterior fontanelles) were observed at \ndoses that may be considered to be clinically relevant. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n28 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nNerlynx 40 mg film-coated tablets \nneratinib \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of Section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See Section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Nerlynx is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Nerlynx \n3. How to take Nerlynx \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Nerlynx \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Nerlynx is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Nerlynx is \nNerlynx contains the active substance ‘neratinib’. It belongs to a group of medicines called ‘tyrosine \nkinase inhibitors’ used to block cancer cells and treat breast cancer.  \n \nWhat Nerlynx is used for \nNerlynx is used for patients who have early stage breast cancer which: \n- is human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2-positive) and \n- has previously been treated with another medicine called ‘trastuzumab’. \n \nThe ‘HER2 receptor’ is a protein found on the surface of cells in the body. It helps control how a \nhealthy breast cell grows. In HER2-positive breast cancer, the cancer cells have a large amount of \nHER2 receptors on their surface. This results in the cancer cells dividing and growing faster. \n \nBefore Nerlynx is used, your cancer must have been tested to show it is HER2-positive. You must \nalso have previously been treated with trastuzumab. \n \nHow Nerlynx works \nNerlynx works by blocking the HER2 receptors on the cancer cells. This helps to stop the cells from \ndividing and growing. \n \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Nerlynx \n \nDo not take Nerlynx \n- if you are allergic to neratinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nSection 6), \n- if you have a severe liver problem, \n- if you are taking rifampicin (a medicine for tuberculosis (TB)), \n- if you are taking carbamazepine or phenytoin (medicines for seizures), \n- if you are taking St. John’s wort (herbal product for depression).  \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Nerlynx. \n \nYou need to take an anti-diarrhoea medicine when you start Nerlynx \nNerlynx can cause diarrhoea early during treatment. You should take an anti-diarrhoea medicine so \nthat your diarrhoea does not become severe, and to prevent you from getting dehydrated during \ntreatment with Nerlynx.  \n \nTests and checks for liver problems \nNerlynx can cause changes in liver function – these are shown in blood tests. Your doctor will do \nblood tests before and during your treatment with Nerlynx. Your doctor will stop your treatment with \nNerlynx if your liver tests show severe problems. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not use in children under 18 years of age. The safety of Nerlynx and how effective it is has not \nbeen studied in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Nerlynx \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This is because Nerlynx can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other \nmedicines can affect the way Nerlynx works. \n \nIn particular tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n- rifampicin - a medicine for tuberculosis \n- carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin - medicines for seizures \n- St John’s wort - an herbal product for depression \n- ketoconazole, voriconazole,  itraconazole or fluconazole - medicines for fungal infections \n- erythromycin or clarithromycin - medicines for bacterial infections \n- protease inhibitors - antiviral medicines \n- nefazodone – a medicine to treat depression \n- diltiazem or verapamil - medicines for high blood pressure and chest pain \n- dabigatran or digoxin - a medicine for heart problems \n- rosuvastatin – a medicine to treat high cholesterolemia \n- irinotecan – a medicine used in colorectal cancers \n- sulfasalazine – an anti-inflammatory intestinal medicine \n- medicines for stomach problems such as: \n\n- lansoprazole, omeprazole or similar medicines called ‘proton pump inhibitors’ or PPIs \nare not recommended. \n\n- ranitidine, cimetidine or similar medicines called “H2 receptor antagonists”. Neratinib \nshould be taken 10 hours after the H2-receptor antagonist dosing and at least 2 hours \nbefore the next dose of the H2-receptor antagonist \n\n- antacid medicines - the dose of these medicines and Nerlynx should be separated by at \nleast 3 hours. \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking \nNerlynx. \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nNerlynx with food and drink \nDo not take grapefruit or pomegranate while you are taking Nerlynx – this includes eating them, \ndrinking the juice or taking a supplement that might contain them. This is because these fruits may \ninteract with Nerlynx and affect how the medicine works. \n \nPregnancy \nIf you are pregnant, the doctor will assess the potential benefit to you and risk to the foetus before \ngiving this medicine to you. If you become pregnant while taking this medicine, the doctor will assess \nthe potential benefit to you and the risk to the foetus, of continuing this medicine.   \n \nContraception \nWomen who can become pregnant must use an effective method of contraception, including a barrier \nmethod: \n- while taking Nerlynx and \n- for one month after treatment has finished. \n \nMen must use an effective barrier method of contraception such as a condom: \n- while taking Nerlynx and \n- for three months after treatment has finished. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTalk to your doctor before taking Nerlynx if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed because \nsmall amounts of this medicine may pass into your breast milk. Your doctor will discuss with you the \nbenefits and risks of taking Nerlynx during this time. \n \nDriving and using machines \nNerlynx has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. The side effects of \nNerlynx (for example, dehydration and dizziness resulting from diarrhoea, fatigue, and fainting) may \naffect how tasks that require judgment, motor or cognitive skills are carried out. \n \n \n3. How to take Nerlynx \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nHow much Nerlynx to take \nThe recommended dose of Nerlynx is 6 tablets once a day (a total of 240 mg). \n- Take the tablets with food. Do not crush or dissolve. Do not swallow the desiccant. \n- Take all the tablets with water, at about the same time each day, preferably in the morning. \n \nThe course of treatment is one year. \n \nYou need to take an anti-diarrhoea medicine when you start Nerlynx \nNerlynx can cause diarrhoea early during treatment unless anti-diarrhoea medicine is taken to prevent \nor reduce diarrhoea. Diarrhoea usually happens early in treatment with Nerlynx and may be severe, \ncausing you to get dehydrated.  \n- Start taking anti-diarrhoea medicine with the first dose of Nerlynx. \n- Your doctor will tell you how to take the anti-diarrhoea medicine. \n- Keep taking anti-diarrhoea medicine during the first one to two months of Nerlynx treatment. \n\nYour doctor will tell you if you need to keep taking anti-diarrhoea medicine after the first two \nmonths to control your diarrhoea.  \n\n- Your doctor will also tell you if you need to change the dose of Nerlynx because of diarrhoea. \n \nIf you take more Nerlynx than you should, contact a doctor or a hospital straight away. Take the \nmedicine pack with you. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nSome side effects associated with taking more Nerlynx than you should are: diarrhoea, nausea, \nvomiting and dehydration. \n \nIf you forget to take Nerlynx \n- If you forget a dose, wait until the next day before you take the next dose. \n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Nerlynx \n- Do not stop taking Nerlynx without talking to your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The \nfollowing side effects may happen with this medicine: \n \nDiarrhoea \nNerlynx can cause diarrhoea early during treatment unless anti-diarrhoeal medicines are taken to \nprevent or reduce diarrhoea. The diarrhoea may be severe, and you may get dehydrated. See Section 3 \nfor more information about the anti-diarrhoea medicine you need to take at the same time as Nerlynx. \n \nTalk to your doctor if: \n- you are having diarrhoea that does not go away - they can advise how to control your diarrhoea. \n- you feel dizzy or weak from diarrhoea - alternatively go to the hospital immediately. \n \nLiver problems \nNerlynx can cause changes in liver function - these are shown in blood tests. You may or may not \nhave signs or symptoms of liver problems (e.g., yellow skin and/or eyes, dark urine, or light-colour \nstools). Your doctor will do blood tests before and during your treatment with Nerlynx. Your doctor \nwill stop your treatment with Nerlynx if your liver tests show severe problems. \n \nOther side effects \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any of the following side effects: \n \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n- diarrhoea \n- stomach pain, feeling or being sick, low appetite \n- dry or inflamed mouth, including blisters or mouth ulcers \n- rash \n- muscle spasms or cramps \n- feeling very tired \n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n- burning sensation during urination and frequent, and urgent need to urinate, (may be symptoms \n\nof urinary tract infection)  \n- dehydration \n- nosebleed \n- mild stomach upset \n- dry mouth \n- changes in liver blood test results \n- nail problems including nail splitting or colour change \n- dry skin including cracked skin \n- changes in kidney function test \n- weight loss \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n- kidney failure \n- changes in liver blood test results (i.e., blood bilirubin increased) \n\n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any of the side effects above. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
