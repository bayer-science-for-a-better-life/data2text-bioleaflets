PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for infusion. \n \nThe powder is white to off-white. The solvent is a clear and colourless solution. \nThe reconstituted solution has an approximate osmolality of 279 mOsmol / kg and a pH of 7.0. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRespreeza is indicated for maintenance treatment, to slow the progression of emphysema in adults \nwith documented severe alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency (e.g. genotypes PiZZ, PiZ(null), \nPi(null,null), PiSZ). Patients are to be under optimal pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment \nand show evidence of progressive lung disease (e.g. lower forced expiratory volume per second \n\n\n\n 3 \n\n(FEV1) predicted, impaired walking capacity or increased number of exacerbations) as evaluated by a \nhealthcare professional experienced in the treatment of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nFirst infusions should be administered under the supervision of a healthcare professional experienced \nin the treatment of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency. Subsequent infusions can be administered by \na caregiver or by the patient (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of Respreeza is 60 mg / kg body weight (bw) administered once weekly. \n \nElderly population \nThe safety and efficacy of Respreeza in elderly patients (65 years of age or older) have not been \nestablished in specific clinical trials. \n \nPatients with renal or hepatic impairment \nNo special investigations have been performed. No alternative dose regimen can be recommended in \nthose patients. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Respreeza in the paediatric population (below 18 years) have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \nRespreeza should only be administered intravenously by infusion after reconstitution. \nThe powder must be reconstituted with water for injections (see instructions on reconstitution in \nsection 6.6) and administered using an intravenous administration set (supplied with the 4,000 and \n5,000 package). \n \nThe reconstituted solution should be infused intravenously at an infusion rate of about 0.08 ml / kg bw \n/ min. This infusion rate may be adjusted, based upon patient tolerability. The recommended dose of \n60 mg / kg bw will take approximately 15 minutes to infuse. \nOne vial of Respreeza is for single use only. \n \nFor detailed information regarding the administration of the reconstituted solution, see the instructions \nat the end of section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see also \n\nsection 4.4). \n\u2022 IgA deficient patients with known antibodies against IgA, due to the risk of severe \n\nhypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nThe recommended infusion rate given under section 4.2 should be adhered to. During the first \ninfusions, patient\u2019s clinical state, including vital signs, should be closely monitored throughout the \ninfusion period. If any reaction takes place that might be related to the administration of Respreeza, \nthe rate of infusion should be decreased or the administration should be stopped, as required by the \nclinical condition of the patient. If symptoms subside promptly after stopping, the infusion may be \nresumed at a lower rate that is comfortable for the patient. \n\n\n\n 4 \n\n \nHypersensitivity \nHypersensitivity reactions may occur, including in patients who have tolerated previous treatment with \nhuman alpha1-proteinase inhibitor. \n \nRespreeza may contain trace amounts of IgA. Patients with selective or severe IgA deficiency can \ndevelop antibodies to IgA and, therefore, have a greater risk of developing potentially severe \nhypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. \n \nSuspected allergic or anaphylactic type reactions may require immediate discontinuation of the \ninfusion, depending on the nature and severity of the reaction. In case of shock, emergency medical \ntreatment should be administered. \n \nHome-treatment / self-administration \nThere are limited data regarding the use of this medicinal product in home-treatment / self-\nadministration. \nPotential risks associated with home-treatment / self-administration are related to the handling and \nadministration of the medicinal product as well as to the handling of adverse reactions, particularly \nhypersensitivity. Patients should be informed of signs of hypersensitivity reactions. \n \nThe decision of whether a patient is suitable for home-treatment / self-administration is made by the \ntreating doctor, who should ensure appropriate training is provided (e.g. regarding reconstitution, use \nof Mix2Vial\u00ae set, assembly of intravenous tubing, infusion techniques, maintenance of a treatment \ndiary, identification of adverse reactions and measures to be taken in case such reactions occur) and \nthe use is reviewed at regular intervals. \n \nTransmissible agents \nStandard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from \nhuman blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma \npools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the \ninactivation / removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood \nor plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. \nThis also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens. \n \nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and for the non-enveloped hepatitis \nA (HAV) and parvovirus B19 virus. \n \nAppropriate vaccination (hepatitis A and B) should be considered for patients in regular/repeated \nreceipt of human plasma-derived proteinase inhibitors. \n \nSmoking \nTobacco smoke is an important risk factor for the development and progression of emphysema. \nTherefore, cessation of smoking and the avoidance of environmental tobacco smoke are strongly \nrecommended. \n \nSodium content \nRespreeza 1,000 mg powder and solvent for solution for infusion \nThis medicine contains approximately 37 mg (1.6 mmol) sodium per 1,000 mg Respreeza vial. This is \nequivalent to 1.9% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n \nRespreeza 4,000 mg powder and solvent for solution for infusion \nThis medicine contains approximately 149 mg (6.5 mmol) sodium per 4,000 mg Respreeza vial. This \nis equivalent to 7.4% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n \nRespreeza 5,000 mg powder and solvent for solution for infusion \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nThis medicine contains approximately 186 mg (8.1 mmol) sodium per 5,000 mg Respreeza vial. This \nis equivalent to 9.3% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n \nThat should be taken into consideration for patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nNo animal reproduction studies have been conducted with Respreeza and its safety for use in human \npregnancy has not been established in controlled clinical trials. Since alpha1-proteinase inhibitor is an \nendogenous human protein, it is considered unlikely that Respreeza will cause harm to the foetus when \ngiven at recommended doses. However, Respreeza should be given with caution to pregnant women. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether Respreeza / metabolites are excreted in human milk. The excretion of human \nalpha1-proteinase inhibitor in milk has not been studied in animals. A decision on whether to \ncontinue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with Respreeza should be \nmade, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of human alpha1-\nproteinase inhibitor therapy to the woman. \n \nFertility \nNo animal fertility studies have been conducted with Respreeza and its effect on human fertility has \nnot been established in controlled clinical trials. Since human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor is an \nendogenous human protein, no adverse effects on fertility are expected when given at recommended \ndoses. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nDizziness may occur following the administration of Respreeza (see section 4.8). Therefore, \nRespreeza may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions have been observed during the treatment. In the most serious \ncases, allergic reactions may progress to severe anaphylactic reactions even when the patient has \nshown no hypersensitivity to previous administrations (see section 4.4). \n \nFor safety information with respect to transmissible agents, see section 4.4. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe adverse reactions (ARs) collected from six clinical studies in 221 patients and post-marketing \nexperience are presented in the table below according to the MedDRA system organ classification \n(SOC and Preferred Term (PT) Level). Frequency per patient (based on six months of exposure during \nclinical trials) has been evaluated according to the following convention: common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000). The \nfrequency of ARs during post marketing only is considered as \u201cnot known (cannot be estimated from \nthe available data)\u201d. \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n  \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nFrequency of adverse reactions (ARs) in clinical studies and post-marketing experience with \nRespreeza  \n \n\nSystem organ class \n(SOC) Frequency of ARs \n\n Common \n(\u22651/100 to \n\n<1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to \n\n<1/100) \n\nVery rare \n(<1/10,000) Not known \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\n   Lymph node \npain \n\nImmune system disorders  Hypersensitivity \nreactions \n(including \ntachycardia, \nhypotension, \nconfusion, \nsyncope, oxygen \nconsumption \ndecreased and \npharyngeal \noedema) \n\nAnaphylactic \nreactions \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders Dizziness, \nheadache  \n\nParaesthesia Hypoaesthesia   \n\nEye disorders    Eye swelling \nVascular disorders  Flushing   \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nDyspnoea    \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea   Lip swelling \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n Urticaria, rash \n(including \nexfoliative and \ngeneralized) \n\nHyperhidrosis, \npruritus \n\nFace \nswelling \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\n Asthenia, \ninfusion-site \nreactions \n(including \ninfusion site \nhematoma) \n\nChest pain, \nchills, pyrexia \n\n \n\n \nPaediatric Population \nSafety and effectiveness in the paediatric population have not been established. No data are available. \n \nGeriatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Respreeza in elderly patients (65 years of age or older) have not been \nestablished in clinical trials. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nConsequences of overdose are unknown. \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nIn the event of overdose, the patient should be observed closely for the occurrence of adverse reactions \nand supportive measures should be available as necessary. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antihemorrhagics, proteinase inhibitor, ATC code: B02AB02 \n \nHuman alpha1-proteinase inhibitor is a normal constituent of human blood. Human alpha1-proteinase \ninhibitor has a molecular weight of 51 kDa and belongs to the family of serine protease inhibitors. \n \nMechanism of action \nHuman alpha1-proteinase inhibitor is understood to be the primary anti-protease in the lower \nrespiratory tract, where it inhibits neutrophil elastase (NE). Normal healthy individuals produce \nsufficient alpha1-proteinase inhibitor to control the NE produced by activated neutrophils and are thus \nable to prevent inappropriate proteolysis of lung tissue by NE. Conditions that increase neutrophil \naccumulation and activation in the lung, such as respiratory infection and smoking, will in turn \nincrease levels of NE. However, individuals deficient in endogenous alpha1-proteinase inhibitor are \nunable to maintain appropriate antiprotease defence and experience more rapid proteolysis of the \nalveolar walls starting prior to the development of clinically evident chronic obstructive lung disease \nin the third or fourth decade. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nThe administration of Respreeza increases and maintains serum levels and lung epithelial lining fluid \n(ELF) levels of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor leading to a slowdown of the progression of emphysema. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nRAPID studies \nThe safety and efficacy of Respreeza was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled, multi-center study (RAPID) followed by a 2-year open-label extension study (RAPID \nextension study). A total of 180 subjects with alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency characterized by a \nserum alpha1-proteinase inhibitor level < 11 \u03bcM (i.e. < 50 mg/dL as determined by nephelometry) and \nclinical evidence of emphysema, were randomized to receive a weekly 60 mg / kg bw intravenous \ndose of either Respreeza (93 subjects) or placebo (87 subjects) for up to 24 months. The subjects \nranged in age from 31 to 67 years (median age 54 years) with average baseline alpha1-proteinase \ninhibitor levels of approximately 6.15 \u00b5M, and average volume-adjusted CT lung density of 47 g/L \n/50 g/L for Respreeza and placebo subjects, respectively. \nOne-hundred forty subjects (76 Respreeza-treated subjects and 64 subjects treated with placebo in the \nRAPID Study) continued into the RAPID extension study and were treated with a weekly 60 mg / kg \nbw intravenous dose of Respreeza for up to 24 months. \n \nThe studies investigated the effect of Respreeza on the progression of emphysema, assessed by the \ndecline of lung density, measured by computer tomography (CT). \nRespreeza-treated subjects demonstrated a consistent pattern of slower lung density decline than those \nreceiving placebo (see Figure 1). The annual rate of lung density decline, as measured by CT scan at \ntotal lung capacity (TLC) over 2 years was lower with Respreeza (-1.45 g/L) as compared with \nplacebo (-2.19 g/L), reflecting a 34% reduction (p = 0.017, 1-sided). \n \nThe RAPID extension study demonstrated that the reduced rate in lung density decline was maintained \nfor subjects continuously treated with Respreeza for 4 years (see Figure 1). \n\n  \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nFigure 1: Changes in Lung Density (TLC) from baseline in the RAPID and RAPID Extension \nstudies \n\n \n\n \n \nSingle doses of 120 mg / kg bw have been administered to 137 subjects treated with Respreeza. \n \nPediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nRespreeza in all subsets of the pediatric population in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \ndue to alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency (see section 4.2 for information on pediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFour clinical studies were conducted with Respreeza in 89 subjects (59 males and 30 females) to \nevaluate the effect of Respreeza on serum levels of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor. The subjects ranged in \nage from 29 to 68 years (median age 49 years). At screening, serum alpha1-proteinase inhibitor levels \nwere between 3.2 and 10.1 \u00b5M (mean of 5.6 \u00b5M). \n \nA double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, crossover pharmacokinetic study was conducted in \n13 males and 5 females with alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency, ranging in age from 36 to \n66 years. Nine subjects received a single 60 mg / kg bw dose of Respreeza followed by a comparator \nproduct, and 9 subjects received comparator product followed by a single 60 mg / kg bw dose of \nRespreeza, with a wash-out period of 35 days between doses. A total of 13 post-infusion serum \nsamples were taken at various time points up to Day 21. Table 1 shows the mean results for the \nRespreeza pharmacokinetic parameters. \n \n\nTable 1: Pharmacokinetic parameters for alpha1-proteinase inhibitor following a single \n60 mg / kg bw dose of Respreeza \n\nPharmacokinetic Parameter Mean (standard deviation)* \nArea under the curve (AUC0-\u221e) 144 (\u00b127) \u00b5M x day \nMaximum concentration (Cmax) 44.1 (\u00b110.8) \u00b5M \nTerminal half-life (t1/2\u00df) 5.1 (\u00b12.4) days \nTotal clearance 603 (\u00b1129) mL/day \nVolume of distribution at steady state 3.8 (\u00b11.3) L \n\n* n=18 subjects. \n \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted using data from 90 Respreeza-treated subjects \nfrom the RAPID trial. The population estimate of mean half-life was 6.8 days. The model predicted \nmean steady-state concentration was 21.8 \u00b5M after a 60 mg /kg bw / week dose. The population \n\n\n\n 9 \n\npharmacokinetic analysis did not indicate that there were any significant effects of age, gender, \nweight, or baseline serum antigenic alpha1-proteinase inhibitor concentrations on the clearance of \nRespreeza. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \nIn a double-blind, controlled clinical study to evaluate the safety and biochemical efficacy of \nRespreeza 44 subjects were randomized to receive 60 mg / kg bw intravenous dose of Respreeza once \nweekly for 24 weeks. The mean trough serum alpha1-proteinase inhibitor levels at steady state (weeks \n7-11) were maintained above 11 \u00b5M. The mean (standard deviation) of the steady state trough serum \nalpha1-proteinase inhibitor level for Respreeza-treated subjects was 17.7 \u00b5M (2.5). \nIn a subgroup of subjects enrolled in this study (10 Respreeza-treated subjects) broncho-alveolar \nlavage was performed. Epithelial lining fluid measurements (ELF) of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor levels \nshowed a consistent increase following treatment. ELF levels of antigenic alpha1-proteinase inhibitor \nand alpha1-proteinase inhibitor: NE complexes increased from baseline. Free elastase was \nimmeasurably low in all samples. \nFollowing the completion of the RAPID study, an analysis of achieved median alpha1-proteinase \ninhibitor levels and lung density decline was conducted. This analysis revealed an inverse linear \nrelationship between trough serum alpha1-proteinase inhibitor levels and the annual decline in lung \ndensity as measured by volume adjusted CT scans for subjects receiving 60 mg / kg bw intravenous \ndose of Respreeza. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe safety of Respreeza has been assessed in several preclinical studies. Non-clinical data reveal no \nspecial risk for humans based on safety pharmacology and short-term toxicity studies. Repeat dose \ntoxicity studies longer than 5 days, reproductive toxicity studies and carcinogenicity studies, have not \nbeen performed. Such studies are not considered meaningful due to the production of antibodies \nagainst the heterologous human protein in animals. Since human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor is a \nprotein and a physiological constituent of human blood, it is not expected to present carcinogenic, \ngenotoxic, or teratogenic effects. \n \n \n6.

Elevate the Respreeza vial/infusion container or hang on an infusion stand. \n3. Prime the drip chamber by squeezing it until the Respreeza solution has filled the chamber \n\nroughly half-way. \n4. Open the air vent cap of the IV infusion set. \n\n\n\n 13 \n\n5. Slowly open the roller clamp of the IV infusion set and let the Respreeza solution flow until it \nreaches the end of the tubing with no air bubbles.  \n\n6. Close the roller clamp. \n7. Disinfect the injection site with an antiseptic like an alcohol swab before carefully inserting the \n\nneedle into the vein. Make sure that there is no more air in the butterfly tube left. \n8. Connect the end of the IV infusion set to the butterfly set and open the roller clamp again. \n9. Infuse the reconstituted solution into the vein. The solution should be infused at an infusion rate \n\nof about 0.08 ml per kg body weight each min, as determined by your response and your \ncomfort. The recommended dose of 60 mg per kg of body weight will take approximately 15 \nminutes to infuse. \n\n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or healthcare professional. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or healthcare professional. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What Respreeza is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Respreeza \n3. How to use Respreeza \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Respreeza \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Respreeza is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Respreeza is \n \nThis medicine contains the active substance human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, which is a normal \ncomponent of the blood and is found in the lung. There, its main function is to protect the lung tissue \nby limiting the action of a certain enzyme, called neutrophil elastase. Neutrophil elastase can cause \ndamage if its action is not controlled (for example, in case you have an alpha1-proteinase inhibitor \ndeficiency). \n \n \nWhat Respreeza is used for \n \nThis medicine is used in adults with known severe alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency (an inherited \ncondition also called alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency) who have developed a lung condition called \nemphysema. \n \nEmphysema develops when the lack of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor results in a condition in which \nneutrophil elastase is not being properly controlled, damaging the tiny air sacs in the lungs through \nwhich oxygen passes into the body. Because of this damage, the lungs do not work properly. \n \nUsing this medicine regularly increases the blood and lung levels of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, thus \nslowing the progression of emphysema. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Respreeza \n \nDo NOT take Respreeza \n\u2022 if you are allergic to human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n\n\n\n 41 \n\n\u2022 if you have been found to have a deficiency of certain blood proteins called immunoglobulin \ntype A (IgA) and have developed antibodies against them. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n \n\uf0e8 Talk to your doctor or healthcare professional before using Respreeza. \n \nInformation on allergic reactions: when slowing or stopping the infusion may be required? \nYou may be allergic to human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor even if you have previously received human \nalpha1-proteinase inhibitors and had tolerated them well. In some cases, severe allergic reactions may \noccur. Your doctor will inform you about signs of allergic reactions (for example chills, flushing, \nfaster heartbeat, fall in blood pressure, light-headedness, rash, hives, itching, difficulty in breathing or \nswallowing as well as swelling of your hands, face, or mouth) (see also section 4). \n\uf0e8 Tell your doctor or healthcare professional immediately if you notice such reactions during the \n\ninfusion of this medicine. Depending on the nature and severity of the reaction, your doctor may \ndecide whether to slow or stop the infusion completely and start the appropriate treatment. \n\n\uf0e8 In case of self-administration / home-treatment, stop the infusion immediately and contact your \ndoctor or healthcare professional. \n\n \nInformation on safety with respect to infections \nRespreeza is made from human blood plasma (this is the liquid part of the blood with the blood cells \nremoved). \nBecause blood can carry infections, when medicines are made from human blood or plasma certain \nmeasures are put in place to prevent these from being present in the medicine and passed on to \npatients. These include: \n\u2022 careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections \n\nare excluded, \n\u2022 the testing of samples of donated blood and plasma to try to avoid use of material with signs of \n\nvirus/infections, \n\u2022 the inclusion of steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove \n\nviruses. \n \nThe measures taken are considered effective for viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus \n(HIV), hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and parvovirus B19 virus. \n \nHowever, despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are \nadministered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to \nany unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections. \n \nYour doctor may recommend that you consider vaccination against hepatitis A and B if you \nregularly/repeatedly receive human plasma-derived proteinase inhibitors. \n \n\uf0e8 It is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Respreeza the name and batch \n\nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. \n \nSmoking \nSince tobacco smoke is an important risk factor for the development and progression of emphysema, \nyou are strongly advised to stop smoking and avoid passive smoking. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nThis medicine is not for use in children or adolescents below 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Respreeza \n \n\uf0e8 Tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you are taking, have recently taken or might take \n\nany other medicines. \n\n\n\n 42 \n\n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n \n\uf0e8 If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \n\nask your doctor or healthcare professional for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nSince alpha1-proteinase inhibitor is a normal component of human blood, recommended dose of this \nmedicine is not expected to cause harm to the developing foetus. However, as there is no information \navailable regarding the safety of Respreeza use during pregnancy, if you are pregnant, this medicine \nshould only be given to you with caution. \nIt is unknown whether Respreeza passes into human milk. If you are breast-feeding, your doctor will \ndiscuss with you the risks and benefits of taking this medicine. \nThere are no data concerning the effect on fertility but as alpha1-proteinase inhibitor is a normal \ncomponent of human blood, no adverse effects on fertility are expected if you use Respreeza at the \nrecommended dose. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nDizziness may occur after the administration of this medicine. If you experience dizziness, you should \nnot drive or use machines until the dizziness has passed (see section 4). \n \nRespreeza contains sodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains approximately 37 mg sodium per 1,000 mg Respreeza vial, 149 mg \nsodium per 4,000 mg Respreeza vial and 186 mg sodium per 5,000 mg Respreeza vial, equivalent to \n1.9%, 7.4% and 9.3% respectively, of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium \nfor an adult. Your doctor or healthcare professional will take that into consideration if you are on a \ncontrolled sodium diet. \n \n \n \n3. How to use Respreeza \n \nAfter reconstitution, Respreeza is given by infusion into a vein. A healthcare professional experienced \nin the treatment of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency will supervise the first infusions. \n \nHome treatment / Self-administration \nAfter the first infusions, you or your caregiver might also administer Respreeza, but only after \nreceiving adequate training. If your doctor decides that you are suitable for such home-treatment / self-\nadministration, he or she will instruct you in: \n\u2022 how to prepare and give this medicine (see the illustrated instructions at the end of this leaflet in \n\n\u201cInformation for health-care professionals and for patients suitable for home-treatment / self-\nadministration\u201d), \n\n\u2022 how to keep the product sterile (aseptic infusion techniques), \n\u2022 how to keep a treatment diary, \n\u2022 how to identify side effects, including signs of allergic reactions, and measures to be taken in \n\ncase such effects occur (see also section 2 and section 4). \nYour doctor or your healthcare professional will regularly review your / your caregiver\u2019s infusion \ntechnique to ensure continued appropriate handling. \n \nDose \nThe amount of Respreeza you are given is based on your body weight. The recommended dose is \n60 mg per kg of body weight and should be administered once per week. The infusion solution is \nnormally given over about 15 minutes (about 0.08 ml of solution per kg body weight each min). Your \ndoctor will determine the appropriate infusion rate for you by taking into account your weight and \nyour tolerability to infusion. \n \n\n\n\n 43 \n\nIf you use more Respreeza than you should \nConsequences of an overdose are unknown. \n\uf0e8 Tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you think you have used more Respreeza as you \n\nshould. He or she will take the appropriate measures. \n \nIf you forget to use Respreeza \n\uf0e8 Proceed with your next dose immediately and continue at regular intervals as advised by your \n\ndoctor or healthcare professional. \n\uf0e8 Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Respreeza \n\uf0e8 Do no stop using this medicine without consulting your doctor or healthcare professional. If \n\ntreatment with Respreeza is stopped, your condition may worsen. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Such side \neffects may occur even if you previously received human alpha1-proteinase inhibitors and had \ntolerated them well. \n \nSome side effects may be serious: \nUncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people), allergic reactions have been observed. They may \nprogress in some very rare cases (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) to severe allergic reactions even \nwhen you have shown no signs of allergy on previous infusions. \n\uf0e8 Tell your doctor or healthcare professional immediately if you notice any sign of allergic \n\nreactions (for example chills, flushing, faster heartbeat, fall in blood pressure, light-headedness, \nrash, hives, itching, difficulty in breathing or swallowing as well as swelling of your hands, \nface, or mouth) during the administration of Respreeza. Depending on the nature and severity of \nthe reaction, your doctor or healthcare professional may decide whether to slow or stop the \nadministration completely and give appropriate treatment for the reaction. \n\n In case of self-administration / home-treatment, stop the infusion immediately and contact your \ndoctor or healthcare professional. \n\n \nThe other side effects may include: \n \nCommonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \nDizziness, headache, shortness of breath (dyspnoea), nausea.  \n \nUncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \nAltered sense of touch like burning, tingling or feeling of numbness in your hands, arms, legs, or feet \n(paraesthesia), flushing, hives (urticaria), scaly rash and rash all over the body, physical weakness \n(asthenia), infusion-site reactions (such as burning, stinging, pain, swelling or redness at the infusion \nsite (haematoma)). \n \nVery rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) \nDecreased sense of touch like burning, tingling or feeling of numbness in your hands, arms, legs, or \nfeet (hypoaesthesia), excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis), itching, chest pain, chills, fever (pyrexia). \n \nFrequency not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \nPain to the lymph glands (oval-shaped masses of tissue that are distributed throughout the body and \nwhich may be palpable for example in the armpit, groin or neck), swollen face, swollen eyes and lips. \n \n \nReporting of side effects \n\uf0e8 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or healthcare professional. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the \n\n\n\n 44 \n\nnational reporting system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide \nmore information on the safety of this medicine.  \n\n \n5.

\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/. \n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nThe following information is intended for health-care professionals and for patients suitable for \nhome-treatment / self-administration \n \nGeneral instructions \n\u2022 The reconstitution should be performed according to the instructions provided below. \n\u2022 The product must be reconstituted, administered and handled with caution using aseptic technique \n\nto maintain product sterility. \n\u2022 Do not use provided sterile ancillaries for reconstitution and administration if their package is \n\nopened or if they are damaged. \n\u2022 The powder must be reconstituted with solvent (water for injections). \n\u2022 Total reconstitution of the powder should be obtained within 5 minutes (1,000 mg presentation) \n\nor 10 minutes (4,000 mg and 5,000 mg presentation). \n\u2022 Inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. \n\u2022 The reconstituted solution should be clear, colorless to slightly yellow, and free from visible \n\nparticles. \n \nFollow the steps provided below for the preparation and reconstitution of Respreeza: \n \n1. Ensure that the Respreeza vial and water for injections vial are at room temperature (up to 25\u00b0C). \n2. Remove the plastic flip-off cap from the water for injections vial. \n3. Wipe the rubber stopper of the water for injections vial with an antiseptic like an alcohol swab and \nallow it to dry. \n\n4. Open the Mix2Vial\u00ae set by peeling off the lid (Figure 1). \nDo not remove the Mix2Vial set from the blister package. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1 \n\n5. Place the water for injections vial on an even, clean surface and hold the \nvial tight. Take the Mix2Vial set together with the blister package and \nvertically pierce the water for injections vial with the blue tip of the \nMix2Vial set (Figure 2). \n\n \n\n\n\n 47 \n\n \nFigure 2 \n\n6. Carefully remove the blister package from the Mix2Vial set by holding at \nthe rim and pulling vertically upwards. Make sure that you only pull away \nthe blister package and not the Mix2Vial set (Figure 3). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3 \n\n7. Remove the plastic flip-off cap from the Respreeza vial. \n8. Wipe the rubber stopper of the Respreeza vial with an antiseptic like an alcohol swab and allow it to \ndry. \n\n9. Place the Respreeza vial on an even and firm surface. Invert the water for \ninjections vial with the Mix2Vial set attached and vertically pierce the \nRespreeza vial with the clear tip of the Mix2Vial set (Figure 4). The water \nfor injections will automatically flow into the Respreeza vial. \n \nNOTE: Ensure all water has transferred into the Respreeza vial. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4 \n\n10. Follow steps below to remove entire Mix2Vial set from Respreeza vial: \n \n\n\u2022 With one hand tightly grasp the Respreeza vial as shown in Figure 5. \n\u2022 With the other hand tightly grasp the water for injections vial and the \n\nblue part of the Mix2Vial set. \n\u2022 Bend the entire Mix2Vial set to the side until it disconnects from \n\nthe Respreeza vial (Figure 5). \n \nDiscard the water for injections vial with the entire Mix2Vial set. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5 \n\n11. Gently swirl the Respreeza vial until the powder is completely dissolved \n(Figure 6). DO NOT SHAKE. Take care not to touch the rubber vial stopper. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6 \n\n\n\n 48 \n\n12. Inspect visually the reconstituted solution. The solution should be clear, colourless to slightly \nyellow, and free from visible particles. Do not use solutions that are discoloured, cloudy or have \nparticles. \n13. If more than 1 vial of Respreeza is needed to achieve the required dose, repeat instructions 1 to 12 \nabove using an additional package containing an unused Mix2Vial set. \n \nUse a separate, unused Mix2Vial set, and a water for injections vial for each Respreeza vial. \n14. Use aseptic technique to transfer the reconstituted solutions into the administration container (e.g., \nempty intravenous bag or glass bottle; (not supplied) via a commercially available intravenous fluid \ntubing transfer set (not supplied)). \n \nAdministration \n \nThe reconstituted solution must be administered using an IV infusion set (supplied with the 4,000 and \n5,000 package). \n \n\n1. Make sure that the air vent cap and the roller clamp of the IV infusion set are closed. \nVERTICALLY pierce the Respreeza vial with the IV infusion set spike while twisting the IV \ninfusion set spike gently or connect it to an infusion container. \n2. Elevate the Respreeza vial/infusion container or hang on an infusion stand. \n3. Prime the drip chamber by squeezing it until the Respreeza solution has filled the chamber \nroughly half-way. \n4. Open the air vent cap of the IV infusion set. \n5. Slowly open the roller clamp of the IV infusion set and let the Respreeza solution flow until it \nreaches the end of the tubing with no air bubbles.  \n6. Close the roller clamp. \n7. Disinfect the injection site with an antiseptic like an alcohol swab before carefully inserting the \nneedle into the vein. Make sure that there is no air in the butterfly tube left. \n8. Connect the end of the IV infusion set to the butterfly set and open the roller clamp again. \n9. Infuse the reconstituted solution into the vein. The solution should be infused at an infusion rate \nof about 0.08 ml per kg body weight each min, as determined by your response and your comfort. \nThe recommended dose of 60 mg per kg of body weight will take approximately 15 minutes to \ninfuse. \n\n \nOne vial of Respreeza is for single use only. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed as instructed by your doctor or \nhealthcare professional. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

inhibitor, which is a normal component of the blood and is found in the lung. there, its main function is to protect the lung tissue by limiting the action of a certain enzyme, called neutrophil elastase. neutrophil elastase can cause damage if its action is not controlled (for example, in case you have an alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency). what respreeza is used for this medicine is used in adults with known severe alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency (an inherited condition also called alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency) who have developed a lung condition called emphysema. emphysema develops when the lack of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor results in a condition in which neutrophil elastase is not being properly controlled, damaging the tiny air sacs in the lungs through which oxygen passes into the body. because of this damage, the lungs do not work properly. using this medicine regularly increases the blood and lung levels of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, thus

or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). if you have been found to have a deficiency of certain blood proteins called immunoglobulin type a (iga) and have developed antibodies against them. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or healthcare professional before using respreeza. information on allergic reactions: when slowing or stopping the infusion may be required? you may be allergic to human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor even if you have previously received human alpha1-proteinase inhibitors and had tolerated them well. in some cases, severe allergic reactions may occur. your doctor will inform you about signs of allergic reactions (for example chills, flushing, faster heartbeat, fall in blood pressure, light-headedness, rash, hives, itching, difficulty in breathing or swallowing as well as swelling of your hands, face, or mouth) (see also section 4). tell your doctor or healthcare professional immediately if you notice such reactions during the infusion of this medicine. depending on the nature and severity of the reaction, your doctor may decide whether to slow or stop the infusion completely and start the appropriate treatment. in case of self-administration / home-treatment, stop the infusion immediately and contact your doctor or healthcare professional. information on safety with respect to infections respreeza is made from human blood plasma (this is the liquid part of the blood with the blood cells removed). because blood can carry infections, when medicines are made from human blood or plasma certain measures are put in place to prevent these from being present in the medicine and passed on to patients. these include: careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, the testing of samples of donated blood and plasma to try to avoid use of material with signs of virus/infections, the inclusion of steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. the measures taken are considered effective for viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), hepatitis a virus, hepatitis b virus, hepatitis c virus, and parvovirus b19 virus. however, despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. this also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections. your doctor may recommend that you consider vaccination against hepatitis a and b if you regularly/repeatedly receive human plasma-derived proteinase inhibitors. it is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of respreeza the name and batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. smoking since tobacco smoke is an important risk factor for the development and progression of emphysema, you are strongly advised to stop smoking and avoid passive smoking. children and adolescents this medicine is not for use in children or adolescents below 18 years of age. other medicines and respreeza tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or healthcare professional for advice before taking this medicine. since alpha1-proteinase inhibitor is a normal component of human blood, recommended dose of this medicine is not expected to cause harm to the developing foetus. however, as there is no information available regarding the safety of respreeza use during pregnancy, if you are pregnant, this medicine should only be given to you with caution. it is unknown whether respreeza passes into human milk. if you are breast-feeding, your doctor will discuss with you the risks and benefits of taking this medicine. there are no data concerning the effect on fertility but as alpha1-proteinase inhibitor is a normal component of human blood, no adverse effects on fertility are expected if you use respreeza at the recommended dose. driving and using machines dizziness may occur after the administration of this medicine. if you experience dizziness, you should not drive or use machines until the dizziness has passed (see section 4). respreeza contains sodium this medicinal product contains approximately 37 mg sodium per 1,000 mg respreeza vial, 149 mg sodium per 4,000 mg respreeza vial and 186 mg sodium per 5,000 mg respreeza vial, equivalent to 1.9%, 7.4% and 9.3% respectively, of the who recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. your doctor or healthcare professional will take that into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "respreeza", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id":
