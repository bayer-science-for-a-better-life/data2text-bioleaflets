Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.   \n   \n   \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nWakix 4.5 mg film-coated tablets   \nWakix 18 mg film-coated tablets   \n   \n   \n2.   QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION   \n   \nWakix 4.5 mg film-coated tablet \n \nEach tablet contains pitolisant hydrochloride equivalent to 4.45 mg of pitolisant.   \n \nWakix 18 mg film-coated tablet \n \nEach tablet contains pitolisant hydrochloride equivalent to 17.8 mg of pitolisant.   \n   \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.   \n   \n   \n3.   PHARMACEUTICAL FORM   \n   \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet)   \n   \nWakix 4.5 mg film-coated tablet \n \nWhite, round, biconvex film-coated tablet, 3.7 mm diameter, marked with “5” on one side.  \n \nWakix 18 mg film-coated tablet \n \nWhite, round, biconvex film-coated tablet, 7.5 mm diameter marked with “20” on one side.    \n   \n   \n4.   CLINICAL PARTICULARS   \n   \n4.1   Therapeutic indications   \n   \nWakix is indicated in adults for the treatment of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy (see also section \n5.1).   \n   \n4.2   Posology and method of administration   \n   \nTreatment should be initiated by a physician experienced in the treatment of sleep disorders.   \n   \nPosology   \n   \nWakix should be used at the lowest effective dose, depending on individual patient response and \ntolerance, according to an up-titration scheme, without exceeding the dose of 36 mg/day:    \n- Week 1: initial dose of 9 mg (two 4.5 mg tablets) per day.   \n- Week 2: the dose may be increased to 18 mg (one 18 mg tablet) per day or decreased to 4.5 mg \n\n(one 4.5 mg tablet) per day.   \n- Week 3: the dose may be increased to 36 mg (two 18 mg tablets) per day.   \n\n\n\n3   \n\n   \nAt any time the dose can be decreased (down to 4.5 mg per day) or increased (up to 36 mg per day) \naccording to the physician assessment and the patient’s response.   \n \nThe total daily dose should be administered as a single dose in the morning during breakfast.   \n \nMaintenance of efficacy \nAs long-term efficacy data are limited (see section 5.1), the continued efficacy of treatment should be \nregularly evaluated by the physician. \n  \nSpecial populations   \n \nElderly   \nLimited data are available in elderly. Therefore, dosing should be adjusted according to their renal and \nhepatic status.   \n  \nRenal impairment   \nIn patients with renal impairment, the maximum daily dose should be 18 mg.   \n  \nHepatic impairment   \nIn patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) two weeks after initiation of treatment, \nthe daily dose can be increased without exceeding a maximal dose of 18 mg (see section 5.2).   \nPitolisant is contra-indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) (see section \n4.3).  \nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment.  \n   \nPaediatric population   \nThe safety and efficacy of pitolisant in children aged from 0 to 18 years old have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available.  \n \nPoor metabolizers \nBy comparison to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers, higher systemic exposure (up to 3 fold) is \nobserved in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers. In the up-titration scheme, dose increment should take into \naccount this higher exposure. \n  \nMethod of administration  \n \nFor oral use. \n   \n4.3   Contraindications   \n   \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.   \n \nSevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).   \n \nBreastfeeding (see section 4.6).   \n   \n4.4   Special warnings and precautions for use   \n   \nPsychiatric disorders   \n \nPitolisant should be administered with caution in patients with history of psychiatric disorders such as \nsevere anxiety or severe depression with suicidal ideation risk. Suicidal ideation has been reported in \npatients with psychiatric history treated with pitolisant. \n   \nHepatic or renal impairment   \n \n\n\n\n4   \n\nPitolisant should be administered with caution in patients with either renal impairment or moderate \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) and dosing regimen should be adapted according to section 4.2.    \n   \nGastrointestinal disorders   \n \nGastric disorders reactions have been reported with pitolisant, therefore it should be administered with \ncaution in patients with acid related gastric disorders (see section 4.8) or when co-administered with \ngastric irritants such as corticosteroids or NSAID.   \n   \nNutrition disorders   \n \nPitolisant should be administered with caution in patients with severe obesity or severe anorexia (see \nsection 4.8). In case of significant weight change, treatment should be re-evaluated by the physician.   \n   \nCardiac disorders   \n \nIn two dedicated QT studies, supra-therapeutic doses of pitolisant (3-6-times the therapeutic dose, that \nis 108 mg to 216 mg) produced mild to moderate prolongation of QTc interval (10-13 ms). In clinical \ntrials, no specific cardiac safety signal was identified at therapeutic doses of pitolisant. Nevertheless, \npatients with cardiac disease, co-medicated with other QT-prolonging medicinal products or known to \nincrease the risk of repolarization disorders, or co-medicated with medicinal products that significantly \nincrease pitolisant Cmax and AUC ratio (see section 4.5) or patients with severe renal or moderate \nhepatic impairment (see section 4.4) should be carefully monitored (see section 4.5).   \n   \nEpilepsy  \n \nConvulsions were reported at high doses in animal models (see section 5.3). In clinical trials, one \nepilepsy aggravation was reported in one epileptic patient. Caution should be taken for patients with \nsevere epilepsy.   \n   \nWomen of childbearing potential  \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and at least up \nto 21 days after treatment discontinuation (based on pitolisant/metabolites half-life). Pitolisant may \nreduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, an alternative method of effective \ncontraception should be used if the woman patient is using hormonal contraceptives (see sections 4.5 \nand 4.6).  \n \nDrug-drug interactions  \n \nThe combination of pitolisant with substrates of CYP3A4 and having a narrow therapeutic margin \nshould be avoided (see section 4.5).  \n \nRebound effect \n \nNo rebound effect was reported during clinical trials. However, treatment discontinuation should be \nmonitored. \n \n4.5   Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction   \n   \nAntidepressants   \n \nTri or tetracyclic antidepressants (e.g. imipramine, clomipramine, mirtazapine) may impair the \nefficacy of pitolisant because they display histamine H1-receptor antagonist activity and possibly \ncancel the effect of endogenous histamine released in brain by the treatment.   \n   \nAnti-histamines   \n\n\n\n5   \n\n \nAnti-histamines (H1-receptor antagonists) crossing the haemato-encephalic barrier (e.g. pheniramine \nmaleate, chlorpheniramine, diphenydramine, promethazine, mepyramine) may impair the efficacy of \npitolisant.   \n   \nQT-prolonging substances or known to increase the risk of repolarization disorders  \n \nCombination with pitolisant should be made with a careful monitoring (see section 4.4).  \n  \nPharmacokinetic interactions   \n \nMedicinal products affecting pitolisant metabolism  \n  \n- Enzyme inducers   \nCo-administration of pitolisant with rifampicin in multiple doses significantly decreases pitolisant \nmean Cmax and AUC ratio about 39% and 50%, respectively. Therefore, co-administration of pitolisant \nwith potent CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin) should be \ndone with caution. With St John’s Wort (Hypericum Perforatum), due to its strong CYP3A4 inducing \neffect, caution should be exercised when taken concurrently with pitolisant. A clinical monitoring \nshould be made when both active substances are combined and, eventually a dosage adjustment during \nthe combination and one week after the inducer treatment.   \nIn a clinical multiple dose study, the combination of pitolisant with probenecid decreases the AUC of \npitolisant by about 34%. \n   \n- CYP2D6 inhibitors   \nCo-administration of pitolisant with paroxetine significantly increases pitolisant mean Cmax and \nAUC0—72h ratio about 47% and 105%, respectively. Given the 2-fold increase of pitolisant exposure, its \ncoadministration with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. paroxetine, fluoxetine, venlafaxine, duloxetine, \nbupropion, quinidine, terbinafine, cinacalcet) should be done with caution. A dosage adjustment \nduring the combination could eventually be considered.   \n   \nMedicinal products that pitolisant may affect metabolism  \n  \n- CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 substrates  \nBased on in vitro data, pitolisant and its main metabolites may induce CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 at \ntherapeutic concentrations and by extrapolation, CYP2C, UGTs and P-gp. No clinical data on the \nmagnitude of this interaction are available. Therefore, the combination of pitolisant with substrates of \nCYP3A4 and having a narrow therapeutic margin (e.g. immunosuppressants, docetaxel, kinase \ninhibitors, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine) should be avoided (see section 4.4). With other CYP3A4, \nCYP2B6 (e.g. efavirenz, bupropion), CYP2C (e.g. repaglinide, phenytoin, warfarin), P-gp (e.g. \ndabigatran, digoxin) and UGT (e.g. morphine, paracetamol, irinotecan) susbtrates, caution should be \nmade with a clinical monitoring of their efficacy.   \n \nWith oral contraceptives, the combination with pitolisant should be avoided and a further reliable \ncontraceptive method used.  \n  \n- Substrates of OCT1   \nPitolisant shows greater than 50% inhibition towards OCT1 (organic cation transporters 1) at \n1.33 µM, the extrapolated IC50 of pitolisant is 0.795 µM.   \n \nEven if the clinical relevance of this effect is not established, caution is advised when pitolisant is \nadministered with a substrate of OCT1 (e.g. metformin (biguanides)) (see section 5.2).   \n   \nThe combination of pitolisant with modafinil or sodium oxybate, usual treatments of narcolepsy was \nevaluated in healthy volunteers, at therapeutic doses. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug-drug \ninteraction was evidenced either with modafinil or with sodium oxybate. \n \n\n\n\n6   \n\nPaediatric population   \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.   \n   \n4.6   Fertility, pregnancy and lactation   \n   \nWomen of childbearing potential   \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and at least up \nto 21 days after treatment discontinuation (based on pitolisant/metabolites half-life). \nPitolisant/metabolites may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, an \nalternative method of effective contraception should be used if the woman is using hormonal \ncontraceptives (see section 4.5).   \n \nPregnancy   \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of pitolisant in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity, including teratogenicity. In rats, pitolisant/metabolites were \nshown to cross the placenta (see section 5.3).  \n \nPitolisant should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk \nfor foetus.  \n \nBreast-feeding   \n \nAnimal study has shown excretion of pitolisant/metabolites in milk. Therefore, breastfeeding is \ncontraindicated during treatment with pitolisant (see section 4.3).   \n   \nFertility   \n \nStudy in animals has shown effects on semen parameters, without a significant impact on reproductive \nperformance in males and reduction on the percentage of live foetuses in treated females (see section \n5.3).   \n  \n4.7   Effects on ability to drive and use machines   \n   \nPitolisant has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.    \n \nPatients with abnormal levels of sleepiness who take pitolisant should be advised that their level of \nwakefulness may not return to normal. Patients with excessive daytime sleepiness, including those \ntaking pitolisant should be frequently reassessed for their degree of sleepiness and, if appropriate, \nadvised to avoid driving or any other potentially dangerous activity.    \n   \n4.8   Undesirable effects   \n   \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequent adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported with pitolisant were insomnia (8.4%), \nheadache (7.7%), nausea (4.8%), anxiety (2.1%), irritability (1.8%), dizziness (1.4%), depression \n(1.3%), tremor (1.2%), sleep disorders (1.1%), fatigue (1.1%), vomiting (1.0%), vertigo (1.0%), \ndyspepsia (1.0%), weight increase (0.9%), abdominal pain upper (0.9%).

Most \nof these adverse reactions were mild to moderate. If symptoms persist a reduced daily dose or \ndiscontinuation should be considered.   \n   \nGastric disorders \nGastric disorders caused by hyperacidity have been reported during clinical studies in 3.5% of the \npatients receiving pitolisant. These effects were mostly mild to moderate. If they persist a corrective \ntreatment with proton pump inhibitor could be initiated.   \n   \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions   \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.   \n   \n4.9   Overdose   \n   \nSymptoms \n \nSymptoms of Wakix overdose may include headache, insomnia, irritability, nausea and abdominal \npain.    \n   \nManagement   \n \nIn case of overdose, hospitalisation and monitoring of the vital functions are recommended. There is \nno clearly identified antidote.   \n   \n  \n5.   PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES   \n   \n5.1    Pharmacodynamic properties   \n   \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs, ATC code: N07XX11.   \n   \nMechanism of action \n \nPitolisant is a potent, orally active histamine H3-receptor antagonist/inverse agonist which, via its \nblockade of histamine auto-receptors enhances the activity of brain histaminergic neurons, a major \narousal system with widespread projections to the whole brain. Pitolisant also modulates various \nneurotransmitter systems, increasing acetylcholine, noradrenaline and dopamine release in the brain. \nHowever no increase in dopamine release in the striatal complex including nucleus accumbens was \nevidenced for pitolisant.   \n \nPharmacodynamic effects   \n \nIn narcoleptic patients with or without cataplexy, pitolisant improves the level and duration of \nwakefulness and daytime alertness assessed by objective measures of ability to sustain wakefulness \n(e.g. Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT)) and attention (e.g. Sustained Attention to Response \nTask (SART)).   \n  \nClinical efficacy and safety   \n \nNarcolepsy (with or without cataplexy) is a chronic condition. The effectiveness of pitolisant up to \n36 mg once a day, for the treatment of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy was established in two \nmain, 8 weeks, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trials \n(Harmony I and Harmony CTP). Harmony Ibis, study with a similar design, was limited to 18 mg \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10   \n\nonce a day. To date, there are limited amount of data from an open label study on long term efficacy \nof Wakix in this indication. \n \nThe pivotal study (Harmony 1), double-blind, randomized, vs placebo and modafinil (400 mg/day), \nparallel group studies with flexible dose adaptation, included 94 patients (31 patients treated with \npitolisant, 30 with placebo and 33 with modafinil). Dosage was initiated at 9 mg once a day and was \nincreased, according to efficacy response and tolerance to 18 mg or 36 mg once a day per 1-week \ninterval. Most patients (60%) reached the 36 mg once a day dosage. To assess the efficacy of pitolisant \non Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score was used as primary \nefficacy criterion. The results with pitolisant were significantly superior to those in the placebo group \n(mean difference: -3.33; 95%CI [-5.83 to -0.83]; p < 0.05) but did not differ significantly from the \nresults in the modafinil group (mean difference: 0.12; 95%CI [-2.5 to 2.7]). The waking effect of the \ntwo active substances was established at similar rates (Figure 1).   \n   \nFigure 1: Changes in Epworth Sleepiness Scale Score (ESS) (mean ± SEM) from Baseline to \nweek 8 in Harmony 1 study   \n\n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \nThe effect on Epworth was supported in two laboratory tests of vigilance and attention (Maintenance \nof Wakefulness Test (MWT) (p=0.044) and Sustained Attention to Response (SART) (p=0.053, \nalmost but not significant)).   \n   \nCataplexy attacks frequency in patients displaying this symptom was decreased significantly \n(p=0.034) with pitolisant (-65%) compared to placebo (-10%). The daily cataplexy rate (geometric \nmeans) was 0.52 at baseline and 0.18 at final visit for pitolisant and 0.43 at baseline and 0.39 at final \nvisit for placebo, with a rate ratio rR=0.38 [0.16 ; 0.93] (p=0.034).    \n  \nThe second pivotal study (Harmony Ibis) included 165 patients (67 treated with pitolisant, 33 with \nplacebo and 65 with modafinil). The study design was similar to study Harmony I except that the \nmaximum dose for pitolisant reached by 75% of patients was 18 mg once a day instead of 36 mg in \nHarmony I. As an important unbalance led to comparison of results with or without cluster grouping \nof sites, the most conservative approach showed non-significant ESS score decrease with pitolisant \ncompared to placebo (pitolisant-placebo=-1.94 with p=0.065). Results from cataplexy rate at 18 mg \nonce a day were not consistent with those of the first pivotal study (36 mg once a day). \n \nImprovement of the two objective tests of wakefulness and attention, MWT and SART, with pitolisant \nwas significant versus placebo (p=0.009 and p=0.002 respectively) and non-significant versus \nmodafinil (p=0.713 and p=0.294 respectively). \n\n\n\n11   \n\n \nHarmony CTP, a supportive double blind, randomized, parallel group study of pitolisant versus \nplacebo, was designed to establish pitolisant efficacy in patients with high frequency cataplexy in \nnarcolepsy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in the average number of cataplexy attacks \nper week between the 2 weeks of baseline and the 4 weeks of stable treatment period at the end of \nstudy. 105 narcoleptic patients with high frequency weekly cataplexy rates at baseline were included \n(54 patients treated with pitolisant and 51 with placebo). Dosage was initiated at 4.5 mg once a day \nand was increased, according to efficacy response and tolerance to 9 mg, 18 mg or 36 mg once a day \nper 1-week interval. Most patients (65%) reached the 36 mg once a day dosage.   \n  \nOn the primary efficacy endpoint, Weekly Rate of Cataplexy episodes (WRC), the results with \npitolisant were significantly superior to those in the placebo group (p < 0.0001), with a progressive \n64% decrease from baseline to end of treatment (Figure 2). At baseline, the geometric mean of WRC \nwas 7.31 (median=6.5 [4.5; 12]) and 9.15 (median=8.5 [5.5; 15.5]) in the placebo and pitolisant groups \nrespectively. During the stable period (until the end of treatment), geometric mean WRC decreased to \n6.79 (median=6 [3; 15]) and 3.28 (median=3 [1.3; 6]) in the placebo and pitolisant groups respectively \nin patients who had experienced at least one episode of cataplexy. The observed WRC in pitolisant \ngroup was about half of WRC in the placebo group: the effect size of pitolisant compared with placebo \nwas summarized by the ratio rate rR(Pt/Pb), rR=0.512; 95%CI [0.435 to 0.603]; p < 0.0001). The \neffect size of pitolisant compared with placebo based on a model for WRC based on BOCF with centre \nas a fixed effect was 0.581, 95%CI [0.493 to 0.686]; p<0.0001. \n   \nFigure 2: Changes in weekly cataplexy episodes (geometric mean) from Baseline to week 7 in \nHarmony CTP study   \n   \n\n   \n*p<0.0001 vs placebo   \n\n   \nThe effect of pitolisant on EDS was also assessed in this population using the ESS score. In the \npitolisant group, ESS decreased significantly between baseline and the end of treatment compared to \nplacebo with an observed mean change of -1.9 ± 4.3 and -5.4 ± 4.3 (mean ± sd) for placebo and \npitolisant respectively, (p<0.0001) (Figure 3). This effect on EDS was confirmed by the results on \nMaintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT). The geometric mean of the ratios (MWTFinal/MWTBaseline) \nwas 1.8 (95%CI 1.19; 2.71, p=0.005). The MWT value in the pitolisant group was 80% higher than in \nthe placebo group.   \n   \n\n\n\n12   \n\nFigure 3: Changes in Epworth Sleepiness Scale Score (ESS) (mean ± SEM) from Baseline to \nweek 7 in Harmony CTP study   \n\n   \n  \nPaediatric population   \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nWakix in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in narcolepsy with or without cataplexy (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use).   \n  \n5.2   Pharmacokinetic properties   \n  \nThe exposure to pitolisant in healthy volunteers was assessed in studies involving more than 200 \nsubjects that received doses of pitolisant in single administration up to 216 mg and for a duration up to \n28 days.   \n   \nAbsorption   \n \nPitolisant is well and rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentration reached approximately three \nhours after administration.   \n   \nDistribution   \n \nPitolisant exhibits high serum protein binding (>90%) and demonstrates approximately equal \ndistribution between red blood cells and plasma.   \n   \nBiotransformation   \n \nThe metabolisation of pitolisant in humans is fully characterized. The major non-conjugated \nmetabolites are hydroxylated derivatives in several positions and cleaved forms of pitolisant leading to \ninactive major carboxylic acid metabolite found in urine and serum. They are formed under the action \nof CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Several conjugated metabolites were identified, the major ones (inactive) \nbeing two glycine conjugates of the acid metabolite of pitolisant and a glucuronide of a ketone \nmetabolite of monohydroxy desaturated pitolisant.    \n   \nOn liver microsomes, pitolisant and its major metabolites do not significantly inhibit the activities of \nthe cytochromes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2C8, CYP2B6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A4 and of \nuridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferases isoforms UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9 and \nUGT2B7 up to the concentration of 13.3 µM, a level considerably higher than the levels achieved with \ntherapeutic dose. Pitolisant is an inhibitor of CYP2D6 with moderate potency (IC50 = 2.6 µM).    \n\n\n\n13   \n\n  \nPitolisant induces CYP3A4, CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 in vitro. Clinically relevant interactions are \nexpected with CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 substrates and by extrapolation, UGTs, CYP2C and P-gp \nsubstrates (see section 4.5).  \n   \nIn vitro studies indicate that pitolisant is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of human P-glycoprotein \nand breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Pitolisant is not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3. \nPitolisant is not a significant inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, or \nMATE2K at the tested concentration. Pitolisant shows greater than 50% inhibition towards OCT1 \n(organic cation transporters 1) at 1.33 µM, the extrapolated IC50 of pitolisant is 0.795 µM (see section \n4.5).   \n   \nElimination   \n \nPitolisant has a plasma half-life of 10-12 hours. Upon repeated administrations, the steady state is \nachieved after 5-6 days of administration leading to an increased serum level around 100%. Inter \nindividual variability is rather high, some volunteers showing outlier high profile (without tolerance \nissues).   \n \nThe elimination is mainly achieved via urine (approximately 63%) through an inactive non conjugated \nmetabolite (BP2.951) and a glycine conjugated metabolite. 25% of the dose is excreted through \nexpired air and a small fraction (<3%) recovered in faeces where the amount of pitolisant or BP2.951 \nwas negligible.    \n   \nLinearity/non-linearity   \n \nWhen pitolisant dose is doubled from 27 to 54 mg, AUC0-∞ is increased by about 2.3.   \n   \nSpecial populations   \n \nElderly   \nIn 68 to 80 years old patients the pharmacokinetics of pitolisant is not different compared to younger \npatients (18 to 45 years of age). Above 80 years old, kinetics show a slight variation without clinical \nrelevance. Limited data are available in elderly. Therefore, dosing should be adjusted according to \ntheir renal hepatic status (see section 4.2 and 4.4).  \n   \nRenal impairment   \nIn patients with impaired renal function (stages 2 to 4 according to the international classification of \nchronic kidney disease, i.e. creatinine clearance between 15 and 89 ml/min), Cmax and AUC tended to \nbe increased by a factor of 2.5 without any impact on half-life (see section 4.2).   \n   \nHepatic impairment   \nIn patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A), there was no significant changes in \npharmacokinetics compared with normal healthy volunteers. In patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh B), AUC increased by a factor 2.4, while half-life doubled (see section 4.2). \nPitolisant pharmacokinetics after repeated administration in patients with hepatic impairment has not \nbeen evaluated yet.   \n \nCYP2D6 poor metabolizers \nThe exposure to Pitolisant was higher in the CYP2D6 poor metabolisers after a single dose and at \nsteady state; Cmax and AUC(0-tau) was approximately 2.7-fold and 3.2-fold greater on Day 1 and 2.1-\nfold and 2.4-fold on Day 7. The serum Pitolisant half-life was longer in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers \ncompared to the extensive metabolisers. \n   \nRace   \nThe effect of race on metabolism of pitolisant has not been evaluated.   \n   \n\n\n\n14   \n\n5.3   Preclinical safety data   \n   \nAfter 1 month in mice, 6 months in rats and 9 months in monkeys, no adverse effect level (NOAEL) \nwere 75, 30 and 12 mg/kg/day, p.o., respectively, providing safety margins of 9, 1 and 0.4, \nrespectively when compared to the drug exposure at therapeutic dose in human. In rats, transient \nreversible convulsive episodes occurred at Tmax , that may be attributable to a metabolite abundant in \nthis species but not in humans. In monkeys, at the highest doses, transient CNS related clinical signs \nincluding emesis, tremors and convulsions were reported. At the highest doses, no histopathological \nchanges were recorded in monkeys and rats presented some limited histopathological changes in some \norgans (liver, duodenum, thymus, adrenal gland and lung).   \n   \nPitolisant was neither genotoxic nor carcinogenic.  \n  \nTeratogenic effect of pitolisant was observed at maternally toxic doses (teratogenicity safety margins \n< 1 in rats and in rabbits). At high doses, pitolisant induced sperm morphology abnormalities and \ndecreased motility without any significant effect on fertility indexes in male rats and it decreased the \npercentage of live conceptuses and increased post-implantation loss in female rats (safety margin of \n1). It caused a delay in post-natal development (safety margin of 1).   \n   \nPitolisant/metabolites were shown to cross the placenta barrier in animals.   \n   \nJuvenile toxicity studies in rats revealed that the administration of pitolisant at high doses induced a \ndose related mortality and convulsive episode that may be attributable to a metabolite abundant in rats \nbut not in humans.   \n   \nPitolisant blocked hERG channel with an IC50 exceeding therapeutic concentrations and induced a \nslight QTc prolongation in dogs.  \n \nIn preclinical studies, drug dependence and drug abuse liability studies were conducted in mice, \nmonkeys and rats. However, no definitive conclusion could be drawn on tolerance, dependence and \nself-administration studies. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.   \n   \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.   \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.    \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.   \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.    \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

What you need to know before you take Wakix   \n3. How to take Wakix    \n4. Possible side effects    \n5. How to store Wakix   \n6. Contents of the pack and other information   \n   \n   \n1.   What Wakix is and what it is used for   \n   \nWakix contains the active ingredient pitolisant. It is a medicine used to treat adult patients with \nnarcolepsy, with or without cataplexy.  \n   \nNarcolepsy is a condition that causes excessive daytime sleepiness and a tendency to suddenly fall \nasleep in inappropriate situations (sleep attacks). Cataplexy is the onset of sudden muscle weakness or \nparalysis without losing consciousness, in response to a sudden emotional reaction such as anger, fear, \njoy, laughter or surprise.   \n   \nThe active substance, pitolisant, attaches to receptors on cells in the brain that are involved in \nstimulating alertness. This helps to combat daytime sleepiness and cataplexy and promote \nwakefulness.   \n   \n   \n2.   What you need to know before you take Wakix   \n   \nDo not take Wakix if you   \n \n- Are allergic to pitolisant or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).   \n- Have severe liver problems, as pitolisant is normally broken down in the liver and excess levels \n\nmay build up in patients whose liver function is severely reduced.   \n- Are breastfeeding.   \n   \nWarnings and precautions   \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Wakix if any of the situations mentioned below apply to you:   \n\n\n\n34   \n\n- You ever had anxiety or depression with suicidal thoughts.   \n- You have liver or kidney problems, as your dose may need to be adjusted.   \n- You have a gastric ulcer or you take medicines that can irritate your stomach such as medicines \n\nagainst inflammations, since gastric reactions have been reported with Wakix.   \n- You are obese or anorexic, as you may have change of your body weight (increase or decrease) \n\nwhile taking Wakix.   \n- You have heart problems. Your doctor will need to check this regularly while you are taking \n\nWakix.   \n- You have severe epilepsy.  \n   \nIf any of these apply to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Wakix.   \n \nOther things to talk to your doctor or pharmacist about:  \n \nSome people with history of psychiatric disorders have reported having suicidal thoughts while taking \nthis medicine. Tell your doctor straight away if you notice that you are becoming depressed or have \nsuicidal thoughts (see section 4). You may want to consider asking a family member or close friend to \nhelp you look out for signs of depression or other changes in your behaviour. \n \nChildren and adolescents  \n \nWakix should not be taken by children or adolescents.   \n   \nOther medicines and Wakix   \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Wakix can affect the way other medicines work and other medicines can affect the way \nWakix works. Your doctor may need to adjust your doses.   \n   \nIn particular, you should be cautious if you take Wakix together with some antidepressants (e.g. \nimipramine, clomipramine and mirtazapine) and some medicines to treat allergic conditions (anti-\nhistamines, e.g. pheniramine maleate, chlorpheniramine, diphenydramine, promethazine, \nmepyramine).   \n   \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines: rifampicin (an \nantibiotic), phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital (mainly used to control seizures), quinidine, \ndigoxin (used to treat abnormal heart rhythms), paroxetine, fluoxetine, venlafaxine, duloxetine \n(antidepressants), St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) a herbal remedy for depression, bupropion \n(antidepressant or aid to smoking cessation), cinacalcet (for treatment of disorders of the parathyroid \ngland), terbinafine (used to treat fungal infections), metformin, repaglinide (used to treat diabete), \ndocetaxel, irinotecan (used to treat cancer), cisapride (used to treat gastric reflux), pimozide (used to \ntreat some mental disorders), halofantrine (to treat malaria), efavirenz (antiviral medicine to treat \nHIV), morphine, paracetamol (used to treat pain), dabigatran (used to treat problems of the veins), \nwarfarin (used to treat heart diseases), probenecid (used to treat gout and gouty arthritis).Pitolisant can \nbe used with modafinil or sodium oxybate. \n \nWakix may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, an alternative method of effective \ncontraception has to be used (see section “Pregnancy).   \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding   \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.   \n  \nPregnancy \n \n\n\n\n35   \n\nWakix should not be used during pregnancy unless your doctor says so. There is not enough \ninformation available to know whether any particular risk is associated with the use of Wakix during \npregnancy. If you are a woman, you have to take a contraceptive during your treatment with Wakix \nand at least up to 21 days after treatment discontinuation. As Wakix may reduce the effectiveness of \nhormonal contraceptive, an alternative method of effective contraception has to be used.   \n   \nBreast-feeding \n \nWakix passes into breast milk in animal. Patients taking Wakix must stop breastfeeding.   \n   \nDriving and using machines   \n \nYou should be cautious with activities that require attention such as driving a car and handling \nmachinery. If you are unsure whether your condition has a negative effect on your ability to drive, talk \nto your doctor.   \n   \n   \n3.   How to take Wakix   \n   \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.   \n   \nTreatment is normally started with a dose of 9 mg once per day, and gradually increased over three \nweeks to the most appropriate dose. At any time, your doctor can increase or decrease your dose \ndepending on how well the medicine works for you and how well you tolerate it.   \n   \nIt might take a few days before you feel the benefit of the medicine and the maximum benefit is \nusually felt after a few weeks.   \nDo not change doses of Wakix on your own. Any change in dosage must be prescribed and monitored \nby your doctor.   \n   \nFor a dose of 4.5 mg, take one 4.5 mg tablet.   \nFor a dose of 9 mg, take two 4.5 mg tablets.   \nFor a dose of 18 mg, take one 18 mg tablet.   \nFor a dose of 36 mg, take two 18 mg tablets.   \n \nTake Wakix once a day by mouth, in the morning with your breakfast.   \nDo not take a dose of Wakix in the afternoon since you may have difficulty sleeping.   \n   \nIf you take more Wakix than you should   \n \nIf you take too many tablets of Wakix, contact your nearest hospital casualty department or tell your \ndoctor or pharmacist immediately.
