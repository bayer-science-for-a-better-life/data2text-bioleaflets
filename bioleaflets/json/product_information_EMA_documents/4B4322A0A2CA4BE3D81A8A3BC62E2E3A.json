NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nCosentyx 150 mg powder for solution for injection \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach vial of powder contains 150 mg secukinumab. After reconstitution, 1 ml of solution contains \n\n150 mg secukinumab. \n\n \n\nSecukinumab is a recombinant fully human monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary \n\n(CHO) cells. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nPowder for solution for injection \n\n \n\nThe powder is a white solid lyophilisate. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nAdult plaque psoriasis \n\n \n\nCosentyx is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are \n\ncandidates for systemic therapy. \n\n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n\n \n\nCosentyx is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in children and \n\nadolescents from the age of 6 years who are candidates for systemic therapy. \n\n \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\n \n\nCosentyx, alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for the treatment of active \n\npsoriatic arthritis in adult patients when the response to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic \n\ndrug (DMARD) therapy has been inadequate (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nAxial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) \n\n \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS, radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) \n\nCosentyx is indicated for the treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis in adults who have responded \n\ninadequately to conventional therapy. \n\n \n\nNon-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) \n\nCosentyx is indicated for the treatment of active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with \n\nobjective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic \n\nresonance imaging (MRI) evidence in adults who have responded inadequately to non-steroidal \n\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nCosentyx is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician experienced in the \n\ndiagnosis and treatment of conditions for which Cosentyx is indicated. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nAdult plaque psoriasis \n\nThe recommended dose is 300 mg of secukinumab by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at \n\nweeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by monthly maintenance dosing. Each 300 mg dose is given as two \n\nsubcutaneous injections of 150 mg. \n\n \n\nPaediatric plaque psoriasis (adolescents and children from the age of 6 years) \n\nThe recommended dose is based on body weight (Table 1) and administered by subcutaneous injection \n\nwith initial dosing at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by monthly maintenance dosing. Each 75 mg \n\ndose is given as one subcutaneous injection of 75 mg. Each 150 mg dose is given as one subcutaneous \n\ninjection of 150 mg. Each 300 mg dose is given as two subcutaneous injections of 150 mg. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Recommended dose for paediatric plaque psoriasis \n\n \n\nBody weight at time of dosing Recommended Dose \n\n<25 kg 75 mg \n\n25 to <50 kg 75 mg \n\n≥50 kg 150 mg (*may be increased to 300 mg) \n\n*Some patients may derive additional benefit from the higher dose. \n\n \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\nFor patients with concomitant moderate to severe plaque psoriasis or who are anti-TNFα inadequate \n\nresponders (IR), the recommended dose is 300 mg by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at \n\nweeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by monthly maintenance dosing. Each 300 mg dose is given as two \n\nsubcutaneous injections of 150 mg. \n\n \n\nFor other patients, the recommended dose is 150 mg by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at \n\nweeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by monthly maintenance dosing. Based on clinical response, the dose \n\ncan be increased to 300 mg. \n\n \n\nAxial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS, radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) \n\nThe recommended dose is 150 mg by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and \n\n4, followed by monthly maintenance dosing. Based on clinical response, the dose can be increased to \n\n300 mg. Each 300 mg dose is given as two subcutaneous injections of 150 mg. \n\n \n\nNon-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) \n\nThe recommended dose is 150 mg by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and \n\n4, followed by monthly maintenance dosing. \n\n \n\nFor all of the above indications, available data suggest that a clinical response is usually achieved \n\nwithin 16 weeks of treatment. Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients \n\nwho have shown no response by 16 weeks of treatment. Some patients with an initial partial response \n\nmay subsequently improve with continued treatment beyond 16 weeks. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly patients (aged 65 years and over) \n\nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nRenal impairment / hepatic impairment \n\nCosentyx has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Cosentyx in children with plaque psoriasis below the age of 6 years have \n\nnot been established. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Cosentyx in children below the age of 18 years in other indications have not \n\nyet been established. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nCosentyx is to be administered by subcutaneous injection. If possible, areas of the skin that show \n\npsoriasis should be avoided as injection sites. The powder for solution for injection must be \n\nreconstituted before use. \n\n \n\nThe reconstitution, dose preparation and administration of the powder for solution for injection is to be \n\ndone by a healthcare professional. For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before \n\nadministration, see section 6.6 and the Instructions for Use in the package leaflet. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nClinically important, active infection, e.g. active tuberculosis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nTraceability \n\n \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\nInfections \n\n \n\nSecukinumab has the potential to increase the risk of infections. Serious infections have been observed \n\nin patients receiving secukinumab in the post-marketing setting. Caution should be exercised when \n\nconsidering the use of secukinumab in patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent \n\ninfection. \n\n \n\nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection \n\noccur. If a patient develops a serious infection, the patient should be closely monitored and \n\nsecukinumab should not be administered until the infection resolves. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, infections have been observed in patients receiving secukinumab (see section 4.8). \n\nMost of these were mild or moderate upper respiratory tract infections such as nasopharyngitis and did \n\nnot require treatment discontinuation. \n\n \n\nRelated to the mechanism of action of secukinumab, non-serious mucocutaneous candida infections \n\nwere more frequently reported for secukinumab than placebo in the psoriasis clinical studies (3.55 per \n\n100 patient years for secukinumab 300 mg versus 1.00 per 100 patient years for placebo) (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\nNo increased susceptibility to tuberculosis was reported from clinical studies. However, secukinumab \n\nshould not be given to patients with active tuberculosis. Anti-tuberculosis therapy should be \n\nconsidered prior to initiation of secukinumab in patients with latent tuberculosis. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nInflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) \n\n \n\nCases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease have been reported with secukinumab \n\n(see section 4.8). Secukinumab is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. If a \n\npatient develops signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease or experiences an exacerbation of \n\npre-existing inflammatory bowel disease, secukinumab should be discontinued and appropriate \n\nmedical management should be initiated. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, rare cases of anaphylactic reactions have been observed in patients receiving \n\nsecukinumab. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reactions occur, administration of \n\nsecukinumab should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. \n\n \n\nVaccinations \n\n \n\nLive vaccines should not be given concurrently with secukinumab. \n\n \n\nPatients receiving secukinumab may receive concurrent inactivated or non-live vaccinations. In a \n\nstudy, after meningococcal and inactivated influenza vaccinations, a similar proportion of healthy \n\nvolunteers treated with 150 mg of secukinumab and those treated with placebo were able to mount an \n\nadequate immune response of at least a 4-fold increase in antibody titres to meningococcal and \n\ninfluenza vaccines. The data suggest that secukinumab does not suppress the humoral immune \n\nresponse to the meningococcal or influenza vaccines. \n\n \n\nPrior to initiating therapy with Cosentyx, it is recommended that paediatric patients receive all \n\nage-appropriate immunisations as per current immunisation guidelines. \n\n \n\nConcomitant immunosuppressive therapy \n\n \n\nIn psoriasis studies, the safety and efficacy of secukinumab in combination with immunosuppressants, \n\nincluding biologics, or phototherapy have not been evaluated. Secukinumab was administered \n\nconcomitantly with methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine and/or corticosteroids in arthritis studies \n\n(including in patients with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis). Caution should be exercised \n\nwhen considering concomitant use of other immunosuppressants and secukinumab (see also \n\nsection 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nLive vaccines should not be given concurrently with secukinumab (see also section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn a study in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, no interaction was observed between secukinumab \n\nand midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate). \n\n \n\nNo interaction was seen when secukinumab was administered concomitantly with methotrexate \n\n(MTX) and/or corticosteroids in arthritis studies (including in patients with psoriatic arthritis and axial \n\nspondyloarthritis). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential should use an effective method of contraception during treatment \n\nand for at least 20 weeks after treatment. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of secukinumab in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n\n(see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Cosentyx during \n\npregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether secukinumab is excreted in human milk. Immunoglobulins are excreted in \n\nhuman milk and it is not known if secukinumab is absorbed systemically after ingestion. Because of \n\nthe potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from secukinumab, a decision on whether to \n\ndiscontinue breast-feeding during treatment and up to 20 weeks after treatment or to discontinue \n\ntherapy with Cosentyx must be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and \n\nthe benefit of therapy to the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThe effect of secukinumab on human fertility has not been evaluated. Animal studies do not indicate \n\ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nCosentyx has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are upper respiratory tract infections \n\n(most frequently nasopharyngitis, rhinitis). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nADRs from clinical studies and post-marketing reports (Table 2) are listed by MedDRA system organ \n\nclass. Within each system organ class, the ADRs are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent \n\nreactions first. Within each frequency grouping, adverse drug reactions are presented in order of \n\ndecreasing seriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse drug \n\nreaction is based on the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); \n\nuncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); and not known \n\n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nOver 18,000 patients have been treated with secukinumab in blinded and open-label clinical studies in \n\nvarious indications (plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis and other autoimmune \n\nconditions), representing 30,565 patient years of exposure. Of these, over 11,700 patients were \n\nexposed to secukinumab for at least one year. The safety profile of secukinumab is consistent across \n\nall indications. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nTable 2 List of adverse reactions in clinical studies1) and post-marketing experience \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reaction \n\nInfections and \n\ninfestations \n\nVery common Upper respiratory tract infections \n\nCommon Oral herpes \n\nTinea pedis \n\nUncommon Oral candidiasis \n\nOtitis externa \n\nLower respiratory tract infections \n\nNot known Mucosal and cutaneous candidiasis (including \n\noesophageal candidiasis) \n\nBlood and lymphatic \n\nsystem disorders \n\nUncommon Neutropenia \n\nImmune system \n\ndisorders \n\nRare Anaphylactic reactions \n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon Headache \n\nEye disorders Uncommon Conjunctivitis \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \n\nand mediastinal \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon Rhinorrhoea \n\nGastrointestinal \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon Diarrhoea \n\nCommon Nausea \n\nUncommon Inflammatory bowel disease \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders \n\nUncommon Urticaria \n\nRare Exfoliative dermatitis2) \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site \n\nconditions \n\nCommon Fatigue \n\n1) Placebo-controlled clinical studies (phase III) in plaque psoriasis, PsA, AS and nr-axSpA patients \n\nexposed to 300 mg, 150 mg, 75 mg or placebo up to 12 weeks (psoriasis) or 16 weeks (PsA, AS and \n\nnr-axSpA) treatment duration \n2) Cases were reported in patients with psoriasis diagnosis \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nInfections \n\nIn the placebo-controlled period of clinical studies in plaque psoriasis (a total of 1,382 patients treated \n\nwith secukinumab and 694 patients treated with placebo for up to 12 weeks), infections were reported \n\nin 28.7% of patients treated with secukinumab compared with 18.9% of patients treated with placebo. \n\nThe majority of infections consisted of non-serious and mild to moderate upper respiratory tract \n\ninfections, such as nasopharyngitis, which did not necessitate treatment discontinuation. There was an \n\nincrease in mucosal or cutaneous candidiasis, consistent with the mechanism of action, but the cases \n\nwere mild or moderate in severity, non-serious, responsive to standard treatment and did not \n\nnecessitate treatment discontinuation. Serious infections occurred in 0.14% of patients treated with \n\nsecukinumab and in 0.3% of patients treated with placebo (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nOver the entire treatment period (a total of 3,430 patients treated with secukinumab for up to 52 weeks \n\nfor the majority of patients), infections were reported in 47.5% of patients treated with secukinumab \n\n(0.9 per patient-year of follow-up). Serious infections were reported in 1.2% of patients treated with \n\nsecukinumab (0.015 per patient-year of follow-up). \n\n \n\nInfection rates observed in psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and \n\nnon-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) clinical studies were similar to those observed in the \n\npsoriasis studies. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nNeutropenia \n\nIn psoriasis phase III clinical studies, neutropenia was more frequently observed with secukinumab \n\nthan with placebo, but most cases were mild, transient and reversible. Neutropenia <1.0-0.5x109/l \n\n(CTCAE grade 3) was reported in 18 out of 3,430 (0.5%) patients on secukinumab, with no dose \n\ndependence and no temporal relationship to infections in 15 out of 18 cases. There were no reported \n\ncases of more severe neutropenia. Non-serious infections with usual response to standard care and not \n\nrequiring discontinuation of secukinumab were reported in the remaining 3 cases. \n\n \n\nThe frequency of neutropenia in psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis \n\nand non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) was similar to psoriasis. \n\n \n\nRare cases of neutropenia <0.5x109/l (CTCAE grade 4) were reported. \n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\nIn clinical studies, urticaria and rare cases of anaphylactic reaction to secukinumab were observed (see \n\nalso section 4.4). \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity \n\nIn psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and non-\n\nradiographic axial spondyloarthritis) clinical studies, less than 1% of patients treated with \n\nsecukinumab developed antibodies to secukinumab up to 52 weeks of treatment. About half of the \n\ntreatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies were neutralising, but this was not associated with loss of \n\nefficacy or pharmacokinetic abnormalities. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nUndesirable effects in paediatric patients from the age of 6 years with plaque psoriasis \n\nThe safety of secukinumab was assessed in two phase III studies in paediatric patients with plaque \n\npsoriasis. The first study (paediatric study 1) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of \n\n162 patients from 6 to less than 18 years of age with severe plaque psoriasis. The second study \n\n(paediatric study 2) is an open-label study of 84 patients from 6 to less than 18 years of age with \n\nmoderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The safety profile reported in these two studies was consistent \n\nwith the safety profile reported in adult plaque psoriasis patients. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC10 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nSecukinumab is a fully human IgG1/κ monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to and neutralises \n\nthe proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A). Secukinumab works by targeting IL-17A and \n\ninhibiting its interaction with the IL-17 receptor, which is expressed on various cell types including \n\nkeratinocytes. As a result, secukinumab inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines \n\nand mediators of tissue damage and reduces IL-17A-mediated contributions to autoimmune and \n\ninflammatory diseases. Clinically relevant levels of secukinumab reach the skin and reduce local \n\ninflammatory markers. As a direct consequence treatment with secukinumab reduces erythema, \n\ninduration and desquamation present in plaque psoriasis lesions. \n\n \n\nIL-17A is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune \n\nresponses. IL-17A plays a key role in the pathogenesis of plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and axial \n\nspondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) and is \n\nup-regulated in lesional skin in contrast to non-lesional skin of plaque psoriasis patients and in \n\nsynovial tissue of psoriatic arthritis patients. The frequency of IL-17-producing cells was also \n\nsignificantly higher in the subchondral bone marrow of facet joints from patients with ankylosing \n\nspondylitis. Increased numbers of IL-17A producing lymphocytes have also been found in patients \n\nwith non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. Inhibition of IL-17A was shown to be effective in the \n\ntreatment of ankylosing spondylitis, thus establishing the key role of this cytokine in axial \n\nspondyloarthritis. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nSerum levels of total IL-17A (free and secukinumab-bound IL-17A) are initially increased in patients \n\nreceiving secukinumab. This is followed by a slow decrease due to reduced clearance of \n\nsecukinumab-bound IL-17A, indicating that secukinumab selectively captures free IL-17A, which \n\nplays a key role in the pathogenesis of plaque psoriasis. \n\n \n\nIn a study with secukinumab, infiltrating epidermal neutrophils and various neutrophil-associated \n\nmarkers that are increased in lesional skin of plaque psoriasis patients were significantly reduced after \n\none to two weeks of treatment. \n\n \n\nSecukinumab has been shown to lower (within 1 to 2 weeks of treatment) levels of C-reactive protein, \n\nwhich is a marker of inflammation. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nAdult plaque psoriasis \n\nThe safety and efficacy of secukinumab were assessed in four randomised, double-blind, \n\nplacebo-controlled phase III studies in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who were \n\ncandidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy [ERASURE, FIXTURE, FEATURE, JUNCTURE]. \n\nThe efficacy and safety of secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg were evaluated versus either placebo or \n\netanercept. In addition, one study assessed a chronic treatment regimen versus a “retreatment as \n\nneeded” regimen [SCULPTURE]. \n\n \n\nOf the 2,403 patients who were included in the placebo-controlled studies, 79% were biologic-naive, \n\n45% were non-biologic failures and 8% were biologic failures (6% were anti-TNF failures, and 2% \n\nwere anti-p40 failures). Approximately 15 to 25% of patients in phase III studies had psoriatic arthritis \n\n(PsA) at baseline. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nPsoriasis study 1 (ERASURE) evaluated 738 patients. Patients randomised to secukinumab received \n\n150 mg or 300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by the same dose every month. Psoriasis \n\nstudy 2 (FIXTURE) evaluated 1,306 patients. Patients randomised to secukinumab received 150 mg or \n\n300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by the same dose every month. Patients randomised \n\nto etanercept received 50 mg doses twice per week for 12 weeks followed by 50 mg every week. In \n\nboth study 1 and study 2, patients randomised to receive placebo who were non-responders at week 12 \n\nthen crossed over to receive secukinumab (either 150 mg or 300 mg) at weeks 12, 13, 14, and 15, \n\nfollowed by the same dose every month starting at week 16. All patients were followed for up to \n\n52 weeks following first administration of study treatment. \n\n \n\nPsoriasis study 3 (FEATURE) evaluated 177 patients using a pre-filled syringe compared with placebo \n\nafter 12 weeks of treatment to assess the safety, tolerability, and usability of secukinumab \n\nself-administration via the pre-filled syringe. Psoriasis study 4 (JUNCTURE) evaluated 182 patients \n\nusing a pre-filled pen compared with placebo after 12 weeks of treatment to assess the safety, \n\ntolerability, and usability of secukinumab self-administration via the pre-filled pen. In both study 3 \n\nand study 4, patients randomised to secukinumab received 150 mg or 300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 \n\nand 4, followed by the same dose every month. Patients were also randomised to receive placebo at \n\nweeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by the same dose every month. \n\n \n\nPsoriasis study 5 (SCULPTURE) evaluated 966 patients. All patients received secukinumab 150 mg or \n\n300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 12 and then were randomised to receive either a \n\nmaintenance regimen of the same dose every month starting at week 12 or a “retreatment as needed” \n\nregimen of the same dose. Patients randomised to “retreatment as needed” did not achieve adequate \n\nmaintenance of response and therefore a fixed monthly maintenance regimen is recommended. \n\n \n\nThe co-primary endpoints in the placebo and active-controlled studies were the proportion of patients \n\nwho achieved a PASI 75 response and IGA mod 2011 “clear” or “almost clear” response versus \n\nplacebo at week 12 (see Tables 3 and 4). The 300 mg dose provided improved skin clearance \n\nparticularly for “clear” or “almost clear” skin across the efficacy endpoints of PASI 90, PASI 100, and \n\nIGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response across all studies with peak effects seen at week 16, therefore this dose \n\nis recommended. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nTable 3 Summary of PASI 50/75/90/100 & IGA⃰ mod 2011 “clear” or “almost clear” clinical \n\nresponse in psoriasis studies 1, 3 and 4 (ERASURE, FEATURE and JUNCTURE) \n\n \n Week 12 Week 16 Week 52 \n\n Placebo 150 mg 300 mg 150 mg 300 mg 150 mg 300 mg \n\nStudy 1 \n\nNumber of patients 246 244 245 244 245 244 245 \n\nPASI 50 response n (%) 22 \n(8.9%) \n\n203 \n\n(83.5%) \n\n222 \n\n(90.6%) \n\n212 \n\n(87.2%) \n\n224 \n\n(91.4%) \n\n187 \n\n(77%) \n\n207 \n\n(84.5%) \n\nPASI 75 response n (%) 11 \n(4.5%) \n\n174 \n\n(71.6%)** \n\n200 \n\n(81.6%)** \n\n188 \n\n(77.4%) \n\n211 \n\n(86.1%) \n\n146 \n\n(60.1%) \n\n182 \n\n(74.3%) \n\nPASI 90 response n (%) 3 (1.2%) 95 \n(39.1%)** \n\n145 \n\n(59.2%)** \n\n130 \n\n(53.5%) \n\n171 \n\n(69.8%) \n\n88 \n\n(36.2%) \n\n147 \n\n(60.0%) \n\nPASI 100 response n (%) 2 (0.8%) 31 \n(12.8%) \n\n70 \n\n(28.6%) \n\n51 \n\n(21.0%) \n\n102 \n\n(41.6%) \n\n49 \n\n(20.2%) \n\n96 \n\n(39.2%) \n\nIGA mod 2011 “clear” or \n\n“almost clear” response \n\nn (%) \n\n6 \n\n(2.40%) \n\n125 \n\n(51.2%)** \n\n160 \n\n(65.3%)** \n\n142 \n\n(58.2%) \n\n180 \n\n(73.5%) \n\n101 \n\n(41.4%) \n\n148 \n\n(60.4%) \n\nStudy 3 \nNumber of patients  59 59 58 - - - - \n\nPASI 50 response n (%) 3 (5.1%) 51 \n(86.4%) \n\n51 \n\n(87.9%) \n\n- - - - \n\nPASI 75 response n (%) 0 (0.0%) 41 \n(69.5%)** \n\n44 \n\n(75.9%)** \n\n- - - - \n\nPASI 90 response n (%) 0 (0.0%) 27 \n(45.8%) \n\n35 \n\n(60.3%) \n\n- - - - \n\nPASI 100 response n (%) 0 (0.0%) 5 \n(8.5%) \n\n25 \n\n(43.1%) \n\n- - - - \n\nIGA mod 2011 “clear” or \n\n“almost clear” response \n\nn (%) \n\n0 (0.0%) 31 \n\n(52.5%)** \n\n40 \n\n(69.0%)** \n\n- - - - \n\nStudy 4 \nNumber of patients  61 60 60 - - - - \n\nPASI 50 response n (%) 5 (8.2%) 48 \n(80.0%) \n\n58 \n\n(96.7%) \n\n- - - - \n\nPASI 75 response n (%) 2 (3.3%) 43 \n(71.7%)** \n\n52 \n\n(86.7%)** \n\n- - - - \n\nPASI 90 response n (%) 0 (0.0%) 24 \n(40.0%) \n\n33 \n\n(55.0%) \n\n- - - - \n\nPASI 100 response n(%) 0 (0.0%) 10 \n(16.7%) \n\n16 \n\n(26.7%) \n\n- - - - \n\nIGA mod 2011 “clear” or \n\n“almost clear” response \n\nn (%) \n\n0 (0.0%) 32 \n\n(53.3%)** \n\n44 \n\n(73.3%)** \n\n- - - - \n\n* The IGA mod 2011 is a 5-category scale including “0 = clear”, “1 = almost clear”, “2 = mild”, “3 = \n\nmoderate” or “4 = severe”, indicating the physician’s overall assessment of the psoriasis severity focusing \n\non induration, erythema and scaling.

In the \n\nTRANSFIGURE study, secukinumab was superior to placebo at week 16 (46.1% for 300 mg, 38.4% \n\nfor 150 mg and 11.7% for placebo) as assessed by significant improvement from baseline in the Nail \n\nPsoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI %) for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis with nail \n\ninvolvement. In the GESTURE study, secukinumab was superior to placebo at week 16 (33.3% for \n\n300 mg, 22.1% for 150 mg, and 1.5% for placebo) as assessed by significant improvement of ppIGA 0 \n\nor 1 response (“clear” or “almost clear”) for patients with moderate to severe palmoplantar plaque \n\npsoriasis. \n\n \n\nA placebo-controlled study evaluated 102 patients with moderate to severe scalp psoriasis, defined as \n\nhaving a Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) score of ≥12, an IGA mod 2011 scalp only score of 3 \n\nor greater and at least 30% of the scalp surface area affected. Secukinumab 300 mg was superior to \n\nplacebo at week 12 as assessed by significant improvement from baseline in both the PSSI 90 response \n\n(52.9% versus 2.0%) and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 scalp only response (56.9% versus 5.9%). \n\nImprovement in both endpoints was sustained for secukinumab patients who continued treatment \n\nthrough to week 24. \n\n \n\nQuality of life/patient-reported outcomes \n\nStatistically significant improvements at week 12 (studies 1-4) from baseline compared to placebo \n\nwere demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). Mean decreases (improvements) in \n\nDLQI from baseline ranged from -10.4 to -11.6 with secukinumab 300 mg, from -7.7 to -10.1 with \n\nsecukinumab 150 mg, versus -1.1 to -1.9 for placebo at week 12.

Patients with each subtype of PsA were \n\nenrolled in these studies, including polyarticular arthritis with no evidence of rheumatoid nodules, \n\nspondylitis with peripheral arthritis, asymmetric peripheral arthritis, distal interphalangeal \n\ninvolvement and arthritis mutilans. Patients in these studies had a diagnosis of PsA of at least five \n\nyears. The majority of patients also had active psoriasis skin lesions or a documented history of \n\npsoriasis. Over 61% and 42% of the PsA patients had enthesitis and dactylitis at baseline, respectively. \n\nFor all studies, the primary endpoint was American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response. For \n\nPsoriatic Arthritis study 1 (PsA study 1) and Psoriatic Arthritis study 2 (PsA study 2), the primary \n\nendpoint was at week 24. For Psoriatic Arthritis study 3 (PsA study 3), the primary endpoint was at \n\nweek 16 with the key secondary endpoint, the change from baseline in modified Total Sharp Score \n\n(mTSS), at week 24. \n\n \n\nIn PsA study 1, PsA study 2 and PsA study 3, 29%, 35% and 30% of patients, respectively, were \n\npreviously treated with an anti-TNFα agent and discontinued the anti-TNFα agent for either lack of \n\nefficacy or intolerance (anti-TNFα-IR patients). \n\n \n\nPsA study 1 (FUTURE 1) evaluated 606 patients, of whom 60.7% had concomitant MTX. Patients \n\nrandomised to secukinumab received 10 mg/kg intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 4, followed by either \n\n75 mg or 150 mg subcutaneously every month starting at week 8. Patients randomised to placebo who \n\nwere non-responders at week 16 (early rescue) and other placebo patients at week 24 were crossed \n\nover to receive secukinumab (either 75 mg or 150 mg subcutaneously) followed by the same dose \n\nevery month. \n\n \n\nPsA study 2 (FUTURE 2) evaluated 397 patients, of whom 46.6% had concomitant MTX. Patients \n\nrandomised to secukinumab received 75 mg, 150 mg or 300 mg subcutaneously at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and \n\n4, followed by the same dose every month. Patients randomised to receive placebo who were \n\nnon-responders at week 16 (early rescue) were crossed over to receive secukinumab (either 150 mg or \n\n300 mg subcutaneously) at week 16 followed by the same dose every month.

In PsA study 2, at week 24, secukinumab-\n\ntreated patients with concomitant MTX use had a higher ACR 20 response (47.7% and 54.4% for \n\n150 mg and 300 mg, respectively, compared to placebo 20.0%) and ACR 50 response (31.8% and \n\n38.6% for 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively, compared to placebo 8.0%). Secukinumab-treated \n\npatients without concomitant MTX use had a higher ACR 20 response (53.6% and 53.6% for 150 mg \n\nand 300 mg, respectively, compared to placebo 10.4%) and ACR 50 response (37.5% and 32.1% for \n\n150 mg and 300 mg, respectively, compared to placebo 6.3%). \n\n \n\nIn PsA study 2, both anti-TNFα-naive and anti-TNFα-IR secukinumab-treated patients had a \n\nsignificantly higher ACR 20 response compared to placebo at week 24, with a slightly higher response \n\nin the anti-TNFα-naive group (anti-TNFα-naive: 64% and 58% for 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively, \n\ncompared to placebo 15.9%; anti-TNFα-IR: 30% and 46% for 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively, \n\ncompared to placebo 14.3%). In the anti-TNFα-IR patients subgroup, only the 300 mg dose showed \n\nsignificantly higher response rate for ACR 20 compared to placebo (p<0.05) and demonstrated clinical \n\nmeaningful benefit over 150 mg on multiple secondary endpoints. Improvements in the PASI 75 \n\nresponse were seen in both subgroups and the 300 mg dose showed statistically significant benefit in \n\nthe anti-TNFα-IR patients. \n\n \n\nThe number of PsA patients with axial involvement was too small to allow meaningful assessment. \n\n \n\nImprovements were shown in all components of the ACR scores, including patient assessment of pain. \n\nIn PsA study 2, the proportion of patients achieving a modified PsA Response Criteria (PsARC) \n\nresponse was greater in the secukinumab-treated patients (59.0% and 61.0% for 150 mg and 300 mg, \n\nrespectively) compared to placebo (26.5%) at week 24. \n \n\nIn PsA study 1 and PsA study 2, efficacy was maintained up to week 104. In PsA study 2, among \n\n200 patients initially randomised to secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg, 178 (89%) patients were still \n\non treatment at week 52. Of the 100 patients randomised to secukinumab 150 mg, 64, 39 and 20 had \n\nan ACR 20/50/70 response, respectively. Of the 100 patients randomised to secukinumab 300 mg, 64, \n\n44 and 24 had an ACR 20/50/70 response, respectively. \n\n \n\nRadiographic response \n\nIn PsA study 3, inhibition of progression of structural damage was assessed radiographically and \n\nexpressed by the modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) and its components, the Erosion Score (ES) and \n\nthe Joint Space Narrowing Score (JSN). Radiographs of hands, wrists, and feet were obtained at \n\nbaseline, week 16 and/or week 24 and scored independently by at least two readers who were blinded \n\nto treatment group and visit number. Secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg treatment significantly \n\ninhibited the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage compared with placebo treatment as \n\nmeasured by change from baseline in mTSS at week 24 (Table 7). \n\n \n\nInhibition of progression of structural damage was also assessed in PsA study 1 at weeks 24 and 52, \n\ncompared to baseline.

Patients randomised to placebo who were non-responders at week 16 (early rescue) \n\nand all other placebo patients at week 24 were crossed over to receive secukinumab (either 75 mg or \n\n150 mg subcutaneously), followed by the same dose every month. \n\n \n\nAS study 2 (MEASURE 2) evaluated 219 patients, of whom 11.9% and 14.2% used concomitant \n\nMTX or sulfasalazine, respectively. Patients randomised to secukinumab received 75 mg or 150 mg \n\nsubcutaneously at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by the same dose every month. At week 16, \n\npatients who were randomised to placebo at baseline were re-randomised to receive secukinumab \n\n(either 75 mg or 150 mg subcutaneously) every month. \n\n \n\nAS study 3 (MEASURE 3) evaluated 226 patients, of whom 13.3% and 23.5% used concomitant \n\nMTX or sulfasalazine, respectively. Patients randomised to secukinumab received 10 mg/kg \n\nintravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 4, followed by either 150 mg or 300 mg subcutaneously every month. \n\nAt week 16, patients who were randomised to placebo at baseline were re-randomised to receive \n\nsecukinumab (either 150 mg or 300 mg subcutaneously) every month.

In AS study 2, among 72 patients initially randomised to secukinumab 150 mg, \n\n61 (84.7%) patients were still on treatment at week 52. Of the 72 patients randomised to secukinumab \n\n150 mg, 45 and 35 had an ASAS 20/40 response, respectively. \n\n \n\nIn AS study 3, patients treated with secukinumab (150 mg and 300 mg) demonstrated improved signs \n\nand symptoms, and had comparable efficacy responses regardless of dose that were superior to \n\nplacebo at week 16 for the primary endpoint (ASAS 20). Overall, the efficacy response rates for the \n\n300 mg group were consistently greater compared to the 150 mg group for the secondary endpoints. \n\nDuring the blinded period, the ASAS 20 and ASAS 40 responses were 69.7% and 47.6% for 150 mg \n\nand 74.3% and 57.4% for 300 mg at week 52, respectively.

Larger differences in response rates, \n\nfavouring 300 mg over 150 mg, were observed in anti-TNFα-IR patients (n=36) compared to \n\nanti-TNFα-naïve patients (n=114). \n\n \n\nSpinal mobility: \n\nPatients treated with secukinumab 150 mg showed improvements in spinal mobility as measured by \n\nchange from baseline in BASMI at week 16 for both AS study 1 (-0.40 versus -0.12 for placebo; \n\np=0.0114) and AS study 2 (-0.51 versus -0.22 for placebo; p=0.0533). These improvements were \n\nsustained up to week 52. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\nPhysical function and health-related quality of life: \n\nIn AS study 1 and study 2, patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg showed improvements in health-\n\nrelated quality of life as measured by AS Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQoL) (p=0.001) and SF-36 \n\nPhysical Component Summary (SF-36PCS) (p<0.001). Patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg also \n\nshowed statistically significant improvements on exploratory endpoints in physical function as \n\nassessed by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) compared to placebo (-2.15 \n\nversus -0.68), and in fatigue as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-\n\nFatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) scale compared to placebo (8.10 versus 3.30). These improvements were \n\nsustained up to week 52. \n\n \n\nNon-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) \n\nThe safety and efficacy of secukinumab were assessed in 555 patients in one randomised, \n\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study (PREVENT), consisting of a 2-year core phase and a \n\n2-year extension phase, in patients with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) \n\nfulfilling the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS) classification criteria for \n\naxial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) with no radiographic evidence of changes in the sacroiliac joints that \n\nwould meet the modified New York criteria for ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Patients enrolled had \n\nactive disease, defined as a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) ≥4, a \n\nVisual Analogue Scale (VAS) for total back pain of ≥40 (on a scale of 0-100 mm), despite current or \n\nprevious non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy and increased C-reactive protein \n\n(CRP) and/or evidence of sacroiliitis on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

Approximately 43% of the patients had prior \n\nexposure to phototherapy, 53% to conventional systemic therapy, 3% to biologics, and 9% had \n\nconcomitant psoriatic arthritis. \n\n \nThe paediatric psoriasis study 1 evaluated 162 patients who were randomised to receive low dose \n\nsecukinumab (75 mg for body weight <50 kg or 150 mg for body weight ≥50 kg), high dose \n\nsecukinumab (75 mg for body weight <25 kg, 150 mg for body weight between ≥25 kg and <50 kg, or \n\n300 mg for body weight ≥50 kg), or placebo at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 followed by the same dose \n\nevery 4 weeks, or etanercept. Patients randomised to etanercept received 0.8 mg/kg weekly (up to a \n\nmaximum of 50 mg).

The co-\n\nprimary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 response and IGA mod \n\n2011 ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ (0 or 1) response at week 12. \n\n \n\nDuring the 12 week placebo-controlled period, the efficacy of both the low and the high dose of \n\nsecukinumab was comparable for the co-primary endpoints. The odds ratio estimates in favour of both \n\nsecukinumab doses were statistically significant for both the PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 \n\nresponses. \n\n \n\nAll patients were followed for efficacy and safety during the 52 weeks following the first dose. The \n\nproportion of patients achieving PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ (0 or 1) \n\nresponses showed separation between secukinumab treatment groups and placebo at the first post-\n\nbaseline visit at week 4, the difference becoming more prominent at week 12. The response was \n\nmaintained throughout the 52 week time period (see Table 11). Improvement in PASI 50, 90, 100 \n\nresponder rates and Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) scores of 0 or 1 were also \n\nmaintained throughout the 52 week time period. \n\n \n\nIn addition, PASI 75, IGA 0 or 1, PASI 90 response rates at weeks 12 and 52 for both secukinumab \n\nlow and high dose groups were higher than the rates for patients treated with etanercept (see Table 11). \n\n \n\nBeyond week 12, efficacy of both the low and the high dose of secukinumab was comparable although \n\nthe efficacy of the high dose was higher for patients ≥50 kg. The safety profiles of the low dose and \n\nthe high dose were comparable and consistent with the safety profile in adults. \n \n\nTable 11 Summary of clinical response in severe paediatric psoriasis at weeks 12 and 52 \n\n(paediatric psoriasis study 1)* \n\n \n\nResponse \n\ncriterion \n\nTreatment comparison 'test' 'control' odds ratio  \n\n'test' vs. 'control' n**/m (%) n**/m (%) estimate (95% CI) p-value \n\nAt week 12*** \n\nPASI 75 secukinumab low dose vs. placebo 32/40 (80.0) 6/41 (14.6) 25.78 (7.08, 114.66) <0.0001 \n\n secukinumab high dose vs. placebo 31/40 (77.5) 6/41 (14.6) 22.65 (6.31, 98.93) <0.0001 \n\n secukinumab low dose vs. etanercept 32/40 (80.0) 26/41 (63.4) 2.25 (0.73, 7.38)  \n\n secukinumab high dose vs. etanercept 31/40 (77.5) 26/41 (63.4) 1.92 (0.64, 6.07)  \n\nIGA 0/1 secukinumab low dose vs. placebo 28/40 (70.0) 2/41 (4.9) 51.77 (10.02, 538.64) <0.0001 \n\n secukinumab high dose vs. placebo 24/40 (60.0) 2/41 (4.9) 32.52 (6.48, 329.52) <0.0001 \n\n secukinumab low dose vs. etanercept 28/40 (70.0) 14/41 (34.1) 4.49 (1.60, 13.42)  \n\n secukinumab high dose vs. etanercept 24/40 (60.0) 14/41 (34.1) 2.86 (1.05, 8.13)  \n\nPASI 90 secukinumab low dose vs. placebo 29/40 (72.5) 1/41 (2.4) 133.67 (16.83, 6395.22) <0.0001 \n\n secukinumab high dose vs. placebo 27/40 (67.5) 1/41 (2.4) 102.86 (13.22, 4850.13) <0.0001 \n\n secukinumab low dose vs. etanercept 29/40 (72.5) 12/41 (29.3) 7.03 (2.34, 23.19)  \n\n secukinumab high dose vs. etanercept 27/40 (67.5) 12/41 (29.3) 5.32 (1.82, 16.75)  \n\nAt week 52 \n\nPASI 75 secukinumab low dose vs. etanercept 35/40 (87.5) 28/41 (68.3) 3.12 (0.91, 12.52)  \n\nsecukinumab high dose vs. etanercept 35/40 (87.5) 28/41 (68.3) 3.09 (0.90, 12.39)  \n\nIGA 0/1 secukinumab low dose vs. etanercept 29/40 (72.5) 23/41 (56.1) 2.02 (0.73, 5.77)  \n\nsecukinumab high dose vs. etanercept 30/40 (75.0) 23/41 (56.1) 2.26 (0.81, 6.62)  \n\nPASI 90 secukinumab low dose vs. etanercept 30/40 (75.0) 21/41 (51.2) 2.85 (1.02, 8.38)  \n\nsecukinumab high dose vs. etanercept 32/40 (80.0) 21/41 (51.2) 3.69 (1.27, 11.61)  \n\n* non-responder imputation was used to handle missing values \n\n** n is the number of responders, m = number of patients evaluable \n\n*** extended visit window at week 12 \n\nOdds ratio, 95% confidence interval, and p-value are from an exact logistic regression model with treatment \n\ngroup, baseline body-weight category and age category as factors \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\nA higher proportion of paediatric patients treated with secukinumab reported improvement in health-\n\nrelated quality of life as measured by a CDLQI score of 0 or 1 compared to placebo at week 12 (low \n\ndose 44.7%, high dose 50%, placebo 15%).

In the high dose group, 61.9% and 60.5% achieved a CDLQI 0 or 1 score at weeks 12 \n\nand 24, respectively. \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nCosentyx in plaque psoriasis in paediatric patients aged from birth to less than 6 years and in chronic \n\nidiopathic arthritis for paediatric patients aged from birth to less than 2 years (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nCosentyx in chronic idiopathic arthritis for paediatric patients aged from 2 years to less than 18 years \n\n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nMost pharmacokinetics properties observed in patients with plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and \n\nankylosing spondylitis were similar. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nFollowing a single subcutaneous dose of 300 mg as a liquid formulation in healthy volunteers, \n\nsecukinumab reached peak serum concentrations of 43.2±10.4 μg/ml between 2 and 14 days post dose. \n\n \n\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following a single subcutaneous dose of either 150 mg \nor 300 mg in plaque psoriasis patients, secukinumab reached peak serum concentrations of \n\n13.7±4.8 µg/ml or 27.3±9.5 µg/ml, respectively, between 5 and 6 days post dose. \n\n \n\nAfter initial weekly dosing during the first month, time to reach the maximum concentration was \n\nbetween 31 and 34 days based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. \n\n \n\nOn the basis of simulated data, peak concentrations at steady-state (Cmax,ss) following subcutaneous \n\nadministration of 150 mg or 300 mg were 27.6 µg/ml and 55.2 µg/ml, respectively. Population \n\npharmacokinetic analysis suggests that steady-state is reached after 20 weeks with monthly dosing \n\nregimens. \n\n \n\nCompared with exposure after a single dose, the population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that \n\npatients exhibited a 2-fold increase in peak serum concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) \n\nfollowing repeated monthly dosing during maintenance. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis showed that secukinumab was absorbed with an average absolute \n\nbioavailability of 73% in patients with plaque psoriasis. Across studies, absolute bioavailabilities in \n\nthe range between 60 and 77% were calculated. \n\n \n\nThe bioavailability of secukinumab in PsA patients was 85% on the basis of the population \n\npharmacokinetic model. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe mean volume of distribution during the terminal phase (Vz) following single intravenous \n\nadministration ranged from 7.10 to 8.60 litres in plaque psoriasis patients, suggesting that \n\nsecukinumab undergoes limited distribution to peripheral compartments. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nThe majority of IgG elimination occurs via intracellular catabolism, following fluid-phase or receptor \n\nmediated endocytosis. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nMean systemic clearance (CL) following a single intravenous administration to patients with plaque \npsoriasis ranged from 0.13 to 0.36 l/day. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the mean systemic \n\nclearance (CL) was 0.19 l/day in plaque psoriasis patients. The CL was not impacted by gender. \n\nClearance was dose- and time-independent. \n\n \n\nThe mean elimination half-life, as estimated from population pharmacokinetic analysis, was 27 days in \n\nplaque psoriasis patients, ranging from 18 to 46 days across psoriasis studies with intravenous \n\nadministration. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nThe single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics of secukinumab in plaque psoriasis patients were \n\ndetermined in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 1x 0.3 mg/kg to 3x 10 mg/kg and \n\nwith subcutaneous doses ranging from 1x 25 mg to multiple doses of 300 mg. Exposure was dose \n\nproportional across all dosing regimens. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis with a limited number of elderly patients (n=71 for age \n\n≥65 years and n=7 for age ≥75 years), clearance in elderly patients and patients less than 65 years of \n\nage was similar. \n\n \n\nPatients with renal or hepatic impairment \n\nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. The renal \n\nelimination of intact secukinumab, an IgG monoclonal antibody, is expected to be low and of minor \n\nimportance. IgGs are mainly eliminated via catabolism and hepatic impairment is not expected to \n\ninfluence clearance of secukinumab. \n\n \n\nEffect of weight on pharmacokinetics \n\nSecukinumab clearance and volume of distribution increase as body weight increases. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn a pool of the two paediatric studies, patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (6 to less than \n\n18 years of age) were administered secukinumab at the recommended paediatric dosing regimen. At \n\nweek 24, patients weighing ≥25 and <50 kg had a mean ± SD steady-state trough concentration of \n\n19.8 ± 6.96 µg/ml (n=24) after 75 mg of secukinumab and patients weighing ≥50 kg had mean ±SD \n\ntrough concentration of 27.3 ± 10.1 µg/ml (n=36) after 150 mg of secukinumab. The mean ± SD \n\nsteady-state trough concentration in patients weighing <25 kg (n=8) was 32.6 ± 10.8 µg/ml at week 24 \n\nafter 75 mg dose. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans (adult or paediatric) based on conventional \n\nstudies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose and reproductive toxicity, or tissue cross-reactivity. \n\n \n\nAnimal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of secukinumab. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Do not shake or invert the vial. \n\n6. Keep the vial standing at room temperature for a minimum of 10 minutes to allow for \n\ndissolution. Note that foaming of the solution may occur. \n\n7. Tilt the vial to an angle of approx. 45° and gently rotate between the fingertips for approx. \n\n1 minute. Do not shake or invert the vial. \n\n8. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed at room temperature for approximately 5 minutes. The \n\nresulting solution should be clear. Its colour may vary from colourless to slightly yellow. Do not \n\nuse if the lyophilised powder has not fully dissolved or if the liquid contains easily visible \n\nparticles, is cloudy or is distinctly brown. \n\n9. Prepare the required number of vials (2 vials for the 300 mg dose). \n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\nUse in the paediatric population \n\n \n\nFor paediatric patients receiving the 75 mg dose, it is currently recommended to use the single-use vial \n\ncontaining 150 mg secukinumab for reconstitution with sterile water for injections. Slightly more than \n\n0.5 ml of the reconstituted solution for subcutaneous injection have to be withdrawn and the rest of the \n\nsolution must be discarded immediately. Detailed instructions for use are provided in the package \n\nleaflet. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nAdult plaque psoriasis \n\n \n\nCosentyx is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are \n\ncandidates for systemic therapy. \n\n \n\nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n\n \n\nCosentyx is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in children and \n\nadolescents from the age of 6 years who are candidates for systemic therapy. \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\n \n\nCosentyx, alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for the treatment of active \n\npsoriatic arthritis in adult patients when the response to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic \n\ndrug (DMARD) therapy has been inadequate (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nAxial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) \n\n \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS, radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) \n\nCosentyx is indicated for the treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis in adults who have responded \n\ninadequately to conventional therapy. \n\n \n\nNon-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) \n\nCosentyx is indicated for the treatment of active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with \n\nobjective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic \n\nresonance imaging (MRI) evidence in adults who have responded inadequately to non-steroidal \n\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nCosentyx is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician experienced in the \n\ndiagnosis and treatment of conditions for which Cosentyx is indicated. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nAdult plaque psoriasis \n\nThe recommended dose is 300 mg of secukinumab by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at \n\nweeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by monthly maintenance dosing. Each 300 mg dose is given as one \n\nsubcutaneous injection of 300 mg or as two subcutaneous injections of 150 mg. \n\n \n\nPaediatric plaque psoriasis (adolescents and children from the age of 6 years) \n\nThe recommended dose is based on body weight (Table 1) and administered by subcutaneous injection \n\nwith initial dosing at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by monthly maintenance dosing. Each 75 mg \n\ndose is given as one subcutaneous injection of 75 mg. Each 150 mg dose is given as one subcutaneous \n\ninjection of 150 mg. Each 300 mg dose is given as one subcutaneous injection of 300 mg or as two \n\nsubcutaneous injections of 150 mg. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Recommended dose for paediatric plaque psoriasis \n\n \n\nBody weight at time of dosing Recommended Dose \n\n<25 kg 75 mg \n\n25 to <50 kg 75 mg \n\n≥50 kg 150 mg (*may be increased to 300 mg) \n\n*Some patients may derive additional benefit from the higher dose. \n\n \n\nThe 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe is not indicated for administration to paediatric \n\npatients with a weight <50 kg. The 150 mg powder for solution for injection presentation is \n\nappropriate for administration to this population. \n\n \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\nFor patients with concomitant moderate to severe plaque psoriasis or who are anti-TNFα inadequate \n\nresponders (IR), the recommended dose is 300 mg by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at \n\nweeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by monthly maintenance dosing. Each 300 mg dose is given as one \n\nsubcutaneous injection of 300 mg or as two subcutaneous injections of 150 mg. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\nFor other patients, the recommended dose is 150 mg by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at \n\nweeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by monthly maintenance dosing. Based on clinical response, the dose \n\ncan be increased to 300 mg. \n\n \n\nAxial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS, radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) \n\nThe recommended dose is 150 mg by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and \n\n4, followed by monthly maintenance dosing. Based on clinical response, the dose can be increased to \n\n300 mg. Each 300 mg dose is given as one subcutaneous injection of 300 mg or as two subcutaneous \n\ninjections of 150 mg. \n\n \n\nNon-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) \n\nThe recommended dose is 150 mg by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and \n\n4, followed by monthly maintenance dosing. \n\n \n\nFor all of the above indications, available data suggest that a clinical response is usually achieved \n\nwithin 16 weeks of treatment. Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients \n\nwho have shown no response by 16 weeks of treatment. Some patients with an initial partial response \n\nmay subsequently improve with continued treatment beyond 16 weeks. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly patients (aged 65 years and over) \n\nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment / hepatic impairment \n\nCosentyx has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Cosentyx in children with plaque psoriasis below the age of 6 years have \n\nnot been established. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Cosentyx in children below the age of 18 years in other indications have not \n\nyet been established. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nCosentyx is to be administered by subcutaneous injection. If possible, areas of the skin that show \n\npsoriasis should be avoided as injection sites. The solution in the syringe or pen must not be shaken. \n\n \n\nAfter proper training in subcutaneous injection technique, patients may self-inject Cosentyx or be \n\ninjected by a caregiver if a physician determines that this is appropriate. However, the physician \n\nshould ensure appropriate follow-up of patients. Patients or caregivers should be instructed to inject \n\nthe full amount of Cosentyx according to the instructions provided in the package leaflet. \n\nComprehensive instructions for administration are given in the package leaflet. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nClinically important, active infection, e.g. active tuberculosis (see section 4.4). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nTraceability \n\n \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\nInfections \n\n \n\nSecukinumab has the potential to increase the risk of infections. Serious infections have been observed \n\nin patients receiving secukinumab in the post-marketing setting. Caution should be exercised when \n\nconsidering the use of secukinumab in patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent \n\ninfection. \n\n \n\nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection \n\noccur. If a patient develops a serious infection, the patient should be closely monitored and \n\nsecukinumab should not be administered until the infection resolves. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, infections have been observed in patients receiving secukinumab (see section 4.8). \n\nMost of these were mild or moderate upper respiratory tract infections such as nasopharyngitis and did \n\nnot require treatment discontinuation. \n\n \n\nRelated to the mechanism of action of secukinumab, non-serious mucocutaneous candida infections \n\nwere more frequently reported for secukinumab than placebo in the psoriasis clinical studies (3.55 per \n\n100 patient years for secukinumab 300 mg versus 1.00 per 100 patient years for placebo) (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\nNo increased susceptibility to tuberculosis was reported from clinical studies. However, secukinumab \n\nshould not be given to patients with active tuberculosis. Anti-tuberculosis therapy should be \n\nconsidered prior to initiation of secukinumab in patients with latent tuberculosis. \n\n \n\nInflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) \n\n \n\nCases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease have been reported with secukinumab \n\n(see section 4.8). Secukinumab is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. If a \n\npatient develops signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease or experiences an exacerbation of \n\npre-existing inflammatory bowel disease, secukinumab should be discontinued and appropriate \n\nmedical management should be initiated. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, rare cases of anaphylactic reactions have been observed in patients receiving \n\nsecukinumab. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reactions occur, administration of \n\nsecukinumab should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. \n\n \n\nLatex-sensitive individuals – Cosentyx 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe and 150 mg \n\nsolution for injection in pre-filled pen only \n\n \n\nThe removable needle cap of Cosentyx 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe and \n\nCosentyx 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen contains a derivative of natural rubber latex. \n\nNo natural rubber latex has to date been detected in the removable needle cap. Nevertheless, the use of \n\nCosentyx 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe and Cosentyx 150 mg solution for \n\ninjection in pre-filled pen in latex-sensitive individuals has not been studied and there is therefore a \n\npotential risk of hypersensitivity reactions which cannot be completely ruled out. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\nVaccinations \n\n \n\nLive vaccines should not be given concurrently with secukinumab. \n\n \n\nPatients receiving secukinumab may receive concurrent inactivated or non-live vaccinations. In a \n\nstudy, after meningococcal and inactivated influenza vaccinations, a similar proportion of healthy \n\nvolunteers treated with 150 mg of secukinumab and those treated with placebo were able to mount an \n\nadequate immune response of at least a 4-fold increase in antibody titres to meningococcal and \n\ninfluenza vaccines. The data suggest that secukinumab does not suppress the humoral immune \n\nresponse to the meningococcal or influenza vaccines. \n\n \n\nPrior to initiating therapy with Cosentyx, it is recommended that paediatric patients receive all \n\nage-appropriate immunisations as per current immunisation guidelines. \n\n \n\nConcomitant immunosuppressive therapy \n\n \n\nIn psoriasis studies, the safety and efficacy of secukinumab in combination with immunosuppressants, \n\nincluding biologics, or phototherapy have not been evaluated. Secukinumab was administered \n\nconcomitantly with methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine and/or corticosteroids in arthritis studies \n\n(including in patients with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis). Caution should be exercised \n\nwhen considering concomitant use of other immunosuppressants and secukinumab (see also \n\nsection 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nLive vaccines should not be given concurrently with secukinumab (see also section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn a study in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, no interaction was observed between secukinumab \n\nand midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate). \n\n \n\nNo interaction was seen when secukinumab was administered concomitantly with methotrexate \n\n(MTX) and/or corticosteroids in arthritis studies (including in patients with psoriatic arthritis and axial \n\nspondyloarthritis). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential should use an effective method of contraception during treatment \n\nand for at least 20 weeks after treatment. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of secukinumab in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n\n(see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Cosentyx during \n\npregnancy. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether secukinumab is excreted in human milk. Immunoglobulins are excreted in \n\nhuman milk and it is not known if secukinumab is absorbed systemically after ingestion. Because of \n\nthe potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from secukinumab, a decision on whether to \n\ndiscontinue breast-feeding during treatment and up to 20 weeks after treatment or to discontinue \n\ntherapy with Cosentyx must be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and \n\nthe benefit of therapy to the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThe effect of secukinumab on human fertility has not been evaluated. Animal studies do not indicate \n\ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nCosentyx has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are upper respiratory tract infections \n\n(most frequently nasopharyngitis, rhinitis). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nADRs from clinical studies and post-marketing reports (Table 2) are listed by MedDRA system organ \n\nclass. Within each system organ class, the ADRs are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent \n\nreactions first. Within each frequency grouping, adverse drug reactions are presented in order of \n\ndecreasing seriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse drug \n\nreaction is based on the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); \n\nuncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); and not known \n\n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nOver 18,000 patients have been treated with secukinumab in blinded and open-label clinical studies in \n\nvarious indications (plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis and other autoimmune \n\nconditions), representing 30,565 patient years of exposure. Of these, over 11,700 patients were \n\nexposed to secukinumab for at least one year. The safety profile of secukinumab is consistent across \n\nall indications. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\nTable 2 List of adverse reactions in clinical studies1) and post-marketing experience \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reaction \n\nInfections and \n\ninfestations \n\nVery common Upper respiratory tract infections \n\nCommon Oral herpes \n\nTinea pedis \n\nUncommon Oral candidiasis \n\nOtitis externa \n\nLower respiratory tract infections \n\nNot known Mucosal and cutaneous candidiasis (including \n\noesophageal candidiasis) \n\nBlood and lymphatic \n\nsystem disorders \n\nUncommon Neutropenia \n\nImmune system \n\ndisorders \n\nRare Anaphylactic reactions \n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon Headache \n\nEye disorders Uncommon Conjunctivitis \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \n\nand mediastinal \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon Rhinorrhoea \n\nGastrointestinal \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon Diarrhoea \n\nCommon Nausea \n\nUncommon Inflammatory bowel disease \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders \n\nUncommon Urticaria \n\nRare Exfoliative dermatitis2) \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site \n\nconditions \n\nCommon Fatigue \n\n1) Placebo-controlled clinical studies (phase III) in plaque psoriasis, PsA, AS and nr-axSpA patients \n\nexposed to 300 mg, 150 mg, 75 mg or placebo up to 12 weeks (psoriasis) or 16 weeks (PsA, AS and \n\nnr-axSpA) treatment duration \n2) Cases were reported in patients with psoriasis diagnosis \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nInfections \n\nIn the placebo-controlled period of clinical studies in plaque psoriasis (a total of 1,382 patients treated \n\nwith secukinumab and 694 patients treated with placebo for up to 12 weeks), infections were reported \n\nin 28.7% of patients treated with secukinumab compared with 18.9% of patients treated with placebo. \n\nThe majority of infections consisted of non-serious and mild to moderate upper respiratory tract \n\ninfections, such as nasopharyngitis, which did not necessitate treatment discontinuation. There was an \n\nincrease in mucosal or cutaneous candidiasis, consistent with the mechanism of action, but the cases \n\nwere mild or moderate in severity, non-serious, responsive to standard treatment and did not \n\nnecessitate treatment discontinuation. Serious infections occurred in 0.14% of patients treated with \n\nsecukinumab and in 0.3% of patients treated with placebo (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nOver the entire treatment period (a total of 3,430 patients treated with secukinumab for up to 52 weeks \n\nfor the majority of patients), infections were reported in 47.5% of patients treated with secukinumab \n\n(0.9 per patient-year of follow-up). Serious infections were reported in 1.2% of patients treated with \n\nsecukinumab (0.015 per patient-year of follow-up). \n\n \n\nInfection rates observed in psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and \n\nnon-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) clinical studies were similar to those observed in the \n\npsoriasis studies. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\nNeutropenia \n\nIn psoriasis phase III clinical studies, neutropenia was more frequently observed with secukinumab \n\nthan with placebo, but most cases were mild, transient and reversible. Neutropenia <1.0-0.5x109/l \n\n(CTCAE grade 3) was reported in 18 out of 3,430 (0.5%) patients on secukinumab, with no dose \n\ndependence and no temporal relationship to infections in 15 out of 18 cases. There were no reported \n\ncases of more severe neutropenia. Non-serious infections with usual response to standard care and not \n\nrequiring discontinuation of secukinumab were reported in the remaining 3 cases. \n\n \n\nThe frequency of neutropenia in psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis \n\nand non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) was similar to psoriasis. \n\n \n\nRare cases of neutropenia <0.5x109/l (CTCAE grade 4) were reported. \n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\nIn clinical studies, urticaria and rare cases of anaphylactic reaction to secukinumab were observed (see \n\nalso section 4.4). \n\n \n\nImmunogenicity \n\nIn psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and non-\n\nradiographic axial spondyloarthritis) clinical studies, less than 1% of patients treated with \n\nsecukinumab developed antibodies to secukinumab up to 52 weeks of treatment. About half of the \n\ntreatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies were neutralising, but this was not associated with loss of \n\nefficacy or pharmacokinetic abnormalities. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nUndesirable effects in paediatric patients from the age of 6 years with plaque psoriasis \n\nThe safety of secukinumab was assessed in two phase III studies in paediatric patients with plaque \n\npsoriasis. The first study (paediatric study 1) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of \n\n162 patients from 6 to less than 18 years of age with severe plaque psoriasis. The second study \n\n(paediatric study 2) is an open-label study of 84 patients from 6 to less than 18 years of age with \n\nmoderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The safety profile reported in these two studies was consistent \n\nwith the safety profile reported in adult plaque psoriasis patients. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nDoses up to 30 mg/kg (approximately 2000 to 3000 mg) have been administered intravenously in \n\nclinical studies without dose-limiting toxicity. In the event of overdose, it is recommended that the \n\npatient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic \n\ntreatment be instituted immediately. \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC10 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nSecukinumab is a fully human IgG1/κ monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to and neutralises \n\nthe proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A). Secukinumab works by targeting IL-17A and \n\ninhibiting its interaction with the IL-17 receptor, which is expressed on various cell types including \n\nkeratinocytes. As a result, secukinumab inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines \n\nand mediators of tissue damage and reduces IL-17A-mediated contributions to autoimmune and \n\ninflammatory diseases. Clinically relevant levels of secukinumab reach the skin and reduce local \n\ninflammatory markers. As a direct consequence treatment with secukinumab reduces erythema, \n\ninduration and desquamation present in plaque psoriasis lesions. \n\n \n\nIL-17A is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune \n\nresponses. IL-17A plays a key role in the pathogenesis of plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and axial \n\nspondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) and is \n\nup-regulated in lesional skin in contrast to non-lesional skin of plaque psoriasis patients and in \n\nsynovial tissue of psoriatic arthritis patients. The frequency of IL-17-producing cells was also \n\nsignificantly higher in the subchondral bone marrow of facet joints from patients with ankylosing \n\nspondylitis. Increased numbers of IL-17A producing lymphocytes have also been found in patients \n\nwith non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. Inhibition of IL-17A was shown to be effective in the \n\ntreatment of ankylosing spondylitis, thus establishing the key role of this cytokine in axial \n\nspondyloarthritis. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nSerum levels of total IL-17A (free and secukinumab-bound IL-17A) are initially increased in patients \n\nreceiving secukinumab. This is followed by a slow decrease due to reduced clearance of \n\nsecukinumab-bound IL-17A, indicating that secukinumab selectively captures free IL-17A, which \n\nplays a key role in the pathogenesis of plaque psoriasis. \n\n \n\nIn a study with secukinumab, infiltrating epidermal neutrophils and various neutrophil-associated \n\nmarkers that are increased in lesional skin of plaque psoriasis patients were significantly reduced after \n\none to two weeks of treatment. \n\n \n\nSecukinumab has been shown to lower (within 1 to 2 weeks of treatment) levels of C-reactive protein, \n\nwhich is a marker of inflammation. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nAdult plaque psoriasis \n\nThe safety and efficacy of secukinumab were assessed in four randomised, double-blind, \n\nplacebo-controlled phase III studies in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who were \n\ncandidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy [ERASURE, FIXTURE, FEATURE, JUNCTURE]. \n\nThe efficacy and safety of secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg were evaluated versus either placebo or \n\netanercept. In addition, one study assessed a chronic treatment regimen versus a “retreatment as \n\nneeded” regimen [SCULPTURE]. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\nOf the 2,403 patients who were included in the placebo-controlled studies, 79% were biologic-naive, \n\n45% were non-biologic failures and 8% were biologic failures (6% were anti-TNF failures, and 2% \n\nwere anti-p40 failures). Approximately 15 to 25% of patients in phase III studies had psoriatic arthritis \n\n(PsA) at baseline. \n\n \n\nPsoriasis study 1 (ERASURE) evaluated 738 patients. Patients randomised to secukinumab received \n\n150 mg or 300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by the same dose every month. Psoriasis \n\nstudy 2 (FIXTURE) evaluated 1,306 patients. Patients randomised to secukinumab received 150 mg or \n\n300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by the same dose every month. Patients randomised \n\nto etanercept received 50 mg doses twice per week for 12 weeks followed by 50 mg every week. In \n\nboth study 1 and study 2, patients randomised to receive placebo who were non-responders at week 12 \n\nthen crossed over to receive secukinumab (either 150 mg or 300 mg) at weeks 12, 13, 14, and 15, \n\nfollowed by the same dose every month starting at week 16. All patients were followed for up to \n\n52 weeks following first administration of study treatment. \n\n \n\nPsoriasis study 3 (FEATURE) evaluated 177 patients using a pre-filled syringe compared with placebo \n\nafter 12 weeks of treatment to assess the safety, tolerability, and usability of secukinumab \n\nself-administration via the pre-filled syringe. Psoriasis study 4 (JUNCTURE) evaluated 182 patients \n\nusing a pre-filled pen compared with placebo after 12 weeks of treatment to assess the safety, \n\ntolerability, and usability of secukinumab self-administration via the pre-filled pen. In both study 3 \n\nand study 4, patients randomised to secukinumab received 150 mg or 300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 \n\nand 4, followed by the same dose every month. Patients were also randomised to receive placebo at \n\nweeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by the same dose every month. \n\n \n\nPsoriasis study 5 (SCULPTURE) evaluated 966 patients. All patients received secukinumab 150 mg or \n\n300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 12 and then were randomised to receive either a \n\nmaintenance regimen of the same dose every month starting at week 12 or a “retreatment as needed” \n\nregimen of the same dose. Patients randomised to “retreatment as needed” did not achieve adequate \n\nmaintenance of response and therefore a fixed monthly maintenance regimen is recommended. \n\n \n\nThe co-primary endpoints in the placebo and active-controlled studies were the proportion of patients \n\nwho achieved a PASI 75 response and IGA mod 2011 “clear” or “almost clear” response versus \n\nplacebo at week 12 (see Tables 3 and 4). The 300 mg dose provided improved skin clearance \n\nparticularly for “clear” or “almost clear” skin across the efficacy endpoints of PASI 90, PASI 100, and \n\nIGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response across all studies with peak effects seen at week 16, therefore this dose \n\nis recommended. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\nTable 3 Summary of PASI 50/75/90/100 & IGA⃰ mod 2011 “clear” or “almost clear” clinical \n\nresponse in psoriasis studies 1, 3 and 4 (ERASURE, FEATURE and JUNCTURE) \n\n \n Week 12 Week 16 Week 52 \n\n Placebo 150 mg 300 mg 150 mg 300 mg 150 mg 300 mg \n\nStudy 1 \n\nNumber of patients 246 244 245 244 245 244 245 \n\nPASI 50 response n (%) 22 \n(8.9%) \n\n203 \n\n(83.5%) \n\n222 \n\n(90.6%) \n\n212 \n\n(87.2%) \n\n224 \n\n(91.4%) \n\n187 \n\n(77%) \n\n207 \n\n(84.5%) \n\nPASI 75 response n (%) 11 \n(4.5%) \n\n174 \n\n(71.6%)** \n\n200 \n\n(81.6%)** \n\n188 \n\n(77.4%) \n\n211 \n\n(86.1%) \n\n146 \n\n(60.1%) \n\n182 \n\n(74.3%) \n\nPASI 90 response n (%) 3 (1.2%) 95 \n(39.1%)** \n\n145 \n\n(59.2%)** \n\n130 \n\n(53.5%) \n\n171 \n\n(69.8%) \n\n88 \n\n(36.2%) \n\n147 \n\n(60.0%) \n\nPASI 100 response n (%) 2 (0.8%) 31 \n(12.8%) \n\n70 \n\n(28.6%) \n\n51 \n\n(21.0%) \n\n102 \n\n(41.6%) \n\n49 \n\n(20.2%) \n\n96 \n\n(39.2%) \n\nIGA mod 2011 “clear” or \n\n“almost clear” response \n\nn (%) \n\n6 \n\n(2.40%) \n\n125 \n\n(51.2%)** \n\n160 \n\n(65.3%)** \n\n142 \n\n(58.2%) \n\n180 \n\n(73.5%) \n\n101 \n\n(41.4%) \n\n148 \n\n(60.4%) \n\nStudy 3 \nNumber of patients  59 59 58 - - - - \n\nPASI 50 response n (%) 3 (5.1%) 51 \n(86.4%) \n\n51 \n\n(87.9%) \n\n- - - - \n\nPASI 75 response n (%) 0 (0.0%) 41 \n(69.5%)** \n\n44 \n\n(75.9%)** \n\n- - - - \n\nPASI 90 response n (%) 0 (0.0%) 27 \n(45.8%) \n\n35 \n\n(60.3%) \n\n- - - - \n\nPASI 100 response n (%) 0 (0.0%) 5 \n(8.5%) \n\n25 \n\n(43.1%) \n\n- - - - \n\nIGA mod 2011 “clear” or \n\n“almost clear” response \n\nn (%) \n\n0 (0.0%) 31 \n\n(52.5%)** \n\n40 \n\n(69.0%)** \n\n- - - - \n\nStudy 4 \nNumber of patients  61 60 60 - - - - \n\nPASI 50 response n (%) 5 (8.2%) 48 \n(80.0%) \n\n58 \n\n(96.7%) \n\n- - - - \n\nPASI 75 response n (%) 2 (3.3%) 43 \n(71.7%)** \n\n52 \n\n(86.7%)** \n\n- - - - \n\nPASI 90 response n (%) 0 (0.0%) 24 \n(40.0%) \n\n33 \n\n(55.0%) \n\n- - - - \n\nPASI 100 response n(%) 0 (0.0%) 10 \n(16.7%) \n\n16 \n\n(26.7%) \n\n- - - - \n\nIGA mod 2011 “clear” or \n\n“almost clear” response \n\nn (%) \n\n0 (0.0%) 32 \n\n(53.3%)** \n\n44 \n\n(73.3%)** \n\n- - - - \n\n* The IGA mod 2011 is a 5-category scale including “0 = clear”, “1 = almost clear”, “2 = mild”, “3 = \n\nmoderate” or “4 = severe”, indicating the physician’s overall assessment of the psoriasis severity focusing \n\non induration, erythema and scaling.

In the \n\nTRANSFIGURE study, secukinumab was superior to placebo at week 16 (46.1% for 300 mg, 38.4% \n\nfor 150 mg and 11.7% for placebo) as assessed by significant improvement from baseline in the Nail \n\nPsoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI %) for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis with nail \n\ninvolvement. In the GESTURE study, secukinumab was superior to placebo at week 16 (33.3% for \n\n300 mg, 22.1% for 150 mg, and 1.5% for placebo) as assessed by significant improvement of ppIGA 0 \n\nor 1 response (“clear” or “almost clear”) for patients with moderate to severe palmoplantar plaque \n\npsoriasis. \n\n \n\nA placebo-controlled study evaluated 102 patients with moderate to severe scalp psoriasis, defined as \n\nhaving a Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) score of ≥12, an IGA mod 2011 scalp only score of 3 \n\nor greater and at least 30% of the scalp surface area affected. Secukinumab 300 mg was superior to \n\nplacebo at week 12 as assessed by significant improvement from baseline in both the PSSI 90 response \n\n(52.9% versus 2.0%) and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 scalp only response (56.9% versus 5.9%). \n\nImprovement in both endpoints was sustained for secukinumab patients who continued treatment \n\nthrough to week 24. \n\n \n\nQuality of life/patient-reported outcomes \n\nStatistically significant improvements at week 12 (studies 1-4) from baseline compared to placebo \n\nwere demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). Mean decreases (improvements) in \n\nDLQI from baseline ranged from -10.4 to -11.6 with secukinumab 300 mg, from -7.7 to -10.1 with \n\nsecukinumab 150 mg, versus -1.1 to -1.9 for placebo at week 12. These improvements were \n\nmaintained for 52 weeks (studies 1 and 2). \n\n \n\nForty percent of the participants in studies 1 and 2 completed the Psoriasis Symptom Diary©. For the \n\nparticipants completing the diary in each of these studies, statistically significant improvements at \n\nweek 12 from baseline compared to placebo in patient-reported signs and symptoms of itching, pain \n\nand scaling were demonstrated. \n\n \n\nStatistically significant improvements at week 4 from baseline in patients treated with secukinumab \n\ncompared to patients treated with ustekinumab (CLEAR) were demonstrated in the DLQI and these \n\nimprovements were maintained for up to 52 weeks. \n\n \n\nPASI % change \n\nfrom baseline \n\nWeeks of treatment \n\nn = number of patients evaluable \n\n secukinumab 150 mg (n=243)   secukinumab 300 mg (n=245)    Placebo (n=245) \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n\nStatistically significant improvements in patient-reported signs and symptoms of itching, pain and \n\nscaling at week 16 and week 52 (CLEAR) were demonstrated in the Psoriasis Symptom Diary© in \n\npatients treated with secukinumab compared to patients treated with ustekinumab. \n\n \n\nStatistically significant improvements (decreases) at week 12 from baseline in the scalp psoriasis study \n\nwere demonstrated in patient reported signs and symptoms of scalp itching, pain and scaling compared \n\nto placebo. \n\n \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\nThe safety and efficacy of secukinumab were assessed in 1,999 patients in three randomised, \n\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled phase III studies in patients with active psoriatic arthritis (≥3 swollen \n\nand ≥3 tender joints) despite non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), corticosteroid or \n\ndisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy. Patients with each subtype of PsA were \n\nenrolled in these studies, including polyarticular arthritis with no evidence of rheumatoid nodules, \n\nspondylitis with peripheral arthritis, asymmetric peripheral arthritis, distal interphalangeal \n\ninvolvement and arthritis mutilans. Patients in these studies had a diagnosis of PsA of at least five \n\nyears. The majority of patients also had active psoriasis skin lesions or a documented history of \n\npsoriasis. Over 61% and 42% of the PsA patients had enthesitis and dactylitis at baseline, respectively. \n\nFor all studies, the primary endpoint was American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response. For \n\nPsoriatic Arthritis study 1 (PsA study 1) and Psoriatic Arthritis study 2 (PsA study 2), the primary \n\nendpoint was at week 24. For Psoriatic Arthritis study 3 (PsA study 3), the primary endpoint was at \n\nweek 16 with the key secondary endpoint, the change from baseline in modified Total Sharp Score \n\n(mTSS), at week 24. \n\n \n\nIn PsA study 1, PsA study 2 and PsA study 3, 29%, 35% and 30% of patients, respectively, were \n\npreviously treated with an anti-TNFα agent and discontinued the anti-TNFα agent for either lack of \n\nefficacy or intolerance (anti-TNFα-IR patients). \n\n \n\nPsA study 1 (FUTURE 1) evaluated 606 patients, of whom 60.7% had concomitant MTX. Patients \n\nrandomised to secukinumab received 10 mg/kg intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 4, followed by either \n\n75 mg or 150 mg subcutaneously every month starting at week 8. Patients randomised to placebo who \n\nwere non-responders at week 16 (early rescue) and other placebo patients at week 24 were crossed \n\nover to receive secukinumab (either 75 mg or 150 mg subcutaneously) followed by the same dose \n\nevery month. \n\n \n\nPsA study 2 (FUTURE 2) evaluated 397 patients, of whom 46.6% had concomitant MTX. Patients \n\nrandomised to secukinumab received 75 mg, 150 mg or 300 mg subcutaneously at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and \n\n4, followed by the same dose every month. Patients randomised to receive placebo who were \n\nnon-responders at week 16 (early rescue) were crossed over to receive secukinumab (either 150 mg or \n\n300 mg subcutaneously) at week 16 followed by the same dose every month. Patients randomised to \n\nreceive placebo who were responders at week 16 were crossed over to receive secukinumab (either \n\n150 mg or 300 mg subcutaneously) at week 24 followed by the same dose every month. \n\n \n\nPsA study 3 (FUTURE 5) evaluated 996 patients, of whom 50.1% had concomitant MTX.

In PsA study 2, at week 24, secukinumab-\n\ntreated patients with concomitant MTX use had a higher ACR 20 response (47.7% and 54.4% for \n\n150 mg and 300 mg, respectively, compared to placebo 20.0%) and ACR 50 response (31.8% and \n\n38.6% for 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively, compared to placebo 8.0%). Secukinumab-treated \n\npatients without concomitant MTX use had a higher ACR 20 response (53.6% and 53.6% for 150 mg \n\nand 300 mg, respectively, compared to placebo 10.4%) and ACR 50 response (37.5% and 32.1% for \n\n150 mg and 300 mg, respectively, compared to placebo 6.3%). \n\n \n\nIn PsA study 2, both anti-TNFα-naive and anti-TNFα-IR secukinumab-treated patients had a \n\nsignificantly higher ACR 20 response compared to placebo at week 24, with a slightly higher response \n\nin the anti-TNFα-naive group (anti-TNFα-naive: 64% and 58% for 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively, \n\ncompared to placebo 15.9%; anti-TNFα-IR: 30% and 46% for 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively, \n\ncompared to placebo 14.3%). In the anti-TNFα-IR patients subgroup, only the 300 mg dose showed \n\nsignificantly higher response rate for ACR 20 compared to placebo (p<0.05) and demonstrated clinical \n\nmeaningful benefit over 150 mg on multiple secondary endpoints. Improvements in the PASI 75 \n\nresponse were seen in both subgroups and the 300 mg dose showed statistically significant benefit in \n\nthe anti-TNFα-IR patients. \n\n \n\nThe number of PsA patients with axial involvement was too small to allow meaningful assessment. \n\n \n\nImprovements were shown in all components of the ACR scores, including patient assessment of pain. \n\nIn PsA study 2, the proportion of patients achieving a modified PsA Response Criteria (PsARC) \n\nresponse was greater in the secukinumab-treated patients (59.0% and 61.0% for 150 mg and 300 mg, \n\nrespectively) compared to placebo (26.5%) at week 24. \n \n\nIn PsA study 1 and PsA study 2, efficacy was maintained up to week 104. In PsA study 2, among \n\n200 patients initially randomised to secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg, 178 (89%) patients were still \n\non treatment at week 52. Of the 100 patients randomised to secukinumab 150 mg, 64, 39 and 20 had \n\nan ACR 20/50/70 response, respectively. Of the 100 patients randomised to secukinumab 300 mg, 64, \n\n44 and 24 had an ACR 20/50/70 response, respectively. \n\n \n\nRadiographic response \n\nIn PsA study 3, inhibition of progression of structural damage was assessed radiographically and \n\nexpressed by the modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) and its components, the Erosion Score (ES) and \n\nthe Joint Space Narrowing Score (JSN). Radiographs of hands, wrists, and feet were obtained at \n\nbaseline, week 16 and/or week 24 and scored independently by at least two readers who were blinded \n\nto treatment group and visit number. Secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg treatment significantly \n\ninhibited the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage compared with placebo treatment as \n\nmeasured by change from baseline in mTSS at week 24 (Table 7). \n\n \n\nInhibition of progression of structural damage was also assessed in PsA study 1 at weeks 24 and 52, \n\ncompared to baseline.

Patients randomised to placebo who were non-responders at week 16 (early rescue) \n\nand all other placebo patients at week 24 were crossed over to receive secukinumab (either 75 mg or \n\n150 mg subcutaneously), followed by the same dose every month. \n\n \n\nAS study 2 (MEASURE 2) evaluated 219 patients, of whom 11.9% and 14.2% used concomitant \n\nMTX or sulfasalazine, respectively. Patients randomised to secukinumab received 75 mg or 150 mg \n\nsubcutaneously at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, followed by the same dose every month. At week 16, \n\npatients who were randomised to placebo at baseline were re-randomised to receive secukinumab \n\n(either 75 mg or 150 mg subcutaneously) every month. \n\n \n\nAS study 3 (MEASURE 3) evaluated 226 patients, of whom 13.3% and 23.5% used concomitant \n\nMTX or sulfasalazine, respectively. Patients randomised to secukinumab received 10 mg/kg \n\nintravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 4, followed by either 150 mg or 300 mg subcutaneously every month. \n\nAt week 16, patients who were randomised to placebo at baseline were re-randomised to receive \n\nsecukinumab (either 150 mg or 300 mg subcutaneously) every month.

Patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg also \n\nshowed statistically significant improvements on exploratory endpoints in physical function as \n\nassessed by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) compared to placebo (-2.15 \n\nversus -0.68), and in fatigue as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-\n\nFatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) scale compared to placebo (8.10 versus 3.30). These improvements were \n\nsustained up to week 52. \n\n \n\nNon-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) \n\nThe safety and efficacy of secukinumab were assessed in 555 patients in one randomised, \n\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study (PREVENT), consisting of a 2-year core phase and a \n\n2-year extension phase, in patients with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) \n\nfulfilling the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS) classification criteria for \n\naxial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) with no radiographic evidence of changes in the sacroiliac joints that \n\nwould meet the modified New York criteria for ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Patients enrolled had \n\nactive disease, defined as a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) ≥4, a \n\nVisual Analogue Scale (VAS) for total back pain of ≥40 (on a scale of 0-100 mm), despite current or \n\nprevious non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy and increased C-reactive protein \n\n(CRP) and/or evidence of sacroiliitis on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

Approximately 43% of the patients had prior \n\nexposure to phototherapy, 53% to conventional systemic therapy, 3% to biologics, and 9% had \n\nconcomitant psoriatic arthritis. \n\n \nThe paediatric psoriasis study 1 evaluated 162 patients who were randomised to receive low dose \n\nsecukinumab (75 mg for body weight <50 kg or 150 mg for body weight ≥50 kg), high dose \n\nsecukinumab (75 mg for body weight <25 kg, 150 mg for body weight between ≥25 kg and <50 kg, or \n\n300 mg for body weight ≥50 kg), or placebo at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 followed by the same dose \n\nevery 4 weeks, or etanercept. Patients randomised to etanercept received 0.8 mg/kg weekly (up to a \n\nmaximum of 50 mg).

The co-\n\nprimary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 response and IGA mod \n\n2011 ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ (0 or 1) response at week 12. \n\n \n\nDuring the 12 week placebo-controlled period, the efficacy of both the low and the high dose of \n\nsecukinumab was comparable for the co-primary endpoints. The odds ratio estimates in favour of both \n\nsecukinumab doses were statistically significant for both the PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 \n\nresponses. \n\n \n\nAll patients were followed for efficacy and safety during the 52 weeks following the first dose. The \n\nproportion of patients achieving PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ (0 or 1) \n\nresponses showed separation between secukinumab treatment groups and placebo at the first post-\n\nbaseline visit at week 4, the difference becoming more prominent at week 12. The response was \n\nmaintained throughout the 52 week time period (see Table 11). Improvement in PASI 50, 90, 100 \n\nresponder rates and Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) scores of 0 or 1 were also \n\nmaintained throughout the 52 week time period. \n\n \n\nIn addition, PASI 75, IGA 0 or 1, PASI 90 response rates at weeks 12 and 52 for both secukinumab \n\nlow and high dose groups were higher than the rates for patients treated with etanercept (see Table 11). \n\n \n\nBeyond week 12, efficacy of both the low and the high dose of secukinumab was comparable although \n\nthe efficacy of the high dose was higher for patients ≥50 kg. The safety profiles of the low dose and \n\nthe high dose were comparable and consistent with the safety profile in adults. \n \n\nTable 11 Summary of clinical response in severe paediatric psoriasis at weeks 12 and 52 \n\n(paediatric psoriasis study 1)* \n\n \n\nResponse \n\ncriterion \n\nTreatment comparison 'test' 'control' odds ratio  \n\n'test' vs. 'control' n**/m (%) n**/m (%) estimate (95% CI) p-value \n\nAt week 12*** \n\nPASI 75 secukinumab low dose vs. placebo 32/40 (80.0) 6/41 (14.6) 25.78 (7.08, 114.66) <0.0001 \n\n secukinumab high dose vs. placebo 31/40 (77.5) 6/41 (14.6) 22.65 (6.31, 98.93) <0.0001 \n\n secukinumab low dose vs. etanercept 32/40 (80.0) 26/41 (63.4) 2.25 (0.73, 7.38)  \n\n secukinumab high dose vs. etanercept 31/40 (77.5) 26/41 (63.4) 1.92 (0.64, 6.07)  \n\nIGA 0/1 secukinumab low dose vs. placebo 28/40 (70.0) 2/41 (4.9) 51.77 (10.02, 538.64) <0.0001 \n\n secukinumab high dose vs. placebo 24/40 (60.0) 2/41 (4.9) 32.52 (6.48, 329.52) <0.0001 \n\n secukinumab low dose vs. etanercept 28/40 (70.0) 14/41 (34.1) 4.49 (1.60, 13.42)  \n\n secukinumab high dose vs. etanercept 24/40 (60.0) 14/41 (34.1) 2.86 (1.05, 8.13)  \n\nPASI 90 secukinumab low dose vs. placebo 29/40 (72.5) 1/41 (2.4) 133.67 (16.83, 6395.22) <0.0001 \n\n secukinumab high dose vs. placebo 27/40 (67.5) 1/41 (2.4) 102.86 (13.22, 4850.13) <0.0001 \n\n secukinumab low dose vs. etanercept 29/40 (72.5) 12/41 (29.3) 7.03 (2.34, 23.19)  \n\n secukinumab high dose vs. etanercept 27/40 (67.5) 12/41 (29.3) 5.32 (1.82, 16.75)  \n\nAt week 52 \n\nPASI 75 secukinumab low dose vs. etanercept 35/40 (87.5) 28/41 (68.3) 3.12 (0.91, 12.52)  \n\nsecukinumab high dose vs. etanercept 35/40 (87.5) 28/41 (68.3) 3.09 (0.90, 12.39)  \n\nIGA 0/1 secukinumab low dose vs. etanercept 29/40 (72.5) 23/41 (56.1) 2.02 (0.73, 5.77)  \n\nsecukinumab high dose vs. etanercept 30/40 (75.0) 23/41 (56.1) 2.26 (0.81, 6.62)  \n\nPASI 90 secukinumab low dose vs. etanercept 30/40 (75.0) 21/41 (51.2) 2.85 (1.02, 8.38)  \n\nsecukinumab high dose vs. etanercept 32/40 (80.0) 21/41 (51.2) 3.69 (1.27, 11.61)  \n\n*  non-responder imputation was used to handle missing values \n\n** n is the number of responders, m = number of patients evaluable \n\n*** extended visit window at week 12 \n\nOdds ratio, 95% confidence interval, and p-value are from an exact logistic regression model with treatment \n\ngroup, baseline body-weight category and age category as factors \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\n \n\nA higher proportion of paediatric patients treated with secukinumab reported improvement in health-\n\nrelated quality of life as measured by a CDLQI score of 0 or 1 compared to placebo at week 12 (low \n\ndose 44.7%, high dose 50%, placebo 15%).

In the high dose group, 61.9% and 60.5% achieved a CDLQI 0 or 1 score at weeks 12 \n\nand 24, respectively. \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nCosentyx in plaque psoriasis in paediatric patients aged from birth to less than 6 years and in chronic \n\nidiopathic arthritis for paediatric patients aged from birth to less than 2 years (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nCosentyx in chronic idiopathic arthritis for paediatric patients aged from 2 years to less than 18 years \n\n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nMost pharmacokinetics properties observed in patients with plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and \n\nankylosing spondylitis were similar. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nFollowing a single subcutaneous dose of 300 mg as a liquid formulation in healthy volunteers, \n\nsecukinumab reached peak serum concentrations of 43.2±10.4 μg/ml between 2 and 14 days post dose. \n\n \n\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following a single subcutaneous dose of either 150 mg \nor 300 mg in plaque psoriasis patients, secukinumab reached peak serum concentrations of \n\n13.7±4.8 µg/ml or 27.3±9.5 µg/ml, respectively, between 5 and 6 days post dose. \n\n \n\nAfter initial weekly dosing during the first month, time to reach the maximum concentration was \n\nbetween 31 and 34 days based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. \n\n \n\nOn the basis of simulated data, peak concentrations at steady-state (Cmax,ss) following subcutaneous \n\nadministration of 150 mg or 300 mg were 27.6 µg/ml and 55.2 µg/ml, respectively. Population \n\npharmacokinetic analysis suggests that steady-state is reached after 20 weeks with monthly dosing \n\nregimens. \n\n \n\nCompared with exposure after a single dose, the population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that \n\npatients exhibited a 2-fold increase in peak serum concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) \n\nfollowing repeated monthly dosing during maintenance. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis showed that secukinumab was absorbed with an average absolute \n\nbioavailability of 73% in patients with plaque psoriasis. Across studies, absolute bioavailabilities in \n\nthe range between 60 and 77% were calculated. \n\n \n\nThe bioavailability of secukinumab in PsA patients was 85% on the basis of the population \n\npharmacokinetic model. \n\n \n\nFollowing a single subcutaneous injection of 300 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe in \n\nplaque psoriasis patients, secukinumab systemic exposure was similar to what was observed \n\npreviously with two injections of 150 mg. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe mean volume of distribution during the terminal phase (Vz) following single intravenous \n\nadministration ranged from 7.10 to 8.60 litres in plaque psoriasis patients, suggesting that \n\nsecukinumab undergoes limited distribution to peripheral compartments. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nThe majority of IgG elimination occurs via intracellular catabolism, following fluid-phase or receptor \n\nmediated endocytosis. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nMean systemic clearance (CL) following a single intravenous administration to patients with plaque \npsoriasis ranged from 0.13 to 0.36 l/day. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the mean systemic \n\nclearance (CL) was 0.19 l/day in plaque psoriasis patients. The CL was not impacted by gender. \n\nClearance was dose- and time-independent. \n\n \n\nThe mean elimination half-life, as estimated from population pharmacokinetic analysis, was 27 days in \n\nplaque psoriasis patients, ranging from 18 to 46 days across psoriasis studies with intravenous \n\nadministration. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nThe single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics of secukinumab in plaque psoriasis patients were \n\ndetermined in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 1x 0.3 mg/kg to 3x 10 mg/kg and \n\nwith subcutaneous doses ranging from 1x 25 mg to multiple doses of 300 mg. Exposure was dose \n\nproportional across all dosing regimens. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis with a limited number of elderly patients (n=71 for age \n\n≥65 years and n=7 for age ≥75 years), clearance in elderly patients and patients less than 65 years of \n\nage was similar. \n\n \n\nPatients with renal or hepatic impairment \n\nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. The renal \n\nelimination of intact secukinumab, an IgG monoclonal antibody, is expected to be low and of minor \n\nimportance. IgGs are mainly eliminated via catabolism and hepatic impairment is not expected to \n\ninfluence clearance of secukinumab. \n\n \n\nEffect of weight on pharmacokinetics \n\nSecukinumab clearance and volume of distribution increase as body weight increases. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn a pool of the two paediatric studies, patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (6 to less than \n\n18 years of age) were administered secukinumab at the recommended paediatric dosing regimen. At \n\nweek 24, patients weighing ≥25 and <50 kg had a mean ± SD steady-state trough concentration of \n\n19.8 ± 6.96 µg/ml (n=24) after 75 mg of secukinumab and patients weighing ≥50 kg had mean ±SD \n\ntrough concentration of 27.3 ± 10.1 µg/ml (n=36) after 150 mg of secukinumab. The mean ± SD \n\nsteady-state trough concentration in patients weighing <25 kg (n=8) was 32.6 ± 10.8 µg/ml at week 24 \n\nafter 75 mg dose. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans (adult or paediatric) based on conventional \n\nstudies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose and reproductive toxicity, or tissue cross-reactivity. \n\n \n\nAnimal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of secukinumab. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What Cosentyx is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nCosentyx contains the active substance secukinumab. Secukinumab is a monoclonal antibody which \n\nbelongs to a group of medicines called interleukin (IL) inhibitors. This medicine works by neutralising \n\nthe activity of a protein called IL-17A, which is present at increased levels in diseases such as \n\npsoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis. \n\n \n\nCosentyx is used for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: \n\n Plaque psoriasis \n\n Psoriatic arthritis \n\n Axial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) \nand non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \n\n \n\nPlaque psoriasis \nCosentyx is used to treat a skin condition called “plaque psoriasis”, which causes inflammation \n\naffecting the skin. Cosentyx reduces the inflammation and other symptoms of the disease. Cosentyx is \n\nused in adults, adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) with moderate to severe plaque \n\npsoriasis. \n\n \n\nUsing Cosentyx in plaque psoriasis will benefit you by leading to improvements of skin clearance and \n\nreducing your symptoms such as scaling, itching and pain. \n\n \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\nCosentyx is used to treat a condition called “psoriatic arthritis”. The condition is an inflammatory \n\ndisease of the joints, often accompanied by psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis you will first \n\nbe given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given \n\nCosentyx to reduce the signs and symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis, improve physical function and \n\nslow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints involved in the disease. \n\n \n\nCosentyx is used in adults with active psoriatic arthritis and can be used alone or with another \n\nmedicine called methotrexate. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n101 \n\n \n\nUsing Cosentyx in psoriatic arthritis will benefit you by reducing the signs and symptoms of the \n\ndisease, slowing down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints and improving your ability to \n\ndo normal daily activities. \n\n \n\nAxial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) \n\nand non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \n\nCosentyx is used to treat conditions called “ankylosing spondylitis” and “non-radiographic axial \n\nspondyloarthritis”. These conditions are inflammatory diseases primarily affecting the spine which \n\ncause inflammation of the spinal joints. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or non-radiographic axial \n\nspondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these \n\nmedicines, you will be given Cosentyx to reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease, reduce \n\ninflammation and improve your physical function. \n\n \n\nCosentyx is used in adults with active ankylosing spondylitis and active non-radiographic axial \n\nspondyloarthritis. \n\n \n\nUsing Cosentyx in ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis will benefit \n\nyou by reducing the signs and symptoms of your disease and improving your physical function. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.

The preparation time from piercing the stopper until end of \n\nreconstitution takes 20 minutes on average and should not exceed 90 minutes. \n\n \n\nTo prepare Cosentyx 150 mg powder for solution for injection, please adhere to the following \n\ninstructions: \n\n \n\nInstructions for reconstitution of Cosentyx 150 mg powder for solution for injection: \n\n1. Bring the vial of powder to room temperature and ensure that the sterile water for injections is at \n\nroom temperature. \n\n2. Withdraw slightly more than 1.0 ml sterile water for injections into a 1 ml graduated disposable \n\nsyringe and adjust to 1.0 ml. \n\n3. Remove the plastic cap from the vial. \n\n4. Insert the syringe needle into the vial containing the powder through the centre of the rubber \n\nstopper and reconstitute the powder by slowly injecting 1.0 ml of sterile water for injections into \n\nthe vial. The stream of sterile water for injections should be directed onto the powder. \n\n \n5. Tilt the vial to an angle of approx. 45° and gently rotate between the fingertips for approx. \n\n1 minute. Do not shake or invert the vial. \n\n \n6. Keep the vial standing at room temperature for a minimum of 10 minutes to allow for \n\ndissolution. Note that foaming of the solution may occur. \n\n7. Tilt the vial to an angle of approx. 45° and gently rotate between the fingertips for approx. \n\n1 minute. Do not shake or invert the vial. \n\n \n8. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed at room temperature for approximately 5 minutes. The \n\nresulting solution should be clear. Its colour may vary from colourless to slightly yellow. Do not \n\nuse if the lyophilised powder has not fully dissolved or if the liquid contains easily visible \n\nparticles, is cloudy or is distinctly brown. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n109 \n\n9. Prepare the required number of vials (1 vial for the 75 mg dose, 1 vial for the 150 mg dose, \n\n2 vials for the 300 mg dose). \n\n \n\nAfter storage at 2°C to 8°C, the solution should be allowed to come to room temperature for \n\napproximately 20 minutes before administration. \n\n \n\nInstructions for administration of Cosentyx solution \n\n1. Tilt the vial to an angle of approximately 45° and position the needle tip at the very bottom of \n\nthe solution in the vial when drawing the solution into the syringe. DO NOT invert the vial. \n\n \n2. For the 150 mg and 300 mg doses, carefully withdraw slightly more than 1.0 ml of the solution \n\nfor subcutaneous injection from the vial into a 1 ml graduated disposable syringe using a \n\nsuitable needle (e.g. 21G x 2″). This needle will only be used for withdrawing Cosentyx into the \n\ndisposable syringe. Prepare the required number of syringes (2 syringes for the 300 mg dose). \n\nFor a child receiving the 75 mg dose, carefully withdraw slightly more than 0.5 ml of the \n\nsolution for subcutaneous injection and discard the rest immediately. \n\n3. With the needle pointing upward, gently tap the syringe to move any air bubbles to the top. \n\n \n4. Replace the attached needle with a 27G x ½″ needle. \n\n \n5. Expel the air bubbles and advance the plunger to the 1.0 ml mark for the 150 mg dose. \n\nExpel the air bubbles and advance the plunger to the 0.5 ml mark for the 75 mg dose. \n\n6. Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab. \n\n\n\n \n\n110 \n\n7. Inject the Cosentyx solution subcutaneously into the front of thighs, lower abdomen (but not the \n\narea 5 centimetres around the navel) or outer upper arms. Choose a different site each time an \n\ninjection is administered. Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, scaly or \n\nhard. Avoid areas with scars or stretch marks. \n\n \n8. Any remaining solution in the vial must not be used and should be discarded in accordance with \n\nlocal requirements. Vials are for single use only. Dispose of the used syringe in a sharps \n\ncontainer (closable, puncture-resistant container). For the safety and health of you and others, \n\nneedles and used syringes must never be re-used. \n\n\n\n \n\n111 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nCosentyx 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n\n \n\nsecukinumab \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

This medicine works by neutralising \n\nthe activity of a protein called IL-17A, which is present at increased levels in diseases such as \n\npsoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis. \n\n \n\nCosentyx is used for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: \n\n Plaque psoriasis \n\n Psoriatic arthritis \n\n Axial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) \nand non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \n\n \n\nPlaque psoriasis \nCosentyx is used to treat a skin condition called “plaque psoriasis”, which causes inflammation \n\naffecting the skin. Cosentyx reduces the inflammation and other symptoms of the disease. Cosentyx is \n\nused in adults, adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) with moderate to severe plaque \n\npsoriasis. \n\n \n\nUsing Cosentyx in plaque psoriasis will benefit you by leading to improvements of skin clearance and \n\nreducing your symptoms such as scaling, itching and pain. \n\n \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\nCosentyx is used to treat a condition called “psoriatic arthritis”. The condition is an inflammatory \n\ndisease of the joints, often accompanied by psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis you will first \n\nbe given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given \n\nCosentyx to reduce the signs and symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis, improve physical function and \n\nslow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints involved in the disease. \n\n \n\nCosentyx is used in adults with active psoriatic arthritis and can be used alone or with another \n\nmedicine called methotrexate. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n112 \n\n \n\nUsing Cosentyx in psoriatic arthritis will benefit you by reducing the signs and symptoms of the \n\ndisease, slowing down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints and improving your ability to \n\ndo normal daily activities. \n\n \n\nAxial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) \n\nand non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \n\nCosentyx is used to treat conditions called “ankylosing spondylitis” and “non-radiographic axial \n\nspondyloarthritis”. These conditions are inflammatory diseases primarily affecting the spine which \n\ncause inflammation of the spinal joints. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or non-radiographic axial \n\nspondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these \n\nmedicines, you will be given Cosentyx to reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease, reduce \n\ninflammation and improve your physical function. \n\n \n\nCosentyx is used in adults with active ankylosing spondylitis and active non-radiographic axial \n\nspondyloarthritis. \n\n \n\nUsing Cosentyx in ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis will benefit \n\nyou by reducing the signs and symptoms of your disease and improving your physical function. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.

You \nmay also use the lower abdomen, but not the area \n\n5 centimetres around the navel (belly button).  \n\n Choose a different site each time you give yourself an \ninjection. \n\n Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, \nbruised, red, scaly or hard. Avoid areas with scars or \n\nstretch marks. \n\n \n\nIf a caregiver is giving you the injection, the outer upper \n\narms may also be used. \n\n \n\nPreparing the Cosentyx 150 mg pre-filled syringe ready for use \n\nNote: For a 150 mg dose, prepare 1 pre-filled syringe and inject the content. For a 300 mg dose, \n\nprepare 2 pre-filled syringes and inject the contents of both. \n\n1. Take the box containing the syringe out of the refrigerator and leave it unopened for about \n\n15-30 minutes so that it reaches room temperature. \n\n2. When you are ready to use the syringe, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n\n3. Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab. \n\n4. Remove the syringe from the outer box and take it out of the blister by holding the syringe \n\nguard body. \n\n5. Inspect the syringe. The liquid should be clear. Its colour may vary from colourless to slightly \n\nyellow. You may see a small air bubble, which is normal. DO NOT USE if the liquid contains \n\neasily visible particles, is cloudy or is distinctly brown. DO NOT USE if the syringe is broken. \n\nIn all these cases, return the entire product pack to the pharmacy. \n\n \n\nHow to use the Cosentyx 150 mg pre-filled syringe \n\n \n\n \n\nCarefully remove the needle cap from the \n\nsyringe by holding the syringe guard body. \n\nDiscard the needle cap. You may see a drop of \n\nliquid at the end of the needle. This is normal. \n\n\n\n \n\n121 \n\n \n\nGently pinch the skin at the injection site and \n\ninsert the needle as shown. Push the needle all \n\nthe way in to ensure that the medicine can be \n\nfully administered. \n\n \n\nHold the syringe as shown. Slowly depress the \n\nplunger as far as it will go so that the plunger \n\nhead is completely between the syringe guard \n\nwings. \n\nKeep the plunger pressed fully down while you \n\nhold the syringe in place for 5 seconds. \n\n \n\nKeep the plunger fully depressed while you \n\ncarefully lift the needle straight out from the \n\ninjection site. \n\n \n\nSlowly release the plunger and allow the syringe \n\nguard to automatically cover the exposed needle. \n\n \n\nThere may be a small amount of blood at the \n\ninjection site. You can press a cotton ball or \n\ngauze over the injection site and hold it for \n\n10 seconds. Do not rub the injection site. You \n\nmay cover the injection site with a small \n\nadhesive bandage, if needed. \n\n \n\nDisposal instructions \n\n \n\n \n\nDispose of the used syringe in a sharps container \n\n(closable, puncture resistant container). For the \n\nsafety and health of you and others, needles and \n\nused syringes must never be re-used. \n\n\n\n \n\n122 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nCosentyx 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n\n \n\nsecukinumab \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

This medicine works by neutralising \n\nthe activity of a protein called IL-17A, which is present at increased levels in diseases such as \n\npsoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis. \n\n \n\nCosentyx is used for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: \n\n Plaque psoriasis \n\n Psoriatic arthritis \n\n Axial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) \nand non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \n\n \n\nPlaque psoriasis \nCosentyx is used to treat a skin condition called “plaque psoriasis”, which causes inflammation \n\naffecting the skin. Cosentyx reduces the inflammation and other symptoms of the disease. Cosentyx is \n\nused in adults, adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) with moderate to severe plaque \n\npsoriasis. \n\n \n\nUsing Cosentyx in plaque psoriasis will benefit you by leading to improvements of skin clearance and \n\nreducing your symptoms such as scaling, itching and pain. \n\n \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\nCosentyx is used to treat a condition called “psoriatic arthritis”. The condition is an inflammatory \n\ndisease of the joints, often accompanied by psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis you will first \n\nbe given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given \n\nCosentyx to reduce the signs and symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis, improve physical function and \n\nslow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints involved in the disease. \n\n \n\nCosentyx is used in adults with active psoriatic arthritis and can be used alone or with another \n\nmedicine called methotrexate. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n123 \n\n \n\nUsing Cosentyx in psoriatic arthritis will benefit you by reducing the signs and symptoms of the \n\ndisease, slowing down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints and improving your ability to \n\ndo normal daily activities. \n\n \n\nAxial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) \n\nand non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \n\nCosentyx is used to treat conditions called “ankylosing spondylitis” and “non-radiographic axial \n\nspondyloarthritis”. These conditions are inflammatory diseases primarily affecting the spine which \n\ncause inflammation of the spinal joints. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or non-radiographic axial \n\nspondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these \n\nmedicines, you will be given Cosentyx to reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease, reduce \n\ninflammation and improve your physical function. \n\n \n\nCosentyx is used in adults with active ankylosing spondylitis and active non-radiographic axial \n\nspondyloarthritis. \n\n \n\nUsing Cosentyx in ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis will benefit \n\nyou by reducing the signs and symptoms of your disease and improving your physical function. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.

This medicine works by neutralising \n\nthe activity of a protein called IL-17A, which is present at increased levels in diseases such as \n\npsoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis. \n\n \n\nCosentyx is used for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: \n\n Plaque psoriasis \n\n Psoriatic arthritis \n\n Axial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) \nand non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \n\n \n\nPlaque psoriasis \nCosentyx is used to treat a skin condition called “plaque psoriasis”, which causes inflammation \n\naffecting the skin. Cosentyx reduces the inflammation and other symptoms of the disease. Cosentyx is \n\nused in adults, adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) with moderate to severe plaque \n\npsoriasis. \n\n \n\nUsing Cosentyx in plaque psoriasis will benefit you by leading to improvements of skin clearance and \n\nreducing your symptoms such as scaling, itching and pain. \n\n \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\nCosentyx is used to treat a condition called “psoriatic arthritis”. The condition is an inflammatory \n\ndisease of the joints, often accompanied by psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis you will first \n\nbe given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given \n\nCosentyx to reduce the signs and symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis, improve physical function and \n\nslow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints involved in the disease. \n\n \n\nCosentyx is used in adults with active psoriatic arthritis and can be used alone or with another \n\nmedicine called methotrexate. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n135 \n\n \n\nUsing Cosentyx in psoriatic arthritis will benefit you by reducing the signs and symptoms of the \n\ndisease, slowing down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints and improving your ability to \n\ndo normal daily activities. \n\n \n\nAxial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) \n\nand non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \n\nCosentyx is used to treat conditions called “ankylosing spondylitis” and “non-radiographic axial \n\nspondyloarthritis”. These conditions are inflammatory diseases primarily affecting the spine which \n\ncause inflammation of the spinal joints. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or non-radiographic axial \n\nspondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these \n\nmedicines, you will be given Cosentyx to reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease, reduce \n\ninflammation and improve your physical function. \n\n \n\nCosentyx is used in adults with active ankylosing spondylitis and active non-radiographic axial \n\nspondyloarthritis. \n\n \n\nUsing Cosentyx in ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis will benefit \n\nyou by reducing the signs and symptoms of your disease and improving your physical function. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.

Push the needle all \n\nthe way in to ensure that the medicine can be \n\nfully administered. \n\n\n\n \n\n144 \n\n \n\nHold the syringe as shown. Slowly depress the \n\nplunger as far as it will go so that the plunger \n\nhead is completely between the syringe guard \n\nwings. \n\nKeep the plunger pressed fully down while you \n\nhold the syringe in place for 5 seconds. \n\n \n\nKeep the plunger fully depressed while you \n\ncarefully lift the needle straight out from the \n\ninjection site. \n\n \n\nSlowly release the plunger and allow the syringe \n\nguard to automatically cover the exposed needle. \n\n \n\nThere may be a small amount of blood at the \n\ninjection site. You can press a cotton ball or \n\ngauze over the injection site and hold it for \n\n10 seconds. Do not rub the injection site. You \n\nmay cover the injection site with a small \n\nadhesive bandage, if needed. \n\n \n\nDisposal instructions \n\n \n\n \n\nDispose of the used syringe in a sharps container \n\n(closable, puncture resistant container). For the \n\nsafety and health of you and others, needles and \n\nused syringes must never be re-used. \n\n\n\n \n\n145 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nCosentyx 300 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen \nsecukinumab \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.

Cosentyx is \n\nused in adults, adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) with moderate to severe plaque \n\npsoriasis. \n\n \n\nUsing Cosentyx in plaque psoriasis will benefit you by leading to improvements of skin clearance and \n\nreducing your symptoms such as scaling, itching and pain. \n\n \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\nCosentyx is used to treat a condition called “psoriatic arthritis”. The condition is an inflammatory \n\ndisease of the joints, often accompanied by psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis you will first \n\nbe given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given \n\nCosentyx to reduce the signs and symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis, improve physical function and \n\nslow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints involved in the disease. \n\n \n\nCosentyx is used in adults with active psoriatic arthritis and can be used alone or with another \n\nmedicine called methotrexate. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n146 \n\n \n\nUsing Cosentyx in psoriatic arthritis will benefit you by reducing the signs and symptoms of the \n\ndisease, slowing down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints and improving your ability to \n\ndo normal daily activities. \n\n \n\nAxial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) \n\nand non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis \n\nCosentyx is used to treat conditions called “ankylosing spondylitis” and “non-radiographic axial \n\nspondyloarthritis”. These conditions are inflammatory diseases primarily affecting the spine which \n\ncause inflammation of the spinal joints. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or non-radiographic axial \n\nspondyloarthritis you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these \n\nmedicines, you will be given Cosentyx to reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease, reduce \n\ninflammation and improve your physical function. \n\n \n\nCosentyx is used in adults with active ankylosing spondylitis and active non-radiographic axial \n\nspondyloarthritis. \n\n \n\nUsing Cosentyx in ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis will benefit \n\nyou by reducing the signs and symptoms of your disease and improving your physical function. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.
