NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nFIRMAGON 80 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection \nFIRMAGON 120 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nFIRMAGON 80 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \nEach vial contains 80 mg degarelix (as acetate). After reconstitution, each ml of solution contains 20 mg of \ndegarelix. \n \nFIRMAGON 120 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \nEach vial contains 120 mg degarelix (as acetate). After reconstitution, each ml of solution contains 40 mg of \ndegarelix. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection \n \nPowder: white to off-white powder. \nSolvent: clear, colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nFIRMAGON is a gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist indicated for treatment of adult male \npatients with advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nStarting dose Maintenance dose \u2013 monthly \n\nadministration  \n\n240 mg administered as two consecutive \nsubcutaneous injections of 120 mg each \n\n80 mg administered as one subcutaneous \ninjection  \n\n \nThe first maintenance dose should be given one month after the starting dose. \n \nThe therapeutic effect of degarelix should be monitored by clinical parameters and prostate specific antigen \n(PSA) serum levels. Clinical studies have shown that testosterone (T) suppression occurs immediately after \nadministration of the starting dose with 96% of the patients having serum testosterone levels corresponding \nto medical castration (T\u22640.5 ng/ml) after three days and 100% after one month. Long term treatment with the \nmaintenance dose up to 1 year shows that 97% of the patients have sustained suppressed testosterone levels \n(T\u22640.5 ng/ml).  \n \nIn case the patient's clinical response appears to be sub-optimal, it should be confirmed that serum \ntestosterone levels are remaining sufficiently suppressed. \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nSince degarelix does not induce a testosterone surge it is not necessary to add an anti-androgen as surge \nprotection at initiation of therapy. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly, hepatically or renally impaired patients: \nThere is no need to adjust the dose for the elderly or in patients with mild or moderate liver or kidney \nfunction impairment (see section 5.2). Patients with severe liver or kidney impairment have not been studied \nand caution is therefore warranted (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of FIRMAGON in children and adolescents in the treatment of adult male patients \nwith advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFIRMAGON must be reconstituted prior to administration. For instructions on reconstitution and \nadministration, please see section 6.6. \n \nFIRMAGON is for subcutaneous use ONLY, not to be administered intravenously. \nIntramuscular administration is not recommended as it has not been studied. \n \nFIRMAGON is administered as a subcutaneous injection in the abdominal region. The injection site should \nvary periodically. Injections should be given in areas where the patient will not be exposed to pressure e.g. \nnot close to waistband or belt and not close to the ribs.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEffect on QT/QTc interval \n \nLong-term androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT interval. In the confirmatory study comparing \nFIRMAGON to leuprorelin periodic (monthly) electrocardiograms (ECGs) were performed; both \ntherapies showed QT/QTc intervals exceeding 450 msec in approximately 20% of the patients, and 500 msec \nin 1% and 2% of the degarelix and leuprorelin patients, respectively (see section 5.1). \nFIRMAGON has not been studied in patients with a history of a corrected QT interval over 450 msec, in \npatients with a history of or risk factors for torsades de pointes and in patients receiving concomitant \nmedicinal products that might prolong the QT interval. Therefore in such patients, the benefit/risk ratio of \nFIRMAGON must be thoroughly appraised (see sections 4.5 and 4.8).  \nA thorough QT study showed that there was no intrinsic effect of degarelix on QT/QTc interval (see section \n4.8). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nPatients with known or suspected hepatic disorder have not been included in long-term clinical trials with \ndegarelix. Mild, transient increases in ALT and AST have been seen, these were not accompanied by a rise \nin bilirubin or clinical symptoms. Monitoring of liver function in patients with known or suspected hepatic \ndisorder is advised during treatment. The pharmacokinetics of degarelix has been investigated after single \nintravenous administration in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nDegarelix has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment and caution is therefore warranted. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nHypersensitivity \n \nDegarelix has not been studied in patients with a history of severe untreated asthma, anaphylactic reactions \nor severe urticaria or angioedema. \n \nChanges in bone density \n \nDecreased bone density has been reported in the medical literature in men who have had orchiectomy or who \nhave been treated with a GnRH agonist. It can be anticipated that long periods of testosterone suppression in \nmen will have effects on bone density. Bone density has not been measured during treatment with degarelix. \n \nGlucose tolerance \n \nA reduction in glucose tolerance has been observed in men who have had orchiectomy or who have been \ntreated with a GnRH agonist. Development or aggravation of diabetes may occur; therefore diabetic patients \nmay require more frequent monitoring of blood glucose when receiving androgen deprivation therapy. The \neffect of degarelix on insulin and glucose levels has not been studied. \n \nCardiovascular disease \n \nCardiovascular disease such as stroke and myocardial infarction has been reported in the medical literature in \npatients with androgen deprivation therapy. Therefore, all cardiovascular risk factors should be taken into \naccount. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. \n \nSince androgen deprivation treatment may prolong the QTc interval, the concomitant use of degarelix with \nmedicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval or medicinal products able to induce torsades de \npointes such as class IA (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide) or class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, \nibutilide) antiarrhythmic medicinal products, methadone,  moxifloxacin, antipsychotics, etc. should be \ncarefully evaluated (see section 4.4). \n \nDegarelix is not a substrate for the human CYP450 system and has not been shown to induce or inhibit \nCYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4/5 to any great extent in vitro. \nTherefore, clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions in metabolism related to these \nisoenzymes are unlikely. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nThere is no relevant indication for use of FIRMAGON in women. \n \nFertility \n \nFIRMAGON may inhibit male fertility as long as the testosterone is suppressed. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFIRMAGON has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  Fatigue and dizziness \nare common adverse reactions that might influence the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\n \nThe most commonly observed adverse reactions during degarelix therapy in the confirmatory phase III study \n(N=409) were due to the expected physiological effects of testosterone suppression, including hot flushes \nand weight increase (reported in 25% and 7%, respectively, of patients receiving treatment for one year), or \ninjection site adverse reactions. Transient chills, fever or influenza like illness were reported to occur hours \nafter dosing (in 3%, 2% and 1% of patients, respectively). \n \nThe injection site adverse reactions reported were mainly pain and erythema, reported in 28% and 17% of \npatients, respectively, less frequently reported were swelling (6%), induration (4%) and nodule (3%). These \nevents occurred primarily with the starting dose whereas during maintenance therapy with the 80 mg dose, \nthe incidence of these events pr 100 injections was: 3 for pain and <1 for erythema, swelling, nodule and \ninduration. The reported events were mostly transient, of mild to moderate intensity and led to very few \ndiscontinuations (<1%). Serious injection site reactions were very rarely reported such as injection site \ninfection, injection site abscess or injection site necrosis that could require surgical treatment/drainage. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe frequency of undesirable effects listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in \norder of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Frequency of adverse drug reactions reported in 1,259 patients treated for a total of 1781 patient \nyears (phase II and III studies) and from post-marketing reports \n\nMedDRA \nSystem Organ \nClass (SOC) \n\nVery common \n \n\nCommon \n \n\nUncommon \n \n\nRare \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n Anaemia*  Neutropenic \nfever \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity Anaphylactic \nreactions \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n Weight \nincrease* \n\nHyperglycemia/Diabetes \nmellitus, cholesterol \nincreased, weight \ndecreased, appetite \ndecreased, changes in blood \ncalcium \n\n \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n Insomnia Depression, libido \ndecreased* \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n Dizziness, \nheadache \n\nMental impairment, \nhypoaesthesia  \n\n \n\nEye disorders   Vision blurred  \nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n  Cardiac arrhythmia (incl. \natrial fibrillation), \npalpitations,  \nQT prolongation*(see \nsections 4.4 and 4.5) \n\nMyocardial \ninfarction, \ncardiac failure \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\nHot flush*  Hypertension, vasovagal \nreaction (incl. hypotension) \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n  Dyspnoea  \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Diarrhoea, \nnausea \n\nConstipation, vomiting, \nabdominal pain, abdominal \ndiscomfort, dry mouth \n\n \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n Liver \ntransamina\nses \nincreased \n\nBilirubin increased, \nalkaline phosphatase \nincreased \n\n \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n Hyperhidro\nsis (incl. \nnight \nsweats)*, \nrash \n\nUrticaria, skin nodule, \nalopecia, pruritus, erythema \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal\n, connective \ntissue and bone \ndisorders \n\n Musculosk\neletal pain \nand \ndiscomfort \n\nOsteoporosis/osteopenia, \narthralgia muscular \nweakness, muscle spasms, \njoint swelling/stiffness \n\nRhabdomyo-\nlysis \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n  Pollakiuria, micturition \nurgency, dysuria, nocturia, \nrenal impairment, \nincontinence \n\n \n\nReproductive \nsystem and \nbreast disorders \n\n Gynaecom\nastia*, \ntesticular \natrophy*, \nerectile \ndysfunction\n*  \n\nTesticular pain, breast pain, \npelvic pain, genital \nirritation, ejaculation failure \n\n \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nInjection site \nadverse \nreactions \n\nChills, \npyrexia, \nfatigue*, \nInfluenza-\nlike illness \n\nMalaise, peripheral oedema   \n\n*Known physiological consequence of testosterone suppression \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nChanges in laboratory parameters \nChanges in laboratory values seen during one year of treatment in the confirmatory phase III study (N=409) \nwere in the same range for degarelix and a GnRH-agonist (leuprorelin) used as comparator. Markedly \nabnormal (>3*ULN) liver transaminase values (ALT, AST and GGT) were seen in 2-6% of patients with \nnormal values prior to treatment, following treatment with both medicinal products. Marked decrease in \nhaematological values, hematocrit (\u22640.37) and hemoglobin (\u2264115 g/l) were seen in 40% and 13-15%, \nrespectively, of patients with normal values prior to treatment, following treatment with both medicinal \nproducts. It is unknown to what extent this decrease in haematological values was caused by the underlying \nprostate cancer and to what extent it was a consequence of androgen deprivation therapy. Markedly \nabnormal values of potassium (\u22655.8 mmol/l), creatinine (\u2265177 \u03bcmol/l) and BUN (\u226510.7 mmol/l) in patients \nwith normal values prior to treatment, were seen in 6%, 2% and 15% of degarelix treated patients and 3%, \n2% and 14% of leuprorelin treated patients, respectively. \n \nChanges in ECG measurements \nChanges in ECG measurements seen during one year of treatment in the confirmatory phase III study \n(N=409) were in the same range for degarelix and a GnRH-agonist (leuprorelin) used as comparator. Three \n(<1%) out of 409 patients in the degarelix group and four (2%) out of 201 patients in the leuprorelin 7.5 mg \ngroup, had a QTcF \u2265 500 msec. From baseline to end of study the median change in QTcF for degarelix was \n12.0 msec and for leuprorelin was 16.7 msec. \nThe lack of intrinsic effect of degarelix on cardiac repolarisation (QTcF), heart rate, AV conduction, cardiac \ndepolarisation, or T or U wave morphology was confirmed in a thorough QT study in healthy subjects \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\n(N=80) receiving an i.v. infusion of degarelix over 60 min, reaching a mean Cmax of 222 ng/mL, approx. 3-4-\nfold the Cmax obtained during prostate cancer treatment. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no clinical experience with the effects of an acute overdose with degarelix. In the event of an \noverdose the patient should be monitored and appropriate supportive treatment should be given, if considered \nnecessary.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Endocrine therapy, Other hormone antagonists and related agents, ATC code: \nL02BX02  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nDegarelix is a selective gonadotrophin releasing-hormone (GnRH) antagonist that competitively and \nreversibly binds to the pituitary GnRH receptors, thereby rapidly reducing the release of the gonadotrophins, \nluteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and thereby reducing the secretion of \ntestosterone (T) by the testes. Prostatic carcinoma is known to be androgen sensitive and responds to \ntreatment that removes the source of androgen. Unlike GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists do not induce a \nLH surge with subsequent testosterone surge/tumour stimulation and potential symptomatic flare after the \ninitiation of treatment. \n \nA single dose of 240 mg degarelix, followed by a monthly maintenance dose of 80 mg, rapidly causes a \ndecrease in the concentrations of LH, FSH and subsequently testosterone. The serum concentration of \ndihydrotestosterone (DHT) decreases in a similar manner to testosterone.  \n \nDegarelix is effective in achieving and maintaining testosterone suppression well below medical castration \nlevel of 0.5 ng/ml. Maintenance monthly dosing of 80 mg resulted in sustained testosterone suppression in \n97% of patients for at least one year. No testosterone microsurges were observed after re-injection during \ndegarelix treatment. Median testosterone levels after one year of treatment were 0.087 ng/ml (interquartile \nrange 0.06-0.15) N=167. \n \nResults of the confirmatory Phase III study \n \nThe efficacy and safety of degarelix was evaluated in an open-label, multi-centre, randomised, active \ncomparator controlled, parallel-group study. The study investigated the efficacy and safety of two different \ndegarelix monthly dosing regimens with a starting dose of 240 mg (40 mg/ml) followed by monthly doses \nsubcutaneous administration of 160 mg (40 mg/ml) or 80 mg (20 mg/ml), in comparison to monthly \nintramuscular administration of 7.5 mg leuprorelin in patients with prostate cancer requiring androgen \ndeprivation therapy. In total 620 patients were randomised to one of the three treatment groups, of which 504 \n(81%) patients completed the study. In the degarelix 240/80 mg treatment group 41 (20%) patients \ndiscontinued the study, as compared to 32 (16%) patients in the leuprorelin group. \n \nOf the 610 patients treated \n\u2022 31% had localised prostate cancer \n\u2022 29% had locally advanced prostate cancer  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n \n\n\u2022 20% had metastatic prostate cancer  \n\u2022 7% had an unknown metastatic status \n\u2022 13% had previous curative intent surgery or radiation and a rising PSA \n \nBaseline demographics were similar between the arms. The median age was 74 years (range 47 to 98 years). \nThe primary objective was to demonstrate that degarelix is effective with respect to achieving and \nmaintaining testosterone suppression to below 0.5 ng/ml, during 12 months of treatment.  \nThe lowest effective maintenance dose of 80 mg degarelix was chosen. \n \nAttainment of serum testosterone (T) \u22640.5 ng/ml \n \nFIRMAGON is effective in achieving fast testosterone suppression, see Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Percentage of patients attaining T\u22640.5 ng/ml after start of treatment.  \n\nTime Degarelix 240/80 mg Leuprorelin 7.5 mg \n\nDay 1 52% 0%  \n\nDay 3 96% 0%  \n\nDay 7 99% 1% \n\nDay 14 100% 18% \n\nDay 28 100% 100% \n \nAvoidance of testosterone surge \n \nSurge was defined as testosterone exceeding baseline by \u226515% within the first 2 weeks. \nNone of the degarelix-treated patients experienced a testosterone surge; there was an average decrease of \n94% in testosterone at day 3. Most of the leuprorelin-treated patients experienced testosterone surge; there \nwas an average increase of 65% in testosterone at day 3. This difference was statistically significant \n(p<0.001). \n \nFigure 1: Percentage change in testosterone from baseline by treatment group until day 28 (median with \ninterquartile ranges). \n \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n \n \nThe primary end-point in the study was testosterone suppression rates after one year of treatment with \ndegarelix or leuprorelin. The clinical benefit for degarelix compared to leuprorelin plus anti-androgen in the \ninitial phase of treatment has not been demonstrated. \n \nTestosterone Reversibility \n \nIn a study involving patients with rising PSA after localised therapy (mainly radical prostatectomy and \nradiation) were administered FIRMAGON for seven months followed by a seven months monitoring period. \nThe median time to testosterone recovery (>0.5 ng/mL, above castrate level) after discontinuation of \ntreatment was 112 days (counted from start of monitoring period, i.e 28 days after last injection). The median \ntime to testosterone >1.5 ng/mL (above lower limit of normal range) was 168 days.  \n \nLong-term effect \n \nSuccessful response in the study was defined as attainment of medical castration at day 28 and maintenance \nthrough day 364 where no single testosterone concentration was greater than 0.5 ng/ml. \n \nTable 3: Cumulative probability of testosterone \u22640.5 ng/ml from Day 28 to Day 364. \n\n Degarelix 240/80 mg \nN=207 \n\nLeuprorelin 7.5 mg \nN=201 \n\nNo. of responders 202 194 \nResponse Rate  \n(confidence intervals)* \n\n97.2% \n(93.5; 98.8%) \n\n96.4% \n(92.5; 98.2%) \n\n* Kaplan Meier estimates within group \n \nAttainment of prostate specific antigen (PSA) reduction \n \nTumour size was not measured directly during the clinical trial programme, but there was an indirect \nbeneficial tumour response as shown by a 95% reduction after 12 months in median PSA for degarelix.  \n \nThe median PSA in the study at baseline was: \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\n\u2022 for the degarelix 240/80 mg treatment group 19.8 ng/ml (interquartile range: P25 9.4 ng/ml, P75 \n46.4 ng/ml)  \n\n\u2022 for the leuprorelin 7.5 mg treatment group 17.4 ng/ml (interquartile range: P25 8.4 ng/ml, P75 \n56.5 ng/ml) \n\n \nFigure 2: Percentage change in PSA from baseline by treatment group until day 56 (median with interquartile \nranges). \n\n \n\n \nThis difference was statistically significant (p<0.001) for the pre-specified analysis at day 14 and day 28. \n \nProstate specific antigen (PSA) levels are lowered by 64% two weeks after administration of degarelix, 85% \nafter one month, 95% after three months, and remained suppressed (approximately 97%) throughout the one \nyear of treatment. \nFrom day 56 to day 364 there were no significant differences between degarelix and the comparator in the \npercentage change from baseline. \n \nEffect on prostate volume \n \nThree months therapy with degarelix (240/80 mg dose regimen) resulted in a 37% reduction in prostate \nvolume as measured by trans-rectal ultrasound scan (TRUS) in patients requiring hormonal therapy prior to \nradiotherapy and in patients who were candidates for medical castration. The prostate volume reduction was \nsimilar to that attained with goserelin plus anti-androgen protection.  \n \nEffect on QT/QTc intervals \n \nIn the confirmatory study comparing FIRMAGON to leuprorelin periodic electrocardiograms were \nperformed. Both therapies showed QT/QTc intervals exceeding 450 msec in approximately 20% of the \npatients. From baseline to end of study the median change for FIRMAGON was 12.0 msec and for \nleuprorelin it was 16.7 msec. \n \nAnti-degarelix antibodies \n \nAnti-degarelix antibody development has been observed in 10% of patients after treatment with \nFIRMAGON for one year and 29% of patients after treatment with FIRMAGON for up to 5.5 years. There is \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nno indication that the efficacy or safety of FIRMAGON treatment is affected by antibody formation after up \nto 5.5 years of treatment.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nFIRMAGON in all subsets of the paediatric population (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 240 mg degarelix at a concentration of 40 mg/ml to prostate \ncancer patients in the pivotal study CS21, AUC0-28 days was 635 (602-668) day*ng/ml, Cmax was 66.0 (61.0-\n71.0) ng/ml and occurred at tmax at 40 (37-42) hours. Mean trough values were approximately 11-12 ng/ml \nafter the starting dose and 11-16 ng/ml after maintenance dosing of 80 mg at a concentration of 20 mg/ml. \nCmax degarelix plasma concentration decreases in a biphasic fashion, with a mean terminal half-life (t\u00bd) of 29 \ndays for the maintenance dose. The long half-life after subcutaneous administration is a consequence of a \nvery slow release of degarelix from the depot formed at the injection site(s). The pharmacokinetic behavior \nof the medicinal product is influenced by its concentration in the solution for injection. Thus, Cmax and \nbioavailability tend to decrease with increasing dose concentration while the half-life is increased. Therefore, \nno other dose concentrations than the recommended should be used.  \n \nDistribution \n \nThe distribution volume in healthy elderly men is approximately 1 l/kg. Plasma protein binding is estimated \nto be approximately 90%. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nDegarelix is subject to common peptidic degradation during the passage of the hepato-biliary system and is \nmainly excreted as peptide fragments in the faeces. No significant metabolites were detected in plasma \nsamples after subcutaneous administration. In vitro studies have shown that degarelix is not a substrate for \nthe human CYP450 system. \n \nElimination \n \nIn healthy men, approximately 20-30% of a single intravenously administered dose is excreted in the urine, \nsuggesting that 70-80% is excreted via the hepato-biliary system. The clearance of degarelix when \nadministered as single intravenous doses (0.864-49.4 \u00b5g/kg) in healthy elderly men was found to be 35-\n50 ml/h/kg. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nNo pharmacokinetic studies in renally impaired patients have been conducted. Only about 20-30% of a given \ndose of degarelix is excreted unchanged by the kidneys. A population pharmacokinetics analysis of the data \nfrom the confirmatory Phase III study has demonstrated that the clearance of degarelix in patients with mild \nto moderate renal impairment is reduced by approximately 23%; therefore, dose adjustment in patients with \nmild or moderate renal impairment is not recommended. Data on patients with severe renal impairment is \nscarce and caution is therefore warranted in this patient population.    \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nDegarelix has been investigated in a pharmacokinetic study in patients with mild to moderate hepatic \nimpairment. No signs of increased exposure in the hepatically impaired subjects were observed compared to \nhealthy subjects. Dose adjustment is not necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nPatients with severe hepatic dysfunction have not been studied and caution is therefore warranted in this \ngroup.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAnimal reproduction studies showed that degarelix caused infertility in male animals. This is due to the \npharmacological effect; and the effect was reversible. \n \nIn female reproduction toxicity studies degarelix revealed findings expected from the pharmacological \nproperties. It caused a dosage dependent prolongation of the time to mating and to pregnancy, a reduced \nnumber of corpora lutea, and an increase in the number of pre- and post-implantation losses, abortions, early \nembryo/foetal deaths, premature deliveries and in the duration of parturition. \n \nNonclinical studies on safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential \nrevealed no special hazard for humans. Both in vitro and in vivo studies showed no signs of QT prolongation. \n \nNo target organ toxicity was observed from acute, subacute and chronic toxicity studies in rats \nand monkeys following subcutaneous administration of degarelix. Drug-related local irritation was noted in \nanimals when degarelix was administered subcutaneously in high doses.  \n \n \n6.

The reconstituted solution should be a clear liquid, free of undissolved matter. \n \nNOTE: THE VIALS SHOULD NOT BE SHAKEN \n \nThe pack contains one vial of powder and one pre-filled syringe with solvent that must be prepared for \nsubcutaneous injection.  \n \n\n \n\n1.  Remove the cover from the vial adapter pack. \nAttach the adapter to the powder vial by pressing \nthe adapter down until the spike pushes through \nthe rubber stopper and the adapter snaps in place. \n\n2. Prepare the pre-filled syringe by attaching the plunger rod. \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\n \n\n3. Remove the cap of the pre-filled syringe. Attach \nthe syringe to the powder vial by screwing it on \nto the adapter. Transfer all solvent to the \npowder vial. \n\n \n \n\n4. With the syringe still attached to the adapter, \nswirl gently until the liquid looks clear and without \nundissolved powder or particles. If the powder \nadheres to the side of the vial above the liquid \nsurface, the vial can be tilted slightly. Avoid shaking \nto prevent foam formation. \n\n \n\n A ring of small air bubbles on the surface of the \nliquid is acceptable. The reconstitution procedure \nusually takes a few minutes, but may take up to 15 \nminutes in some cases. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5. Turn the vial upside down and draw up to the line \nmark on the syringe for injection.  \n\nAlways make sure to withdraw the precise \nvolume and adjust for any air bubbles. \n\n \nFIRMAGON 80 mg powder and solvent for solution for \ninjection: withdrawn until the line marking at 4 ml. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFIRMAGON 120 mg powder and solvent for solution \nfor injection: withdrawn until the line marking at \n3 ml. \n\n \n\n \n\n6. Detach the syringe from the vial adapter and attach the needle for deep subcutaneous \ninjection to the syringe. \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\n \n\n7. Perform a deep subcutaneous injection. To do so: \ngrasp the skin of the abdomen, elevate the \nsubcutaneous tissue and insert the needle deeply at \nan angle of not less than 45 degrees. \n\n \nFIRMAGON 80 mg powder and solvent for solution for \ninjection: Inject 4 ml of FIRMAGON 80 mg slowly, \nimmediately after reconstitution. \n\n \n\nFIRMAGON 120 mg powder and solvent for solution \nfor injection: Inject 3 ml of FIRMAGON 120 mg \nslowly, immediately after reconstitution. \n\n8. No injections should be given in areas where the patient will be exposed to pressure, e.g. \naround the belt or waistband or close to the ribs. \n\n Do not inject directly into a vein. Gently pull back the plunger to check if blood is \naspirated. If blood appears in the syringe, the medicinal product can no longer be used. \nDiscontinue the procedure and discard the syringe and the needle (reconstitute a new dose \nfor the patient). \n\n9. FIRMAGON 120 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection \n\n Repeat the reconstitution procedure for the second dose. Choose a different injection site \nand inject 3 ml.  \n\n \nNo special requirements for disposal.  \n \n \n7.

What FIRMAGON is and what it is used for \n \nFIRMAGON contains degarelix. \nDegarelix is a synthetic hormone blocker used in the treatment of prostate cancer in adult male patients. \nDegarelix mimics a natural hormone (gonadotrophin-relasing hormone, GnRH) and directly blocks its \neffects. By doing so, degarelix immediately reduces the level of the male hormone testosterone that \nstimulates the prostate cancer. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use FIRMAGON \n \nDo not use FIRMAGON  \n\u2212 If you are allergic to degarelix or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nPlease tell your doctor if you have any of the following: \n\u2212 Any cardiovascular conditions or heart rhythm problems (arrythmia), or are being treated with medicines \n\nfor this condition. The risk of heart rhythm problems may be increased when using FIRMAGON. \n\u2212 Diabetes mellitus. Worsening or onset of diabetes may occur. If you have diabetes, you may have to \n\nmeasure blood glucose more frequently. \n\u2212 Liver disease. Liver function may need to be monitored. \n\u2212 Kidney disease. Use of FIRMAGON has not been investigated in patients with severe kidney disease. \n\u2212 Osteoporosis or any condition that affects the strenght of your bones. Reduced level of testosterone may \n\ncause a reduction in bone calcium (thinning of bones).  \n\u2212 Severe hypersensitivity. Use of FIRMAGON has not been investigated in patients with severe \n\nhypersensitivity reactions. \n \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children or adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and FIRMAGON \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\nFIRMAGON might interfere with some medicines used to treat heart rhythm problems (e.g. quinidine, \nprocainamide, amiodarone and sotalol) or other medicines which can have an effect on heart rhythm (e.g. \nmethadone (used for pain relief and as part of drug addiction detoxification), moxifloxacin (an antibiotic), \nantipsychotics). \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTiredness and dizziness are common side effects that may impair your ability to drive and use machines. \nThese side effects may be due to the treatment or effects resulting from the underlying disease. \n \n \n3. How to use FIRMAGON \n \nThis medicine is usually injected by a nurse or a doctor. \n \nThe recommended starting dose is two consecutive injections of 120 mg. After that, you will receive a \nmonthly 80 mg injection. The injected liquid forms a gel from which degarelix is released over a period of \none month. \n \nFIRMAGON must be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) ONLY. FIRMAGON must NOT be given \ninto a blood vessel (intravenously). Precautions must be taken to avoid accidental injection into a vein. The \nsite of injection is likely to vary within the abdominal region. \n \nIf you forget to use FIRMAGON \nIf you believe your monthly dose of FIRMAGON has been forgotten, please talk to your doctor. \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4.
