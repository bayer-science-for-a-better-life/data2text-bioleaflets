QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nAbilify Maintena 300 mg powder and solvent for prolonged-release suspension for injection \n \nEach vial contains 300 mg aripiprazole. \n \nAbilify Maintena 400 mg powder and solvent for prolonged-release suspension for injection \n \nEach vial contains 400 mg aripiprazole. \n \nAbilify Maintena 300 mg powder and solvent for prolonged-release suspension for injection in \npre-filled syringe \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 300 mg aripiprazole. \n \nAbilify Maintena 400 mg powder and solvent for prolonged-release suspension for injection in \npre-filled syringe \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 400 mg aripiprazole. \n \nAfter reconstitution each ml of suspension contains 200 mg aripiprazole. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for prolonged-release suspension for injection \n \nPowder: white to off-white \nSolvent: clear solution \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAbilify Maintena is indicated for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients stabilised \nwith oral aripiprazole. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nFor patients who have never taken aripiprazole, tolerability with oral aripiprazole must occur prior to \ninitiating treatment with Abilify Maintena. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nThe recommended starting and maintenance dose of Abilify Maintena is 400 mg. \n \nTitration of the dose of this medicinal product is not required. It should be administered once monthly \nas a single injection (no sooner than 26 days after the previous injection). \n \nAfter the first injection, treatment with 10 mg to 20 mg oral aripiprazole per day should be continued \nfor 14 consecutive days to maintain therapeutic aripiprazole concentrations during initiation of \ntherapy. \n \nIf there are adverse reactions with the 400 mg dosage, reduction of the dose to 300 mg once monthly \nshould be considered. \n \nMissed doses \n \n\nMissed doses \nIf 2nd or 3rd dose is missed and time \nsince last injection is: \n\nAction \n\n> 4 weeks and < 5 weeks  The injection should be administered as soon as possible \nand then the monthly injection schedule should be resumed. \n\n> 5 weeks  Concomitant oral aripiprazole should be restarted for \n14 days with next administered injection. \n\nIf 4th or subsequent doses are missed \n(i.e., after attainment of steady state) \nand time since last injection is: \n\nAction \n\n> 4 weeks and < 6 weeks The injection should be administered as soon as possible \nand then the monthly injection schedule should be resumed. \n\n> 6 weeks Concomitant oral aripiprazole should be restarted for \n14 days with next administered injection and then resume \nmonthly injection schedule. \n\n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThe safety and efficacy of Abilify Maintena in the treatment of schizophrenia in patients 65 years of \nage or older has not been established (see section 4.4). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. In patients \nwith severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations. In \nthese patients dosing should be managed cautiously. Oral formulation should be preferred (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nKnown CYP2D6 poor metabolisers \nIn patients who are known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, the starting and maintenance dose should \nbe 300 mg. When used concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors the dose should be reduced to \n200 mg (see section 4.5). \n \nDose adjustments due to interactions with CYP2D6 and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or CYP3A4 \ninducers \nDosage adjustments should be made in patients taking concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or \nstrong CYP2D6 inhibitors for more than 14 days. If the CYP3A4 inhibitor or CYP2D6 inhibitor is \nwithdrawn, the dosage may need to be increased to the previous dose (see section 4.5). In case of \nadverse reactions despite dose adjustments of Abilify Maintena, the necessity of concomitant use of \nCYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor should be reassessed. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nConcomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers with Abilify Maintena should be avoided for more than 14 days \nbecause the blood levels of aripiprazole are decreased and may be below the effective levels (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nDose adjustments of Abilify Maintena in patients who are taking concomitant strong CYP2D6 \ninhibitors, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, and/or CYP3A4 inducers for more than 14 days \n \n Adjusted dose \n\nPatients taking 400 mg of Abilify Maintena \nStrong CYP2D6 or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 300 mg \nStrong CYP2D6 and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 200 mg* \nCYP3A4 inducers Avoid use \nPatients taking 300 mg of Abilify Maintena \nStrong CYP2D6 or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 200 mg* \nStrong CYP2D6 and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 160 mg* \nCYP3A4 inducers Avoid use \n\n* 200 mg and 160 mg can be achieved via adjustment of the injection volume only by using Abilify Maintena powder and solvent for \nprolonged-release suspension for injection. \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Abilify Maintena in children and adolescents aged 0-17 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nAbilify Maintena is only intended for intramuscular use and should not be administered intravenously \nor subcutaneously. It should only be administered by a healthcare professional. \n \nThe suspension should be injected slowly as a single injection (doses must not be divided) into the \ngluteal or deltoid muscle. Care should be taken to avoid inadvertent injection into a blood vessel. \n \nFull instructions for use and handling of Abilify Maintena are provided in the package leaflet \n(information intended for healthcare professionals). \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days \nto some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \n \nUse in patients who are in an acutely agitated or severely psychotic state \n \nAbilify Maintena should not be used to manage acutely agitated or severely psychotic states when \nimmediate symptom control is warranted. \n \nSuicidality \n \nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses, and in some cases has been \nreported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including treatment with \n\n\n\n5 \n\naripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high risk patients should accompany antipsychotic \ntreatment. \n \nCardiovascular disorders \n \nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken (see section 4.8). \n \nQT prolongation \n \nIn clinical trials of treatment with oral aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable \nto placebo. Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT \nprolongation (see section 4.8). \n \nTardive dyskinesia \n \nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment. \n \nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \n \nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued (see section 4.8). \n \nSeizure \n \nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. \nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \n \nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \n \nIncreased mortality \nIn three placebo-controlled trials of oral aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with \nAlzheimer's disease (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years), patients treated with \naripiprazole were at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in oral \naripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in placebo. Although the causes of deaths \nwere varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) \nor infectious (e.g. pneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \nIn the same trials with oral aripiprazole, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient \nischaemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: \n78-88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of oral aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse \nreactions compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not \nstatistically significant. However, in one of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose- \nresponse relationship for cerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \n \nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \n \nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with aripiprazole. Risk factors that may predispose patients \nto severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes. Patients treated with \naripiprazole should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, \npolyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for \ndiabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nWeight gain \n \nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic patients due to use of antipsychotics known to cause \nweight gain, co-morbidities, poorly managed life-style and might lead to severe complications. Weight \ngain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed oral aripiprazole. When seen, it is \nusually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid disorder or pituitary \nadenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain \n(see section 4.8). \n \nDysphagia \n \nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of aripiprazole. \nAripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \n \nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \n \nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or \nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \nwhen the dose was reduced or the medicinal productation was discontinued. Impulse control disorders \nmay result in harm to the patient and others if not recognised. A dose reduction or stopping of the \nmedicinal product should be considered if a patient develops such urges (see section 4.8). \n \nFalls \n \nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nSodium \n \nAbilify Maintena contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per dose. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with Abilify Maintena. The information below is obtained \nfrom studies with oral aripiprazole. \n \nDue to its α1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \n \nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \n \nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \n \nPotential for other medicinal products to affect aripiprazole \n \nQuinidine and other strong CYP2D6 inhibitors \nIn a clinical trial of oral aripiprazole in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) \nincreased aripiprazole AUC by 107 %, while Cmax was unchanged. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-\naripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Other strong inhibitors \nof CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be expected to have similar effects and similar \ndose reduction should, therefore, be applied (see section 4.2). \n \nKetoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors \nIn a clinical trial of oral aripiprazole in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) \nincreased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant \nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (see section 4.2). When considering concomitant \nadministration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits \nshould outweigh the potential risks to the patient. Other strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as \nitraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \nreductions should, therefore, be applied (see section 4.2). Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or \nCYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased to the dose prior to the initiation of \nthe concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. diltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. \nescitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases in plasma aripiprazole \nconcentrations may be expected. \n \nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of Cmax \nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when oral \naripiprazole (30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means \nof Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than \nthose following treatment with oral aripiprazole alone. Concomitant administration of Abilify \nMaintena and other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, \nprimidone, efavirenz, nevirapine and St. John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effects. The \nconcomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers with Abilify Maintena should be avoided because the blood \nlevels of aripiprazole are decreased and may be below the effective levels. \n \nSerotonin syndrome \n\n\n\n8 \n\nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \nmedicinal products, such as SSRI/SNRI, or with medicinal products that are known to increase \naripiprazole concentrations (see section 4.8). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by \nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nPrescribers need to be aware of the long-acting properties of Abilify Maintena. \n \nNew-born infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, new-born \ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAripiprazole is excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-\nfeeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of breast \nfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in ≥ 5 % of patients in two \ndouble-blind, long-term trials of Abilify Maintena were weight increased (9.0 %), akathisia (7.9 %), \ninsomnia (5.8 %), and injection site pain (5.1 %). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe incidences of the ADRs associated with aripiprazole therapy are tabulated below. The table is \nbased on adverse reactions reported during clinical trials and/or post-marketing use. \n \nAll ADRs are listed by system organ class and frequency; very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 \nto < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) \n\n\n\n9 \n\nand not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, \nadverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions reported during post-marketing use cannot be determined as they \nare derived from spontaneous reports.

reactions \nDuring the double-blind, controlled phases of the two long-term trials, injection site reactions were \nobserved; those seen were generally mild to moderate in severity, and resolved over time. Injection \nsite pain (incidence 5.1 %), had a median onset on day 2 after the injection and a median duration of \n4 days. \n \nIn an open label study comparing bioavailability of Abilify Maintena administered in the deltoid or \ngluteal muscle, injection site related reactions were slightly more frequent in the deltoid muscle. The \nmajority were mild and improved on subsequent injections. When compared to studies where Abilify \nMaintena was injected in the gluteal muscle, repeated occurrence of injection site pain was more \nfrequent in the deltoid muscle. \n \nLeukopenia \nNeutropenia has been reported in the clinical program with Abilify Maintena and typically started \naround day 16 after first injection, and lasted a median of 18 days. \n \nExtrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS) \nIn trials in stable patients with schizophrenia, Abilify Maintena was associated with a higher \nfrequency of EPS symptoms (18.4 %) than oral aripiprazole treatment (11.7 %). Akathisia was the \nmost frequently observed symptom (8.2 %) and typically started around day 10 after first injection, \nand lasted a median of 56 days. Subjects with akathisia typically received anti-cholinergic medicines \nas treatment, primarily benzatropine mesilate and trihexyphenidyl. Less often substances such as \npropranolol and benzodiazepines (clonazepam and diazepam) were administered to control akathisia. \nParkinsonism events followed in frequency of 6.9 % for Abilify Maintena, 4.15 % for oral aripiprazole \n10-30 mg tablets and 3.0 % for placebo, respectively. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \nDystonia \nClass effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in \nsusceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of \nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty \nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur \nmore frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation \nantipsychotic medicinal products. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger \nage groups. \n \nWeight \nDuring the Double-blind, Active-controlled Phase of the 38-week long-term trial, the incidence of \nweight gain of ≥ 7 % from baseline to last visit was 9.5 % for Abilify Maintena and 11.7 % for the oral \naripiprazole tablets 10-30 mg. The incidence of weight loss of ≥ 7 % from baseline to last visit was \n10.2 % for Abilify Maintena and 4.5 % for oral aripiprazole tablets 10-30 mg. During the Double-\nblind, Placebo-controlled Phase of the 52-week long-term trial, the incidence of weight gain of ≥ 7 % \nfrom baseline to last visit was 6.4 % for Abilify Maintena and 5.2 % for placebo. The incidence of \nweight loss of ≥ 7 % from baseline to last visit was 6.4 % for Abilify Maintena and 6.7 % for placebo. \nDuring double-blind treatment, mean change in body weight from baseline to last visit was -0.2 kg for \nAbilify Maintena and -0.4 kg for placebo (p = 0.812). \n \nProlactin \nIn clinical trials for the approved indications and post-marketing, both increase and decrease in serum \nprolactin as compared to baseline was observed with aripiprazole (section 5.1). \n \nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \nPathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive shopping and binge or compulsive eating can \noccur in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo cases of overdose associated with adverse reactions were reported in clinical studies with Abilify \nMaintena. Care must be taken to avoid inadvertent injection of this medicinal product into a blood \nvessel. Following any confirmed or suspected accidental overdose/inadvertent intravenous \nadministration, close observation of the patient is needed and if any potentially medically serious sign \nor symptom develops, monitoring, which should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, \nis required. The medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. \n \nA simulation of dose dumping showed that the predicted median aripiprazole concentration reaches a \npeak of 4,500 ng/ml or approximately 9 times the upper therapeutic range. In case of dose dumping, \naripiprazole concentrations are predicted to descend rapidly to the upper limit of the therapeutic \nwindow after approximately 3 days. By the 7th day, the median aripiprazole concentrations further \ndecline to concentrations following an IM depot dose with no dose dumping. While overdose is less \nlikely with parenteral than oral medicinal products, reference information for oral aripiprazole \noverdose is presented below. \n \nSigns and symptoms \n \nIn clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdose of \naripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13 \n\n(41 times highest recommended daily aripiprazole dose) with no fatalities. The potentially medically \nimportant signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, \ntachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In addition, reports of accidental overdose with \naripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received with no fatalities. The potentially \nmedically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness \nand extrapyramidal symptoms. \n \nManagement of overdose \n \nManagement of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, \noxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. The possibility of multiple medicinal \nproduct involvement should be considered. Therefore, cardiovascular monitoring should be started \nimmediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible \narrhythmias. Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical \nsupervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. \n \nHaemodialysis \n \nAlthough there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with \naripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is \nhighly bound to plasma proteins. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, other antipsychotics, ATC code: N05AX12 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nIt has been proposed that aripiprazole’s efficacy in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination \nof partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and antagonism at serotonin 5-HT2A \nreceptors. Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \nhyperactivity and agonist properties of dopaminergic hypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibits high binding \naffinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors and has moderate \naffinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic, and histamine H1 receptors. \nAripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no \nappreciable affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors. Interaction with receptors other than \ndopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole. \n \nAripiprazole oral doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for \n2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor \nligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nMaintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults \nThe efficacy of Abilify Maintena in the maintenance treatment of patients with schizophrenia was \nestablished in two randomised, double-blind, long-term trials. \n \nThe pivotal trial was a 38 week, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled trial designed to establish \nthe efficacy, safety, and tolerability of this medicinal product administered as monthly injections \ncompared to once daily oral aripiprazole tablets 10-30 mg as maintenance treatment in adult patients \nwith schizophrenia. This trial consisted of a screening phase and 3 treatment phases: Conversion \nPhase, Oral Stabilisation Phase, and Double-blind, Active-controlled Phase. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nSix-hundred and sixty two patients eligible for the 38-week Double-blind, Active-controlled Phase \nwere randomly assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio to double-blind treatment to one of 3 treatment groups: 1) \nAbilify Maintena 2) the stabilisation dose of oral aripiprazole 10-30 mg, or 3) aripiprazole Long-\nActing Injectable 50 mg/25 mg. The aripiprazole Long-Acting Injectable 50 mg/25 mg dose was \nincluded as a low dose aripiprazole to test assay sensitivity for the non-inferiority design. \n \nThe results of analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, the estimated proportion of patients \nexperiencing impending relapse by end of Week 26 of the Double-blind, Active-controlled Phase, \nshowed that Abilify Maintena 400 mg/300 mg is non-inferior to aripiprazole oral tablets 10-30 mg. \nThe estimated relapse rate by end of Week 26 was 7.12 % for Abilify Maintena, and 7.76 % for oral \naripiprazole tablets 10-30 mg, a difference of -0.64 %. \n \nThe 95 % CI (-5.26, 3.99) for the difference in the estimated proportion of patients experiencing \nimpending relapse by end of Week 26 excluded the predefined non-inferiority margin, 11.5 %. \nTherefore, Abilify Maintena is non-inferior to aripiprazole oral tablets 10-30 mg. \n \nThe estimated proportion of patients experiencing impending relapse by end of Week 26 for Abilify \nMaintena was 7.12 %, which was statistically significantly lower than in aripiprazole Long-Acting \nInjectable 50 mg/25 mg (21.80 %; p = 0.0006). Thus, superiority of Abilify Maintena over the \naripiprazole Long-Acting Injectable 50 mg/25 mg was established and the validity of the trial design \nwas confirmed. \n \nThe Kaplan-Meier curves of the time from randomisation to impending relapse during the 38-week, \nDouble-blind, Active-controlled Phase for Abilify Maintena, oral aripiprazole 10-30 mg, and \naripiprazole Long-Acting Injectable 50 mg/25 mg are shown in Figure 1. \n \nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier Product Limit Plot for Time to Exacerbation of Psychotic \n\nSymptoms/Impending Relapse \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nIMD 400/ 300 mg \n\nARIP 10-30 mg \n\nIMD 50/25 mg \n\nARIP IMD 400/ 300 mg \nARIP 10-30 mg \nARIP IMD 50/25 mg \n\nPr\nop\n\nor\ntio\n\nn \nof\n\n su\nbj\n\nec\nts\n\n fr\nee\n\n o\nf i\n\nm\npe\n\nnd\nin\n\ng \nre\n\nla\nps\n\ne \n\nNumbers of Subjects at Risk \n\nDays from Randomization \n\nLog-Rank Test \nARIP IMD 400/300 mg vs. ARIP 10-30 mg: p value 0.9920 \nARIP IMD 400/300 mg vs. ARIP IMD 50/25 mg: p value < 0.0001 \n\n1.0 \n  \n  \n0.8 \n  \n  \n0.6 \n  \n  \n0.4 \n  \n  \n0.2 \n  \n  \n0.0 \n\n \nNOTE: ARIP IMD 400/300 mg = Abilify Maintena;ARIP 10-30 mg = oral aripiprazole; ARIP IMD 50/25 mg = Long-acting Injectable \n \nFurther, the non-inferiority of Abilify Maintena compared to oral aripiprazole 10-30 mg is supported \nby the results of the analysis of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score (PANSS). \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nTable 1 PANSS Total Score – Change From Baseline to Week 38-LOCF: \nRandomised Efficacy Samplea, b \n\n \nPANSS Total Score – Change From Baseline to Week 38-LOCF: \n\nRandomised Efficacy Samplea, b \n Abilify Maintena \n\n \n 400 mg/300 mg \n\n(n = 263) \n\nOral aripiprazole \n \n\n10-30 mg/day \n(n = 266) \n\nAripiprazole Long-Acting \nInjectable \n\n50 mg/25 mg \n(n = 131) \n\nMean baseline (SD) 57.9 (12.94) 56.6 (12.65) 56.1 (12.59) \nMean change (SD) -1.8 (10.49) 0.7 (11.60) 3.2 (14.45) \nP-value NA 0.0272 0.0002 \n\na: Negative change in score indicates improvement. \nb: Only patients having both baseline and at least one post baseline were included.

This trial consisted of a screening phase and \n4 treatment phases: Conversion, Oral Stabilisation, Abilify Maintena Stabilisation, and Double-blind \nPlacebo-controlled. Patients fulfilling the oral stabilisation requirement in the Oral Stabilisation Phase \nwere assigned to receive, in a single-blind fashion, Abilify Maintena and began an Abilify Maintena \nStabilisation Phase for a minimum of 12 weeks and a maximum of 36 weeks. Patients eligible for the \nDouble-blind, Placebo-controlled Phase were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to double-blind \ntreatment with Abilify Maintena or placebo, respectively. \n \nThe final efficacy analysis included 403 randomised patients and 80 exacerbations of psychotic \nsymptoms/impending relapse events. In the placebo group 39.6 % of the patients had progressed to \nimpending relapse, whilst in the Abilify Maintena group impending relapse occurred in 10 % of the \npatients; thus patients in the placebo group had a 5.03-fold greater risk of experiencing impending \nrelapse. \n \nProlactin \nIn the Double-blind, Active-controlled Phase of the 38-week trial, from baseline to last visit there was \na mean decrease in prolactin levels in Abilify Maintena (−0.33 ng/ml) compared with a mean increase \nin oral aripiprazole tablets 10-30 mg (0.79 ng/ml; p < 0.01). The incidence of Abilify Maintena \npatients with prolactin levels > 1 time the upper limit of normal range (ULN) at any assessment was \n5.4 % compared with 3.5 % of the patients on oral aripiprazole tablets 10-30 mg. \nMale patients generally had a higher incidence than female patients in each treatment group. \n \nIn the Double-blind Placebo-controlled Phase of the 52-week trial, from baseline to last visit there was \na mean decrease in prolactin levels in Abilify Maintena (−0.38 ng/ml) compared with a mean increase \nin placebo (1.67 ng/ml). The incidences of Abilify Maintena patients with prolactin levels > 1 time the \nupper limit of normal range (ULN) was 1.9 % compared to 7.1 % for placebo patients. \n \nAcute treatment of schizophrenia in adults \nThe efficacy of Abilify Maintena in acutely relapsed adult patients with schizophrenia was established \nin a short-term (12-week), randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (n = 339). \nThe primary endpoint (change in PANSS total score from baseline to week 10) showed superiority of \nAbilify Maintena (n = 167) over placebo (n = 172). \nSimilar to the PANSS Total Score, both the PANSS positive and negative subscale scores also showed \nan improvement (decrease) from baseline over time. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nTable 2 PANSS Total Score – Change From Baseline to week 10: Randomised Efficacy \nSample \n\n \nPANSS Total Score – Change From Baseline to Week 10: \n\nRandomised Efficacy Sample a \n Abilify Maintena \n\n400 mg/300 mg \nPlacebo \n\n \n\nMean baseline (SD) 102.4 (11.4) \nn = 162 \n\n103.4 (11.1) \nn = 167 \n\nLS Mean change (SE) -26.8 (1.6) \nn = 99 \n\n-11.7 (1.6) \nn = 81 \n\nP-value < 0.0001  \nTreatment differenceb (95 % CI) -15.1 (-19.4, -10.8)  \n\na Data were analysed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) approach.

The PSP is a validated clinician-rated scale that measures personal and social functioning in four \ndomains: socially useful activities (e.g. work and study), personal and social relationships, self-care, \nand disturbing and aggressive behaviours. There was a statistically significant treatment difference in \nfavour of Abilify Maintena 400 mg/300 mg compared to placebo at week 10 (+7.1, p < 0.0001, 95 % \nCI: 4.1, 10.1 using an ANCOVA model (LOCF)). \n \nThe safety profile was consistent with that known to Abilify Maintena. Nevertheless, there were \ndifferences from what has been observed with maintenance use in the treatment of schizophrenia. In a \nshort-term (12-week), randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with Abilify Maintena \n400 mg/300 mg treated subjects the symptoms which had at least twice the incidence of placebo were \nincreased weight and akathisia. The incidence of weight gain of ≥ 7 % from baseline to last visit \n(week 12) was 21.5 % for Abilify Maintena compared with the placebo group 8.5 %. Akathisia was \nthe most frequently observed EPS symptom (Abilify Maintena 11.4 % and placebo group 3.5 %). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nAbilify Maintena in all subsets of the paediatric population in schizophrenia (see section 4.2). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAripiprazole absorption into the systemic circulation is slow and prolonged following Abilify \nMaintena administration due to low solubility of aripiprazole particles.The average absorption half-life \nof Abilify Maintena is 28 days. Absorption of aripiprazole from the IM depot formulation was \ncomplete relative to the IM standard (immediate-release) formulation. The dose adjusted Cmax values \nfor the depot formulation were approximately 5 % of Cmax from IM standard formulation.Following a \nsingle dose administration of Abilify Maintena in the deltoid and gluteal muscle, the extent of \nabsorption (AUC) was similar for both injection sites, but the rate of absorption (Cmax) was higher \nfollowing administration to the deltoid muscle. Following multiple intramuscular doses, the plasma \nconcentrations of aripiprazole gradually rise to a maximum plasma concentration at a median tmax \nof 7 days for the gluteal muscle and 4 days for the deltoid muscle. Steady state concentrations for the \ntypical subject were attained by the fourth dose for both sites of administration. Less than dose-\nproportional increases in aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole concentrations and AUC parameters \nare observed after monthly Abilify Maintena injections of 300 mg to 400 mg. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nDistribution \n \nBased on results from trials with oral administration of aripiprazole, aripiprazole is widely distributed \nthroughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/kg, indicating extensive \nextravascular distribution. At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are \ngreater than 99 % bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: \ndehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic \ncirculation. After multiple dose administration of Abilify Maintena, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active \nmetabolite, represents about 29.1-32.5 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma. \n \nElimination \n \nAfter administration of multiple dose of 400 mg or 300 mg of Abilify Maintena, the mean aripiprazole \nterminal elimination half-life is respectively 46.5 and 29.9 days presumably due to absorption rate-\nlimited kinetics. Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27 % of the \nadministered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces. Less than \n1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered \nunchanged in the faeces. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n \nCYP2D6 poor metabolisers \nBased on population pharmacokinetic evaluation of Abilify Maintena, the total body clearance of \naripiprazole was 3.71 L/h in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 1.88 L/h \n(approximately 50 % lower) in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 (for dose recommendation, see \nsection 4.2). \n \nElderly \nAfter oral administration of aripiprazole, there are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of \naripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects. Similarly, there was no detectable \neffect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of Abilify Maintena in schizophrenia patients. \n \nGender \nAfter oral administration of aripiprazole, there are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of \naripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects. Similarly, there was no clinically relevant \neffect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of Abilify Maintena in clinical trials in \npatients with schizophrenia. \n \nSmoking \nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation of oral aripiprazole has revealed no evidence of clinically \nrelevant effects from smoking on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \n \nRace \nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation showed no evidence of race-related differences on the \npharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn a single-dose study with oral administration of aripiprazole, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of \naripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease \ncompared to that in young healthy subjects. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nHepatic impairment \nA single-dose study with oral administration of aripiprazole to subjects with varying degrees of liver \ncirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on \nthe pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients \nwith Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe toxicological profile for aripiprazole administered to experimental animals by intramuscular \ninjection is generally similar to that seen following oral administration at comparable plasma levels. \nWith intramuscular injection, however an inflammatory response was seen at the injection site, and \nconsisted of granulomatous inflammation, foci (deposited drug), cellular infiltrates, oedema (swelling) \nand, in monkeys, fibrosis. These effects gradually resolved with discontinuation of dosing. \n \nNon-clinical safety data for orally administered aripiprazole reveal no special hazard for humans based \non conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic \npotential, toxicity to reproduction and development. \n \nOral aripiprazole \n \nFor oral aripiprazole, toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that \nwere sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were \nlimited or of no relevance to clinical use. These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity in \nrats after 104 weeks of oral administration at approximately 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC \nat the maximum recommended human dose and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined \nadrenocortical adenomas/carcinomas in female rats at approximately 10 times the mean steady-state \nAUC at the maximum recommended human dose. The highest non-tumorigenic exposure in female \nrats was approximately 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. \n \nAn additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of \nhydroxy-metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to \n125 mg/kg/day or approximately16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on \nmg/m2. \n \nHowever, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy-aripiprazole in human bile at the \nhighest dose proposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the \nmonkeys in the 39-week study and are well below (6 %) their limits of in vitro solubility. \n \nIn repeated dose studies in juvenile rats and dogs, the toxicity profile of aripiprazole was comparable \nto that observed in adult animals, and there was no evidence of neurotoxicity or adverse events on \ndevelopment. \n \nBased on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole was considered non-\ngenotoxic. Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies. \n \nDevelopmental toxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic \neffects, were observed in rats at doses resulting in sub-therapeutic exposures (based on AUC) and in \nrabbits at doses resulting in exposures approximately 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the \nmaximum recommended clinical dose. Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting \ndevelopmental toxicity. \n \n \n6.

You may feel a little pain during the injection. Your doctor will alternate the \ninjections between your right and left side. The injections will not be given intravenously. \n \nIf you are given more Abilify Maintena than you should \nThis medicine will be given to you under medical supervision; it is therefore unlikely that you will be \ngiven too much.

You should be given an injection every month but not \nbefore the 26 days has passed from the last injection. If you miss an injection, you should contact your \ndoctor to arrange your next injection as soon as you can. \n \nIf you stop receiving Abilify Maintena \nDo not stop your treatment just because you feel better.

And then, rotate plunger rod until the rod stops \n\nrotating to release diluent. After plunger rod is at complete stop, middle stopper will be at the \nindicator line. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nIndicator line \n\n \n\n \n\nPlunger Rod \n\n \nb) Vertically shake the syringe vigorously for 20 seconds until the reconstituted suspension \n\nappears uniform. The suspension should be injected immediately after reconstitution. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nuniform \nmilky white \n \n\n20 seconds \n\n \nc) Visually inspect the syringe for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. The \n\nreconstituted product suspension should appear to be a uniform, homogeneous suspension that \nis opaque and milky-white in colour. \n\n\n\n94 \n\n \nd) If the injection is not performed immediately after reconstitution, the syringe can be kept below \n\n25 °C for up to 2 hours. Shake the syringe vigorously for at least 20 seconds to re-suspend prior \nto injection if the syringe has been left for more than 15 minutes. \n\n \nStep 3: Injection procedure \na) Twist and pull off Over-cap and Tip-cap. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nTwist + \nPull Off \n \nOver-cap \n\n \n\n \n\nTip-cap \n \n\nTwist + Pull Off \n \n\n \nb) Select one of the following hypodermic safety needles depending on the injection site and \n\npatient’s weight. \n \n\nBody type Injection site Needle size \n \nNon-obese \n\n \nDeltoid \n\n \n25 mm (1 inch) 23 gauge \n\n Gluteal 38 mm (1.5 inch) 22 gauge \n \nObese \n\n \nDeltoid \n\n \n38 mm (1.5 inch) 22 gauge \n\n Gluteal 51 mm (2 inch) 21 gauge \n \nc) While holding the needle cap, ensure the needle is firmly seated on the safety device with a \n\npush. Twist clockwise until snugly fitted. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nNeedle cap \n\n \nd) Then pull needle-cap straight up. \n \n\n \n \n\nNeedle cap \n\n \n\n \n \nPull \n \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \ne) Hold syringe upright and advance plunger rod slowly to expel the air. If it's not possible to \n\nadvance plunger rod to expel the air, check that plunger rod is rotated to a complete stop. It is \nnot possible to re-suspend after the air in the syringe is expelled. \n\n \n\n*If there’s resistance or \ndifficulty expelling air, check \nthat plunger rod is rotated to a \n\ncomplete stop.  \n\n \n \nExpel air until suspension fills needle \nbase* \n\n \n \nf) Slowly inject into the gluteal or deltoid muscle. Do not massage the injection site. Care must be \n\ntaken to avoid inadvertent injection into the blood vessel. Do not inject into an area with signs \nof inflammation, skin damage, lumps and/or bruises. For deep intramuscular gluteal or deltoid \ninjection only. \n\n \n\n \ndeltoid gluteal \n\n \nRemember to rotate sites of injections between the two gluteal or deltoid muscles. Look for \nsigns or symptoms of inadvertent intravenous administration. \n\n \nStep 4: Procedures after injection \nEngage the needle safety device. Dispose of the needle and pre-filled syringe appropriately after \ninjection. \n \n\n \nCover Discard \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n96 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX IV \n \n\nSCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS \nOF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S) \n\n \n\n\n\n97 \n\nScientific conclusions \n \nTaking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for aripiprazole, the scientific \nconclusions of CHMP are as follows: \n \nThe cumulative review of post-marketing cases indicates there is an existence of potential association \nof aripiprazole and photophobia and the comparison of reference safety information documents, \nshowed that photophobia is not a new ADR. Of the 97 post-marketing cases, in 33 cases (34 %) a \npossible role of aripiprazole could not be excluded (this is based on temporal association, and \nimprovement/recovery of symptoms either on discontinuation or dose reduction of aripiprazole), and \nthere were 25 (26 %) cases in which there was a positive dechallenge, and 2 cases with a rechallenge \npositive. Moreover, results of the medical safety review of Abilify and Abilify Maintena cases from \nthe clinical trials indicated that the incidence rate for aripiprazole was 0.2 % (52/28729) compared to \nplacebo 0.0 % (4/9234). \n \nOf note, the CCDS for the originator product already mentions the ADR photophobia following \nadministration of oral Abilify during clinical trials. Also, the US-SmPC includes photophobia. \n \nThe PRAC considers that Photophobia should be listed in SmPC section 4.8 of all aripiprazole \ncontaining products, with frequency “Uncommon”, under SOC Eye disorders. \n \nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n \nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n \nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for aripiprazole the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-\nrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing aripiprazole is unchanged subject to the proposed \nchanges to the product information. \n \nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
