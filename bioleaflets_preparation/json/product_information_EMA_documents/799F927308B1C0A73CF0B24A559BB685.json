PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion (powder for concentrate).\n\nWhite to yellowish powder.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nZerbaxa is indicated for the treatment of the following infections in adults (see section 5.1):\n\n- Complicated intra-abdominal infections (see section 4.4);\n- Acute pyelonephritis;\n- Complicated urinary tract infections (see section 4.4);\n- Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).\n\nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended intravenous dose regimen for patients with creatinine clearance > 50 mL/min is \nshown by infection type in Table 1.\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nTable 1: Intravenous dose of Zerbaxa by type of infection in patients with creatinine clearance \n> 50 mL/min\nType of infection Dose Frequency Infusion \n\ntime\nDuration of \ntreatment\n\nComplicated intra-abdominal \ninfection*\n\n1 g ceftolozane / \n0.5 g tazobactam\n\nEvery \n8 hours\n\n1 hour 4-14 days\n\nComplicated urinary tract \ninfection\nAcute pyelonephritis\n\n1 g ceftolozane / \n0.5 g tazobactam\n\nEvery \n8 hours\n\n1 hour 7 days\n\nHospital-acquired pneumonia, \nincluding ventilator-associated \npneumonia**\n\n2 g ceftolozane / \n1 g tazobactam\n\nEvery \n8 hours\n\n1 hour 8-14 days\n\n*To be used in combination with metronidazole when anaerobic pathogens are suspected.\n**To be used in combination with an antibacterial agent active against Gram-positive pathogens when \nthese are known or suspected to be contributing to the infectious process.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly (≥ 65 years of age)\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for the elderly based on age alone (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nIn patients with mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance [CrCL] > 50 mL/min), no dose \nadjustment is necessary (see section 5.2).\n\nIn patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, and in patients with end stage renal disease on \nhaemodialysis, the dose should be adjusted as listed in Table 2 (see sections 5.1 and 6.6).\n\nTable 2: Recommended intravenous dose regimens for Zerbaxa in patients with creatinine \nclearance ≤ 50 mL/min\nEstimated \nCrCL \n(mL/min)*\n\nComplicated intra-abdominal \ninfections, complicated urinary tract \ninfections, and acute pyelonephritis**\n\nHospital-acquired pneumonia, \nincluding ventilator-associated \npneumonia**\n\n30 to 50\n500 mg ceftolozane / 250 mg tazobactam \nintravenously every 8 hours\n\n1 g ceftolozane / 0.5 g tazobactam \nintravenously every 8 hours\n\n15 to 29\n250 mg ceftolozane / 125 mg tazobactam\nintravenously every 8 hours\n\n500 mg ceftolozane / 250 mg tazobactam\nintravenously every 8 hours\n\nEnd stage \nrenal disease \non \nhaemodialysis\n\nA single loading dose of 500 mg \nceftolozane / 250 mg tazobactam\nfollowed after 8 hours by a 100 mg \nceftolozane / 50 mg tazobactam\nmaintenance dose administered every \n8 hours for the remainder of the \ntreatment period (on haemodialysis days, \nthe dose should be administered at the \nearliest possible time following \ncompletion of haemodialysis)\n\nA single loading dose of 1.5 g \nceftolozane / 0.75 g tazobactam followed\nafter 8 hours by a 300 mg ceftolozane / \n150 mg tazobactam maintenance dose \nadministered every 8 hours for the \nremainder of the treatment period (on \nhaemodialysis days, the dose should be \nadministered at the earliest possible time \nfollowing completion of haemodialysis)\n\n*CrCL estimated using Cockcroft-Gault formula.\n**All doses of Zerbaxa are administered intravenously over 1 hour and are recommended for all \nindications. The duration of treatment should follow the recommendations in Table 1.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of ceftolozane/tazobactam in children and adolescents below 18 years of age \nhave not yet been established. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nZerbaxa is to be administered by intravenous infusion over a 1 hour period for all doses.\n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the product\nSee section 6.2 for incompatibilities.\n\nSee section 6.6 for instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before \nadministration.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1;\n- Hypersensitivity to any cephalosporin antibacterial agent;\n- Severe hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reaction, severe skin reaction) to any other type of\n\nbeta-lactam antibacterial agent (e.g., penicillins or carbapenems).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\n\nSerious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions are possible (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.8). If a severe allergic reaction occurs during treatment with ceftolozane/tazobactam, the \nmedicinal product should be discontinued and appropriate measures taken.\n\nPatients who have a history of hypersensitivity to cephalosporins, penicillins or other beta-lactam\nantibacterial agents may also be hypersensitive to ceftolozane/tazobactam.\n\nCeftolozane/tazobactam is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to ceftolozane, \ntazobactam, or cephalosporins (see section 4.3).\n\nCeftolozane/tazobactam is also contraindicated in patients with severe hypersensitivity (e.g.,\nanaphylactic reaction, severe skin reaction) to any other type of beta-lactam antibacterial agent (e.g.,\npenicillins or carbapenems) (see section 4.3). \n\nCeftolozane/tazobactam should be used with caution in patients with a history of any other type of \nhypersensitivity reaction to penicillins or other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. \n\nEffect on renal function\n\nA decline in renal function has been seen in patients receiving ceftolozane/tazobactam.\n\nImpaired renal function\n\nThe ceftolozane/tazobactam dose should be adjusted based on renal function (see section 4.2, Table 2).\n\nIn clinical trials of complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated urinary tract infections, \nincluding pyelonephritis, the efficacy of ceftolozane/tazobactam was lower in patients with moderate \nrenal impairment compared with those with normal or mildly impaired renal function at baseline. \nPatients with renal impairment at baseline should be monitored frequently for any changes in renal \nfunction during treatment and the dose of ceftolozane/tazobactam should be adjusted as necessary.\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nLimitations of the clinical data\n\nPatients who were immunocompromised, patients with severe neutropenia, and patients with end stage \nrenal disease on haemodialysis were excluded from clinical trials.\n\nComplicated intra-abdominal infections\nIn a trial in patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections, the most common diagnosis was \nappendiceal perforation or peri-appendiceal abscess (420/970 [43.3%] patients), of which 137/420 \n(32.6%) had diffuse peritonitis at baseline. Approximately 82% of all patients in the trial had \nAPACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) scores of < 10 and 2.3% had \nbacteraemia at baseline. In the clinically evaluable (CE) patients, the clinical cure rates for \nceftolozane/tazobactam were 95.9% in 293 patients aged less than 65 years and 87.8% in 82 patients \naged 65 years or more.\n\nComplicated urinary tract infections\nClinical efficacy data in patients with complicated lower urinary tract infection are limited. In a \nrandomised active-controlled trial 18.2% (126/693) of microbiologically evaluable (ME) patients had \ncomplicated lower urinary tract infection, including 60/126 patients who were treated with \nceftolozane/tazobactam. One of these 60 patients had bacteraemia at baseline.\n\nClostridioides difficile-associated diarrhoea\n\nAntibacterial-associated colitis and pseudomembranous colitis have been reported with \nceftolozane/tazobactam (see section 4.8). These types of infection may range in severity from mild to \nlife-threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with \ndiarrhoea during or subsequent to the administration of ceftolozane/tazobactam. In such \ncircumstances, the discontinuation of therapy with ceftolozane/tazobactam and the use of supportive \nmeasures together with the administration of specific treatment for Clostridioides difficile should be \nconsidered.\n\nNon-susceptible micro-organisms\n\nThe use of ceftolozane/tazobactam may promote the overgrowth of non-susceptible micro-organisms. \nIf super infection occurs during or following treatment, appropriate measures should be taken.\n\nCeftolozane/tazobactam is not active against bacteria that produce beta-lactamase enzymes which are \nnot inhibited by tazobactam (see section 5.1).\n\nDirect antiglobulin test (Coombs test) seroconversion and potential risk of haemolytic anaemia\n\nThe development of a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAGT) may occur during treatment with\nceftolozane/tazobactam (see section 4.8). In clinical studies, there was no evidence of haemolysis in \npatients who developed a positive DAGT on treatment.\n\nSodium content\n\nCeftolozane/tazobactam contains 230 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 11.5% of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. The reconstituted vial with 10 mL of \n0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline) for injection contains 265 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to \n13.3% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo significant medicinal product interactions are anticipated between ceftolozane/tazobactam and \nsubstrates, inhibitors, and inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) based on in vitro and in vivo\nstudies.\n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nIn vitro studies demonstrated that ceftolozane, tazobactam and the M1 metabolite of tazobactam did \nnot inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4 and did not \ninduce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 at therapeutic plasma concentrations.\n\nCeftolozane and tazobactam were not substrates for P-gp or BCRP, and tazobactam was not a \nsubstrate for OCT2, in vitro at therapeutic plasma concentrations. In vitro data indicate that \nceftolozane did not inhibit P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, MRP, BSEP, OAT1, \nOAT3, MATE1, or MATE2-K in vitro at therapeutic plasma concentrations. In vitro data indicate that \nneither tazobactam nor the tazobactam metabolite M1 inhibit P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, \nOCT1, OCT2, or BSEP transporters at therapeutic plasma concentrations.\n\nTazobactam is a substrate for OAT1 and OAT3. In vitro, tazobactam inhibited human OAT1 and \nOAT3 transporters with IC50 values of 118 and 147 mcg/mL, respectively. Co-administration of \nceftolozane/tazobactam with OAT1 and OAT3 substrate furosemide in a clinical study did not \nsignificantly increase furosemide plasma exposures (geometric mean ratios of 0.83 and 0.87 for Cmax\n\nand AUC, respectively). However, active substances that inhibit OAT1 or OAT3 (e.g., probenecid) \nmay increase tazobactam plasma concentrations.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data on the use of ceftolozane/tazobactam in pregnant women. Tazobactam crosses the \nplacenta. It is not known if ceftolozane crosses the placenta.\n\nAnimal studies with tazobactam have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3) without evidence \nof teratogenic effects. Studies with ceftolozane in mice and rats have not shown evidence of \nreproductive toxicity or teratogenicity. Ceftolozane administered to rats during pregnancy and breast-\nfeeding was associated with a decrease in auditory startle response in postnatal day (PND) 60 male \npups (see section 5.3).\n\nZerbaxa should only be used during pregnancy if the expected benefit outweighs the possible risks to \nthe pregnant woman and foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether ceftolozane and tazobactam are excreted in human milk. A risk to \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding \nor to discontinue/abstain from Zerbaxa therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the \nchild and the benefit of therapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\n\nThe effects of ceftolozane and tazobactam on fertility in humans have not been studied. Fertility \nstudies in rats showed no effect on fertility and mating after intraperitoneal administration of \ntazobactam or intravenous administration of ceftolozane (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nZerbaxa may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness may occur \nfollowing administration of Zerbaxa (see section 4.8).\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nZerbaxa was evaluated in Phase 3 comparator-controlled clinical trials of complicated intra-abdominal \ninfections and complicated urinary tract infections (including pyelonephritis). \n\nThe most common adverse reactions (≥ 3% in pooled Phase 3 trials of complicated intra-abdominal \ninfections and complicated urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis) occurring in patients \nreceiving Zerbaxa were nausea, headache, constipation, diarrhoea, and pyrexia and were generally \nmild or moderate in severity.\n\nZerbaxa was evaluated in a Phase 3 comparator-controlled clinical trial of hospital-acquired\npneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (≥ 5% in a Phase 3 trial of hospital-acquired pneumonia, \nincluding ventilator-associated pneumonia) occurring in patients receiving Zerbaxa were diarrhoea, \nalanine aminotransferase increased, and aspartate aminotransferase increased and were generally mild \nor moderate in severity.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during clinical trials with Zerbaxa. Adverse \nreactions are classified according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency. Frequency \ncategories are derived according to the following conventions: common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), \nuncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) (see Table 3).\n\nTable 3: Adverse reactions identified during clinical trials with ceftolozane/tazobactam\n\nSystem organ class\nCommon \n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10)\n\nUncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100)\n\nInfections and infestations Clostridioides difficile colitis2\n\nCandidiasis including \noropharyngeal and vulvovaginal1, \nClostridioides difficile colitis1, \nfungal urinary tract infection1, \nClostridioides difficile infection2\n\nBlood and the lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nThrombocytosis1 Anaemia1\n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders\n\nHypokalemia1\nHyperglycaemia1, \nhypomagnesaemia1, \nhypophosphataemia1\n\nPsychiatric disorders Insomnia1, anxiety1\n\nNervous system disorders Headache1, dizziness1 Ischemic stroke1\n\nCardiac disorders\nAtrial fibrillation1, tachycardia1, \nangina pectoris1\n\nVascular disorders Hypotension1 Phlebitis1, venous thrombosis1\n\nRespiratory, thoracic, and \nmediastinal disorders\n\nDyspnoea1\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nNausea1, diarrhoea3, constipation1, \nvomiting3, abdominal pain1\n\nGastritis1, abdominal distension1, \ndyspepsia1, flatulence1, ileus \nparalytic1\n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nRash1 Urticaria1\n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders\n\nRenal impairment1, renal failure1\n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nSystem organ class\nCommon \n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10)\n\nUncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100)\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions\n\nPyrexia1, infusion site reactions1\n\nInvestigations\n\nAlanine aminotransferase increased3, \naspartate aminotransferase increased3, \ntransaminases increased2, liver function \ntest abnormal2, blood alkaline \nphosphatase increased2, gamma-\nglutamyltransferase increased2\n\nCoombs test positive3, increased \nserum gamma-glutamyl \ntranspeptidase (GGT)1, increased \nserum alkaline phosphatase1, \nClostridioides test positive2\n\n1 Specific for the complicated intra-abdominal infections, acute pyelonephritis, and complicated \nurinary tract infections indications treated with Zerbaxa (1 g / 0.5 g intravenously every 8 hours) for \nup to 14 days.\n2 Specific for the hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia indication \ntreated with Zerbaxa (2 g / 1 g intravenously every 8 hours) for up to 14 days.\n3 Applies across all indications: complicated intra-abdominal infections, acute pyelonephritis, \ncomplicated urinary tract infections, and hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated \npneumonia.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nLaboratory values\nThe development of a positive direct Coombs test may occur during treatment with Zerbaxa. The \nincidence of seroconversion to a positive direct Coombs test was 0.2% in patients receiving Zerbaxa \nand 0% in patients receiving the comparator in the complicated intra-abdominal infections and \ncomplicated urinary tract infections clinical trials. The incidence of seroconversion to a positive direct \nCoombs test was 31.2% in patients receiving Zerbaxa and 3.6% in patients receiving meropenem in \nthe hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia clinical trial. In clinical \nstudies, there was no evidence of haemolysis in patients who developed a positive direct Coombs test \nin any treatment group.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no experience with overdose of Zerbaxa. The highest single dose of Zerbaxa used in clinical \ntrials was 3 g / 1.5 g of ceftolozane/tazobactam administered to healthy volunteers.\n\nIn the event of overdose, Zerbaxa should be discontinued and general supportive treatment given. \nZerbaxa can be removed by haemodialysis. Approximately 66% of ceftolozane, 56% of tazobactam, \nand 51% of the M1 metabolite of tazobactam were removed by dialysis. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, other cephalosporins and penems, \nATC code: J01DI54.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9\n\nMechanism of action\n\nCeftolozane belongs to the cephalosporin class of antimicrobials. Ceftolozane exerts bactericidal \nactivity through binding to important penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), resulting in inhibition of \nbacterial cell-wall synthesis and subsequent cell death. \n\nTazobactam is a beta-lactam structurally related to penicillins. It is an inhibitor of many molecular \nClass A beta-lactamases, including CTX-M, SHV, and TEM enzymes. See below.\n\nMechanisms of resistance\n\nMechanisms of bacterial resistance to ceftolozane/tazobactam include:\ni. Production of beta-lactamases that can hydrolyse ceftolozane and which are not inhibited \n\nby tazobactam (see below)\nii. Modification of PBPs\n\nTazobactam does not inhibit all Class A enzymes.\nIn addition tazobactam does not inhibit the following types of beta-lactamase:\n\ni. AmpC enzymes (produced by Enterobacterales)\nii. Serine-based carbapenemases (e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases [KPCs])\niii. Metallo-beta-lactamases (e.g., New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase [NDM])\niv. Ambler Class D beta-lactamases (OXA-carbapenemases)\n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships\n\nFor ceftolozane the time that the plasma concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration \nof ceftolozane for the infecting organism has been shown to be the best predictor of efficacy in animal \nmodels of infection. \n\nFor tazobactam the PD index associated with efficacy was determined to be the percentage of the dose \ninterval during which the plasma concentration of tazobactam exceeds a threshold value \n(%T > threshold). The time above a threshold concentration has been determined to be the parameter \nthat best predicts the efficacy of tazobactam in in vitro and in vivo non-clinical models.\n\nSusceptibility testing breakpoints\n\nMinimum inhibitory concentration breakpoints established by the European Committee on \nAntimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) are as follows:\n\nMinimum Inhibitory \nConcentrations (mg/L)\n\nPathogen Type of Infection Susceptible Resistant \nEnterobacterales Complicated intra-abdominal infections*\n\nComplicated urinary tract infections*\nAcute pyelonephritis*\nHospital-acquired pneumonia, including \nventilator-associated pneumonia**\n\n≤ 2 > 2\n\nP. aeruginosa Complicated intra-abdominal infections*\nComplicated urinary tract infections*\nAcute pyelonephritis*\nHospital-acquired pneumonia, including \nventilator-associated pneumonia**\n\n≤ 4 > 4\n\nH. influenzae Hospital-acquired pneumonia, including \nventilator-associated pneumonia**\n\n≤ 0.5 > 0.5\n\n*Based on 1 g ceftolozane / 0.5 g tazobactam intravenously every 8 hours.\n**Based on 2 g ceftolozane / 1 g tazobactam intravenously every 8 hours.\n\n \n\n\n\n10\n\nClinical efficacy against specific pathogens\n\nEfficacy has been demonstrated in clinical studies against the pathogens listed under each indication \nthat were susceptible to Zerbaxa in vitro:\n\nComplicated intra-abdominal infections\n\nGram-negative bacteria\nEnterobacter cloacae\nEscherichia coli \nKlebsiella oxytoca\nKlebsiella pneumoniae\nProteus mirabilis\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n\nGram-positive bacteria\nStreptococcus anginosus\nStreptococcus constellatus\nStreptococcus salivarius\n\nComplicated urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis \n\nGram-negative bacteria\nEscherichia coli \nKlebsiella pneumoniae\nProteus mirabilis\n\nHospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia\n\nGram-negative bacteria\nEnterobacter cloacae\nEscherichia coli\nHaemophilus influenzae\nKlebsiella oxytoca\nKlebsiella pneumoniae\nProteus mirabilis\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\nSerratia marcescens\n\nClinical efficacy has not been established against the following pathogens although in vitro studies \nsuggest that they would be susceptible to Zerbaxa in the absence of acquired mechanisms of \nresistance:\nCitrobacter freundii\nCitrobacter koseri\nKlebsiella (Enterobacter) aerogenes\nMorganella morganii\nProteus vulgaris\nSerratia liquefaciens\n\nIn vitro data indicate that the following species are not susceptible to ceftolozane/tazobactam:\nStaphylococcus aureus\nEnterococcus faecalis\nEnterococcus faecium\n\n \n\n\n\n11\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nZerbaxa in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in complicated intra-abdominal infection, \ncomplicated urinary tract infection, and hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated \npneumonia (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe Cmax and AUC of ceftolozane/tazobactam increase approximately in proportion to dose within \nceftolozane single-dose range of 250 mg to 3 g and tazobactam single-dose range of 500 mg to 1.5 g. \nNo appreciable accumulation of ceftolozane/tazobactam is observed following multiple 1-hour IV \ninfusions of 1 g / 0.5 g ceftolozane/tazobactam or 2 g / 1 g ceftolozane/tazobactam administered every \n8 hours for up to 10 days in healthy adults with normal renal function. The elimination half-life (t½) of \nceftolozane or tazobactam is independent of dose.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe binding of ceftolozane and tazobactam to human plasma proteins is low (approximately 16% to \n21% and 30%, respectively). The mean (coefficient of variation CV%) steady-state volume of \ndistribution of ceftolozane/tazobactam in healthy adult males (n=51) following a single 1 g / 0.5 g IV \ndose was 13.5 L (21%) and 18.2 L (25%) for ceftolozane and tazobactam, respectively, similar to \nextracellular fluid volume.\n\nFollowing 1 hour intravenous infusions of 2 g / 1 g ceftolozane/tazobactam or adjusted based on renal \nfunction every 8 hours in ventilated patients with confirmed or suspected pneumonia (N=22), \nceftolozane and tazobactam concentrations in pulmonary epithelial lining fluid were greater than \n8 mcg/mL and 1 mcg/mL, respectively, over 100% of the dosing interval. Mean pulmonary \nepithelial-to-free plasma AUC ratios of ceftolozane and tazobactam were approximately 50% and \n62%, respectively and are similar to those in healthy subjects (approximately 61% and 63%, \nrespectively) receiving 1 g / 0.5 g ceftolozane/tazobactam.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nCeftolozane is eliminated in the urine as unchanged parent substance and thus does not appear to be \nmetabolised to any appreciable extent. The beta-lactam ring of tazobactam is hydrolysed to form the \npharmacologically inactive, tazobactam metabolite M1.\n\nElimination\n\nCeftolozane, tazobactam and the tazobactam metabolite M1 are eliminated by the kidneys. Following \nadministration of a single 1 g / 0.5 g IV dose of ceftolozane/tazobactam to healthy male adults greater \nthan 95% of ceftolozane was excreted in the urine as unchanged parent substance. More than 80% of \ntazobactam was excreted as the parent compound with the remaining amount excreted as the \ntazobactam M1 metabolite. After a single dose of ceftolozane/tazobactam, renal clearance of \nceftolozane (3.41 - 6.69 L/h) was similar to plasma clearance (4.10 - 6.73 L/h) and similar to the \nglomerular filtration rate for the unbound fraction, suggesting that ceftolozane is eliminated by the \nkidney via glomerular filtration.\n\nThe mean terminal elimination half-life of ceftolozane and tazobactam in healthy adults with normal \nrenal function is approximately 3 hours and 1 hour, respectively. \n\nLinearity/non-linearity\n\nThe Cmax and AUC of ceftolozane/tazobactam increase in proportion to dose. Plasma levels of \nceftolozane/tazobactam do not increase appreciably following multiple IV infusions of up to \n\n \n\n\n\n12\n\n2.0 g / 1.0 g administered every 8 hours for up to 10 days in healthy adults with normal renal function. \nThe elimination half-life (t½) of ceftolozane is independent of dose.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\nCeftolozane/tazobactam and the tazobactam metabolite M1 are eliminated by the kidneys. \n\nThe ceftolozane dose normalised geometric mean AUC increased up to 1.26-fold, 2.5-fold, and 5-fold \nin subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, compared to healthy \nsubjects with normal renal function. The respective tazobactam dose normalized geometric mean AUC \nincreased approximately up to 1.3-fold, 2-fold, and 4-fold. To maintain similar systemic exposures to \nthose with normal renal function, dosage adjustment is required (see section 4.2).\n\nIn subjects with end stage renal disease on haemodialysis, approximately two-thirds of the \nadministered ceftolozane/tazobactam dose is removed by haemodialysis. The recommended dose in\ncomplicated intra-abdominal infections, complicated urinary tract infections, and acute pyelonephritis\nsubjects with end stage renal disease on haemodialysis is a single loading dose of 500 mg / 250 mg \nceftolozane/tazobactam followed by a 100 mg / 50 mg maintenance dose of ceftolozane/tazobactam \nadministered every 8 hours for the remainder of the treatment period. The recommended dose in \nhospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia subjects with end stage renal \ndisease on haemodialysis is a single loading dose of 1.5 g / 0.75 g ceftolozane/tazobactam followed by \na 300 mg / 150 mg maintenance dose of ceftolozane/tazobactam administered every 8 hours for the \nremainder of the treatment period. With haemodialysis, the dose should be administered immediately \nfollowing completion of dialysis (see section 4.2).\n\nAugmented renal clearance\nFollowing a single 1-hour intravenous infusion of 2 g / 1 g ceftolozane/tazobactam to critically ill \npatients with CrCL greater than or equal to 180 mL/min (N=10), mean terminal half-life values of \n\nceftolozane and tazobactam were 2.6 hours and 1.5 hours, respectively. Free plasma ceftolozane \nconcentrations were greater than 8 mcg/mL over 70% of an 8-hour period; free tazobactam \nconcentrations were greater than 1 mcg/mL over 60% of an 8-hour period. No dose adjustment of \nceftolozane/tazobactam is recommended for hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-\nassociated pneumonia patients with augmented renal clearance.\n\nHepatic impairment\nAs ceftolozane/tazobactam does not undergo hepatic metabolism, the systemic clearance of \nceftolozane/tazobactam is not expected to be affected by hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is \nrecommended for ceftolozane/tazobactam in subjects with hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).\n\nElderly\nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of ceftolozane/tazobactam, no clinically relevant differences\nin exposure were observed with regard to age. No dose adjustment of ceftolozane/tazobactam based on \nage alone is recommended.\n\nPaediatric patients\nSafety and efficacy in paediatric patients have not been established.\n\nGender\nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of ceftolozane/tazobactam, no clinically relevant differences \nin AUC were observed for ceftolozane and tazobactam. No dose adjustment is recommended based on \ngender.\n\nEthnicity\nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of ceftolozane/tazobactam, no clinically relevant differences \nin ceftolozane/tazobactam AUC were observed in Caucasians compared to other ethnicities. No dose \nadjustment is recommended based on race.\n\n \n\n\n\n13\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity or genotoxicity. Carcinogenicity studies with \nceftolozane/tazobactam have not been conducted.\n\nEffects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the \nmaximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.\n\nAdverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to \nclinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: ceftolozane \nadministered to rats during pregnancy and breast-feeding was associated with a decrease in auditory \nstartle response in postnatal day (PND) 60 male pups at maternal doses of 300 and 1,000 mg/kg/day. \nA dose of 300 mg/kg/day to rats was associated with a ceftolozane plasma exposure (AUC) value \nlower than the ceftolozane plasma AUC value at the highest recommended human dose of 2 grams \nevery 8 hours.\n\nPeri/postnatal development was impaired (reduced pup weights, increase in stillbirths, increase in pup \nmortality) concurrent with maternal toxicity after intraperitoneal administration of tazobactam in the \nrat.\n\nEnvironmental risk assessment (ERA)\n\nEnvironmental risk assessment studies have shown that one of the active ingredients, ceftolozane, may \npose a risk to surface water organisms (see section 6.6).\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Zerbaxa is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Zerbaxa\n3. How to take Zerbaxa\n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Zerbaxa\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Zerbaxa is and what it is used for\n\nZerbaxa is a medicine used to treat a range of bacterial infections. It contains two active substances:\n- ceftolozane, an antibiotic that belongs to the group of “cephalosporins” and which can kill \n\ncertain bacteria that can cause infection;\n- tazobactam, which blocks the action of certain enzymes called beta-lactamases. These enzymes \n\nmake bacteria resistant to ceftolozane by breaking down the antibiotic before it can act. By \nblocking their action, tazobactam makes ceftolozane more effective at killing bacteria. \n\nZerbaxa is used in adults to treat complicated infections within the abdomen, kidney and urinary \nsystem infections, and an infection of the lungs called “pneumonia”.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Zerbaxa\n\nDo not take Zerbaxa\n- if you are allergic to ceftolozane, tazobactam or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n- if you are allergic to medicines known as “cephalosporins”. \n- if you have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., severe skin peeling; swelling of the face, hands, \n\nfeet, lips, tongue or throat; or difficulty swallowing or breathing) to certain other antibiotics \n(e.g., penicillins or carbapenems).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Zerbaxa if you know you are, or have previously been \nallergic to cephalosporins, penicillins or other antibiotics.\n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist if you develop diarrhoea while taking Zerbaxa.\n\nInfections caused by bacteria that are not sensitive to Zerbaxa or caused by a fungus can occur during \nor following treatment with Zerbaxa. Tell your doctor if you think you may have another infection.\n\nTreatment with Zerbaxa sometimes causes production of antibodies that react with your red blood \ncells. If you are told that you have an abnormal blood test (called Coombs test) tell your doctor that \nyou are having or have recently had Zerbaxa.\n\n \n\n\n\n25\n\nChildren and adolescents\nThis medicine should not be given to children under 18 years old because there is not enough \ninformation on use in this age group.\n\nOther medicines and Zerbaxa\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nSome medicines may interact with ceftolozane and tazobactam. These include:\n- Probenecid (a medicine for gout). This can increase the time it takes for tazobactam to leave \n\nyour body.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or think you may be pregnant, ask your doctor or pharmacist for \nadvice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will advise if you should receive Zerbaxa during \npregnancy. \n\nIf you are breast-feeding, your doctor will advise you on whether you should stop breast-feeding or \nstop or avoid Zerbaxa therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the \nbenefit of therapy for you.\n\nDriving and using machines\nZerbaxa may cause dizziness, which can affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n\nZerbaxa contains sodium\nThis medicine contains 230 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is \nequivalent to 11.5% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. The \nreconstituted vial with 10 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline) for injection contains 265 mg \nsodium in each vial. This is equivalent to 13.3% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of \nsodium for an adult.\n\n3. How to take Zerbaxa\n\nYour doctor or other healthcare professional will give you this medicine into one of your veins\nthrough an infusion (a drip) lasting one hour. The dose of medicine given to you depends on whether \nor not you have kidney problems.\n\nAdults\nThe dose depends on the type of infection that you have, where the infection is in your body and how \nserious the infection is. Your doctor will decide on the dose that you need.\n\nThe recommended dose of Zerbaxa is 1 g of ceftolozane and 0.5 g of tazobactam or 2 g of ceftolozane \nand 1 g of tazobactam every 8 hours, which is given into one of your veins (directly into the \nbloodstream).\n\nTreatment with Zerbaxa normally lasts between 4 and 14 days, depending on the severity and location \nof the infection and on how your body responds to the treatment.\n\nPatients with kidney problems\nYour doctor may need to reduce the dose of Zerbaxa or decide how often Zerbaxa is given to you. \nYour doctor may also want to test your blood to make sure you receive an appropriate dose, especially \nif you have to take this medicine for a long time.\n\n \n\n\n\n26\n\nIf you take more Zerbaxa than you should\nAs this product is given by a doctor or other healthcare professional, it is very unlikely that you will be \ngiven too much Zerbaxa. However, if you have any concerns you should let your doctor, nurse or \npharmacist know immediately.\n\nIf you stop taking Zerbaxa\nIf you think you have not been given a dose of Zerbaxa, tell your doctor or other healthcare \nprofessional immediately.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4.
