This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTecartus 0.4 \u2013 2 \u00d7 108 cells dispersion for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n2.1 General description \n \nTecartus (autologous anti-CD19-transduced CD3+ cells) is a gene therapy medicinal product \ncontaining autologous T cells genetically modified ex vivo using a retroviral vector encoding an \nanti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) comprising a murine anti-CD19 single chain variable \nfragment (scFv) linked to CD28 co-stimulatory domain and CD3-zeta signalling domain.  \n \n2.2 Qualitative and quantitative composition \n \nEach patient specific single infusion bag contains a dispersion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in \napproximately 68 mL for a target dose of 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR-positive viable T cells/kg body \nweight (range: 1 x 106 \u2013 2 x 106 cells/kg), with a maximum of 2 x 108 anti-CD19 CAR-positive viable \nT cells. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect \n \nThis medicinal product contains 300 mg sodium. \nEach dose contains 0.05 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) per mL of Tecartus. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nDispersion for infusion. \n \nA clear to opaque, white to red dispersion. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTecartus is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell \nlymphoma (MCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy including a Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase \n(BTK) inhibitor.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTecartus must be administered in a qualified treatment centre by a physician with experience in the \ntreatment of haematological malignancies and trained for administration and management of patients \ntreated with Tecartus. At least 1 dose of tocilizumab for use in the event of cytokine release syndrome \n(CRS) and emergency equipment must be available prior to infusion. The qualified treatment centre \nmust have access to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of each previous dose. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n3 \n\n \nPatients are expected to enrol in a registry and will be followed in the registry in order to better \nunderstand the long-term safety and efficacy of Tecartus. \n \nPosology \n \nTecartus is intended for autologous use only (see section 4.4). \n \nA single dose of Tecartus contains 2 \u00d7 106 CAR-positive viable T cells per kg of body weight (range: \n1 x 106\u20132 x 106 cells/kg), or maximum of 2 \u00d7 108 CAR-positive viable T cells for patients 100 kg and \nabove in approximately 68 mL dispersion in an infusion bag. \n \nTecartus is recommended to be infused 3 to 14 days after completion of the lymphodepleting \nchemotherapy. The availability of the treatment must be confirmed prior to starting the \nlymphodepleting regimen. \n \nPre-treatment (lymphodepleting chemotherapy) \n\u2022 A lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m\u00b2 and \n\nfludarabine 30 mg/m\u00b2 should be administered intravenously on the 5th, 4th, and 3rd day before \ninfusion of Tecartus. \n\n \nPre-medication \n\u2022 To minimise potential acute infusion reactions, it is recommended that patients be \n\npre-medicated with paracetamol 500 to 1,000 mg given orally and diphenhydramine 12.5 to \n25 mg intravenous or oral (or equivalent) approximately 1 hour prior to infusion. \n\n\u2022 Prophylactic use of systemic corticosteroids is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nMonitoring after infusion \n\u2022 Patients should be monitored daily for the first 10 days following infusion for signs and \n\nsymptoms of potential CRS, neurologic events and other toxicities. Physicians should consider \nhospitalisation for the first 10 days post infusion or at the first signs/symptoms of CRS and/or \nneurologic events. \n\n\u2022 After the first 10 days following the infusion, the patient should be monitored at the physician\u2019s \ndiscretion. \n\n\u2022 Patients should be instructed to remain within proximity (within 2 hours of travel) of a qualified \ntreatment centre for at least 4 weeks following infusion. \n\n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients \u226565 years of age. \n \nPatients seropositive for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or human \nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) \nThere is no experience with manufacturing Tecartus for patients with a positive test for HIV, active \nHBV, or active HCV infection. Therefore, the benefit/risk has not yet been established in this \npopulation. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Tecartus in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years have not yet \nbeen established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTecartus is for intravenous use only. \n \nTecartus must not be irradiated. Do NOT use a leukodepleting filter. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n4 \n\n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \nThis medicinal product contains genetically modified human blood cells. Healthcare professionals \nhandling Tecartus should take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves and glasses) to avoid potential \ntransmission of infectious diseases (see section 6.6). \n \nPreparation for infusion \n\u2022 Verify that the patient\u2019s identity (ID) matches the patient identifiers on the Tecartus metal \n\ncassette. \n\u2022 The Tecartus infusion bag must not be removed from the metal cassette if the information on the \n\npatient-specific label does not match the intended patient. \n\u2022 Once the patient ID is confirmed, remove the infusion bag from the metal cassette. \n\u2022 Check that the patient information on the metal cassette label matches that on the bag label. \n\u2022 Inspect the infusion bag for any breaches of container integrity before thawing. If the bag is \n\ncompromised, follow the local guidelines for handling of waste of human-derived material (or \nimmediately contact Kite). \n\n\u2022 Place the infusion bag inside a second bag. \n\u2022 Thaw Tecartus at approximately 37 \u00b0C using either a water bath or dry thaw method until there \n\nis no visible ice in the infusion bag. Gently mix the contents of the bag to disperse clumps of \ncellular material. If visible cell clumps remain, continue to gently mix the contents of the bag. \nSmall clumps of cellular material should disperse with gentle manual mixing. Tecartus should \nnot be washed, spun down, and/or re-suspended in new media prior to infusion. Thawing should \ntake approximately 3 to 5 minutes. \n\n\u2022 Once thawed, Tecartus is stable at room temperature (20 \u00b0C \u2013 25 \u00b0C) for up to 3 hours. \nHowever, Tecartus infusion should begin within 30 minutes of thaw completion. \n\n \nAdministration \n\u2022 For autologous single use only. \n\u2022 Tocilizumab and emergency equipment should be available prior to infusion and during the \n\nmonitoring period. \n\u2022 A leukodepleting filter must not be used. \n\u2022 Central venous access is recommended for the administration. \n\u2022 Verify the patient ID again to match the patient identifiers on the Tecartus bag. \n\u2022 Prime the tubing with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection (0.154 mmol \n\nsodium per mL) prior to infusion. \n\u2022 Infuse the entire content of the Tecartus bag within 30 minutes by either gravity or a peristaltic \n\npump.  \n\u2022 Gently agitate the bag during infusion to prevent cell clumping. \n\u2022 After the entire content of the bag is infused, rinse the tubing at the same infusion rate with \n\nsodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection (0.154 mmol sodium per mL) to ensure \nall the treatment is delivered. \n\n \nFor instructions on the handling, accidental exposure to and disposal of the medicinal product, see \nsection 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nContraindications of the lymphodepleting chemotherapy must be considered. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n5 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nThe traceability requirements of cell-based advanced therapy medicinal products must apply. To \nensure traceability the name of the product, the batch number and the name of the treated patient \nshould be kept for a period of 30 years.  \n \nGeneral \n \nWarnings and precautions of lymphodepleting chemotherapy must be considered. \n \nPatients should be monitored daily for the first 10 days following infusion for signs and symptoms of \npotential CRS, neurologic events and other toxicities. Physicians should consider hospitalisation for \nthe first 10 days post infusion or at the first signs/symptoms of CRS and/or neurologic events. After \nthe first 10 days following infusion, the patient should be monitored at the physician\u2019s discretion. \n \nCounsel patients to remain within the proximity of a qualified treatment centre for at least 4 weeks \nfollowing infusion and to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS or \nneurological adverse reactions occur. Monitoring of vital signs and organ functions should be \nconsidered depending on the severity of the reaction. \n \nReasons to delay treatment \n \nDue to the risks associated with Tecartus treatment, infusion should be delayed if a patient has any of \nthe following conditions: \n\u2022 Unresolved serious adverse reactions (especially pulmonary reactions, cardiac reactions, or \n\nhypotension) including from preceding chemotherapies. \n\u2022 Active uncontrolled infection or inflammatory disease. \n\u2022 Active graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). \n \nIn some cases, the treatment may be delayed after administration of the lymphodepleting \nchemotherapy regimen. If the infusion is delayed for more than 2 weeks after the patient has received \nthe lymphodepleting chemotherapy, lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen should be administered \nagain (see section 4.2)  \n \nSerological testing \n \nScreening for HBV, HCV, and HIV should be performed before collection of cells for manufacturing \nof Tecartus (see section 4.2). \n \nBlood, organ, tissue and cell donation \n \nPatients treated with Tecartus should not donate blood, organs, tissues, or cells for transplantation. \n \nActive central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma \n \nThere is no experience of use of this medicinal product in patients with active CNS lymphoma defined \nas detectable cerebrospinal fluid malignant cells or brain metastases confirmed by imaging. Therefore, \nthe benefit/risk of Tecartus has not been established in this population. \n \nConcomitant disease \n \nPatients with a history of or active CNS disorder or inadequate renal, hepatic, pulmonary, or cardiac \nfunction were excluded from the study. These patients are likely to be more vulnerable to the \nconsequences of the adverse reactions described below and require special attention. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n6 \n\nCytokine release syndrome \n \nNearly all patients experienced some degree of CRS. Severe CRS, which can be life-threatening, was \nvery commonly observed with Tecartus with a median time to onset of 3 days (range: 1 to 13 days). \nPatients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of these events, such as high fever, \nhypotension, hypoxia, chills, tachycardia and headache (see section 4.8). CRS should be managed at \nthe physician\u2019s discretion, based on the patient\u2019s clinical presentation and according to the CRS \nmanagement algorithm provided in Table 1. \n \nDiagnosis of CRS requires excluding alternate causes of systemic inflammatory response, including \ninfection.  \n \nManagement of cytokine release syndrome associated with Tecartus \nAt least 1 dose per patient of tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor inhibitor, must be on site \nand available for administration prior to Tecartus infusion. The qualified treatment centre should have \naccess to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of each previous dose. \n \nTreatment algorithms have been developed to ameliorate some of the CRS symptoms experienced by \npatients on Tecartus. These include the use of tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids, as \nsummarised in Table 1. Patients who experience Grade 2 or higher CRS (e.g. hypotension, not \nresponsive to fluids, or hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygenation) should be monitored with \ncontinuous cardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry. For patients experiencing severe CRS, consider \nperforming an echocardiogram to assess cardiac function. For severe or life-threatening CRS, consider \nintensive-care supportive therapy. \n \nCRS has been known to be associated with end organ dysfunction (e.g., hepatic, renal, cardiac, and \npulmonary). In addition, worsening of underlying organ pathologies can occur in the setting of CRS. \nPatients with medically significant cardiac dysfunction should be managed by standards of critical care \nand measures such as echocardiography should be considered. In some cases, macrophage activation \nsyndrome (MAS) and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) may occur in the setting of CRS. \n \nEvaluation for haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) \nshould be considered in patients with severe or unresponsive CRS. \n \nTecartus continues to expand and persist following administration of tocilizumab and corticosteroids. \nTumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists are not recommended for management of \nTecartus-associated CRS. \n \nTable 1 CRS grading and management guidance \n \nCRS Grade (a) Tocilizumab Corticosteroids \nGrade 1 \nSymptoms require symptomatic \ntreatment only (e.g., fever, nausea, \nfatigue, headache, myalgia, \nmalaise). \n\nIf not improving after 24 hours, \nadminister tocilizumab \n8 mg/kg intravenously over 1 hour \n(not to exceed 800 mg). \n\nN/A \n\n\n\n \n \n\n7 \n\nCRS Grade (a) Tocilizumab Corticosteroids \nGrade 2 \nSymptoms require and respond to \nmoderate intervention. \nOxygen requirement less than 40% \nFiO2 or hypotension responsive to \nfluids or low-dose of one \nvasopressor or Grade 2 organ \ntoxicity (b). \n\nAdminister tocilizumab (c) 8 mg/kg \nintravenously over 1 hour (not to \nexceed 800 mg). \nRepeat tocilizumab every 8 hours \nas needed if not responsive to \nintravenous fluids or increasing \nsupplemental oxygen. Limit to a \nmaximum of 3 doses in a 24 hour \nperiod; maximum total of 4 doses if \nno clinical improvement in the \nsigns and symptoms of CRS, or if \nno response to second or \nsubsequent doses of tocilizumab, \nconsider alternative measures for \ntreatment of CRS. \nIf improving, discontinue \ntocilizumab. \n\nIf no improvement within 24 hours \nafter starting tocilizumab, manage \nas per Grade 3. \nIf improving, taper corticosteroids, \nand manage as Grade 1. \n\nGrade 3 \nSymptoms require and respond to \naggressive intervention. \nOxygen requirement greater than or \nequal to 40% FiO2 or hypotension \nrequiring high-dose or multiple \nvasopressors or Grade 3 organ \ntoxicity or Grade 4 transaminitis. \n\nPer Grade 2 \n \n\nAdminister methylprednisolone \n1 mg/kg intravenously twice daily \nor equivalent dexamethasone (e.g., \n10 mg intravenously every 6 hours) \nuntil Grade 1, then taper \ncorticosteroids. \nIf improving, manage as Grade 2. \nIf not improving, manage as \nGrade 4. \n\nGrade 4 \nLife-threatening symptoms. \nRequirements for ventilator support \nor continuous veno-venous \nhaemodialysis or Grade 4 organ \ntoxicity (excluding transaminitis). \n\nPer Grade 2 \n \n\nAdminister methylprednisolone \n1000 mg intravenously per day for \n3 days. \nIf improving, taper corticosteroids, \nand manage as Grade 3. \nIf not improving, consider alternate \nimmunosuppressants. \n\nN/A = not available/not applicable \n(a) Lee et al 2014. \n(b) Refer to Table 2 for management of neurologic adverse reactions. \n(c) Refer to tocilizumab summary of product characteristics for details. \n \nNeurologic adverse reactions \n \nSevere neurologic adverse reactions (encephalopathy, confusional state or delirium, decreased level of \nconsciousness, seizures, aphasia), which could be life-threatening, were very commonly observed in \npatients treated with Tecartus with a median time to onset of 8 days (range: 1 to 262 days) (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nPatients who experience Grade 2 or higher neurologic toxicities should be monitored with continuous \ncardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry. Provide intensive-care supportive therapy for severe or \nlife-threatening neurologic toxicities. Non-sedating, anti-seizure medicines should be considered as \nclinically indicated for Grade 2 or higher adverse reactions. Treatment algorithms have been \ndeveloped to ameliorate the neurologic adverse reactions experienced by patients on Tecartus. These \ninclude the use of tocilizumab (if concurrent CRS) and/or corticosteroids for moderate, severe, or \nlife-threatening neurologic adverse reactions as summarised in Table 2. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n8 \n\nTable 2 Neurologic adverse reaction grading and management guidance \n \nGrading \nassessment \n\nConcurrent CRS No concurrent CRS \n\nGrade 2 Administer tocilizumab as per Table 1 for \nmanagement Grade 2 CRS. \nIf not improving within 24 hours after starting \ntocilizumab, administer dexamethasone \n10 mg intravenously every 6 hours until the \nevent is Grade 1 or less, then taper \ncorticosteroids. \nIf improving, discontinue tocilizumab. \nIf still not improving, manage as Grade 3. \n\nAdminister dexamethasone 10 mg \nintravenously every 6 hours until the event is \nGrade 1 or less. \nIf improving, taper corticosteroids \n\nConsider non-sedating, anti-seizure medicines (e.g., levetiracetam) for seizure prophylaxis. \nGrade 3 Administer tocilizumab as per Table 1 for \n\nmanagement of Grade 2 CRS. \nIn addition, administer dexamethasone 10 mg \nintravenously with the first dose of \ntocilizumab and repeat dose every 6 hours. \nContinue dexamethasone use until the event is \nGrade 1 or less, then taper corticosteroids. \nIf improving, discontinue tocilizumab and \nmanage as Grade 2. \nIf still not improving, manage as Grade 4. \n\nAdminister dexamethasone 10 mg \nintravenously every 6 hours. \nContinue dexamethasone use until the event is \nGrade 1 or less, then taper corticosteroids. \nIf not improving, manage as Grade 4. \n\nConsider non-sedating, anti-seizure medicines (e.g., levetiracetam) for seizure prophylaxis. \nGrade 4 Administer tocilizumab as per Table 1 for \n\nmanagement of Grade 2 CRS. \nAdminister methylprednisolone 1000 mg \nintravenously per day with first dose of \ntocilizumab and continue methylprednisolone \n1000 mg intravenously per day for 2 more \ndays. \nIf improving, then manage as Grade 3. \nIf not improving, consider alternate \nimmunosuppressants. \n\nAdminister methylprednisolone 1000 mg \nintravenously per day for 3 days. \nIf improving, then manage as Grade 3. \nIf not improving, consider alternate \nimmunosuppressants. \n\nConsider non-sedating, anti-seizure medicines (e.g., levetiracetam) for seizure prophylaxis. \n \nInfections and febrile neutropenia \n \nSevere infections, which could be life-threatening, were very commonly observed with Tecartus (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection before, during and after infusion and \ntreated appropriately. Prophylactic antibiotics should be administered according to standard \ninstitutional guidelines. \n \nFebrile neutropenia has been observed in patients after Tecartus infusion (see section 4.8) and may be \nconcurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad \nspectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated. \n \nIn immunosuppressed patients, life-threatening and fatal opportunistic infections including \ndisseminated fungal infections and viral reactivation (e.g., HHV-6 and progressive multifocal \nleukoencephalopathy) have been reported. The possibility of these infections should be considered in \npatients with neurologic events and appropriate diagnostic evaluations should be performed.  \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n9 \n\nViral reactivation \n \nViral reactivation, e.g. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, can occur in patients treated with \nmedicinal products directed against B cells and could result in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and \ndeath. \n \nProlonged cytopenias \n \nPatients may exhibit cytopenias for several weeks following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and \nTecartus infusion and should be managed according to standard guidelines. Grade 3 or higher \nprolonged cytopenias following Tecartus infusion occurred very commonly and included \nthrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anaemia (see section 4.8). Patient blood counts should be \nmonitored after Tecartus infusion. \n \nHypogammaglobulinaemia \n \nB-cell aplasia leading to hypogammaglobulinaemia can occur in patients receiving treatment with \nTecartus. Hypogammaglobulinaemia was very commonly observed in patients treated with Tecartus \n(see section 4.8). Hypogammaglobulinaemia predisposes patients to have infections. Immunoglobulin \nlevels should be monitored after treatment with Tecartus and managed using infection precautions, \nantibiotic prophylaxis, and immunoglobulin replacement in case of recurrent infections and should be \ntaken according standard guidelines. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nSerious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, may occur due to DMSO or residual \ngentamicin in Tecartus. \n \nSecondary malignancies \n \nPatients treated with Tecartus may develop secondary malignancies. Patients should be monitored \nlife-long for secondary malignancies. In the event that a secondary malignancy occurs, the company \nshould be contacted to obtain instructions on patient samples to collect for testing. \n \nTumour lysis syndrome (TLS) \n \nTLS, which may be severe, has occasionally been observed. To minimise risk of TLS, patients with \nelevated uric acid or high tumour burden should receive allopurinol, or an alternative prophylaxis, \nprior to Tecartus infusion. Signs and symptoms of TLS should be monitored, and events managed \naccording to standard guidelines. \n \nPrior stem cell transplantation (GvHD) \n \nIt is not recommended that patients who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant and suffer from \nactive acute or chronic GvHD receive treatment because of the potential risk of Tecartus worsening \nGvHD.  \n \nPrior treatment with anti-CD19 therapy \n \nTecartus is not recommended if the patient has relapsed with CD19-negative disease after prior \nanti-CD19 therapy. \n \nSodium content  \n \nThis medicinal product contains 300 mg sodium per infusion, equivalent to 15% of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n10 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nProphylactic use of systemic corticosteroids may interfere with the activity of Tecartus. Prophylactic \nuse of systemic corticosteroids is therefore not recommended before infusion (see section 4.2).  \n \nAdministration of corticosteroids as per the toxicity management guidelines does not impact the \nexpansion and persistence of CAR T cells. \n \nLive vaccines \n \nThe safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines during or following Tecartus treatment has not \nbeen studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the \nstart of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during Tecartus treatment, and until immune recovery \nfollowing treatment. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception \n \nThe pregnancy status of women of childbearing potential must be verified before starting Tecartus \ntreatment. \n \nSee the prescribing information for lymphodepleting chemotherapy for information on the need for \neffective contraception in patients who receive the lymphodepleting chemotherapy. \n \nThere are insufficient exposure data to provide a recommendation concerning duration of \ncontraception following treatment with Tecartus. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no available data with Tecartus use in pregnant women. No reproductive and developmental \ntoxicity animal studies have been conducted with Tecartus to assess whether it can cause foetal harm \nwhen administered to a pregnant woman (see section 5.3). \n \nIt is not known if Tecartus has the potential to be transferred to the foetus. Based on the mechanism of \naction, if the transduced cells cross the placenta, they may cause foetal toxicity, including B-cell \nlymphocytopenia. Therefore, Tecartus is not recommended for women who are pregnant, or for \nwomen of childbearing potential not using contraception. Pregnant women should be advised on the \npotential risks to the foetus. Pregnancy after Tecartus therapy should be discussed with the treating \nphysician. \n \nAssessment of immunoglobulin levels and B-cells in newborn infants of mothers treated with Tecartus \nshould be considered. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether Tecartus is excreted in human milk or transferred to the breast-feeding child. \nBreast-feeding women should be advised of the potential risk to the breast-fed child. \n \nFertility \n \nNo clinical data on the effect of Tecartus on fertility are available. Effects on male and female fertility \nhave not been evaluated in animal studies. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n11 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTecartus has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nDue to the potential for neurologic events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients should \nnot drive or operate heavy or potentially dangerous machines until at least 8 weeks after infusion or \nuntil resolution of neurologic adverse reactions. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety data described in this section reflect exposure to Tecartus in ZUMA-2, a Phase 2 study in \nwhich a total of 82 patients with relapsed/refractory MCL received a single dose of CAR-positive \nviable T cells (2 \u00d7 106 or 0.5 \u00d7 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg) based on a recommended dose which \nwas weight-based. \n \nThe most significant and frequently occurring adverse reactions were cytokine release syndrome \n(91%), infections (56%) and encephalopathy (51%). \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 57% of patients. The most common serious adverse reactions \nincluded encephalopathy (26%), infections (28%) and cytokine release syndrome (15%). \n \nGrade 3 or higher adverse reactions were reported in 65% of patients.

Fifteen percent (15%) of patients experienced Grade 3 or higher \n(severe or life-threatening) CRS. The median time to onset was 3 days (range: 1 to 13 days) and the \nmedian duration was 10 days (range: 1 to 50 days). All patients (100%) recovered from CRS. \n \nThe most common signs or symptoms associated with CRS among the patients who experienced CRS \nincluded pyrexia (99%), hypotension (60%), hypoxia (37%), chills (33%), tachycardia (27%), \nheadache (24%), fatigue (16%), nausea (13%), alanine aminotransferase increased (13%), aspartate \naminotransferase increased (12%), diarrhoea (11%), and sinus tachycardia (11%). Serious adverse \nreactions that may be associated with CRS included hypotension, pyrexia, hypoxia, acute kidney \ninjury, and tachycardia. See section 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance. \n \nNeurologic events and adverse reactions \nNeurologic adverse reactions occurred in 68% of patients. Thirty-three percent (33%) of patients \nexperienced Grade 3 or higher (severe or life-threatening) adverse reactions. The median time to onset \nwas 8 days (range: 1 to 262 days). Neurologic events resolved for 47 out of 56 patients with a median \nduration of 13 days (range: 1 to 567 days). Three patients had ongoing neurologic events at the time of \ndeath, including one patient with the reported event of serious encephalopathy and another patient with \nthe reported event of serious confusional state. The remaining unresolved neurologic events were \nGrade 2. Eighty-five percent of all treated patients experienced the first CRS or neurological event \nwithin the first 7 days after Tecartus infusion. \n \nThe most common neurologic adverse reactions included encephalopathy (51%), tremor (38%), \naphasia (20%), and delirium (18%). Serious adverse reactions including encephalopathy (26%), \naphasia (6%) and seizure (2%) have been reported in patients administered with Tecartus. Serious \ncases of cerebral oedema which may become fatal have occurred in patients treated with Tecartus. See \nsection 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance. \n \nFebrile neutropenia and infections \nFebrile neutropenia was observed in 6% of patients after Tecartus infusion. Infections occurred in 56% \nof patients in ZUMA-2. Grade 3 or higher (severe, life-threatening or fatal) infections occurred in 32% \nof patients including unspecified pathogen, bacterial, and viral infections in 26%, 6%, and 4% of \npatients respectively. See section 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance. \n \nProlonged cytopenias \nCytopenias are very common following prior lymphodepleting chemotherapy and Tecartus therapy.  \n \nProlonged (present on or beyond Day 30 or with an onset at Day 30 or beyond) Grade 3 or higher \ncytopenias occurred in 55% of patients and included thrombocytopenia (38%), neutropenia (37%), and \nanaemia (17%). See section 4.4 for management guidance. \n \nHypogammaglobulinaemia \nIn ZUMA-2, hypogammaglobulinaemia occurred in 16% of patients. Grade 3 or higher \nhypogammaglobulinemia occurred in 1% of patients. See section 4.4 for management guidance. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nThe immunogenicity of Tecartus has been evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay \n(ELISA) for the detection of binding antibodies against FMC63, the originating antibody of the \n\n\n\n \n \n\n14 \n\nanti-CD19 CAR. To date, no anti-CD19 CAR T-cell antibody immunogenicity has been observed. \nBased on an initial screening assay, 17 patients tested positive for antibodies; however, a confirmatory \northogonal cell-based assay demonstrated that all 17 patients were antibody negative at all time points \ntested. There is no evidence that the kinetics of initial expansion, CAR T-cell function and persistence \nof Tecartus, or the safety or effectiveness of Tecartus, was altered in these patients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere are no data regarding the signs of overdose with Tecartus. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: not yet assigned \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTecartus, a CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapy, binds to CD19 \nexpressing cancer cells and normal B cells. Following anti-CD19 CAR T-cell engagement with CD19 \nexpressing target cells, the CD28 co-stimulatory domain and CD3-zeta signalling domain activate \ndownstream signalling cascades that lead to T-cell activation, proliferation, acquisition of effector \nfunctions and secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This sequence of events leads to \nkilling of CD19-expressing cells. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn ZUMA-2, after Tecartus infusion, pharmacodynamic responses were evaluated over a 4-week \ninterval by measuring transient elevation of cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules in blood. \nLevels of cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, TNF-\u03b1, interferon-gamma \n(IFN-\u03b3) and IL-2 receptor alpha were analysed. Peak elevation was generally observed between 4 and \n8 days after infusion and levels generally returned to baseline within 28 days. \n \nDue to the on target, off-tumour effect of Tecartus a period of B-cell aplasia is expected following \ntreatment. \n \nTranslational analyses performed to identify associations between cytokine levels and incidence of \nCRS or neurologic events showed that higher levels (peak and AUC at 1 month) of multiple serum \nanalytes were associated with Grade 3 or higher neurologic adverse reactions and Grade 3 or higher \nCRS. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nRelapsed or refractory MCL: ZUMA-2 \nThe efficacy and safety of Tecartus in adult patients with relapsed or refractory MCL who had \npreviously received anthracycline or bendamustine-containing chemotherapy, an anti CD20 antibody, \nand a Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) (ibrutinib or acalabrutinib), was evaluated in a phase 2 \nsingle-arm, open-label, multicenter trial. Eligible patients also had disease progression after last \nregimen or refractory disease to the most recent therapy. Patients with active or serious infections, \nprior allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), detectable cerebrospinal fluid \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n \n\n15 \n\nmalignant cells or brain metastases, and any history of central nervous system lymphoma or CNS \ndisorders were ineligible. In total, 74 patients were enrolled (i.e. leukapheresed) and 68 patients were \ntreated with Tecartus. Three patients did not receive Tecartus due to manufacturing failure. Two other \npatients were not treated due to progressive disease (death) following leukapheresis. One patient was \nnot treated with Tecartus after receiving lymphodepleting chemotherapy due to ongoing active atrial \nfibrillation. ITT was defined as all patients who underwent leukapheresis. A summary of the patient \nbaseline characteristics is provided in Table 4. \n \nTable 4 Summary of baseline characteristics for ZUMA-2 \n \nCategory All leukapheresed (ITT) \n\n(N=74) \nAge (years) \n\nMedian (min, max) 65 (38, 79) \n\u2265 65 58% \n\nMale gender 84% \nMedian number of prior therapies (min, max) 3 (1; 5) \nRelapsed/refractory subgroup \n\nRelapsed after auto-SCT 42% \nRefractory to last MCL therapy 39% \nRelapsed after last MCL therapy 19% \n\nPatients with disease stage IV 86% \nPatients with bone marrow involvement 51% \nMorphological characteristic \n\nClassical MCL 54% \nBlastoid MCL 26% \nOther 1% \nUnknown 19% \n\nReceived bridging therapy \nYes 38% \nNo 62% \n\nKi-67 IHC by central laboratory \nN 49 \nMedian 65% \n\nAuto-SCT, autologous stem cell transplant; IHC, immunohistochemistry; Max, maximum; MCL, mantle cell lymphoma; \nMin, minimum; \n\n \nTecartus was administered to patients as a single intravenous infusion at a target dose of \n2 \u00d7 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg (maximum permitted dose: 2 \u00d7 108 cells) after lymphodepleting \nchemotherapy regimen of cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m\u00b2 intravenously and fludarabine 30 mg/m\u00b2 \nintravenously, both given on the 5th, 4th, and 3rd day before treatment. Bridging chemotherapy between \nleukapheresis and lymphodepleting chemotherapy was permitted to control disease burden. \n \nFor patients treated with Tecartus, the median time from leukapheresis to product release was 13 days \n(range: 9 to 20 days) and the median time from leukapheresis to Tecartus infusion was 27 days (range: \n19 to 74 days, with the exception of one outlier of 134 days). The median dose was \n2.0 \u00d7 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg. All patients received Tecartus infusion on day 0 and were \nhospitalized until day 7 at the minimum. \n \nThe primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) as determined by Lugano 2014 criteria by an \nindependent review committee. Secondary endpoints included duration of response (DOR), overall \nsurvival (OS), progression free survival (PFS) and severity of adverse events. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n16 \n\nAn analysis set was defined a priori which consisted of the first 60 patients treated with Tecartus who \nwere evaluated for response 6 months after the Week 4 disease assessment after Tecartus infusion. In \nthis analysis set of 60 patients the ORR was 93% with a CR rate of 67%. The ORR was significantly \nhigher than the prespecified historical control rate of 25% at a 1-sided significance level of 0.025 \n(p < 0.0001).

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n\u2013 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\u2013 Your doctor will give you a Patient Alert Card. Read it carefully and follow the instructions on \n\nit. \n\u2013 Always show the Patient Alert Card to the doctor or nurse when you see them or if you go to \n\nhospital. \n\u2013 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n\u2013 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse.

What you need to know before you are given Tecartus \n3. How Tecartus is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Tecartus \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Tecartus is and what it is used for \n \nTecartus is a gene therapy medicine used for treating mantle cell lymphoma in adults. It is used when \nother medicines have stopped working for you (relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma). The \nmedicine is made specially for you from your own white blood cells that have been modified and are \nknown as autologous anti-CD19-transduced CD3+ cells. \n \nMantle cell lymphoma is a cancer of a part of the immune system (the body\u2019s defences). It affects a \ntype of white blood cell called B-lymphocytes. In mantle cell lymphoma, B-lymphocytes grow in an \nuncontrolled way and build up in the lymph tissue, bone marrow or blood. \n \nHow Tecartus works \nThe white blood cells are taken from your blood and are genetically modified so that they can target \nthe cancer cells in your body. When Tecartus is infused into your blood, the modified white blood \ncells will kill the cancer cells. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Tecartus \n \nYou are not to be given Tecartus \n\u2013 if you are allergic to any of the ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). If you think you \n\nmay be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. \n\u2013 if you can\u2019t receive the medicine to reduce the number of white blood cells in your blood \n\n(lymphodepleting chemotherapy) (see also section 3, How Tecartus is given). \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n32 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTecartus is made from your own white blood cells and should only be given to you (autologous use).  \n \nTests and checks \nBefore you are given Tecartus your doctor will: \n\u2022 Check your lungs, heart, kidney and blood pressure. \n\u2022 Look for signs of infection or inflammation; and decide whether you need to be treated before \n\nyou are given Tecartus. \n\u2022 Check if your cancer is getting worse. \n\u2022 Look for signs of graft-versus-host disease that can happen after a transplant. This happens \n\nwhen transplanted cells attack your body, causing symptoms such as rash, nausea, vomiting, \ndiarrhoea and bloody stools. \n\n\u2022 Check your blood for uric acid and for how many cancer cells there are in your blood. This will \nshow if you are likely to develop a condition called tumour lysis syndrome. You may be given \nmedicines to help prevent the condition. \n\n\u2022 Check for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV infection. \n\u2022 Check if you had a vaccination in the previous 6 weeks or are planning to have one in the next \n\nfew months. \n\u2022 Check if you have previously received a treatment that attaches to the protein called CD19. \n \nIn some cases, it might not be possible to go ahead with the planned treatment with Tecartus. If \nTecartus infusion is delayed for more than 2 weeks after you have received lymphodepleting \nchemotherapy you may have to receive more chemotherapy (see also section 3, How Tecartus is \ngiven). \n \nAfter you have been given Tecartus \nTell your doctor or nurse immediately or get emergency help right away if you have any of the \nfollowing: \n\u2022 Chills, extreme tiredness, weakness, dizziness, headache, cough, shortness of breath, rapid or \n\nirregular heartbeat, severe nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea which may be symptoms of a \ncondition known as cytokine release syndrome. Take your temperature twice a day for 3 to \n4 weeks after treatment with Tecartus. If your temperature is high, see your doctor immediately. \n\n\u2022 Fits, shaking, or difficulty speaking or slurred speech, loss of consciousness or decreased level \nof consciousness, confusion and disorientation, loss of balance or coordination. \n\n\u2022 Fever (e.g. temperature above 38\u00b0C), which may be a symptom of an infection. \n\u2022 Extreme tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath, which may be symptoms of a lack of red \n\nblood cells. \n\u2022 Bleeding or bruising more easily, which may be symptoms of low levels of cells in the blood \n\nknown as platelets. \n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse.  \n \nYour doctor will regularly check your blood counts as the number of blood cells and other blood \ncomponents may decrease. \n \nYou will be asked to enrol in a registry for at least 15 years in order to better understand the long-term \neffects of Tecartus.  \n \nDo not donate blood, organs, tissues, or cells for transplants. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nTecartus should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Tecartus \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n33 \n\nBefore you are given Tecartus tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any medicines that weaken \nyour immune system such as corticosteroids, since these medicines may interfere with the effect of \nTecartus. \n \nIn particular, you must not be given certain vaccines called live vaccines: \n\u2022 In the 6 weeks before you are given the short course of lymphodepleting chemotherapy to \n\nprepare your body for the Tecartus cells. \n\u2022 During Tecartus treatment. \n\u2022 After treatment while the immune system is recovering. \n \nTalk to your doctor if you need to have any vaccinations. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before being given this medicine. This is because the effects of Tecartus in \npregnant or breast-feeding women are not known, and it may harm your unborn baby or your \nbreast-fed child. \n\u2022 If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant after treatment with Tecartus, talk to your \n\ndoctor immediately. \n\u2022 You will be given a pregnancy test before treatment starts. Tecartus should only be given if the \n\nresults show you are not pregnant. \n \nDiscuss pregnancy with your doctor if you have received Tecartus. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTecartus can cause problems such as altered or decreased consciousness, confusion and seizures (fits) \nin the 8 weeks after it is given. \n \nDo not drive, use machines, or take part in activities that need you to be alert for at least 8 weeks after \nyour Tecartus treatment or until your doctor tells you that you have completely recovered. \n \nTecartus contains sodium, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and gentamicin \nThis medicine contains 300 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each infusion. This \nis equivalent to 15% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. It also \ncontains DMSO and gentamicin which may cause severe hypersensitivity reactions. \n \n \n3. How Tecartus is given \n \nTecartus will always be given to you by a healthcare professional. \n \n\u2022 Since Tecartus is made from your own white blood cells, your cells will be collected from you \n\nto prepare your medicine. Your doctor will take some of your blood using a catheter placed in \nyour vein (a procedure call leukapheresis). Some of your white blood cells are separated from \nyour blood and the rest of your blood is returned to your vein. This can take 3 to 6 hours and \nmay need to be repeated. \n\n\u2022 Your white blood cells are sent away to a manufacturing center to make your Tecartus. It \nusually takes about 2 to 3 weeks to make Tecartus but the time may vary. \n\n \nMedicines given before Tecartus treatment \nA few days before you receive Tecartus, you will be given lymphodepleting chemotherapy, which will \nallow the modified white blood cells in Tecartus to multiply in your body when the medicine is given \nto you. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n34 \n\nDuring the 30 to 60 minutes before you are given Tecartus you may be given other medicines. This is \nto help prevent infusion reactions and fever. These other medicines may include: \n\u2022 Paracetamol. \n\u2022 An antihistamine such as diphenhydramine. \n \nHow you are given Tecartus \nTecartus will always be given to you by a doctor in a qualified treatment centre. \n \n\u2022 Tecartus is given in a single dose. \n\u2022 Your doctor or nurse will give you a single infusion of Tecartus through a catheter placed into \n\nyour vein (intravenous infusion) over about 30 minutes. \n\u2022 Tecartus is the genetically modified version of your white blood cells. Your healthcare \n\nprofessional handling the treatment will therefore take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves \nand glasses) to avoid potential transmission of infectious diseases and will follow local \nguidelines on handling of waste of human-derived material to clean up or dispose of any \nmaterial that has been in contact with it. \n\n \nAfter you are given Tecartus \n\u2022 You should stay close to the hospital where you were treated for at least 4 weeks after Tecartus \n\ntreatment. Your doctor will recommend that you return to the hospital daily for at least 10 days \nor that you stay at the hospital as an in-patient for the first 10 days after Tecartus treatment. This \nis so your doctor can check if your treatment is working and help you if you have any side \neffects. \n\n \nIf you miss any appointments, call your doctor or your treatment centre as soon as possible to \nreschedule your appointment. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Do not try \nto treat your side effects on your own. \n \nTecartus can cause side effects that may be serious or life-threatening.

There are also links to other websites about rare diseases and treatments. \n \nThis leaflet is available in all EU/EEA languages on the European Medicines Agency website. \n \n<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------> \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n \n \n\n38 \n\nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: \n \nIt is important that you read the entire content of this procedure prior to administering Tecartus.  \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \n\u2022 Tecartus contains genetically-modified cells. Local guidelines on handling of human-derived \n\nmaterial applicable for such products should be followed. \n\u2022 Tecartus should be transported within the facility in closed, break-proof, leak-proof containers. \n\u2022 Tecartus is prepared from autologous blood of the patient collected by leukapheresis. Patient \n\nleukapheresis material and Tecartus may carry a risk of transmitting infectious viruses to \nhealthcare professionals (HCP) handling the product. Accordingly, HCP should employ \nappropriate precautions (wearing gloves and glasses) when handling leukapheresis material or \nTecartus to avoid potential transmission of infectious diseases. \n\n \nPreparation for infusion \n\u2022 Verify that the patient\u2019s identity (ID) matches the patient identifiers on the Tecartus metal \n\ncassette. \n\u2022 The Tecartus infusion bag must not be removed from the metal cassette if the information on the \n\npatient-specific label does not match the intended patient. \n\u2022 Once the patient\u2019s ID is confirmed, remove the infusion bag from the metal cassette. \n\u2022 Check that the patient information on the metal cassette label matches that on the bag label. \n\u2022 Inspect the infusion bag for any breaches of container integrity before thawing. If the bag is \n\ncompromised, follow the local guidelines for handling of waste of human-derived material (or \nimmediately contact Kite). \n\n\u2022 Place the infusion bag inside a second bag. \n\u2022 Thaw Tecartus at approximately 37 \u00b0C using either a water bath or dry thaw method until there \n\nis no visible ice in the infusion bag. Gently mix the contents of the bag to disperse clumps of \ncellular material. If visible cell clumps remain, continue to gently mix the contents of the bag. \nSmall clumps of cellular material should disperse with gentle manual mixing. Tecartus should \nnot be washed, spun down, and/or re-suspended in new media prior to infusion. Thawing should \ntake approximately 3 to 5 minutes. \n\n\u2022 Once thawed, Tecartus is stable at room temperature (20 \u00b0C \u2013 25 \u00b0C) for up to 3 hours. \nHowever, the infusion should begin within 30 minutes of thaw completion. \n\n \nDo NOT use a leukodepleting filter. \n \nAdministration \n\u2022 The medicine must be administered in a qualified treatment centre by a physician(s) with \n\nexperience in the treatment of haematological malignancies and trained for administration and \nmanagement of patients treated with Tecartus. \n\n\u2022 Ensure that at least 1 dose of tocilizumab per patient and emergency equipment are available \nprior to infusion and during the recovery period. Hospitals and associated centres should have \naccess to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of each previous dose.  \n\n\u2022 The patient\u2019s identity should be matched with the patient identifiers on the infusion bag.  \n\u2022 Tecartus is for autologous use only.  \n\u2022 Tecartus should be administered as an intravenous infusion using latex-free intravenous tubing \n\nwithout a leukocyte depleting filter within 30 minutes by either gravity or a peristaltic pump.  \n\u2022 Gently agitate the bag during infusion to prevent cell clumping. All contents of the infusion bag \n\nshould be infused.  \n\u2022 Sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) (0.154 mmol sodium per mL) solution for injection \n\nshould be used to prime the tubing prior to infusion as well as rinse it afterwards. When the full \nvolume of Tecartus has been infused, the infusion bag should be rinsed with 10 to 30 mL \nsodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection by back priming to ensure as many cells \nas possible are infused into the patient.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n39 \n\nDisposal of Tecartus \n\u2022 Any unused medicinal product or waste material that has been in contact with Tecartus (solid \n\nand liquid waste) should be handled and disposed of in accordance with local guidelines on \nhandling of waste of human-derived material. Work surfaces and material which have \npotentially been in contact with Tecartus must be decontaminated with appropriate disinfectant. \n \n\nAccidental exposure  \n\u2022 Accidental exposure to Tecartus must be avoided. Local guidelines on handling of \n\nhuman-derived material should be followed in case of accidental exposure, which may include \nwashing of the contaminated skin, removal of contaminated clothes. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n40 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX IV \n\nCONCLUSIONS ON THE GRANTING OF THE CONDITIONAL MARKETING \nAUTHORISATION PRESENTED BY THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n41 \n\nConclusions presented by the European Medicines Agency on: \n\n\u2022 Conditional marketing authorisation \n\nThe CHMP having considered the application is of the opinion that the risk-benefit balance is \nfavourable to recommend the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation as further \nexplained in the European Public Assessment Report. \n\n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

"2. what you need to know before you are given tecartus", "Section_Content": "you are not to be given tecartus if you are allergic to any of the ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). if you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. if you can't receive the medicine to reduce the number of white blood cells in your blood (lymphodepleting chemotherapy) (see also section 3, how tecartus is given). warnings and precautions tecartus is made from your own white blood cells and should only be given to you (autologous use). tests and checks before you are given tecartus your doctor will: check your lungs, heart, kidney and blood pressure. look for signs of infection or inflammation; and decide whether you need to be treated before you are given tecartus. check if your cancer is getting worse. look for signs of graft-versus-host disease that can happen after a transplant. this happens when transplanted cells attack your body, causing symptoms such as rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and bloody stools. check your blood for uric acid and for how many cancer cells there are in your blood. this will show if you are likely to develop a condition called tumour lysis syndrome. you may be given medicines to help prevent the condition. check for hepatitis b, hepatitis c or hiv infection. check if you had a vaccination in the previous 6 weeks or are planning to have one in the next few months. check if you have previously received a treatment that attaches to the protein called cd19. in some cases, it might not be possible to go ahead with the planned treatment with tecartus. if tecartus infusion is delayed for more than 2 weeks after you have received lymphodepleting chemotherapy you may have to receive more chemotherapy (see also section 3, how tecartus is given). after you have been given tecartus tell your doctor or nurse immediately or get emergency help right away if you have any of the following: chills, extreme tiredness, weakness, dizziness, headache, cough, shortness of breath, rapid or irregular heartbeat, severe nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea which may be symptoms of a condition known as cytokine release syndrome. take your temperature twice a day for 3 to 4 weeks after treatment with tecartus. if your temperature is high, see your doctor immediately. fits, shaking, or difficulty speaking or slurred speech, loss of consciousness or decreased level of consciousness, confusion and disorientation, loss of balance or coordination. fever (e.g. temperature above 38), which may be a symptom of an infection. extreme tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath, which may be symptoms of a lack of red blood cells. bleeding or bruising more easily, which may be symptoms of low levels of cells in the blood known as platelets. if any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse. your doctor will regularly check your blood counts as the number of blood cells and other blood components may decrease. you will be asked to enrol in a registry for at least 15 years in order to better understand the long-term effects of tecartus. do not donate blood, organs, tissues, or cells for transplants. children and adolescents tecartus should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. other medicines and tecartus tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. before you are given tecartus tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any medicines that weaken your immune system such as corticosteroids, since these medicines may interfere with the effect of tecartus. in particular, you must not be given certain vaccines called live vaccines: in the 6 weeks before you are given the short course of lymphodepleting chemotherapy to prepare your body for the tecartus cells. during tecartus treatment. after treatment while the immune system is recovering. talk to your doctor if you need to have any vaccinations. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before being given this medicine. this is because the effects of tecartus in pregnant or breast-feeding women are not known, and it may harm your unborn baby or your breast-fed child. if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant after treatment with tecartus, talk to your doctor immediately. you will be given a pregnancy test before treatment starts. tecartus should only be given if the results show you are not pregnant. discuss pregnancy with your doctor if you have received tecartus. driving and using machines tecartus can cause problems such as altered or decreased consciousness, confusion and seizures (fits) in the 8 weeks after it is given. do not drive, use machines, or take part in activities that need you to be alert for at least 8 weeks after your tecartus treatment or until your doctor tells you that you have completely recovered. tecartus contains sodium, dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) and gentamicin this medicine contains 300 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each infusion. this is equivalent to 15% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. it also contains dmso and gentamicin which may cause severe hypersensitivity reactions.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text":

separated from your blood and the rest of your blood is returned to your vein. this can take 3 to 6 hours and may need to be repeated. your white blood cells are sent away to a manufacturing center to make your tecartus. it usually takes about 2 to 3 weeks to make tecartus but the time may vary. medicines given before tecartus treatment a few days before you receive tecartus, you will be given lymphodepleting chemotherapy, which will allow the modified white blood cells in tecartus to multiply in your body when the medicine is given to you. during the 30 to 60 minutes before you are given tecartus you may be given other medicines. this is to help prevent infusion reactions and fever. these other medicines may include: paracetamol. an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine. how you are given tecartus tecartus will always be given to you by a doctor in a qualified treatment centre. tecartus is given in a single dose. your doctor or nurse will give you a single infusion of tecartus through a catheter placed into your vein (intravenous infusion) over about 30 minutes. tecartus is the genetically modified version of your white blood cells. your healthcare professional handling the treatment will therefore take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves and glasses) to avoid potential transmission of infectious diseases and will follow local guidelines on handling of waste of human-derived material to clean up or dispose of any material that has been in contact with it. after you are given tecartus you should stay close to the hospital where you were treated for at least 4 weeks after tecartus treatment. your doctor will recommend that you return to the hospital daily for at least 10 days or that you stay at the hospital as an in-patient for the first 10 days after tecartus treatment. this is so your doctor can check if your treatment is working and help you if you have any side effects. if you miss any appointments, call your doctor or your treatment centre as
