NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nKengrexal 50 mg powder for concentrate for solution for injection/infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains cangrelor tetrasodium corresponding to 50 mg cangrelor. After reconstitution 1 mL \nof concentrate contains 10 mg cangrelor. After dilution 1 mL of solution contains 200 micrograms \ncangrelor. \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach vial contains 52.2 mg sorbitol. \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for concentrate for solution for injection/infusion. \nWhite to off-white lyophilised powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nKengrexal, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the reduction of \nthrombotic cardiovascular events in adult patients with coronary artery disease undergoing \npercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) who have not received an oral P2Y12 inhibitor prior to the \nPCI procedure and in whom oral therapy with P2Y12 inhibitors is not feasible or desirable. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nKengrexal should be administered by a physician experienced in either acute coronary care or in \ncoronary intervention procedures and is intended for specialised use in an acute and hospital setting. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of Kengrexal for patients undergoing PCI is a 30 micrograms/kg intravenous \nbolus followed immediately by 4 micrograms/kg/min intravenous infusion. The bolus and infusion \nshould be initiated prior to the procedure and continued for at least two hours or for the duration of the \nprocedure, whichever is longer. At the discretion of the physician, the infusion may be continued for a \ntotal duration of four hours, see section 5.1. \n \nPatients should be transitioned to oral P2Y12 therapy for chronic treatment. For transition, a loading \ndose of oral P2Y12 therapy (clopidogrel, ticagrelor or prasugrel) should be administered immediately \nfollowing discontinuation of cangrelor infusion. Alternatively, a loading dose of ticagrelor or prasugrel, \nbut not clopidogrel, may be administered up to 30 minutes before the end of the infusion, see \nsection 4.5. \n \nUse with other anticoagulant agents \nIn patients undergoing PCI, standard procedural adjunctive therapy should be implemented (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nElderly  \nNo dose adjustment is needed in elderly (\u226575 years) patients. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal insufficiency (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is needed (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of cangrelor in children aged less than 18 years has not been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nKengrexal is intended for intravenous use, only after reconstitution and dilution. \n \nKengrexal should be administered via an intravenous line. The bolus volume should be administered \nrapidly (<1 minute), from the diluted bag via manual intravenous push or pump. Ensure the bolus is \ncompletely administered before the start of PCI. Start the infusion immediately after administration of \nthe bolus. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration see \nsection 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding, because of impaired haemostasis and/or \n\nirreversible coagulation disorders or due to recent major surgery/trauma or uncontrolled severe \nhypertension. \n\n\u2022 Any history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nRisk of bleeding \n \nTreatment with Kengrexal may increase the risk of bleeding. \n \nIn pivotal studies conducted in patients undergoing PCI, GUSTO (Global Use of Strategies to Open \nOccluded Arteries), moderate and mild bleeding events were more common in patients treated with \ncangrelor than in patients treated with clopidogrel, see section 4.8. \n \nAlthough most bleeding associated with the use of cangrelor occurs at the site of arterial puncture, \nhaemorrhage can occur at any site. Any unexplained fall in blood pressure or haematocrit should lead \nto the serious consideration of a haemorrhagic event and the cessation of cangrelor administration. \nCangrelor should be used with caution in patients with disease states associated with an increased \nbleeding risk. Cangrelor should be used with caution in patients taking medicines that may increase \nthe risk of bleeding. \n \nCangrelor has a half-life of three to six minutes. Platelet function is restored within 60 minutes of \nstopping infusion. \n \nIntracranial haemorrhage \n \nTreatment with Kengrexal may increase the risk of intracranial haemorrhage. In pivotal studies \nconducted in patients undergoing PCI, there were more intracranial bleeds at 30 days with cangrelor \n(0.07%) than with clopidogrel (0.02%), of which 4 bleeds with cangrelor and 1 bleed with clopidogrel \n\n\n\n4 \n\nwere fatal. Cangrelor is contraindicated in patients with any history of stroke/TIA, (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.8). \n \nCardiac tamponade \n \nTreatment with Kengrexal may increase the risk of cardiac tamponade. In pivotal studies conducted in \npatients undergoing PCI, there were more cardiac tamponades at 30 days with cangrelor (0.12%) than \nwith clopidogrel (0.02%), (see section 4.8). \n \nEffects on renal function \n \nIn pivotal studies conducted in patients undergoing PCI, events of acute renal failure (0.1%), renal \nfailure (0.1%) and increased serum creatinine (0.2%) were reported to occur after administration of \ncangrelor in clinical trials (see section 4.8). In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance 15-30 mL/min) a higher rate of worsening in renal function (3.2%) was reported in the \ncangrelor group compared to clopidogrel (1.4%). In addition, a higher rate of GUSTO moderate \nbleeding was reported in the cangrelor group (6.7%) compared to clopidogrel (1.4%). Cangrelor \nshould be used with caution in these patients. \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nHypersensitivity reactions may occur after treatment with Kengrexal. A higher rate of serious cases of \nhypersensitivity were recorded with cangrelor (0.05%) than with control (0.007%). These included \ncases of anaphylactic reactions/shock and angioedema (see section 4.8). \n \nRisk of dyspnoea \n \nTreatment with Kengrexal may increase the risk of dyspnoea. In pivotal studies conducted in patients \nundergoing PCI dyspnoea (including exertional dyspnoea) occurred more commonly in patients \ntreated with cangrelor (1.3%) than clopidogrel (0.4%). Most dyspnoea events were mild or moderate \nin severity and the median duration of dyspnoea was two hours in patients receiving cangrelor (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nFructose intolerance \n \nThis medicinal product contains 52.2 mg sorbitol in each vial.  Patients with hereditary fructose \nintolerance (HFI) must not be given this medicine unless strictly necessary. \n \nSodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nOral P2Y12 agents (clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) \n \nWhen clopidogrel is administered during infusion of cangrelor, the expected inhibitory effect of \nclopidogrel on platelets is not achieved. Administration of 600 mg clopidogrel immediately after the \ncessation of the cangrelor infusion results in the anticipated full pharmacodynamic effect. No \nclinically relevant interruption of P2Y12 inhibition was observed in phase III studies when 600 mg \nclopidogrel was administered immediately after discontinuation of the cangrelor infusion. \n \nA pharmacodynamic interaction study has been conducted with cangrelor and prasugrel, which \ndemonstrated that cangrelor and prasugrel can be administered concomitantly. Patients can be \n\n\n\n5 \n\ntransitioned from cangrelor to prasugrel when prasugrel is administered immediately following \ndiscontinuation of the cangrelor infusion or up to one hour before, optimally at 30 minutes before the \nend of the cangrelor infusion to limit recovery of platelet reactivity. \n \nA pharmacodynamic interaction study has also been conducted with cangrelor and ticagrelor. No \ninteraction on cangrelor was observed. Patients can be transitioned from cangrelor to ticagrelor \nwithout interruption of antiplatelet effect. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nCangrelor exhibits inhibition of activation and aggregation of platelets as shown by aggregometry \n(light transmission and impedance), point-of care assays, such as the VerifyNow P2Y12 test, VASP-P \nand flow cytometry. \n \nFollowing the administration of a 30 micrograms/kg bolus followed by a 4 micrograms/kg/min \ninfusion (the PCI dose), platelet inhibition is observed within two minutes. The \npharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) effect of cangrelor is maintained consistently for the \nduration of the infusion. \n \nIrrespective of dose, following cessation of the infusion, cangrelor blood levels decrease rapidly and \nplatelet function returns to normal within one hour. \n \nAcetylsalicylic acid, heparin, nitrogycerin \n \nNo pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with cangrelor was observed in an interaction \nstudy with aspirin, heparin, or nitroglycerin. \n \nBivalirudin, low molecular weight heparin, fondaparinux, and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors \n \nIn clinical studies, cangrelor has been co-administered with bivalirudin, low molecular weight heparin, \nfondaparinux, and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors (abciximab, eptifibatide, tirofiban) with no apparent effect \nupon the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of cangrelor. \n \nCytochrome P450 (CYP) \n \nMetabolism of cangrelor is not dependent on CYPs and CYP isoenzymes are not inhibited by \ntherapeutic concentrations of cangrelor or its major metabolites. \n \nBreast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) \n \nIn vitro inhibition of BCRP by the metabolite ARC-69712XX at clinically relevant concentrations has \nbeen observed. Possible implications for the in vivo situation have not been investigated, but caution is \nadvised when cangrelor is to be combined with a BCRP substrate. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of Kengrexal in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nKengrexal is not recommended during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether Kengrexal is excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be \nexcluded. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nFertility \n \nNo effect on female fertility parameters were observed in animal studies of Kengrexal. A reversible \neffect on fertility was observed in male rats treated with Kengrexal (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nKengrexal has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reactions with cangrelor include mild and moderate bleeding and dyspnoea. \nSerious adverse reactions associated with cangrelor in patients with coronary artery disease include \nsevere/life threatening bleeding and hypersensitivity. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nTable 1 depicts adverse reactions that have been identified based upon a pooling of combined data \nfrom all CHAMPION studies. Adverse reactions are classified according to frequency and system \norgan class. Frequency categories are defined according to the following conventions: Very common \n(\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), \nvery rare (<1/10,000). \n \nTable 1: Adverse reactions for cangrelor in CHAMPION pooled studies within 48 hours \n\nSystem organ \nclass  \n\nCommon  Uncommon  Rare  Very rare  \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n   Haematoma \ninfection \n\nNeoplasms \nbenign, malignant \nand unspecified \n(includes cysts \nand polyps) \n\n   Skin neoplasm \nbleeding \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic system \ndisorders \n\n  Anaemia, \nthrombo-\ncytopenia \n\n \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Anaphylactic \nreaction \n(anaphylactic \nshock), \nhypersensitivity \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n  Haemorrhage \nintracranial d * \n\n \n\nEye disorders   Eye haemorrhage  \n\nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders \n\n   Ear haemorrhage \n\nCardiac disorders  Cardiac \ntamponade \n(pericardial \nhaemorrhage) \n\n  \n\n\n\n7 \n\nSystem organ \nclass  \n\nCommon  Uncommon  Rare  Very rare  \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\nHaematoma \n<5 cm, \nhaemorrhage \n\nHaemodynamic \ninstability \n\nWound \nhaemorrhage, \nvascular \npseudoaneurysm \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\nDyspnoea \n(dyspnoea \nexertional) \n\nEpistaxis, \nhaemoptysis \n\nPulmonary \nhaemorrhage \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Retroperitoneal \nhaemorrhage,* \nperitoneal \nhaematoma, \ngastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage a \n\n  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nEcchymosis \n(petechiae, \npurpura) \n\nRash, pruritus, \nurticaria f \n\nAngioedema  \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\n Haemorrhage \nurinary tract, e \nacute renal failure \n(renal failure) \n\n  \n\nReproductive \nsystem and breast \ndisorders \n\n  Pelvic \nhaemorrhage \n\nMenorrhagia, \npenile \nhaemorrhage \n\nGeneral disorders \nand \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nVessel puncture \nsite discharge \n\nVessel puncture \nsite haematoma b  \n\n  \n\nInvestigations Haematocrit \ndecreased, \nhaemoglobin \ndecreased** \n\nBlood creatinine \nincreased \n\nPlatelet count \ndecreased, red \nblood cell count \ndecreased, \ninternational \nnormalised ratio \nincreased c \n\n \n\nInjury, poisoning \nand procedural \ncomplications \n\nHaematoma \n>5 cm \n\n Contusion Periorbital \nhaematoma, \nsubcutaneous \nhaematoma \n\n \nMultiple related adverse reaction terms have been grouped together in the table and include medical \nterms as described below: \na.

An analysis of non-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)-related bleeding is \npresented in Table 2. \n \nWhen administered in the PCI setting, cangrelor was associated with a greater incidence of GUSTO \nmild bleeding compared with clopidogrel. Further analysis of GUSTO mild bleeding revealed that a \nlarge proportion of mild bleeding events were ecchymosis, oozing and <5 cm haematoma. Transfusion \nand GUSTO severe/life-threatening bleeding rates were similar. In the pooled safety population from \nthe CHAMPION trials, the incidence of fatal bleeding within 30 days of dosing was low and similar in \npatients who received cangrelor compared to clopidogrel (8 [0.1%] vs. 9 [0.1%]). \n \nNo baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with cangrelor. \n \nTable 2: Non-CABG-related bleeding \nGUSTO bleeding, n (%)   \n\nCHAMPION pooled  Cangrelor (N=12,565) \nClopidogrel \n(N=12,542) \n\nAny GUSTO bleeding 2,196 (17.5) 1,696 (13.5) \nSevere/life-threatening 28 (0.2) 23 (0.2) \nModerate 76 (0.6) 56 (0.4) \nMild a 2,109 (16.8) 1,627 (13.0) \nMild w/o ecchymosis, oozing and haematoma <5 cm  707 (5.6) 515 (4.1) \nPatients with any transfusion 90 (0.7) 70 (0.6) \n\nCHAMPION PHOENIX Cangrelor (N=5,529) \nClopidogrel \n(N=5,527) \n\nAny GUSTO bleeding 178 (3.2) 107 (1.9) \nSevere/life-threatening 9 (0.2) 6 (0.1) \nModerate 22 (0.4) 13 (0.2) \nMild b 150 (2.7) 88 (1.6) \nMild w/o ecchymosis, oozing and haematoma <5 cm 98 (1.8) 51 (0.9) \nPatients with any transfusion 25 (0.5) 16 (0.3) \nCABG: Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery; GUSTO: Global Use of Strategies to Open Coronary \nArteries; w/o: without \na In the CHAMPION pooled analysis, GUSTO Mild was defined as other bleed not requiring blood \ntransfusion or causing haemodynamic compromise. \nb In CHAMPION PHOENIX, GUSTO Mild was defined as other bleeding requiring intervention but \nnot requiring blood transfusion or causing haemodynamic compromise. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn clinical studies, healthy volunteers received up to two times the proposed daily dose. In clinical \ntrials, the maximum accidental overdose was 10 times (bolus) or 3.5 times the infusion dose normally \nadministered and bleeding was the most frequently observed adverse event. \n \nBleeding is the most likely pharmacological effect of overdose. If bleeding occurs appropriate \nsupportive measures should be taken, which may include stopping the medicinal product so platelet \nfunction can return. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\n \nThere is no antidote to Kengrexal, however, the pharmacokinetic half-life of Kengrexal is three to \nsix minutes. Platelet function is restored within 60 minutes of stopping the infusion. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Platelet aggregation inhibitors excluding heparin, ATC code: B01AC25. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nKengrexal contains cangrelor, a direct P2Y12 platelet receptor antagonist that blocks adenosine \ndiphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet activation and aggregation in vitro and ex vivo. Cangrelor binds \nselectively and reversibly to the P2Y12 receptor to prevent further signalling and platelet activation. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nCangrelor exhibits inhibition of activation and aggregation of platelets as shown by aggregometry \n(light transmission and impedance), point-of care assays, such as the VerifyNow P2Y12test, VASP-P \nand flow cytometry. Onset of P2Y12 inhibition occurs rapidly upon cangrelor administration. \n \nFollowing the administration of a 30 microgram/kg bolus followed by a 4 microgram/kg/min infusion, \nplatelet inhibition is observed within two minutes. The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) \neffect of cangrelor is maintained consistently for the duration of the infusion. \n \nIrrespective of dose, following cessation of the infusion, blood levels decrease rapidly and platelet \nfunction returns to normal within one hour. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe primary clinical evidence for the efficacy of cangrelor is derived from CHAMPION PHOENIX, a \nrandomised, double-blind study comparing cangrelor (n=5,472) to clopidogrel (n=5,470), both given \nin combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, including unfractionated heparin (78%), \nbivalirudin (23%), LMWH (14%) or fondaparinux (2.7%). The median duration of cangrelor infusion \nwas 129 minutes. GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors were permitted for bailout use only and were used in 2.9% of \npatients. Patients with coronary atherosclerosis were included who required PCI for stable angina \n(58%), non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) (26%), or ST-elevation \nmyocardial infraction (STEMI) (16%). \n \nData from the CHAMPION pooled population of over 25,000 PCI patients provide additional clinical \nsupport for safety. \n \nIn CHAMPION PHOENIX, cangrelor significantly reduced (relative risk reduction 22%; absolute risk \nreduction 1.2%) the primary composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, MI, IDR, and ST compared to \nclopidogrel at 48 hours (Table 3). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nTable 3: Thrombotic events at 48 hours in CHAMPION PHOENIX (mITT population) \n  Cangrelor vs. Clopidogrel \n\nn (%) \nCangrelor \nN=5,470 \n\nClopidogrel \nN=5,469 OR (95% CI) p-value \n\nPrimary Endpoint \nDeath/MI/IDR/ST a \n\n \n257 (4.7) \n\n \n322 (5.9) \n\n \n0.78 (0.66,0.93) \n\n \n0.005 \n\nKey Secondary Endpoint     \nStent thrombosis 46 (0.8) 74 (1.4) 0.62 (0.43, 0.90) 0.010 \nDeath 18 (0.3) 18 (0.3) 1.00 (0.52, 1.92) >0.999 \n\nMI 207 (3.8) 255 (4.7) 0.80 (0.67, 0.97) 0.022 \n\nIDR 28 (0.5) 38 (0.7) 0.74 (0.45, 1.20) 0.217 \na Primary endpoint from logistic regression adjusted for loading dose and patient status. p-values for \nsecondary endpoints based on Chi-squared test. \nOR = odds ratio; CI = confidence interval; IDR = ischaemia-driven revascularisation; MI = \nmyocardial infarction; mITT = modified intent-to-treat; ST = stent thrombosis. \n \nSignificant reductions in death/MI/IDR/ST and ST observed in the cangrelor group at 48 hours were \nmaintained at 30 days (Table 4). \n \nTable 4: Thrombotic events at 30 days in CHAMPION PHOENIX (mITT population) \n  Cangrelor vs. Clopidogrel \n\nn (%) \nCangrelor \nN=5,462 \n\nClopidogrel \nN=5,457 OR (95% CI) p-value a \n\nPrimary Endpoint \nDeath/MI/IDR/ST 326 (6.0) 380 (7.0) 0.85 (0.73, 0.99) 0.035 \n\nKey Secondary Endpoint     \n\nStent thrombosis 71 (1.3) 104 (1.9) 0.68 (0.50, 0.92) 0.012 \n\nDeath 60 (1.1) 55 (1.0) 1.09 (0.76, 1.58) 0.643 \n\nMI 225 (4.1) 272 (5.0) 0.82 (0.68, 0.98) 0.030 \n\nIDR 56 (1.0) 66 (1.2) 0.85 (0.59, 1.21) 0.360 \na p-values based on Chi-squared test. \nOR = odds ratio; CI = confidence interval; IDR = ischaemia-driven revascularisation; MI = \nmyocardial infarction; mITT = modified intent-to-treat; ST = stent thrombosis. \n \nPaediatric Population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nKengrexal in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of non-site specific \nembolism and thrombosis, for the treatment of thrombosis in paediatric patients undergoing diagnostic \nand / or therapeutic percutaneous vascular procedures. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric \nuse. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe bioavailability of cangrelor is complete and immediate. Cangrelor is rapidly distributed reaching \nCmax within two minutes after administration of an intravenous bolus followed by infusion. The mean \nsteady state concentration of cangrelor during a constant intravenous infusion of 4 micrograms/kg/min \nis 488 ng/mL. \n \nDistribution \n \nCangrelor has a volume of distribution of 3.9 L. Cangrelor is 97-98% plasma-protein bound. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nCangrelor is deactivated rapidly in the plasma by dephosphorylation to form its primary metabolite, a \nnucleoside. The metabolism of cangrelor is independent of organ function and does not interfere with \nother drugs metabolised by hepatic enzymes. \n \nElimination \n \nThe half-life of Kengrexal is three to six minutes, independent of dose. Following the intravenous \nadministration of a 2 micrograms/kg/min infusion of [3H] cangrelor to healthy male volunteers, 93% \nof total radioactivity was recovered. Of the recovered material, 58% was found in urine and the \nremaining 35% was found in faeces, presumably following biliary excretion. Initial excretion was \nrapid, such that approximately 50% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the first \n24 hours, and 75% was recovered by 48 hours. Mean clearance was approximately 43.2 L/kg. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of cangrelor have been evaluated and found to be linear in patients \nand healthy volunteers. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) \n \nSpecial populations \nThe pharmacokinetics of cangrelor are not affected by gender, age, or renal or hepatic status. No dose \nadjustment is needed for these populations. \n \nPaediatric population \nCangrelor has not been evaluated in a paediatric population (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special safety risk for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, \nmutagenicity and clastogenic potential. \n \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been performed. \n \nThe primary adverse effects of cangrelor in rats and dogs occurred in the upper urinary tract and \nconsisted of injury to renal tubules, renal pelvis, and ureter. Anatomical changes correlated with \nincreased plasma creatinine and urea, and increased albumin and blood cells in urine. Injury to the \nurinary tract was reversible following cessation of dosing in an investigative study in rats. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nReproductive toxicity \n \nCangrelor produced dose-related foetal growth retardation characterised by increased incidences of \nincomplete ossification and unossified hind limb metatarsals in rats. In rabbits, cangrelor was \nassociated with increased incidences of abortion and intrauterine losses, as well as foetal growth \nretardation at higher doses which may have been secondary to maternal toxicity. Cangrelor did not \nproduce malformations in either the rat or rabbit reproductive studies. \n \nImpairment of fertility \n \nEffects on fertility, ability to produce a pregnancy with female partner(s), sperm morphology and \nsperm motility were observed in the male rat fertility study when cangrelor was administered at human \nequivalent doses equal to 1.8 fold the recommended PCI dose. These effects were not apparent at \nlower doses and were reversible following cessation of dosing. In this study, semen analysis was \nconducted after 8 weeks of continuous treatment. \n \nFemale fertility was not affected at any dose. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n22 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nKengrexal 50 mg powder for concentrate for solution for injection/infusion \ncangrelor \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Kengrexal is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Kengrexal \n3. How to use Kengrexal \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Kengrexal \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Kengrexal is and what it is used for \n \nKengrexal is an anti-platelet medicine that contains the active substance cangrelor. \n \nPlatelets are very small cells in the blood that can clump together and help the blood to clot. \nSometimes clots can form within a damaged blood vessel such as in an artery in the heart and this can \nbe very dangerous as the clot can cut off the blood supply (a thrombotic event), causing a heart attack \n(myocardial infarction). \n \nKengrexal diminishes the clumping of platelets and so reduces the chance of a blood clot forming. \n \nYou have been prescribed Kengrexal because you have blocked blood vessels in your heart (coronary \nartery disease) and you need a procedure (called a percutaneous coronary intervention \u2013 PCI) to \nremove the blockage. During this procedure you may have a stent inserted in your blood vessel to help \nto keep it open. Using Kengrexal reduces the risk that this procedure will cause a clot to form and \nblock the blood vessels again. \n \nKengrexal is only for use in adults. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Kengrexal \n \nDo not use Kengrexal \n- If you are allergic to cangrelor or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- If you have a medical condition that is currently causing bleeding such as bleeding from the \n\nstomach or intestines or you have a condition which makes you more prone to uncontrolled \nbleeding (impaired haemostasis or irreversible coagulation disorders). \n\n- If you have recently undergone major surgery or suffered from any form of serious physical \ntrauma such as a bone fracture or road traffic accident. \n\n- If you have uncontrolled very high blood pressure. \n- If you have ever had a stroke, or a \u2018mini-stroke\u2019 (also known as a transient ischaemic attack, \n\nTIA) caused by the temporary interruption of the blood supply to the brain. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before using Kengrexal if: \n\u2022 You are, or you think you may be at increased risk of bleeding. For example, if you have a \n\nmedical condition that affects blood clotting or because of another medical condition that may \nincrease the risk of bleeding such as a recent serious injury, any recent surgery, history of a \nstroke or a transient ischaemic attack  or recent bleeding from your stomach or gut. \n\n\u2022 You suffer from impaired kidney function or require dialysis. \n\u2022 You have ever suffered from an allergic reaction to Kengrexal or any of its constituents. \n\u2022 You suffer from breathing difficulties such as asthma. \n\u2022 You have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nKengrexal is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Kengrexal \nYou may receive acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) while you are treated with Kengrexal or another type of \nanti-platelet medicine (e.g., clopidogrel) before and after you are treated with Kengrexal. \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking other medicines that may increase the risk of side effects such as \nbleeding including blood thinners (anticoagulants e.g. warfarin). \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice before taking this medicine. Kengrexal is not recommended for use during pregnancy. \n \nDriving and using machines \nThe effect of Kengrexal wears off quickly and it is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or to use \nmachines. \n \nKengrexal contains sodium and sorbitol \nSorbitol is a source of fructose. If you have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic \ndisorder, you must not receive this medicine. Patients with HFI cannot break down fructose, which \nmay cause serious side effects. \nYou must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you have HFI. \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Kengrexal \n \nYour treatment with Kengrexal will be supervised by a doctor experienced in caring for patients with \nheart disease. The doctor will decide how much Kengrexal you receive, and will prepare the medicine. \n \nKengrexal is for injection, followed by infusion (drip), into a vein. The dose given depends on your \nweight.  \n \nThe recommended dose is: \n\u2022 30 micrograms per kilogram body weight by injection, followed immediately by  \n\u2022 4 micrograms per kilogram body weight per minute by infusion (drip), for at least 2 hours. The \n\ndoctor will decide if you will need to be treated for longer periods. \n \nIf you use more Kengrexal than you should \nThis medicine will be given to you by a healthcare professional. Your doctor will decide how to treat \nyou, including stopping the medicine and monitoring for signs of side effects. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIf side effects occur, they may need medical attention. \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following: \n\u2022 Bleeding from anywhere in the body. Bleeding is a common side effect of treatment with \n\nKengrexal (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). Bleeding can be serious, and fatal outcomes have \nbeen reported. \n\n\u2022 Allergic reaction (a rash, itching, throat tightening/swelling, swelling of the tongue or lips, \ndifficulty breathing). Allergic reaction is a rare side effect of treatment with Kengrexal (may \naffect up to 1 in 1,000 people) but may be potentially serious. \n\n \nCommon side effects: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n\u2022 Minor bruising can occur anywhere in the body (including small red bruises on the skin or at the \n\nsite of an injection under the skin causing swelling),  \n\u2022 dyspnoea (shortness of breath),  \n\u2022 bleeding leading to decreases in blood volume or red blood cell numbers, \n\u2022 fluid discharge from injection or catheter sites.  \n \nUncommon side effects: may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n\u2022 Bleeding leading to fluid around the heart, blood in the chest cavity or bleeding from the nose, \n\ngastrointestinal tract, in the abdomen, or in the urine or from injection or catheter sites,  \n\u2022 increased levels of creatinine in the blood (identified by blood tests), indicating reduced kidney \n\nfunction, \n\u2022 variations in blood pressure, \n\u2022 rash, pruritus, urticaria, \n\u2022 vessel puncture site haematoma. \n \nRare side effects: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people \n\u2022 Bleeding leading to low platelet count or anaemia,  \n\u2022 bleeding in the eye, brain (including stroke), pelvis and lung,  \n\u2022 bleeding from the site of wounds,  \n\u2022 balloon-like swelling in an artery or wall of the heart, which involves only a few layers of the \n\nvessel walls, \n\u2022 severe allergic reactions,  \n\u2022 reduced clotting of the blood,  \n\u2022 bruising, \n\u2022 swollen face. \n \nVery rare side effects: may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people \n\u2022 Bleeding under the skin or around the eye,  \n\u2022 infection of bleeding sites,  \n\u2022 heavy menstrual bleeding,  \n\u2022 bleeding from the penis, ear or pre-existing skin tumours. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor.

The bolus and infusion \nshould be initiated prior to the procedure and continued for at least two hours or for the duration of the \nprocedure, whichever is longer. At the discretion of the physician, the infusion may be continued for a \ntotal duration of four hours, see section 5.1. \n \nPatients should be transitioned to oral P2Y12 therapy for chronic treatment. For transition, a loading \ndose of oral P2Y12 therapy (clopidogrel, ticagrelor or prasugrel) should be administered immediately \nfollowing discontinuation of cangrelor infusion. Alternatively, a loading dose of ticagrelor or prasugrel, \nbut not clopidogrel, may be administered up to 30 minutes before the end of the infusion, see \nsection 4.5. \n \nInstructions for preparation \n \nAseptic procedures should be used for the preparation of Kengrexal. \n \nThe vial should be reconsituted immediately prior to dilution and use. Reconstitute each 50 mg/vial by \nadding 5 mL of sterile water for injection. Swirl gently until all material is dissolved. Avoid vigorous \nmixing. Allow any foam to settle. Ensure that the contents of the vial are fully dissolved and the \nreconstituted material is a clear, colourless to pale yellow solution. \n \nDo not use without dilution. Before administration, 5 mL reconstituted solution has to be withdrawn \nfrom each vial and must be diluted further with 250 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for \ninjection or glucose (5%) solution for injection. Mix the bag thoroughly. \n \nThe medicinal product should be inspected visually for particulate matter after reconstitution. \n \nKengrexal is administered as a weight-based regimen consisting of an initial intravenous bolus \nfollowed by an intravenous infusion. The bolus and infusion should be administered from the infusion \nsolution. \n \nThis dilution will generate a concentration of 200 micrograms/mL and should be sufficient for at least \ntwo hours of dosing as required. Patients 100 kg and over will require a minimum of two bags. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA. MANUFACTURER(S) RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tB.

accident. - if you have uncontrolled very high blood pressure. - if you have ever had a stroke, or a 'mini-stroke' (also known as a transient ischaemic attack, tia) caused by the temporary interruption of the blood supply to the brain. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before using kengrexal if: you are, or you think you may be at increased risk of bleeding. for example, if you have a medical condition that affects blood clotting or because of another medical condition that may increase the risk of bleeding such as a recent serious injury, any recent surgery, history of a stroke or a transient ischaemic attack or recent bleeding from your stomach or gut. you suffer from impaired kidney function or require dialysis. you have ever suffered from an allergic reaction to kengrexal or any of its constituents. you suffer from breathing difficulties such as asthma. you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars. children and adolescents

bleeding including blood thinners (anticoagulants e.g. warfarin). tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. kengrexal is not recommended for use during pregnancy. driving and using machines the effect of kengrexal wears off quickly and it is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or to use machines. kengrexal contains sodium and sorbitol sorbitol is a source of fructose. if you have hereditary fructose intolerance (hfi), a rare genetic disorder, you must not receive this medicine. patients with hfi cannot break down fructose, which may cause serious side effects. you must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you have hfi. this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 'sodium- free'.",

immediately if you notice any of the following: bleeding from anywhere in the body. bleeding is a common side effect of treatment with kengrexal (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). bleeding can be serious, and fatal outcomes have been reported. allergic reaction (a rash, itching, throat tightening/swelling, swelling of the tongue or lips, difficulty breathing). allergic reaction is a rare side effect of treatment with kengrexal (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) but may be potentially serious. common side effects: may affect up to 1 in 10 people minor bruising can occur anywhere in the body (including small red bruises on the skin or at the site of an injection under the skin causing swelling), dyspnoea (shortness of breath), bleeding leading to decreases in blood volume or red blood cell numbers, fluid discharge from injection or catheter sites. uncommon side effects: may affect up to 1 in 100 people bleeding leading to fluid around the heart, blood in the chest cavity or bleeding from the nose, gastrointestinal tract, in the abdomen, or in the urine or from injection or catheter sites, increased levels of creatinine in the blood (identified by blood tests), indicating reduced kidney function, variations in blood pressure, rash, pruritus, urticaria, vessel puncture site haematoma. rare side effects: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people bleeding leading to low platelet count or anaemia, bleeding in the eye, brain (including stroke), pelvis and lung, bleeding from the site of wounds, balloon-like swelling in an artery or wall of the heart, which involves only a few layers of the vessel walls, severe allergic reactions, reduced clotting of the blood, bruising, swollen face. very rare side effects: may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people bleeding under the skin or around the eye, infection of bleeding sites, heavy menstrual bleeding, bleeding from the penis, ear or pre-existing skin tumours. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your
