NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nDUAVIVE 0.45 mg/20 mg modified-release tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach modified-release tablet contains 0.45 mg of conjugated oestrogens and bazedoxifene acetate \nequivalent to 20 mg bazedoxifene. \n \nExcipients with known effect \nEach modified-release tablet contains 96.9 mg sucrose (includes 0.7 mg sucrose as sucrose \nmonopalmitate), 62.9 mg lactose (as monohydrate), 0.2 mg maltitol liquid, 0.0176 mg glucose, and \n0.0088 mg sorbitol \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nModified-release tablet. \n \nPink, oval-shaped, modified-release tablet of 12 mm printed on one side with “0.45/20”. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDUAVIVE is indicated for the treatment of oestrogen deficiency symptoms in postmenopausal women \nwith a uterus (with at least 12 months since the last menses) for whom treatment with \nprogestin-containing therapy is not appropriate.   \n \nThe experience treating women older than 65 years is limited. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nFor initiation and continuation of treatment of postmenopausal symptoms, the lowest effective dose \nfor the shortest duration should be used (see section 4.4). \n \nThe recommended dose is 0.45 mg conjugated oestrogens (CE) and 20 mg bazedoxifene (BZA) taken \nas a single oral tablet, once daily. \n \nIf a tablet is forgotten, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers. Therapy should then be \ncontinued as before. If more than one tablet has been forgotten, only the most recent tablet should be \ntaken, the patient should not take double the usual dose to make up for missed tablets. \n \nSpecial populations  \n \nElderly \n \nCE/BZA has not been studied in women over 75 years of age. Based on available data no dosage \nadjustment is necessary based on age (see section 5.2). The experience treating women older than \n65 years is limited. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nRenal impairment \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of CE/BZA have not been evaluated in patients with renal impairment. Use in \nthis population is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of CE/BZA have not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment. Use \nin this population is contraindicated (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nThere is no relevant use of CE/BZA in the paediatric population.  \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nOral use. \n \nCE/BZA may be taken at any time of day, without regard to meals (see section 5.2). Tablets should be \nswallowed whole.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n- Known, suspected, or past history of breast cancer. \n- Known, past or suspected oestrogen-dependent malignant tumours (e.g., endometrial \n\ncancer). \n- Undiagnosed genital bleeding. \n- Untreated endometrial hyperplasia. \n- Active or past history of venous thromboembolism (e.g., deep venous thrombosis, \n\npulmonary embolism, and retinal vein thrombosis). \n- Known thrombophilic disorders (e.g., protein C, protein S, or antithrombin deficiency, see \n\nsection 4.4). \n- Active or past history of arterial thromboembolic disease (e.g., myocardial infarction, \n\nstroke). \n- Acute liver disease or a history of liver disease as long as liver function tests have failed \n\nto return to normal. \n- CE/BZA must not be taken by women of childbearing potential, or breast-feeding women \n\n(see sections 4.6 and 5.3).  \n- Porphyria. \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor the treatment of postmenopausal symptoms, CE/BZA should only be initiated for symptoms that \nadversely affect quality of life. In all cases, a careful appraisal of the risks and benefits should be \nundertaken at least annually, and treatment should only be continued as long as the benefit outweighs \nthe risk. \n \nWomen taking CE/BZA should not be taking progestins, additional oestrogens or selective oestrogen \nreceptor modulators (SERMs).  \n \nDUAVIVE (CE/BZA) has not been studied in the treatment of premature menopause.  \n \nMedical examination/follow-up \n \nBefore initiating or reinstituting treatment with CE/BZA, a complete personal and family medical \n\n\n\n4 \n\nhistory should be taken. Physical (including pelvic and breast) examination should be guided by this \nand by the contraindications and precautions for use. During treatment, periodic check-ups are \nrecommended of a frequency and nature adapted to the individual woman. Women should be advised \nwhat changes in their breasts should be reported to their doctor or nurse (see ‘Breast cancer’ below). \nInvestigations, including appropriate imaging tools, e.g., mammography, should be carried out in \naccordance with currently accepted screening practices, modified to the clinical needs of the \nindividual. \n \nConditions which need supervision \n \nIf any of the following conditions are present, have occurred previously, and/or have been aggravated \nduring pregnancy or previous hormone treatment, the patient should be closely supervised. It should \nbe taken into account that these conditions may recur or be aggravated during treatment with CE/BZA, \nin particular: \n \n\n Leiomyoma (uterine fibroids) or endometriosis \n Risk factors for thromboembolic disorders (see below) \n Risk factors for oestrogen-dependent tumours, e.g., 1st degree heredity for breast cancer \n Hypertension \n Liver disorders (e.g., liver adenoma) \n Diabetes mellitus with or without vascular involvement \n Cholelithiasis \n Migraine or (severe) headache \n Systemic lupus erythematosus \n A history of endometrial hyperplasia (see below) \n Epilepsy \n Asthma \n Otosclerosis \n\n \nReasons for immediate withdrawal of therapy \n \nTherapy should be discontinued in case a contraindication is discovered (e.g., venous \nthromboembolism, stroke, and pregnancy) and in the following situations: \n \n\n- Jaundice or deterioration in liver function \n- Significant increase in blood pressure \n- New onset of migraine-type headache \n\n \nEndometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma \n \nIn women with an intact uterus, the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma is increased when \noestrogens are administered alone for prolonged periods. The reported increase in endometrial cancer \nrisk among oestrogen-only users varies from 2- to 12-fold greater compared with non-users, depending \non duration of treatment and oestrogen dose. After stopping treatment, risk may remain elevated for at \nleast 10 years. Women taking CE/BZA should not take additional oestrogens as this may increase the \nrisk of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma.  \n \nThe addition of bazedoxifene in CE/BZA reduces the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a \nprecursor of endometrial carcinoma. \n \nBreak-through bleeding and spotting may occur during treatment. If break-through bleeding or \nspotting appears after some time on therapy, or continues after treatment has been discontinued, the \nreason should be investigated, which may include endometrial biopsy to exclude endometrial \nmalignancy.  \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nBreast cancer \n \nThe overall evidence suggests a possible increased risk of breast cancer in women taking \noestrogen-only therapy that is dependent on the duration of therapy.  \n \nThe Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) trial found no increase in the risk of breast cancer in \nhysterectomised women using oestrogen-only therapy.  \n \nObservational studies have mostly reported a small increase in risk of having breast cancer diagnosed \nthat is substantially lower than that found in users of oestrogen-progestagen combinations (see \nsection 4.8). The excess risk becomes apparent within a few years of use but returns to baseline within \na few (at most five) years after stopping treatment.  \n \nThe effect of CE/BZA on the risk of breast cancer is unknown. \n \nOvarian cancer \n \nOvarian cancer is much rarer than breast cancer.   \n \nEpidemiological evidence from a large meta-analysis suggests a slightly increased risk in women \ntaking oestrogen-only Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT), which becomes apparent within 5 years \nof use and diminishes over time after stopping. \n \nSome other studies, including the WHI trial, suggest that use of combined HRTs may be associated \nwith a similar or slightly smaller risk (see section 4.8). \n \nThe effect of CE/BZA on the risk of ovarian cancer is unknown. \n \nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) \n \nIn clinical trials of up to 2 years duration in postmenopausal women with CE/BZA, cases of VTE have \nbeen reported (see section 4.8). Should a VTE event occur or be suspected, CE/BZA should be \ndiscontinued immediately. \n \nSERMs (including bazedoxifene) and oestrogens individually increase the risk of VTE (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nHormone therapy is associated with a 1.3-3 fold risk of developing VTE. The occurrence of such an \nevent is more likely in the first year of HRT than later (see section 4.8).  \n \nPatients with known thrombophilic states have an increased risk of VTE and hormone therapy may \nadd to this risk. CE/BZA is contraindicated in these patients (see section 4.3). \n \nGenerally recognised risk factors for VTE include, use of oestrogens, older age, major surgery, \nprolonged immobilisation, obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2), pregnancy/postpartum period, systemic lupus \nerythematosus (SLE), and cancer. There is no consensus about the possible role of varicose veins in \nVTE. As in all postoperative patients, prophylactic measures need be considered to prevent VTE \nfollowing surgery. If prolonged immobilisation is to follow elective surgery temporarily stopping \nCE/BZA 4 to 6 weeks earlier is recommended. Treatment should not be restarted until the woman is \ncompletely mobilised. In addition, women taking CE/BZA should be advised to move about \nperiodically during travel involving prolonged immobilisation. \n \nIn women with no personal history of VTE but with a first-degree relative with a history of thrombosis \nat young age, screening may be offered after careful counselling regarding its limitations (only a \nproportion of thrombophilic defects are identified by screening). If a thrombophilic defect is identified \nwhich segregates with thrombosis in family members or if the defect is ‘severe’ (e.g., antithrombin, \nprotein S, or protein C deficiencies or a combination of defects) hormone therapy is contraindicated. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nWomen already on chronic anticoagulant treatment require careful consideration of the benefit risk of \nuse of hormone therapy. \n \nIf VTE develops after initiating therapy, or is suspected, CE/BZA should be discontinued \nimmediately. Women should be told to contact their doctors immediately when they are aware of a \npotential thromboembolic symptom (e.g., painful swelling of a leg, sudden pain in the chest, \ndyspnoea). \n \nCoronary artery disease (CAD) \n \nThere is no evidence from randomised controlled trials of protection against myocardial infarction in \nwomen with or without existing CAD who received oestrogen-only therapy. Randomised controlled \ndata found no increased risk of CAD in hysterectomised women using oestrogen-only therapy.  \n \nIschaemic stroke \n \nOestrogen-only therapy is associated with an up to 1.5-fold increase in risk of ischaemic stroke. The \nrelative risk does not change with age or time since menopause. However, as the baseline risk of \nstroke is strongly age-dependent, the overall risk of stroke in women who use hormone therapy will \nincrease with age (see section 4.8). \n \nThe effect of CE/BZA on the risk of stroke is unknown. \n \nShould a stroke occur or be suspected, CE/BZA should be discontinued immediately (see section 4.3). \n \nOther conditions \n \n- Oestrogens may cause fluid retention, and therefore patients with cardiac or renal dysfunction \n\nshould be carefully monitored when being treated with CE/BZA.  \n- Patients with terminal renal insufficiency should be closely monitored, since it is expected that \n\nthe level of circulating oestrogens components of CE/BZA will be increased. Use in this \npopulation is not recommended (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  \n\n- Women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridaemia should be followed closely during treatment \nwith oestrogens, since rare cases of large increases of plasma triglycerides leading to \npancreatitis have been reported with oestrogen therapy in this condition. CE/BZA has not been \nstudied in women with baseline triglyceride levels >300 mg/dL (>3.4 mmol/L). In clinical trials \nof up to 2 years duration, CE/BZA was associated with an increase from baseline in the \nconcentration of serum triglycerides of approximately 16% at month 12 and 20% at month 24. \nAnnual monitoring of serum triglyceride levels should therefore be considered. \n\n- CE/BZA has not been studied in patients with impaired liver function (see sections 4.2 and 5.2) \nor history of cholestatic jaundice. Oestrogens may be poorly metabolised in women with \nimpaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past \noestrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, \nCE/BZA should be discontinued. \n\n- A 2 to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal \nwomen receiving oestrogens has been reported (see section 4.8). Patients treated with CE/BZA \nshould be monitored carefully for signs of development of gallbladder disease. \n\n- Oestrogens increase thyroid binding globulin (TBG), leading to increased circulating total \nthyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by \nradioimmunoassay) or T3 levels (by radio-immunoassay). T3 resin uptake is decreased, \nreflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Other binding \nproteins may be elevated in serum, i.e. corticoid binding globulin (CBG), sex-hormone-binding \nglobulin (SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. \nFree or biological active hormone concentrations are unchanged. Other plasma proteins may be \nincreased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1 antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nOestrogen therapy use does not improve cognitive function. There is some evidence of increased risk \nof probable dementia in women who start using continuous oestrogen-only therapy after the age of 65. \n \nThe effect of CE/BZA on the risk of dementia is unknown. \n \nExcipients content \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose, sucrose, glucose (in polydextrose and maltitol liquid) and \nsorbitol (in polydextrose).  \n \nLactose, sucrose and glucose \n \nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency, fructose \nintolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \nSorbitol \n \nThis medicinal product contains sorbitol which may affect the bioavailability of other concomitantly \nadministered medicinal products. The additive effect of all sources of sorbitol from other \nconcomitantly administered medicinal products and dietary sources should be taken into account. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nResults from a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted with CE/BZA and from interaction \nstudies with CE or bazedoxifene monotherapy are summarised below. \n \nConjugated oestrogens \n \nIn vitro and in vivo studies have shown that oestrogens are partially metabolised by cytochrome \nP450 enzymes, including CYP3A4. However, in a clinical drug-drug interaction study, repeat \nadministration of 200 mg itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, had minimal impact on the \npharmacokinetics of CE (as measured by estrone and equilin) and bazedoxifene when administered \nwith a single dose of CE 0.45 mg/BZA 20 mg. \n \nThe metabolism of oestrogens may be increased by concomitant use of substances known to induce \ndrug-metabolising enzymes, such as anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine) \nand anti-infectives (e.g., rifampicin, rifabutin, nevirapine, efavirenz). Ritonavir and nelfinavir, \nalthough known as strong inhibitors, by contrast exhibit inducing properties when used concomitantly \nwith steroid hormones. Herbal preparations containing St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) may \ninduce the metabolism of oestrogens. Clinically, an increased metabolism of oestrogens may lead to \ndecreased effect and changes in the uterine bleeding profile. \n \nBazedoxifene  \n \nThe metabolism of bazedoxifene may be increased by concomitant use of substances known to induce \nuridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, \ncarbamazepine, and phenytoin, potentially leading to decreased systemic concentrations of \nbazedoxifene. A reduction in bazedoxifene exposure may be associated with an increased risk of \nendometrial hyperplasia (see section 4.4).  \n \nBazedoxifene undergoes little or no cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated metabolism. Bazedoxifene \ndoes not induce or inhibit the activities of major CYP isoenzymes, and is unlikely to interact with \nco-administered medicinal products via CYP-mediated metabolism.  \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nThere were no significant pharmacokinetic interactions between bazedoxifene and the following \nmedicinal products: ibuprofen, atorvastatin and azithromycin or an antacid containing aluminium and \nmagnesium hydroxide.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nCE/BZA is only for use in postmenopausal women, and is contraindicated in women who are or may \nbecome pregnant (see section 4.3). There are no data from the use of CE/BZA in pregnant women. If \npregnancy occurs during treatment with CE/BZA, it should be withdrawn immediately. \n \nThe results of most epidemiological studies to date relevant to inadvertent foetal exposure to \noestrogens indicate no teratogenic or foetotoxic effects. \n \nIn studies conducted in rabbits, bazedoxifene alone has shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \nThe potential risk for humans is unknown. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nCE/BZA is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). It is not known whether \nbazedoxifene is excreted in human milk. Detectable amounts of oestrogens have been identified in the \nmilk of mothers receiving CE. Oestrogen administration to breast-feeding mothers has been shown to \ndecrease the quantity and quality of the milk. \n \nFertility \n \nNo studies were performed on animals to evaluate the effects on reproduction with the CE/BZA \ncombination.  \n \nStudies in rats with bazedoxifene have shown adverse effects on fertility (see section 5.3). The \npotential risk for humans is unknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCE/BZA has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \nIn clinical trials with bazedoxifene monotherapy, somnolence was reported as an adverse reaction, and \npatients should be advised on the potential effect on driving and using machines. \n \nIn patients receiving bazedoxifene monotherapy there have been post-marketing reports of visual \nsymptoms such as visual acuity disturbance or blurred vision. If such symptoms occur, patients should \navoid driving or use of machines that requires accurate visual perception until symptoms have \nresolved, or until they have received medical advice that it is safe to do so.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reaction is abdominal pain, occurring in more than 10% of \npatients in clinical trials.  \n \nSerious venous thromboembolic events may occur rarely (less than 1 case per 1,000 patients). \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe table below lists the adverse reactions observed with CE/BZA (n = 3,168) in placebo-controlled \nclinical trials. Adverse reactions were categorised as very common ( 1/10), common \n( 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon ( 1/1,000 to < 1/100) or rare ( 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000). \n \nSystem organ \nclass \n\nFrequency of occurrence of adverse reactions \nVery common Common Uncommon Rare \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n Vulvovaginal \ncandidiasis\n\n  \n\nVascular disorders    Venous \nthromboembolic \nevents (including, \npulmonary \nembolism, retinal \nvein thrombosis, \ndeep vein \nthrombosis and \nthrombophlebitis)\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nAbdominal pain Constipation; \ndiarrhoea; nausea \n\n  \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n  Cholecystitis  \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n Muscle spasms   \n\nInvestigations  Blood triglycerides \nincreased\n\n  \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nBreast cancer risk \n \nBreast cancer risk associated with the use of oestrogens alone is represented by several studies. Any \nincreased risk to users of oestrogen-only therapy is substantially lower than that seen in users of \noestrogen–progestagen combinations. The level of risk is dependent on duration of use (see \nsection 4.4). Results of the largest randomised placebo-controlled trial (WHI-study) and largest \nepidemiological study (MWS) are presented.  \n \nUS WHI Oestrogen only (ET) arm – additional risk of breast cancer after 5 years use \n \n\nAge range \n(years) \n\nIncidence per 1,000 \nwomen in placebo arm \nover 5 years \n\n \nRisk ratio & 95% CI \n\nAdditional cases per \n1,000 ET users over \n\n5 years (95% CI)\nCE Oestrogen only\n\n50-79 21 0.8 (0.7-1.0) -4 (-6 – 0)* \n*WHI study in women with no uterus, which did not show an increase in risk of breast cancer \n\n \nMillion women study (Estradiol only arm) – estimated additional risk of breast cancer after 5 years use \n \n\nAge range \n(years) \n\nAdditional cases per \n1,000 never-users of HRT \nover a 5 year period* \n\n \nRisk ratio#  \n\n \n\nAdditional cases per \n1,000 ET users over \n5 years (95%CI) \n\nEstradiol only \n50-65 9-12 1.2 1-2 (0-3) \n\n* Taken from baseline incidence rates in developed countries \n#Overall risk ratio. The risk ratio is not constant but will increase with increasing duration on use. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nEndometrial cancer risk \n \nPostmenopausal women with a uterus  \nThe endometrial cancer risk is about 5 in every 1,000 women with a uterus not using HRT.  \n \nIn women with a uterus, use of oestrogen-only HRT is not recommended because it increases the risk \nof endometrial cancer (see section 4.4). Depending on the duration of oestrogen-only use and \noestrogen dose, the increase in risk of endometrial cancer in epidemiology studies varied from \n5 to 55 extra cases diagnosed in every 1,000 women between the ages of 50 and 65 years. \n \nCE/BZA contains bazedoxifene, which reduces the risk of endometrial hyperplasia that can occur with \noestrogen-only use (see section 4.4). Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial \ncancer. \n \nOvarian cancer \n \nUse of oestrogen-only HRT has been associated with a slightly increased risk of having ovarian cancer \ndiagnosed (see section 4.4).  \n \nA meta-analysis from 52 epidemiological studies reported an increased risk of ovarian cancer in \nwomen currently using HRT compared to women who have never used HRT (RR 1.43, 95% CI \n1.31-1.56). For women aged 50 to 54 years taking 5 years of HRT, this results in about 1 extra case \nper 2,000 users. In women aged 50 to 54 who are not taking HRT, about 2 women in 2,000 will be \ndiagnosed with ovarian cancer over a 5-year period. \n \nRisk of venous thromboembolism \n \nIn the bazedoxifene osteoporosis treatment trial (mean age = 66.5 years), the VTE rate per \n1,000 women-years through the 3-year study period was 2.86 in the bazedoxifene (20 mg) group and \n1.76 in the placebo group and through the 5-year study period was 2.34 in the bazedoxifene 20 mg \ngroup and 1.56 in the placebo group. After 7 years, the VTE rate per 1,000 women-years was 2.06 in \nthe bazedoxifene 20 mg group and 1.36 in the placebo group. \n \nOestrogens are known to increase the risk of VTE (see section 4.4). The occurrence of such a reaction \nis more likely in the first year of treatment. The data from the largest randomised trial are summarised \nbelow: \n \nWHI studies oestrogen only arm – additional risk of VTE over 5 years’ use \n\nAge range (years) Incidence per 1,000 women \nin placebo arm over 5 years \n\nRisk ratio & 95%CI Additional cases per \n1,000 ET users  \n\nOral oestrogen-only* \n50-59 7 1.2 (0.6-2.4) 1 (-3-10) \n\n*study in women with no uterus \n \nRisk of ischaemic stroke \n \nThe use of oestrogen-only therapy is associated with an up to 1.5 fold increased relative risk of \nischaemic stroke. This relative risk is not dependent on age or on duration of use, but as the baseline \nrisk is strongly age-dependent, the overall risk of stroke in women who use oestrogen therapy will \nincrease with age (see section 4.4). The additional risk of ischaemic stroke over five years of use was \nassessed in the largest randomised trial in women without a uterus (WHI) from 50-59 years of age.  \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nWHI Studies combined – Additional risk of ischaemic stroke* over 5 years use \nAge range (years) Incidence per 1,000 women \n\nin placebo arm over 5 years \nRisk ratio & 95%CI Additional cases per \n\n1,000 HRT users \nover 5 years \n\n50-59 8 1.3 (1.1-1.6) 3 (1-5) \n*no differentiation was made between ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke.  \n \nAdverse reactions reported with CE and/or bazedoxifene monotherapy \n \nAdverse reactions were categorised as very common ( 1/10), common ( 1/100 to < 1/10), \nuncommon ( 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare ( 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) or not known \n(cannot be estimated from available data). \n \nAdverse reactions that have been observed with CE monotherapy \n \nSystem organ class Frequency of occurrence of adverse reactions \n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Very rare \nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n Vaginitis    \n\nNeoplasms benign, \nmalignant and \nunspecified (incl. \ncysts and polyps) \n\n  Growth \npotentiation of \nbenign \nmeningioma; \nfibrocystic \nbreast disease \n\nEnlargement of \nhepatic \nhaemangiomas \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Hypersensitivity  Angioedema; \nanaphylactic/ana\nphylactoid \nreactions; \nurticaria \n\n \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\n  Glucose \nintolerance \n\nExacerbation of \nporphyria; \nhypocalcaemia (in \npatients with \ndisease that can \npredispose to \nsevere \nhypocalcaemia) \n\nPsychiatric disorders  Dementia; \ndepression; mood \naltered; changes \nin libido \n\nIrritability  \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n Migraine; \nheadache; \ndizziness; \nnervousness \n\nExacerbation of \nepilepsy \n\nExacerbation of \nchorea \n\nEye disorders \n \n\n Intolerance to \ncontact lenses \n\n  \n\nCardiac disorders   Myocardial \ninfarction \n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\n  Exacerbation of \nasthma \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nSystem organ class Frequency of occurrence of adverse reactions \nCommon Uncommon Rare Very rare \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Nausea Pancreatitis; \nischaemic \ncolitis; vomiting \n\n \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nAlopecia \n \n\nHirsutism; rash; \npruritus; \nchloasma \n\n Erythema \nmultiforme; \nerythema \nnodosum \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nArthralgia; leg \ncramps \n\n   \n\nReproductive system \nand breast disorders \n\nBreast pain, \ntenderness, \nenlargement, \ndischarge; \nleucorrhoea  \n\nChange in \ncervical ectropion \nand secretion \n\nPelvic pain  \n\nInvestigations Changes in \nweight (increase \nor decrease)  \n\n  Increases in blood \npressure \n\n \nAdverse reactions that have been observed with bazedoxifene monotherapy \n \nSystem organ class Frequency of occurrence of adverse reactions \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Hypersensitivity   \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n Somnolence   \n\nEye disorders \n \n\n  Retinal vein \nthrombosis \n\nVisual acuity \nreduced, blurred \nvision, photopsia, \nvisual field defect, \nvisual impairment, \ndry eye, eyelid \noedema, \nblepharospasm, eye \npain and eye \nswelling \n\nCardiac disorders    Palpitations \nVascular disorders Hot flush  Deep vein \n\nthrombosis, \nthrombophlebitis \nsuperficial \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n  Pulmonary \nembolism \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Dry mouth   \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \n\n Urticaria, rash, \npruritus \n\n  \n\n\n\n13 \n\nSystem organ class Frequency of occurrence of adverse reactions \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Not known \n\ndisorders \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\nMuscle \nspasms \n(includes leg \ncramps)  \n\n   \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nOedema \nperipheral \n\n   \n\nInvestigations  Blood triglycerides \nincreased, alanine \naminotransferase \nincreased; aspartate \naminotransferase \nincreased \n\n  \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no specific antidote. In case of overdose it is recommended that the patient be monitored for \nany signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted \nimmediately. \n \nSymptoms of overdose of oestrogen-containing medicinal products in adults and children may include \nnausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, dizziness, abdominal pain, drowsiness/fatigue; withdrawal \nbleeding may occur in females. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital system; estrogens, \ncombinations with other drugs; ATC code: G03CC07 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nCE/BZA pairs CE with the selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM), BZA, which is defined as \na tissue selective oestrogen complex (TSEC). The active ingredients of CE are primarily the sulphate \nesters of estrone, equilin sulphates and 17α/β-estradiol. These substitute for the loss of oestrogen \nproduction in menopausal women, and alleviate menopausal symptoms. As oestrogens promote the \ngrowth of the endometrium, unopposed oestrogens increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and \ncancer. The addition of bazedoxifene, acting as an oestrogen receptor antagonist in the uterus, greatly \nreduces the oestrogen-induced risk of endometrial hyperplasia in non-hysterectomised women. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nCE/BZA was evaluated in 4,868 postmenopausal women who participated in 5 phase 3 trials. Among \nthese, 1,585 women were treated with CE 0.45 mg/BZA 20 mg and 1,241 received placebo. Long-\nterm exposure to CE/BZA for up to 2 years was evaluated; 3,322 women were exposed to CE/BZA for \nat least 1 year, and 1,999 women were exposed for 2 years. \n \nRelief of oestrogen-deficiency symptoms and bleeding patterns \n \nRelief of menopausal symptoms was achieved during the first few weeks of treatment. In a 12-week \nstudy, CE 0.45 mg/BZA 20 mg significantly reduced the number and severity of hot flushes compared \nto placebo at weeks 4 and 12.  \n \nIn one study, amenorrhea was reported in 97% of the women who received CE 0.45 mg/BZA 20 mg \nduring months 10 to 12. Irregular bleeding and/or spotting was reported in the CE 0.45 mg/BZA \n20 mg group by 7% of women during the first 3 months of treatment and by 3% of women during \nmonths 10 to 12. \n \nIn another study, amenorrhea was reported in 96% of the women who received CE 0.45 mg/BZA \n20 mg during months 10 to 12. Irregular bleeding and/or spotting was reported in the CE \n0.45 mg/BZA 20 mg group by 8% of women during the first 3 months and by 4% of women during \nmonths 10 to 12. \n \nBreast density \n \nCE 0.45 mg/BZA 20 mg demonstrated similar changes in mammographic breast density compared to \nplacebo over 1 year of treatment. \n \nEffects on bone mineral density (BMD) \n \nIn a 1 year study, CE 0.45 mg/BZA 20 mg showed a significant difference from baseline in lumbar \nspine BMD (+1.52%) at month 12 compared to placebo. This change in BMD was similar to that \nshown with bazedoxifene 20 mg alone (+1.35%) and less than that seen with CE 0.45 mg/ \nmedroxyprogesterone 1.5 mg (+2.58%) in the same study.  \n \nElderly \n \nOf the total number of women in phase 3 clinical trials who received CE/BZA 20 mg, 2.4% (n=77) \nwere aged ≥65 years. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between women aged \n>65 years and younger women, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nCE/BZA in all subsets of the paediatric population in the ‘treatment of oestrogen deficiency symptoms \nin postmenopausal women’ (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPharmacokinetic studies for CE/BZA were conducted in healthy postmenopausal women who were \nnaturally postmenopausal or who had undergone bilateral oophorectomy. \n \nFollowing multiple doses of CE 0.45 mg/BZA 20 mg, the mean steady state pharmacokinetic \nparameters for CE and bazedoxifene (baseline adjusted for total estrone) are summarised below. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nMean ± SD Steady-State Pharmacokinetic Parameters (n=24) \n Cmax \n\n(ng/mL) \nTmax \n(hr) \n\nAUCss \n(nghr/mL)\n\nBazedoxifene 6.9 ± 3.9 2.5 ± 2.1 71 ± 34 \nBaseline-adjusted total estrone 2.6 ± 0.8 6.5 ± 1.6 35 ± 12 \n\n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter a single dose of CE/BZA, bazedoxifene and baseline-adjusted total estrone were absorbed with a \ntmax of approximately 2 hours and 8.5 hours, respectively. When single doses of CE 0.625 mg/BZA \n20 mg were administered with a high-fat meal, bazedoxifene Cmax was unaffected, but Area Under \nCurve (AUC) increased by approximately 25%. Food had little or no effect on the exposure of CE. \n \nCE/BZA can be administered with or without food. \n \nFollowing administration of BZA alone, a linear increase in plasma concentrations for single doses \nfrom 0.5 mg up to 120 mg and multiple daily doses from 1 mg to 80 mg was observed. The absolute \nbioavailability of BZA is approximately 6%.  \n \nCE are soluble in water and are well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after release from the \nmedicinal product formulation. Oestrogen dose proportionality was assessed in two studies of CE. \nDose-proportional increases in both AUC and Cmax were observed across the dose range from \n0.3 mg to 0.625 mg of CE for total (conjugated plus unconjugated) equilin, total estrone adjusted for \nbaseline, and unconjugated estrone adjusted for baseline. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe distribution of CE and bazedoxifene after administration of CE/BZA has not been studied.  \n \nFollowing intravenous administration of a 3 mg dose of BZA alone, the volume of distribution is 14.7 \n3.9 l/kg. BZA is highly bound (98% - 99%) to plasma proteins in vitro, but does not bind to sex \nhormone binding globulin (SHBG).  \n \nThe distribution of exogenous oestrogens is similar to that of endogenous oestrogens. Oestrogens are \nwidely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone \ntarget organs. Oestrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to SHBG and albumin.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nThe metabolic disposition of CE and BZA, after administration of CE/BZA, has not been studied.  \n \nCirculating oestrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. 17β-estradiol is \nconverted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is the major urinary \nmetabolite. In postmenopausal women, a significant proportion of the circulating oestrogens exists as \nsulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation \nof more active oestrogens. \n \nThe metabolic disposition of bazedoxifene in postmenopausal women has been determined following \noral administration of 20 mg of radiolabeled BZA. BZA is extensively metabolised in women. \nGlucuronidation is the major metabolic pathway. Little or no cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism \nis evident. Bazedoxifene-5-glucuronide is the major circulating metabolite. The concentrations of this \nglucuronide are approximately 10-fold higher than those of unchanged BZA in plasma.  \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nElimination \n \nAfter a single dose of CE/BZA, baseline-adjusted total estrone (representing CE) is eliminated with a \nhalf-life of approximately 17 hours. BZA is eliminated with a half-life of approximately 30 hours. \nSteady-state concentrations are achieved by the second week of once-daily administration.  \n \nCE components, 17β-estradiol, estrone, and estriol are excreted in the urine, along with glucuronide \nand sulfate conjugates. \n \nThe clearance of BZA is 0.4 ±0.1 L/h/kg based on intravenous administration. The major route of \nexcretion of radiolabeled BZA is the faeces, and less than 1% of the dose is eliminated in urine. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThe pharmacokinetics of CE/BZA have not been evaluated in women over 75 years of age. \nThe pharmacokinetics of a 20 mg single dose of BZA were evaluated in a study in 26 healthy \npostmenopausal women. On average, compared to women 51 to 64 years of age (n=8), women \n65 to 74 years of age (n=8) showed a 1.5-fold increase in AUC, and women 75 years of age (n=8) \nshowed a 2.6-fold increase in AUC. This increase is most likely attributable to age-related changes in \nhepatic function.  \n \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of CE/BZA have not been evaluated in patients with renal impairment. \nLimited clinical data (n=5) for bazedoxifene monotherapy are available in subjects with moderate \nrenal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 ml/min). A single 20 mg dose of BZA was administered to \nthese subjects. Negligible (1%) amounts of BZA are eliminated in urine. Impaired renal function \nshowed little or no influence on bazedoxifene pharmacokinetics. \n \nHepatic impairment  \nThe pharmacokinetics of CE/BZA have not been evaluated in women with hepatic impairment.  \n \nThe disposition of a single 20 mg dose of bazedoxifene was compared in women with hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh Class A [n=6], B [n=6], and C [n=6]) and subjects with normal hepatic \nfunction (n=18). On average, women with hepatic impairment showed a 4.3-fold increase in AUC \ncompared with controls. Safety and efficacy have not been evaluated further in women with hepatic \ninsufficiency. Use of CE/BZA in this population is contraindicated (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nBody mass index (BMI)  \nIn a pharmacokinetic study (n=24) BMI appeared to have little impact on systemic exposure to CE and \nBZA. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nCarcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and impairment of fertility studies with CE/BZA have not been \nconducted. The following data are based on the findings in studies with bazedoxifene. \n \nIn 6-month carcinogenicity studies in transgenic mice, there was an increased incidence of benign, \novarian granulosa-cell tumours in female mice given 150 or 500 mg/kg/day. Systemic exposure \n(AUC) to bazedoxifene in these groups was 35 and 69 times that in postmenopausal women \nadministered 20 mg/day for 14 days. \n \nIn a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, an increased incidence of benign, ovarian granulosa-cell \ntumours was observed in female rats at dietary concentrations of 0.03% and 0.1%. Systemic exposure \n(AUC) of bazedoxifene in these groups was 2.6 and 6.6 times that observed in postmenopausal women \nadministered 20 mg/day for 14 days. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nThe observation of benign, ovarian granulosa-cell tumours in female mice and rats administered \nbazedoxifene is a class effect of SERMs related to its pharmacology in rodents when treated during \ntheir reproductive lives, when their ovaries are functional and responsive to hormonal stimulation. \n \nBazedoxifene elicited male rat-specific nephropathies (corticomedullar nephrocalcinosis and enhanced \nspontaneous chronic progressive nephropathy) and associated adenomas and carcinomas at exposure \nratios of 0.05 to 4 times, and dose ratios, based on surface area (mg/m2), of approximately \n0.6 to 22 times the clinical dose of 20 mg. These findings are considered rat-specific and presumably \nnot relevant in humans. Renal cell carcinomas were observed in an 18-month bone efficacy study in \naged ovariectomised cynomolgus monkeys at exposure ratios of 0.05 to 16.3 times, and dose ratios, \nbased on surface area (mg/m2), of approximately 0.2 to 24 times the clinical dose of 20 mg. These \ntumours are known to occur in aged nonhuman primates and were considered spontaneous in the aged \nmonkeys and irrelevant to humans. \n \nBZA was not genotoxic or mutagenic in a battery of tests, including in vitro bacterial reverse mutation \nassay, in vitro mammalian cell forward mutation assay at the thymidine kinase (TK/-) locus in \nL5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, in vitro chromosome aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary \n(CHO) cells, and in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. \n \nReproductive toxicity and impairment of fertility studies with CE/BZA have not been conducted. The \nfollowing data are based on the findings in studies with BZA. \n \nIn rabbit studies with BZA, abortion and an increased incidence of heart (ventricular septal defect) and \nskeletal system (ossification delays, misshapen or misaligned bones, primarily of the spine and skull) \nanomalies in the fetuses were present at maternally toxic dosages of  0.5 mg/kg/day (1.5 times the \nhuman exposure). Treatment of rats with BZA at maternally toxic dosages  1 mg/kg/day ( 0.4 times \nthe human dose based on body surface area) resulted in reduced numbers of live foetuses and/or \nreductions in foetal body weights.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What DUAVIVE is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you take DUAVIVE \n3. How to take DUAVIVE \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store DUAVIVE \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What DUAVIVE is and what it is used for \n \nDUAVIVE is a medicine that contains two active substances called conjugated oestrogens and \nbazedoxifene. Conjugated oestrogens is a medicine that belongs to a group of medicines called \nhormone replacement therapy (HRT). Bazedoxifene belongs to a group of non-hormonal medicines \ncalled selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs).  \n \nDUAVIVE is used in postmenopausal women who still have their uterus (womb) and have not had a \nnatural period in the last 12 months. \n \nDUAVIVE is used for: \n \nRelief of symptoms occurring after menopause \n \nDuring the menopause, the amount of the oestrogen produced by a woman’s body drops. This can \ncause symptoms such as hot face, neck and chest (\"hot flushes\"). DUAVIVE alleviates these \nsymptoms after menopause. You will only be prescribed this medicine if your symptoms seriously \nhinder your daily life and your doctor determines that other types of HRT are not appropriate for you. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take DUAVIVE \n \nMedical history and regular check-ups \n \nThe use of DUAVIVE carries risks, which need to be considered when deciding whether to start \ntaking it, or whether to carry on taking it.  \n \nThere is no experience in treating women with a premature menopause (due to ovarian failure or \nsurgery) with DUAVIVE. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nBefore you start taking this medicine, your doctor will ask you about your own and your family’s \nmedical history. Your doctor may decide to perform a physical examination. This may include an \nexamination of your breasts and/or an internal examination, if necessary, or if you have any special \nconcerns. Tell your doctor if you have any medical problems or illnesses. \n \nOnce you have started this medicine you should see your doctor for regular check-ups (at least once a \nyear). During these check-ups, discuss with your doctor the benefits and risks of continuing with \nDUAVIVE. You are advised to: \n\n go for regular breast screening and cervical smear tests, as recommended by your doctor. \n regularly check your breasts for any changes such as dimpling of the skin, changes in the \n\nnipple, or any lumps you can see or feel. \n \nDo not take DUAVIVE  \n\n- If you are allergic to conjugated estrogens, bazedoxifene or any of the other ingredients of \nthis medicine (listed in section 6).  \n\n- If you have or have ever had breast cancer, or if you are suspected of having it. \n- If you have or have had cancer which is sensitive to oestrogens, such as cancer of the \n\nwomb lining (endometrium), or if you are suspected of having it. \n- If you have recently had any unexplained vaginal bleeding. \n- If you have excessive thickening of the womb lining (endometrial hyperplasia) that is \n\nnot being treated. \n- If you have or have ever had a blood clot in a vein (thrombosis), such as in the legs \n\n(deep venous thrombosis), the lungs (pulmonary embolism) or eyes (retinal vein \nthrombosis). \n\n- If you have a blood clotting disorder (such as protein C, protein S, or antithrombin \ndeficiency). \n\n- If you have or recently have had a disease caused by blood clots in the arteries, such as a \nheart attack, stroke or angina.  \n\n- If you have or have ever had liver disease and your liver function tests have not returned \nto normal. \n\n- If you are pregnant or could still become pregnant or you are breast-feeding. \n- If you have a rare blood problem called porphyria, which is passed down in families \n\n(inherited).  \n \nIf you are not sure about any of the points above, talk to your doctor before taking this medicine.  \nIf any of the above conditions appear for the first time while taking this medicine, stop taking it at \nonce and consult your doctor immediately. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking this medicine if you have ever had any of the following problems, as \nthese may return or become worse during treatment with DUAVIVE. If so, you should see your doctor \nmore often for check-ups: \n\n fibroids inside your womb \n growth of womb lining outside your womb (endometriosis) or a history of excessive \n\ngrowth of the womb lining (endometrial hyperplasia) \n increased risk of developing blood clots [see “Blood clots in a vein (thrombosis)”] \n increased risk of getting a oestrogen-sensitive cancer (such as having a mother, sister or \n\ngrandmother who has had breast cancer)  \n high blood pressure \n a liver disorder, such as a benign liver tumour \n diabetes  \n gallstones  \n migraine or severe headaches \n a rare disease of the immune system that affects many organs of the body (systemic lupus \n\nerythematosus, SLE) \n seizures (epilepsy) \n\n\n\n32 \n\n asthma \n a disease affecting the eardrum and hearing (otosclerosis) \n a high level of fat in your blood (triglycerides) \n fluid retention due to cardiac or kidney problems \n\n \nStop taking DUAVIVE and see a doctor immediately \n \nIf you notice any of the following: \n\n any of the conditions mentioned under ‘Do not take DUAVIVE’ \n yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes (jaundice). These may be signs of a \n\nliver disease \n a large increase in your blood pressure (symptoms may be headache, tiredness, dizziness) \n migraine-like headaches which happen for the first time \n if you become pregnant \n you notice signs of a blood clot, such as painful swelling and redness of the legs, sudden \n\nchest pain, or difficulty in breathing. For more information, see ‘Blood clots in a vein \n(thrombosis)’ \n\n \nDUAVIVE and cancer  \n \nExcessive thickening of the lining of the womb (endometrial hyperplasia) and cancer of the lining \nof the womb (endometrial cancer) \nThis medicine contains conjugated oestrogens and bazedoxifene and is used to treat women with a \nuterus (womb). \n \nWhen you take DUAVIVE do not take additional oestrogens as this may increase the risk of \nendometrial hyperplasia. \n \nIf you have any unexpected vaginal bleeding, you must contact your doctor as soon as possible. \n \nBreast cancer  \nEvidence suggests that taking oestrogen-only HRT possibly increases the risk of breast cancer. The \nextra risk depends on how long you take HRT. The additional risk becomes clear within a few years. \nHowever, it returns to normal within a few years (at most 5) after stopping treatment. For women who \nare using oestrogen-only HRT for 5 years, little or no increase in breast cancer risk is shown. \n \nThe effect of DUAVIVE on the risk of breast cancer is unknown. \n \nRegularly check your breasts. See your doctor as soon as possible if you notice any changes, such \nas: \n\n dimpling of the skin \n changes in the nipple \n any lumps you can see or feel \n\n \nOvarian cancer \nOvarian cancer is rare-much rarer than breast cancer. The use of oestrogen-only HRT has been \nassociated with a slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer. \n \nThe risk of ovarian cancer varies with age. For example, in women aged 50 to 54 who are not taking \nHRT, about 2 women in 2,000 will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer over a 5-year period. For women \nwho have been taking HRT for 5 years, there will be about 3 cases per 2,000 users (i.e. about 1 extra \ncase). Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns.  \n \nThe effect of DUAVIVE on the risk of ovarian cancer is unknown. \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nDUAVIVE and your heart or circulation \n \nBlood clots in a vein (thrombosis) \nDUAVIVE may increase the risk of blood clots. \n \nOestrogen-only and bazedoxifene monotherapy increase the risk of blood clots in the veins (also called \ndeep vein thrombosis, or DVT), especially during the first year of taking these medicines.  \n \nBlood clots can be serious, and if one travels to the lungs, it can cause chest pain, breathlessness, \ncollapse or even death. \n \nSince you are more likely to get a blood clot in your veins as you get older and if any of the following \napplies to you, inform your doctor promptly: \n\n if you are unable to walk for a long time because of major surgery, injury or illness (see \nalso section 3, if you need to have surgery) \n\n if you are seriously overweight (BMI >30 kg/m2) \n if you have any blood clotting problem that needs long-term treatment with a medicine \n\nused to prevent blood clots \n if any of your close relatives has ever had a blood clot in the leg, lung or another organ \n if you have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). \n if you have cancer. \n\n \nIf any of these conditions apply to you, talk to your doctor before you take this medicine. \n \nHeart disease (heart attack) \nThere is no evidence that HRT will prevent a heart attack. Randomised controlled data found no \nincreased risk of coronary artery disease in hysterectomised women using oestrogen-only therapy.  \n \nStroke \nThe risk of having a stroke is about 1.5 times higher in HRT users than in non-users. The number of \nextra cases of stroke due to use of HRT will increase with age.  \n  \nFor women in their 50s who are not taking HRT, on average, 8 in 1,000 would be expected to have a \nstroke over a 5-year period. For women in their 50s who are taking HRT, there will be 11 cases in \n1,000 users, over 5 years (i.e., 3 extra cases). \n \nThe effect of DUAVIVE on the risk of stroke is unknown. \n \nOther things that can increase the risk of stroke include: \n\n getting older \n high blood pressure \n smoking \n drinking too much alcohol \n an irregular heartbeat \n\n \nIf you are having an operation  \n \nIf you are going to have surgery, tell the surgeon you are taking DUAVIVE. You may need to stop \ntaking DUAVIVE about 4 to 6 weeks before the operation, to reduce the risk of a blood clot (see \nBlood clots in a vein). Ask your doctor when you can start taking this medicine again. \n \nIn case of doubt, talk to your doctor before you take this medicine. \n \nOther conditions \n \nIf you have any of the following your doctor should monitor you: \n\n\n\n34 \n\n- kidney problems \n- pre-existing high level of fat in your blood (triglycerides) \n- liver problems \n- asthma \n- seizures (epilepsy) \n- migraine  \n- systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE – a rare disease of the immune system that affects \n\nmany organs of the body) \n- fluid retention \n\n \nOestrogen therapy will not prevent memory loss. There is some evidence of a higher risk of memory \nloss in women who start using oestrogen therapy after the age of 65. Speak to your doctor for advice. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nThis medicine is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old. \n \nOther medicines and DUAVIVE \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nSome medicines may interfere with the effect of DUAVIVE. This might lead to irregular bleeding. \nThis applies to the following medicines: \n\n Medicines for epilepsy (such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine); \n Medicines for tuberculosis (such as rifampicin, rifabutin); \n Medicines for HIV infection (such as nevirapine, efavirenz, ritonavir and nelfinavir); \n Herbal remedies containing St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n\nThis medicine is for use only by postmenopausal women. Do not take this medicine if you are \npregnant, or if you think you might be pregnant. Do not take this medicine if you are breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nDUAVIVE has a minor effect on the ability to drive or use machines. \n \nIf you feel drowsy after taking this medicine, you should avoid driving or operating machines.  \n \nThe bazedoxifene component of this medicine has been reported to cause problems with eyesight such \nas blurred vision. If this happens, you should avoid driving or operating machines until your doctor \ntells you that it is safe to do so. \n \nDUAVIVE contains lactose, sucrose, maltitol liquid, glucose and sorbitol \n \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore using this medicinal product. \nThis medicine contains 0.0088 mg sorbitol in each tablet. \n \n \n3. How to take DUAVIVE  \n \nYour doctor will aim to prescribe the lowest dose to treat your symptom for as short as necessary. \nSpeak to your doctor if you think this dose is too strong or not strong enough.  \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  \n \nThe recommended dose is one tablet once daily.  \nSwallow the tablet whole with a glass of water. \n \nYou can take the tablet at any time of the day, with or without food; however, it is advisable to take \nyour tablet at the same time each day as this will help to remind you to take your medicine. \n \nYou should continue taking this medicine for as long as your doctor tells you. In order for this \nmedicine to work, it should be taken daily as prescribed. \n \nIf you take more DUAVIVE than you should \n \nCall your doctor or pharmacist. \nIf you take too many tablets you may have nausea (feel sick) or vomit. You may experience breast \ntenderness, dizziness, abdominal pain, drowsiness/fatigue or experience a short period of vaginal \nbleeding.  \n \nIf you forget to take DUAVIVE \n \nIf you forget to take a tablet, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it is almost time to take \nyour next tablet, skip the tablet you missed and only take your next scheduled tablet. Do not take a \ndouble dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. \n \nIf you stop taking DUAVIVE \n \nIf you decide to stop taking this medicine before finishing the prescribed course of treatment, you \nshould talk to your doctor first. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
