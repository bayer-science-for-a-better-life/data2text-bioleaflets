This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information.  Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.  \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nOdefsey 200 mg/25 mg/25 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 200 mg of emtricitabine, rilpivirine hydrochloride equivalent to \n25 mg of rilpivirine and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate equivalent to 25 mg of tenofovir alafenamide. \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nEach tablet contains 189.8 mg lactose monohydrate. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nGrey, capsule-shaped, film-coated tablets, of dimensions 15 mm x 7 mm, debossed with “GSI” on one \nside of the tablet and “255” on the other side of the tablet. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nOdefsey is indicated for the treatment of adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older with body \nweight at least 35 kg) infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) without known \nmutations associated with resistance to the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) \nclass, tenofovir or emtricitabine and with a viral load ≤ 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL (see \nsections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, weighing at least 35 kg \nOne tablet to be taken once daily with food (see section 5.2). \n \nIf the patient misses a dose of Odefsey within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient \nshould take Odefsey with food as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule.  If a \npatient misses a dose of Odefsey by more than 12 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose \nand simply resume the usual dosing schedule. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nIf the patient vomits within 4 hours of taking Odefsey another tablet should be taken with food.  If a \npatient vomits more than 4 hours after taking Odefsey they do not need to take another dose of \nOdefsey until the next regularly scheduled dose. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment of Odefsey is required in elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Odefsey is required in adults or in adolescents (aged at least 12 years and of at \nleast 35 kg body weight) with estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/min.  Odefsey should be \ndiscontinued in patients with estimated CrCl that declines below 30 mL/min during treatment (see \nsection  5.2). \n \nNo dose adjustment of Odefsey is required in adults with end stage renal disease (estimated \nCrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis; however, Odefsey should generally be avoided but may \nbe used with caution in these patients if the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential \nrisks (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  On days of haemodialysis, Odefsey should be administered after \ncompletion of haemodialysis treatment. \n \nOdefsey should be avoided in patients with estimated CrCl ≥ 15 mL/min and < 30 mL/min, or \n< 15 mL/min who are not on chronic haemodialysis, as  the safety of Odefsey has not been established \nin these populations. \n \nNo data are available to make dose recommendations in children less than 18 years with end stage \nrenal disease. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Odefsey is required in patients with mild (Child Pugh Class A) or moderate \n(Child Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment.  Odefsey should be used with caution in patients with \nmoderate hepatic impairment.  Odefsey has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (Child Pugh Class C); therefore, Odefsey is not recommended for use in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Odefsey in children younger than 12 years of age, or weighing < 35 kg, \nhave not yet been established.  No data are available. \n \nPregnancy \nLower exposures of rilpivirine (one of the components of Odefsey) were observed during pregnancy; \ntherefore viral load should be monitored closely.  Alternatively, switching to another antiretroviral \nregimen could be considered (see sections 4.4, 4.6, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOdefsey should be taken orally, once daily with food (see section 5.2).  The film-coated tablet should \nnot be chewed, crushed or split. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nOdefsey should not be co-administered with medicinal products that can result in significant decreases \nin rilpivirine plasma concentrations (due to cytochrome P450 [CYP]3A enzyme induction or gastric \npH increase), which may result in loss of therapeutic effect of Odefsey (see section 4.5), including: \n \n• carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin \n• rifabutin, rifampicin, rifapentine \n\n\n\n4 \n\n• omeprazole, esomeprazole, dexlansoprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole \n• dexamethasone (oral and parenteral doses), except as a single dose treatment \n• St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nVirologic failure and development of resistance \n \nThere are insufficient data to justify the use in patients with prior NNRTI failure.  Resistance testing \nand/or historical resistance data should guide the use of Odefsey (see section 5.1). \n \nIn the pooled efficacy analysis from the two Phase 3 clinical studies in adults (C209 [ECHO] and \nC215 [THRIVE]) through 96 weeks, patients treated with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil \nfumarate + rilpivirine with a baseline viral load > 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL had a greater risk of \nvirologic failure (17.6% with rilpivirine versus 7.6% with efavirenz) compared to patients with a \nbaseline viral load ≤ 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL (5.9% with rilpivirine versus 2.4% with \nefavirenz).  The virologic failure rate in patients treated with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil \nfumarate + rilpivirine at Week 48 and Week 96 was 9.5% and 11.5% respectively, and 4.2% and 5.1% \nin the emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + efavirenz arm.  The difference in the rate of new \nvirologic failures from the Week 48 to Week 96 analysis between rilpivirine and efavirenz arms was \nnot statistically significant.  Patients with a baseline viral load > 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL who \nexperienced virologic failure exhibited a higher rate of treatment-emergent resistance to the NNRTI \nclass.  More patients who failed virologically on rilpivirine than who failed virologically on efavirenz \ndeveloped lamivudine/emtricitabine associated resistance (see section 5.1). \n \nFindings in adolescents (12 to less than 18 years of age) in Study C213 were generally in line with \nthese data (for details see section 5.1). \n \nOnly adolescents deemed likely to have good adherence to antiretroviral therapy should be treated \nwith rilpivirine, as suboptimal adherence can lead to development of resistance and the loss of future \ntreatment options. \n \nCardiovascular \n \nAt supratherapeutic doses (75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily), rilpivirine has been associated \nwith prolongation of the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG) (see sections 4.5 and 4.9).  \nRilpivirine at the recommended dose of 25 mg once daily is not associated with a clinically relevant \neffect on QTc.  Odefsey should be used with caution when co-administered with medicinal products \nwith a known risk of Torsade de Pointes. \n \nPatients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B or C virus \n \nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C treated with antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for \nsevere and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Odefsey in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) \nhave not been established. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is active against hepatitis B virus (HBV).  Discontinuation of Odefsey therapy \nin patients co-infected with HIV and HBV may be associated with severe acute exacerbations of \nhepatitis.  Patients co-infected with HIV and HBV who discontinue Odefsey should be closely \nmonitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping \ntreatment. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nLiver disease \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Odefsey in patients with significant underlying liver disorders have not \nbeen established. \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) and \nshould be monitored according to standard practice.  If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in \nsuch patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \n \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nMitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero \n \nNucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most \npronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine.  There have been reports of mitochondrial \ndysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these \nhave predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine.  The main adverse \nreactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders \n(hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia).  These events have often been transitory.  Late onset neurological \ndisorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour).  Whether such \nneurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown.  These findings should be \nconsidered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present with severe clinical \nfindings of unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings.  These findings do not affect current \nnational recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical \ntransmission of HIV. \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \n \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause \nserious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, such reactions have been observed \nwithin the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  Relevant examples include \ncytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis \njirovecii pneumonia.  Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when \nnecessary. \n \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nOpportunistic infections \n \nPatients receiving Odefsey may continue to develop opportunistic infections and other complications \nof HIV infection, and therefore should remain under close clinical observation by physicians \nexperienced in the treatment of patients with HIV associated diseases. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nOsteonecrosis \n \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART.  \nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint \nstiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nNephrotoxicity \n \nA potential risk of nephrotoxicity resulting from chronic exposure to low levels of tenofovir due to \ndosing with tenofovir alafenamide cannot be excluded (see section 5.3). \n \nPatients with end stage renal disease on chronic haemodialysis \n \nOdefsey should generally be avoided but may be used with caution in adults with end stage renal \ndisease (estimated CrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis if the potential benefits outweigh the \npotential risks (see section 4.2).  In a study of emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide in combination \nwith elvitegravir + cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet (E/C/F/TAF) in HIV-1 infected adults \nwith end stage renal disease (estimated CrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis, efficacy was \nmaintained through 48 weeks but emtricitabine exposure was significantly higher than in patients with \nnormal renal function.  Although there were no new safety issues identified, the implications of \nincreased emtricitabine exposure remain uncertain (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \n \nPregnancy \n \nLower exposures of rilpivirine were observed when rilpivirine 25 mg once daily was taken during \npregnancy.  In the Phase 3 studies (C209 and C215), lower rilpivirine exposure, similar to that seen \nduring pregnancy, has been associated with an increased risk of virological failure, therefore viral load \nshould be monitored closely (see sections 4.6, 5.1 and 5.2).  Alternatively, switching to another \nantiretroviral regimen could be considered. \n \nCo-administration of other medicinal products \n \nSome medicinal products should not be co-administered with Odefsey (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nOdefsey should not be co-administered with other antiretroviral medicinal products (see section 4.5). \n \nOdefsey should not be co-administered with other medicinal products containing tenofovir \nalafenamide, lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil or adefovir dipivoxil (see section 4.5). \n \nExcipients \n \nOdefsey contains lactose monohydrate.  Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal \nproduct. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nOdefsey is indicated for use as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and should not \nbe co-administered with other antiretroviral medicinal products.  Therefore, information regarding \ndrug-drug interactions with other antiretroviral medicinal products is not provided.  Interaction studies \nhave only been performed in adults. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nEmtricitabine \n \nIn vitro and clinical pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies have shown that the potential for \nCYP-mediated interactions involving emtricitabine with other medicinal products is low.  \nCo-administration of emtricitabine with medicinal products that are eliminated by active tubular \nsecretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, and/or the co-administered medicinal product.  \nMedicinal products that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of emtricitabine. \n \nRilpivirine \n \nRilpivirine is primarily metabolised by CYP3A.  Medicinal products that induce or inhibit CYP3A \nmay thus affect the clearance of rilpivirine (see section 5.2).  Rilpivirine inhibits P-glycoprotein (P-gp) \nin vitro (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] is 9.2 µM).  In a clinical study, rilpivirine did not \nsignificantly affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.  Additionally, in a clinical drug-drug interaction \nstudy with tenofovir alafenamide, which is more sensitive to intestinal P-gp inhibition, rilpivirine did \nnot affect tenofovir alafenamide exposures when administered concurrently, indicating that rilpivirine \nis not a P-gp inhibitor in vivo. \n \nRilpivirine is an in vitro inhibitor of the transporter MATE-2K with an IC50 of < 2.7 nM.  The clinical \nimplications of this finding are currently unknown. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is transported by P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP).  Medicinal \nproducts that affect P-gp and BCRP activity may lead to changes in tenofovir alafenamide absorption \n(see Table 1).  Medicinal products that induce P-gp activity (e.g., rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital) are expected to decrease the absorption of tenofovir alafenamide, resulting in decreased \nplasma concentration of tenofovir alafenamide, which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of \nOdefsey and development of resistance.  Co-administration of Odefsey with other medicinal products \nthat inhibit P-gp and BCRP activity (e.g., ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, \nvoriconazole, ciclosporin) is expected to increase the absorption and plasma concentration of tenofovir \nalafenamide.  Based on data from an in vitro study, co-administration of tenofovir alafenamide and \nxanthine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., febuxostat) is not expected to increase systemic exposure to tenofovir \nin vivo. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or \nCYP2D6 in vitro.  Tenofovir alafenamide is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A in vivo.  Tenofovir \nalafenamide is a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and OATP1B3 \nin vitro.  The distribution of tenofovir alafenamide in the body may be affected by the activity of \nOATP1B1 and OATP1B3. \n \nConcomitant use contraindicated \n \nCo-administration of Odefsey and medicinal products that induce CYP3A has been observed to \ndecrease the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine which could potentially lead to loss of virologic \nresponse to Odefsey (see section 4.3) and possible resistance to rilpivirine and to the NNRTI class. \n \nCo-administration of Odefsey with proton pump inhibitors has been observed to decrease the plasma \nconcentrations of rilpivirine (due to an increase in gastric pH) which could potentially lead to loss of \nvirologic response to Odefsey (see section 4.3) and possible resistance to rilpivirine and to the \nNNRTI class. \n \nConcomitant use where caution is recommended \n \nCYP enzyme inhibitors \nCo-administration of Odefsey with medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A enzyme activity has been \nobserved to increase rilpivirine plasma concentrations. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nQT prolonging medicinal products \nOdefsey should be used with caution when co-administered with a medicinal product with a known \nrisk of Torsade de Pointes (see section 4.4). \n \nOther interactions \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is not an inhibitor of human uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase \n(UGT) 1A1 in vitro.  It is not known whether emtricitabine, or tenofovir alafenamide are inhibitors of \nother UGT enzymes.  Emtricitabine did not inhibit the glucuronidation reaction of a non-specific UGT \nsubstrate in vitro. \n \nInteractions between Odefsey or its individual component(s) and co-administered medicinal products \nare listed in Table 1 below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓” and no change as “↔”). \n \nTable 1: Interactions between Odefsey or its individual component(s) and other medicinal \nproducts \n \n\nMedicinal product by therapeutic \nareas \n\nEffects on medicinal product \nlevels. \n\nMean percent change in AUC, \nCmax, Cmin \n\nRecommendation concerning \nco-administration with \n\nOdefsey \n\nANTI-INFECTIVES \nAntifungals \nKetoconazole (400 mg once daily)/ \nRilpivirine1 \n\nKetoconazole: \nAUC: ↓ 24% \nCmin: ↓ 66% \nCmax: ↔ \n \nRilpivirine: \nAUC: ↑ 49% \nCmin: ↑ 76% \nCmax: ↑ 30% \nInhibition of CYP3A \n \nExpected: \nTenofovir alafenamide: \nAUC: ↑ \nCmax: ↑ \nInhibition of P-gp \n \nInteraction not studied with \ntenofovir alafenamide.  \nCo-administration of ketoconazole \nis expected to increase plasma \nconcentrations of tenofovir \nalafenamide (inhibition of P-gp). \n\nCo-administration is not \nrecommended. \n\nFluconazole \nItraconazole \nPosaconazole \nVoriconazole \n\nInteraction not studied with any of \nthe components of Odefsey.  \nCo-administration of these \nantifungal agents is expected to \nincrease plasma concentrations of \nrilpivirine (inhibition of CYP3A) \nand tenofovir alafenamide \n(inhibition of P-gp). \n\nCo-administration is not \nrecommended. \n\n\n\n9 \n\nMedicinal product by therapeutic \nareas \n\nEffects on medicinal product \nlevels. \n\nMean percent change in AUC, \nCmax, Cmin \n\nRecommendation concerning \nco-administration with \n\nOdefsey \n\nAntimycobacterials \nRifampicin/ Rilpivirine Rifampicin: \n\nAUC: ↔ \nCmin: N/A \nCmax: ↔ \n \n25-desacetyl-rifampicin: \nAUC: ↓ 9% \nCmin: N/A \nCmax: ↔ \n \nRilpivirine: \nAUC: ↓ 80% \nCmin: ↓ 89% \nCmax: ↓ 69% \nInduction of CYP3A \n \nExpected: \nTenofovir alafenamide: \nAUC: ↓ \nCmax: ↓ \nInduction of P-gp \n \nInteraction not studied with \ntenofovir alafenamide.  \nCo-administration is likely to cause \nsignificant decreases in the plasma \nconcentrations of tenofovir \nalafenamide (induction of P-gp). \n\nCo-administration is \ncontraindicated. \n\nRifapentine Interaction not studied with any of \nthe components of Odefsey.  \nCo-administration is likely to cause \nsignificant decreases in the plasma \nconcentrations of rilpivirine \n(induction of CYP3A) and \ntenofovir alafenamide (induction of \nP-gp). \n\nCo-administration is \ncontraindicated. \n\n\n\n10 \n\nMedicinal product by therapeutic \nareas \n\nEffects on medicinal product \nlevels. \n\nMean percent change in AUC, \nCmax, Cmin \n\nRecommendation concerning \nco-administration with \n\nOdefsey \n\nRifabutin (300 mg once daily)/ \nRilpivirine1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRifabutin (300 mg once daily)/ \nRilpivirine \n\nRifabutin: \nAUC: ↔ \nCmin: ↔ \nCmax: ↔ \n \n25-O-desacetyl-rifabutin: \nAUC: ↔ \nCmin: ↔ \nCmax: ↔ \n \nRilpivirine: \nAUC: ↓ 42% \nCmin: ↓ 48% \nCmax: ↓ 31% \nInduction of CYP3A \n \nExpected: \nTenofovir alafenamide: \nAUC: ↓ \nCmax: ↓  \nInduction of P-gp \n \nInteraction not studied with \ntenofovir alafenamide.  \nCo-administration is likely to cause \nsignificant decreases in the plasma \nconcentrations of tenofovir \nalafenamide (induction of P-gp). \n\nCo-administration is \ncontraindicated. \n\nMacrolide antibiotics \nClarithromycin \nErythromycin \n\nInteraction not studied with any of \nthe components of Odefsey.

A moderate amount of data on pregnant women (between 300-1,000 \npregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or foetal/neonatal toxicity of rilpivirine (see \nsections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).  Lower exposures of rilpivirine were observed during pregnancy; therefore \nviral load should be monitored closely.  A large amount of data on pregnant women (more than \n1,000 exposed outcomes) indicate no malformative nor foetal/neonatal toxicity associated with \nemtricitabine. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3) with the components of Odefsey. \n \nOdefsey should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the \nfoetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nEmtricitabine is excreted in human milk.  It is not known whether rilpivirine or tenofovir alafenamide \nare excreted in human milk.  In animal studies it has been shown that tenofovir is excreted in milk.  \nRilpivirine is excreted in the milk of rats. \n \nThere is insufficient information on the effects of all the components of Odefsey in newborns/infants. \n \nBecause of both the potential for HIV transmission and the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed \ninfants, women should be instructed not to breast-feed if they are receiving Odefsey. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of Odefsey on fertility are available.  Animal studies do not indicate \nharmful effects of emtricitabine, rilpivirine hydrochloride or tenofovir alafenamide on fertility (see \nsection 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients should be informed that fatigue, dizziness and somnolence have been reported during \ntreatment with the components of Odefsey (see section 4.8).  This should be considered when \nassessing a patient’s ability to drive or operate machinery. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions in clinical studies of treatment-naïve patients taking \nemtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide in combination with elvitegravir + cobicistat were nausea \n(11%), diarrhoea (7%), and headache (6%).  The most frequently reported adverse reactions in clinical \nstudies of treatment-naïve patients taking rilpivirine hydrochloride in combination with \nemtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were nausea (9%), dizziness (8%), abnormal dreams \n(8%), headache (6%), diarrhoea (5%) and insomnia (5%). \n \nNo new adverse reactions were identified through Week 96 in 2 clinical studies of virologically \nsuppressed patients who switched from emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate \n(FTC/RPV/TDF) to Odefsey (Study GS-US-366-1216) or from efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir \ndisoproxil fumarate (EFV/FTC/TDF) to Odefsey (Study GS-US-366-1160). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on safety data from across all Phase 2 and 3 studies in which \n2,396 patients received emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide given with elvitegravir + cobicistat as a \nfixed-dose combination tablet, pooled data from 686 patients who received rilpivirine 25 mg once \ndaily in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products in the controlled studies \nTMC278-C209 and TMC278-C215, 754 patients who received Odefsey in Studies GS-US-366-1216 \nand GS-US-366-1160, and post-marketing experience. \n \nThe adverse reactions in Table 2 are listed by system organ class and highest frequency observed.  \nFrequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) or uncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100). \n \nTable 2: Tabulated list of adverse reactions \n \n\nFrequency Adverse reaction \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nCommon: decreased white blood cell count\n1, decreased haemoglobin1, decreased \n\nplatelet count1 \nUncommon: anaemia2 \nImmune system disorders \nUncommon: immune reactivation syndrome1 \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nVery common: increased total cholesterol (fasted)1, increased LDL-cholesterol (fasted)1 \nCommon: decreased appetite1, increased triglycerides (fasted)1 \nPsychiatric disorders \nVery common: insomnia1 \nCommon: depression1, abnormal dreams1, 3, sleep disorders1, depressed mood1 \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: headache1, 3, dizziness1, 3 \nCommon: somnolence1 \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common: nausea1, 3, increased pancreatic amylase1 \n\nCommon: abdominal pain\n1, 3, vomiting1, 3, increased lipase1, abdominal discomfort1, dry \n\nmouth1, flatulence3, diarrhoea3 \nUncommon: dyspepsia3 \nHepatobiliary disorders \nVery common: increased transaminases (AST and/or ALT)1 \nCommon: increased bilirubin1 \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: rash1, 3 \n\nUncommon: severe skin reactions with systemic symptoms\n4, angioedema5, 6, pruritus3, \n\nurticaria6 \n\n\n\n18 \n\nFrequency Adverse reaction \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nUncommon: arthralgia3 \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon: fatigue1, 3 \n\n1 Adverse reactions identified from rilpivirine clinical studies. \n2 This adverse reaction was not observed in the Phase 3 studies of emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide in combination \n\nwith elvitegravir + cobicistat or in the Phase 3 studies with Odefsey but identified from clinical studies or post-marketing \nexperience of emtricitabine when used with other antiretrovirals. \n\n3 Adverse reactions identified from clinical studies of emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide-containing products. \n4 Adverse reaction identified through post-marketing surveillance of emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir disoproxil \n\nfumarate. \n5 Adverse reaction identified through post-marketing surveillance for emtricitabine-containing products.  \n6 Adverse reaction identified through post-marketing surveillance for tenofovir alafenamide-containing products. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \n \nChanges in serum creatinine for rilpivirine-containing regimens \nThe pooled data from the Phase 3 TMC278-C209 and TMC278-C215 studies of treatment-naïve \npatients also demonstrate that serum creatinine increased and estimated glomerular filtration rate \n(eGFR) decreased over 96 weeks of treatment with rilpivirine.  Most of this increase in creatinine and \ndecrease in eGFR occurred within the first four weeks of treatment.  Over 96 weeks of treatment with \nrilpivirine mean changes of 0.1 mg/dL (range: -0.3 mg/dL to 0.6 mg/dL) for creatinine \nand -13.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 (range: -63.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 to 40.1 mL/min/1.73 m2) for eGFR were \nobserved.  In patients who entered the studies with mild or moderate renal impairment, the serum \ncreatinine increase observed was similar to that seen in patients with normal renal function.  These \nincreases do not reflect a change in actual glomerular filtration rate (GFR). \n \nChanges in lipid laboratory tests \nIn studies in treatment-naïve patients receiving emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide (FTC + TAF) or \nemtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC + TDF), both given with elvitegravir + cobicistat \nas a fixed-dose combination tablet, increases from baseline were observed in both treatment groups for \nthe fasting lipid parameters total cholesterol, direct low-density lipoprotein (LDL)- and high-density \nlipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, and triglycerides at Week 144.  The median increase from baseline for \nthese parameters was greater in patients receiving FTC + TAF compared with patients receiving \nFTC + TDF (p < 0.001 for the difference between treatment groups for fasting total cholesterol, direct \nLDL- and HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides).  Median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline at Week 144 \nin total cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol ratio was 0.2 (-0.3, 0.7) in patients receiving FTC + TAF and \n0.1 (-0.4, 0.6) in patients receiving FTC + TDF (p = 0.006 for the difference between treatment \ngroups). \n \nSwitching from a TDF-based regimen to Odefsey may lead to slight increases in lipid parameters.  In a \nstudy of virologically suppressed patients switching from FTC/RPV/TDF to Odefsey (Study \nGS-US-366-1216), increases from baseline were observed in fasting values of total cholesterol, direct \nLDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides in the Odefsey arm; and no clinically relevant \nchanges from baseline in median fasting values for total cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol ratio were \nobserved in either treatment arm at Week 96.  In a study of virologically suppressed patients switching \nfrom EFV/FTC/TDF to Odefsey (Study GS-US-366-1160), decreases from baseline were observed in \nthe fasting values of total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol in the Odefsey arm; no clinically relevant \nchanges from baseline in median fasting values for total cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol ratio, direct \nLDL-cholesterol or triglycerides were observed in either treatment arm at Week 96. \n \nCortisol \nIn the pooled Phase 3 TMC278-C209 and TMC278-C215 studies of treatment-naïve patients, at \nWeek 96, there was an overall mean change from baseline in basal cortisol of -19.1 \n(-30.85; -7.37) nmol/L in the rilpivirine arm and of -0.6 (-13.29; 12.17) nmol/L in the efavirenz arm.  \nAt Week 96, the mean change from baseline in ACTH-stimulated cortisol levels was lower in the \nrilpivirine arm (+18.4 ± 8.36 nmol/L) than in the efavirenz arm (+54.1 ± 7.24 nmol/L).  Mean values \nfor the rilpivirine arm for both basal and ACTH-stimulated cortisol at Week 96 were within the normal \n\n\n\n19 \n\nrange.  These changes in adrenal safety parameters were not clinically relevant.  There were no clinical \nsigns or symptoms suggestive of adrenal or gonadal dysfunction in adults. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise.  Autoimmune \ndisorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the \nreported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of \ntreatment (see section 4.4). \n \nOsteonecrosis \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART.  The frequency of this is unknown \n(see section 4.4). \n \nSevere skin reactions \nSevere skin reactions with systemic symptoms have been reported during post-marketing experience \nof emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate including rashes accompanied by fever, \nblisters, conjunctivitis, angioedema, elevated liver function tests, and/or eosinophilia. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety of emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide was evaluated through 48 weeks in an open-label \nclinical study (GS-US-292-0106) in which 50 HIV-1 infected, treatment-naïve paediatric patients aged \n12 to < 18 years received emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide in combination with \nelvitegravir + cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet.  In this study, the safety profile in \nadolescent patients was similar to that in adults (see section 5.1). \n \nThe safety assessment of rilpivirine is based on Week 48 data from one single-arm open-label study \n(TMC278-C213) in 36 paediatric patients 12 to < 18 years and weighing at least 32 kg.  No patients \ndiscontinued rilpivirine due to adverse reactions.  No new adverse reactions were identified compared \nto those seen in adults.  Most adverse reactions were Grade 1 or 2.  Adverse reactions (all grades) of \nvery common frequency were headache, depression, somnolence and nausea.  No Grade 3-4 \nlaboratory abnormalities for AST/ALT or Grade 3-4 adverse reactions of transaminase increased were \nreported (see section 5.1). \n \nOther special populations \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nThe safety of emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide was evaluated through 144 weeks in an open-label \nclinical study (GS-US-292-0112), in which 248 HIV-1 infected patients who were either \ntreatment-naïve (n = 6) or virologically suppressed (n = 242) with mild to moderate renal impairment \n(estimated glomerular filtration rate by Cockcroft-Gault method [eGFRCG]: 30-69 mL/min) received \nemtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide in combination with elvitegravir + cobicistat as a fixed-dose \ncombination tablet.  The safety profile in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment was similar \nto that in patients with normal renal function (see section 5.1). \n \nThe safety of emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide was evaluated through 48 weeks in a single arm, \nopen-label clinical study (GS-US-292-1825) in which 55 virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected \npatients with end stage renal disease (eGFRCG < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis received \nemtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide in combination with elvitegravir + cobicistat as a fixed-dose \n\n\n\n20 \n\ncombination tablet.  There were no new safety issues identified in patients with end stage renal disease \non chronic haemodialysis receiving emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide, given with elvitegravir + \ncobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet (see section 5.2). \n \nPatients co-infected with HIV and HBV \nThe safety of emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide in combination with elvitegravir and cobicistat as \na fixed-dose combination tablet (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide \n[E/C/F/TAF]) was evaluated in 72 HIV/HBV co-infected patients receiving treatment for HIV in an \nopen-label clinical study (GS-US-292-1249), through Week 48, in which patients were switched from \nanother antiretroviral regimen (which included TDF in 69 of 72 patients) to E/C/F/TAF.  Based on \nthese limited data, the safety profile of emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide in combination with \nelvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet, in patients with HIV/HBV co-infection, \nwas similar to that in patients with HIV-1 monoinfection. \n \nIn patients co-infected with hepatitis B or C virus receiving rilpivirine, the incidence of hepatic \nenzyme elevation was higher than in patients receiving rilpivirine who were not co-infected.  The \npharmacokinetic exposure of rilpivirine in co-infected patients was comparable to that in patients \nwithout co-infection. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIf overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8), and \nstandard supportive treatment applied as necessary including observation of the clinical status of the \npatient and monitoring of vital signs and ECG (QT interval). \n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with Odefsey.  Up to 30% of the emtricitabine dose can be \nremoved by haemodialysis.  Tenofovir is efficiently removed by haemodialysis with an extraction \ncoefficient of approximately 54%.  It is not known whether emtricitabine or tenofovir can be removed \nby peritoneal dialysis.  Since rilpivirine is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to result in \nsignificant removal of the active substance.  Further management should be as clinically indicated or \nas recommended by the national poisons centre, where available. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use; antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, \ncombinations, ATC code: J05AR19 \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \n \nEmtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and analogue of 2’-deoxycytidine.  \nEmtricitabine is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine triphosphate.  Emtricitabine \ntriphosphate competitively inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), resulting in deoxyribonucleic \nacid (DNA) chain termination.  Emtricitabine has activity against HIV-1, HIV-2, and HBV. \n \nRilpivirine is a diarylpyrimidine NNRTI of HIV-1.  Rilpivirine activity is mediated by \nnon-competitive inhibition of HIV-1 RT.  Rilpivirine does not inhibit the human cellular DNA \npolymerases α, β and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n21 \n\n \nTenofovir alafenamide is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) and prodrug of tenofovir \n(2’-deoxyadenosine monophosphate analogue).  Due to increased plasma stability and intracellular \nactivation through hydrolysis by cathepsin A, tenofovir alafenamide is more efficient than tenofovir \ndisoproxil fumarate in loading tenofovir into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (including \nlymphocytes and other HIV target cells) and macrophages.  Intracellular tenofovir is subsequently \nphosphorylated to the active metabolite tenofovir diphosphate.  Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits \nHIV RT, resulting in DNA chain termination.  Tenofovir has activity against HIV-1, HIV-2 and HBV. \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro \n \nThe combinations of emtricitabine, rilpivirine, and tenofovir alafenamide were not antagonistic and \nshowed synergistic effects with each other in cell culture combination antiviral activity assays. \n \nThe antiviral activity of emtricitabine against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in \nlymphoblastoid cell lines, the MAGI CCR5 cell line, and PBMCs.  The 50% effective concentration \n(EC50) values for emtricitabine were in the range of 0.0013 to 0.64 µM.  Emtricitabine displayed \nantiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 subtype A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (EC50 values ranged \nfrom 0.007 to 0.075 µM) and showed activity against HIV-2 (EC50 values ranged from 0.007 to \n1.5 µM). \n \nRilpivirine exhibited activity against laboratory strains of wild-type HIV-1 in an acutely infected \nT-cell line with a median EC50 value for HIV-1/IIIB of 0.73 nM (0.27 ng/mL).  Rilpivirine also \ndemonstrated antiviral activity against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M (subtype A, B, C, D, F, G, H) \nprimary isolates with EC50 values ranging from 0.07 to 1.01 nM (0.03 to 0.37 ng/mL), group O \nprimary isolates with EC50 values ranging from 2.88 to 8.45 nM (1.06 to 3.10 ng/mL), and showed \nlimited in vitro activity against HIV-2 with EC50 values ranging from 2,510 to 10,830 nM (920 to \n3,970 ng/mL). \n \nThe antiviral activity of tenofovir alafenamide against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 \nsubtype B was assessed in lymphoblastoid cell lines, PBMCs, primary monocyte/macrophage cells, \nand CD4+ T-lymphocytes.  The EC50 values for tenofovir alafenamide were in the range of 2.0 to \n14.7 nM.  Tenofovir alafenamide displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against all HIV-1 groups \n(M, N, O), including subtypes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (EC50 values ranged from 0.10 to 12.0 nM) and \nshowed activity against HIV-2 (EC50 values ranged from 0.91 to 2.63 nM). \n \nResistance \n \nConsidering all of the available in vitro data and data generated in treatment-naïve patients, the \nfollowing resistance-associated mutations in HIV-1 RT, when present at baseline, may affect the \nactivity of Odefsey: K65R, K70E, K101E, K101P, E138A, E138G, E138K, E138Q, E138R, V179L, \nY181C, Y181I, Y181V, M184I, M184V, Y188L, H221Y, F227C, M230I, M230L and the \ncombination of L100I and K103N. \n \nA negative impact by NNRTI mutations other than those listed above (e.g., mutations K103N or L100I \nas single mutations) cannot be excluded, since this was not studied in vivo in a sufficient number of \npatients. \n \nAs with other antiretroviral medicinal products, resistance testing and/or historical resistance data \nshould guide the use of Odefsey (see section 4.4). \n \nIn vitro \nReduced susceptibility to emtricitabine is associated with M184V/I mutations in HIV-1 RT. \n \nRilpivirine-resistant strains were selected in cell culture starting from wild-type HIV-1 of different \norigins and subtypes as well as NNRTI-resistant HIV-1.  The most commonly observed amino acid \n\n\n\n22 \n\nsubstitutions that emerged included: L100I, K101E, V108I, E138K, V179F, Y181C, H221Y, F227C, \nand M230I. \n \nHIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir alafenamide expressed a K65R mutation in \nHIV-1 RT; in addition, a K70E mutation in HIV-1 RT has been transiently observed. \n \nIn treatment-naïve adult patients \nIn the Week 144 pooled analysis of antiretroviral-naïve patients receiving \nelvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) in the Phase 3 studies \nGS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111, the development of one or more primary \nresistance-associated mutations was observed in HIV-1 isolates from 12 of 866 (1.4%) patients treated \nwith E/C/F/TAF.  Among these 12 HIV-1 isolates, the mutations that emerged were M184V/I (n = 11) \nand K65R/N (n = 2) in RT and T66T/A/I/V (n = 2), E92Q (n = 4), Q148Q/R (n = 1), and N155H \n(n = 2) in integrase. \n \nIn the Week 96 pooled analysis for patients receiving emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate \n(FTC/TDF) + rilpivirine hydrochloride in the Phase 3 clinical studies TMC278-C209 and \nTMC278-C215, HIV-1 isolates from 43 patients had an amino acid substitution associated with \nNNRTI (n = 39) or NRTI (n = 41) resistance.  The NNRTI resistance-associated mutations that \ndeveloped most commonly were: V90I, K101E, E138K/Q, V179I, Y181C, V189I, H221Y and F227C.  \nThe presence of V90I and V189I at baseline did not affect the response.  Fifty-two percent of HIV-1 \nisolates with emergent resistance in the rilpivirine arm developed concomitant NNRTI and NRTI \nmutations, most frequently E138K and M184V.  The mutations associated with NRTI resistance that \ndeveloped in 3 or more patient isolates were: K65R, K70E, M184V/I and K219E. \n \nThrough Week 96, fewer patients in the rilpivirine arm with baseline viral load ≤ 100,000 copies/mL \nhad emerging resistance-associated substitutions and/or phenotypic resistance to rilpivirine (7/288) \nthan patients with baseline viral load > 100,000 copies/mL (30/262).  \n \nIn virologically suppressed patients \nOne patient with emergent resistance (M184M/I) was identified in a clinical study of virologically \nsuppressed patients who switched from a regimen containing emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil \nfumarate to E/C/F/TAF in a fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet (GS-US-292-0109, n = 959). \n \nThrough Week 96, in patients who switched to Odefsey from emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir \ndisoproxil fumarate (FTC/RPV/TDF) or efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate \n(EFV/FTC/TDF) (Studies GS-US-366-1216 and GS-US-366-1160; n = 754), no treatment-emergent \nresistance-associated mutations were detected.  \n \nIn patients co-infected with HIV and HBV \nIn a clinical study of HIV virologically suppressed patients co-infected with chronic hepatitis B, who \nreceived E/C/F/TAF for 48 weeks (GS-US-292-1249, n = 72), 2 patients qualified for resistance \nanalysis.  In these 2 patients, no amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to any of the \ncomponents of E/C/F/TAF were identified in HIV-1 or HBV. \n \nCross-resistance \n \nEmtricitabine-resistant viruses with the M184V/I substitution were cross-resistant to lamivudine, but \nretained sensitivity to didanosine, stavudine, tenofovir, and zidovudine. \n \nIn a panel of 67 HIV-1 recombinant laboratory strains with one resistance-associated mutation at RT \npositions associated with NNRTI resistance, the only single resistance-associated mutations associated \nwith a loss of susceptibility to rilpivirine were K101P and Y181V/I.  The K103N substitution alone \ndid not result in reduced susceptibility to rilpivirine, but the combination of K103N and L100I resulted \nin a 7-fold reduced susceptibility to rilpivirine.  In another study, the Y188L substitution resulted in a \nreduced susceptibility to rilpivirine of 9-fold for clinical isolates and 6-fold for site-directed mutants. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nIn patients receiving rilpivirine hydrochloride in combination with FTC/TDF in Phase 3 studies \n(TMC278-C209 and TMC278-C215 pooled data), most HIV-1 isolates with emergent phenotypic \nresistance to rilpivirine had cross-resistance to at least one other NNRTI (28/31).  \n \nThe K65R and also the K70E substitution result in reduced susceptibility to abacavir, didanosine, \nlamivudine, emtricitabine, and tenofovir, but retain sensitivity to zidovudine. \n \nClinical data \n \nClinical efficacy of Odefsey was established from studies conducted with emtricitabine + tenofovir \nalafenamide when given with elvitegravir + cobicistat as an E/C/F/TAF FDC tablet, from studies \nconducted with rilpivirine when given with FTC/TDF as individual components or as a \nFTC/RPV/TDF FDC tablet, and from studies conducted with Odefsey. \n \nEmtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide containing regimens \nTreatment-naïve and virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected adult patients \nIn Study GS-US-292-0104 and Study GS-US-292-0111, patients received either E/C/F/TAF (n = 866) \nor elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (E/C/F/TDF) (n = 867) once \ndaily, both given as FDC tablets. \n \nThe mean age was 36 years (range 18-76), 85% were male, 57% were White, 25% were Black, and \n10% were Asian.  The mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.5 log10 copies/mL (range 1.3-7.0) and \n23% of patients had baseline viral loads > 100,000 copies/mL.  The mean baseline CD4+ cell count \nwas 427 cells/mm3 (range 0-1,360) and 13% had CD4+ cell counts < 200 cells/mm3. \n \nIn Studies GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111, E/C/F/TAF demonstrated statistical superiority in \nachieving HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL when compared to E/C/F/TDF at Week 144.  The difference in \npercentage was 4.2% (95% CI: 0.6% to 7.8%).  Pooled treatment outcomes at 48 and 144 weeks are \nshown in Table 3. \n \nIn Study GS-US-292-0109, the efficacy and safety of switching from either EFV/FTC/TDF, FTC/TDF \nplus atazanavir (boosted by either cobicistat or ritonavir), or E/C/F/TDF to E/C/F/TAF FDC tablet \nwere evaluated in a randomised, open-label study of virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA \n< 50 copies/mL) HIV-1 infected adults (n = 959 switching to E/C/F/TAF, n = 477 Stayed on Baseline \nRegimen [SBR]).  Patients had a mean age of 41 years (range 21-77), 89% were male, 67% were \nWhite, and 19% were Black.  The mean baseline CD4+ cell count was 697 cells/mm3 (range \n79-1,951). \n \nIn Study GS-US-292-0109, switching from a tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-based regimen to \nE/C/F/TAF was superior in maintaining HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL compared to staying on the \nbaseline regimen.

In Study GS-US-366-1160, the mean change from baseline in CD4+ cell count at \nWeek 96 was 12 cells/mm3 in patients who switched to Odefsey and 6 cells/mm3 in those who stayed \non EFV/FTC/TDF. \n \nHIV-1 infected adult patients with mild to moderate renal impairment \nIn Study GS-US-292-0112, the efficacy and safety of E/C/F/TAF FDC tablet were evaluated in an \nopen-label clinical study of 242 HIV-1 infected, virologically suppressed patients with mild to \nmoderate renal impairment (eGFRCG: 30-69 mL/min).  \n \nThe mean age was 58 years (range 24-82), with 63 patients (26%) who were ≥ 65 years of age.  \nSeventy-nine percent were male, 63% were White, 18% were Black, and 14% were Asian.  Thirty-five \npercent of patients were on a treatment regimen that did not contain tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.  At \n\n\n\n28 \n\nbaseline, median eGFRCG was 56 mL/min, and 33% of patients had an eGFRCG from 30 to 49 mL/min.  \nThe mean baseline CD4+ cell count was 664 cells/mm3 (range 126-1,813). \n \nAt Week 144, 83.1% (197/237 patients) maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL after switching to \nE/C/F/TAF FDC tablet. \n \nIn Study GS-US-292-1825, the efficacy and safety of E/C/F/TAF were evaluated in a single arm, \nopen-label clinical study in which 55 HIV-1 infected adults with end stage renal disease \n(eGFRCG < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis for at least 6 months before switching to E/C/F/TAF \nFDC tablet.  Patients were virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) for at least \n6 months before switching. \n \nThe mean age was 48 years (range 23-64).  Seventy-six percent were male, 82% were Black and 18% \nwere White.  Fifteen percent of patients identified as Hispanic/Latino.  The mean baseline CD4+ cell \ncount was 545 cells/mm3 (range 205-1473).  At Week 48, 81.8% (45/55 patients) maintained HIV-1 \nRNA < 50 copies/mL after switching to E/C/F/TAF.  There were no clinically significant changes in \nfasting lipid laboratory tests in patients who switched. \n \nPatients co-infected with HIV and HBV \nIn open-label Study GS-US-292-1249, the efficacy and safety of E/C/F/TAF were evaluated in adult \npatients co-infected with HIV-1 and chronic hepatitis B.  Sixty-nine of the 72 patients were on prior \nTDF-containing antiretroviral therapy.  At the start of treatment with E/C/F/TAF, the 72 patients had \nbeen HIV suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) for at least 6 months with or without suppression \nof HBV DNA and had compensated liver function.  The mean age was 50 years (range 28-67), 92% of \npatients were male, 69% were White, 18% were Black, and 10% were Asian.  The mean baseline \nCD4+ cell count was 636 cells/mm3 (range 263-1,498).  Eighty-six percent of patients (62/72) were \nHBV suppressed (HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL) and 42% (30/72) were HBeAg positive at baseline. \n \nOf the patients who were HBeAg positive at baseline, 1/30 (3.3%) achieved seroconversion to \nanti-HBe at Week 48.  Of the patients who were HBsAg positive at baseline, 3/70 (4.3%) achieved \nseroconversion to anti-HBs at Week 48. \n \nAt Week 48, 92% of patients (66/72) maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL after switching to \nE/C/F/TAF.  The mean change from baseline in CD4+ cell count at Week 48 was -2 cells/mm3.  \nNinety-two percent (66/72 patients) had HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL using missing = failure analysis at \nWeek 48.  Of the 62 patients who were HBV suppressed at baseline, 59 remained suppressed and \n3 had missing data.  Of the 10 patients who were not HBV suppressed at baseline \n(HBV DNA ≥ 29 IU/mL), 7 became suppressed, 2 remained detectable, and 1 had missing data.  \nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalisation was achieved in 40% (4/10) of subjects with ALT \ngreater than upper limit of normal (ULN) at baseline. \n \nThere are limited clinical data on the use of E/C/F/TAF in HIV/HBV co-infected patients who are \ntreatment-naïve. \n \nChanges in measures of bone mineral density \nIn studies in treatment-naïve adult patients, E/C/F/TAF was associated with smaller reductions in bone \nmineral density (BMD) compared to E/C/F/TDF through 144 weeks of treatment as measured by dual \nenergy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) analysis of hip (mean change: -0.8% versus -3.4%, p < 0.001) \nand lumbar spine (mean change: -0.9% versus -3.0%, p < 0.001). \n \nSmall improvements in BMD were noted at 48 weeks after switching to E/C/F/TAF compared to \nmaintaining the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-containing regimen. \n \nIn Odefsey studies in virologically suppressed adult patients, increases in BMD were noted at \n96 weeks after switching to Odefsey compared to minimal changes with maintaining FTC/RPV/TDF \nor EFV/FTC/TDF at the hip (mean change 1.6% for Odefsey versus -0.6% for FTC/RPV/TDF, \np < 0.001; 1.8% for Odefsey versus -0.6% for EFV/FTC/TDF, p < 0.001) and the spine (mean change \n\n\n\n29 \n\n2.0% for Odefsey versus -0.3% for FTC/RPV/TDF, p < 0.001; 1.7% for Odefsey versus 0.1% for \nEFV/FTC/TDF, p < 0.001). \n \nChanges in measures of renal function \nIn studies in treatment-naïve adult patients, E/C/F/TAF was associated with lower impact on renal \nsafety parameters (as measured after 144 weeks treatment by eGFRCG and urine protein to creatinine \nratio [UPCR] and after 96 weeks treatment by urine albumin to creatinine ratio [UACR]) compared to \nE/C/F/TDF.  Through 144 weeks of treatment, no subject discontinued E/C/F/TAF due to a \ntreatment-emergent renal adverse event compared with 12 subjects who discontinued E/C/F/TDF \n(p < 0.001).  In studies in virologically suppressed adult patients, through 96 weeks of treatment there \nwere minimal changes or decreases in albuminuria (UACR) in patients receiving Odefsey compared \nwith increases from baseline in patients who stayed on FTC/RPV/TDF or EFV/FTC/TDF.  See also \nsection 4.4. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nEmtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide regimen \nIn Study GS-US-292-0106, the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of E/C/F/TAF FDC tablet were \nevaluated in an open-label study of 50 HIV-1 infected, treatment-naïve adolescents.  Patients had a \nmean age of 15 years (range 12-17), were 56% female, 12% Asian, and 88% Black.  At baseline, \nmedian plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.7 log10 copies/mL, median CD4+ cell count was 456 cells/mm3 \n(range 95 to 1,110), and median CD4+% was 23% (range 7-45).  Overall, 22% had baseline plasma \nHIV-1 RNA > 100,000 copies/mL. \n \nAt 48 weeks, 92% (46/50) achieved HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL, similar to response rates in studies \nof treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults.  No emergent resistance to E/C/F/TAF was detected through \nWeek 48. \n \nRilpivirine-containing regimen \nThe pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and efficacy of rilpivirine 25 mg once daily, in combination \nwith an investigator-selected BR containing two NRTIs, were evaluated in Study TMC278-C213, a \nsingle-arm, open-label Phase 2 study in antiretroviral-naïve HIV-1 infected paediatric patients 12 to \n< 18 years of age and weighing at least 32 kg.  The median duration of exposure for patients was \n63.5 weeks. \n \nThirty-six patients had a median age of 14.5 years and were 55.6% female, 88.9% Black, and 11.1% \nAsian.  The median baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.8 log10 copies/mL, and the median baseline \nCD4+ cell count was 414 cells/mm3.  The proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at \nWeek 48 (TLOVR) was 72.2% (26/36).  The combination of NRTIs most frequently used together \nwith rilpivirine was FTC/TDF (24 subjects [66.7%]). \n \nThe proportion of responders was higher in subjects with a baseline viral load ≤ 100,000 copies/mL \n(78.6%, 22/28) as compared to those with a baseline viral load > 100,000 copies/mL (50.0%, 4/8).  \nThe proportion of virologic failures was 22.2% (8/36). \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nOdefsey in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of human HIV-1 infection \n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nPregnancy \n \nRilpivirine (one of the components of Odefsey) in combination with a background regimen was \nevaluated in Study TMC114HIV3015 in 19 pregnant women during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters, and \npostpartum.  The pharmacokinetic data demonstrate that total exposure (AUC) to rilpivirine as a part \nof an antiretroviral regimen was approximately 30% lower during pregnancy compared with \npostpartum (6-12 weeks).  The virologic response was generally preserved throughout the study: of the \n12 patients that completed the study, 10 patients were suppressed at the end of the study; in the other \n\n\n\n30 \n\n2 patients an increase in viral load was observed only postpartum, for at least 1 patient due to \nsuspected suboptimal adherence.  No mother to child transmission occurred in all 10 infants born to \nthe mothers who completed the study and for whom the HIV status was available.  Rilpivirine was \nwell tolerated during pregnancy and postpartum.  There were no new safety findings compared with \nthe known safety profile of rilpivirine in HIV-1 infected adults (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nOdefsey: Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide exposures were bioequivalent when comparing one \nOdefsey 200/25/25 mg film-coated tablet to elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide \n(150/150/200/10 mg) fixed-dose combination tablet following single dose administration to healthy \nsubjects (n = 82) under fed conditions.  Rilpivirine exposures were bioequivalent when comparing \nOdefsey 200/25/25 mg to one rilpivirine (as hydrochloride) 25 mg film-coated tablet following single \ndose administration to healthy subjects (n = 95) under fed conditions. \n \nEmtricitabine is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration with peak plasma \nconcentrations occurring at 1 to 2 hours post-dose.  Following multiple dose oral administration of \nemtricitabine to 20 HIV-1 infected subjects, the (mean ± SD) area-under the plasma \nconcentration-time curve over a 24-hour dosing interval (AUC) was 10.0 ± 3.1 h•µg/mL.  The mean \nsteady-state plasma trough concentration at 24 hours post-dose was equal to or greater than the mean \nin vitro IC90 value for anti-HIV-1 activity.  The absolute bioavailability of emtricitabine from 200 mg \nhard capsules was estimated to be 93%.  Emtricitabine systemic exposure was unaffected when \nemtricitabine was administered with food. \n \nAfter oral administration, the maximum plasma concentration of rilpivirine is generally achieved \nwithin 4 to 5 hours.  The absolute bioavailability of rilpivirine is unknown.  Relative to fasting \nconditions, the administration of Odefsey to healthy adult subjects with food resulted in increased \nrilpivirine exposure (AUC) by 13-72%. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is rapidly absorbed following oral administration, with peak plasma \nconcentrations occurring at 15-45 minutes post-dose.  Relative to fasting conditions, the administration \nof Odefsey to healthy adult subjects with food resulted in increased tenofovir alafenamide exposure \n(AUC) by 45-53%. \n \nIt is recommended that Odefsey be taken with food. \n \nDistribution \n \nIn vitro binding of emtricitabine to human plasma proteins was < 4% and independent of \nconcentration over the range of 0.02-200 µg/mL. \n \nIn vitro binding of rilpivirine to human plasma proteins is approximately 99.7%, primarily to albumin. \n \nIn vitro binding of tenofovir to human plasma proteins is < 0.7% and is independent of concentration \nover the range of 0.01-25 µg/mL.  Ex vivo binding of tenofovir alafenamide to human plasma proteins \nin samples collected during clinical studies was approximately 80%. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nThe biotransformation of emtricitabine includes oxidation of the thiol moiety to form the 3’-sulfoxide \ndiastereomers (approximately 9% of dose) and conjugation with glucuronic acid to form \n2’-O-glucuronide (approximately 4% of dose).  Emtricitabine did not inhibit in vitro drug metabolism \nmediated by any of the major human CYP isoforms involved in drug biotransformation.  Also, \nemtricitabine did not inhibit uridine-5’-diphosphoglucuronyl transferase (UGT), the enzyme \nresponsible for glucuronidation. \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \nIn vitro experiments indicate that rilpivirine hydrochloride primarily undergoes oxidative metabolism \nmediated by the CYP3A system. \n \nMetabolism is a major elimination pathway for tenofovir alafenamide in humans, accounting for \n> 80% of an oral dose.  In vitro studies have shown that tenofovir alafenamide is metabolised to \ntenofovir (major metabolite) by cathepsin A in PBMCs (including lymphocytes and other HIV target \ncells) and macrophages; and by carboxylesterase-1 in hepatocytes.  In vivo, tenofovir alafenamide is \nhydrolysed within cells to form tenofovir (major metabolite), which is phosphorylated to the active \nmetabolite tenofovir diphosphate.  In human clinical studies, a 10 mg oral dose of tenofovir \nalafenamide given with emtricitabine, cobicistat and elvitegravir resulted in tenofovir diphosphate \nconcentrations > 4-fold higher in PBMCs and > 90% lower concentrations of tenofovir in plasma as \ncompared to a 245 mg oral dose of tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) given with emtricitabine, \ncobicistat and elvitegravir. \n \nIn vitro, tenofovir alafenamide is not metabolised by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or \nCYP2D6.  Tenofovir alafenamide is minimally metabolised by CYP3A4.  Upon co-administration \nwith the moderate CYP3A inducer probe efavirenz, tenofovir alafenamide exposure was not \nsignificantly affected.  Following administration of tenofovir alafenamide, plasma [14C] -radioactivity \nshowed a time-dependent profile, with tenofovir alafenamide as the most abundant species in the \ninitial few hours and uric acid in the remaining period. \n \nElimination \n \nEmtricitabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys with complete recovery of the dose achieved in \nurine (approximately 86%) and faeces (approximately 14%).  Thirteen percent of the emtricitabine \ndose was recovered in urine as three metabolites.  The systemic clearance of emtricitabine averaged \n307 mL/min.  Following oral administration, the elimination half-life of emtricitabine is approximately \n10 hours. \n \nThe terminal elimination half-life of rilpivirine is approximately 45 hours.  After single dose oral \nadministration of [14C]-rilpivirine, on average 85% and 6.1% of the radioactivity could be retrieved in \nfaeces and urine, respectively.  In faeces, unchanged rilpivirine accounted for on average 25% of the \nadministered dose.  Only trace amounts of unchanged rilpivirine (< 1% of dose) were detected in \nurine. \n \nRenal excretion of intact tenofovir alafenamide is a minor pathway with < 1% of the dose eliminated \nin urine.  Tenofovir alafenamide is mainly eliminated following metabolism to tenofovir.  Tenofovir is \nrenally eliminated by both glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nAge, gender and ethnicity \nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to age, gender or ethnicity have been identified \nfor emtricitabine, rilpivirine or tenofovir alafenamide. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine in antiretroviral-naïve HIV-1 infected paediatric patients 12 to \n< 18 years of age receiving rilpivirine 25 mg once daily was comparable to that in treatment-naïve \nHIV-1 infected adults receiving rilpivirine 25 mg once daily.  There was no impact of body weight on \nrilpivirine pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients in Study C213 (33 to 93 kg), similar to what was \nobserved in adults.  The pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine in paediatric patients < 12 years of age is \nunder investigation. \n \nExposures of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide given with elvitegravir + cobicistat achieved in \n24 paediatric patients aged 12 to < 18 years were similar to exposures achieved in treatment-naïve \nadults (Table 6). \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \nTable 6: Pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide in antiretroviral-naïve \nadolescents and adults \n \n\n \n\nAdolescents Adults \nEmtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide \n\n \nEmtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide \n\n \nFTCa TAFb TFVb FTCa TAFc TFVc \n\nAUCtau \n(ng•h/mL) 14,424.4 (23.9) 242.8 (57.8) 275.8 (18.4) 11,714.1 (16.6) 206.4 (71.8) 292.6 (27.4) \n\nCmax (ng/mL) 2,265.0 (22.5) 121.7 (46.2) 14.6 (20.0) 2,056.3 (20.2) 162.2 (51.1) 15.2 (26.1) \nCtau (ng/mL) 102.4 (38.9)b N/A 10.0 (19.6) 95.2 (46.7) N/A 10.6 (28.5) \n\nFTC = emtricitabine; TAF = tenofovir alafenamide; TFV = tenofovir, N/A = not applicable \nData are presented as mean (%CV). \na n = 24 adolescents (GS-US-292-0106); n = 19 adults (GS-US-292-0102). \nb n = 23 adolescents (GS-US-292-0106, population PK analysis). \nc n = 539 (TAF) or 841 (TFV) adults (GS-US-292-0111 and GS-US-292-0104, population PK analysis). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo clinically relevant differences in tenofovir alafenamide or tenofovir pharmacokinetics were \nobserved between healthy subjects and patients with severe renal impairment (estimated \nCrCl ≥ 15 mL/min and < 30 mL/min) in a Phase 1 study of tenofovir alafenamide.  In a separate \nPhase 1 study of emtricitabine alone, mean systemic emtricitabine exposure was higher in patients \nwith severe renal impairment (estimated CrCl < 30 mL/min) (33.7 µg•h/mL) than in subjects with \nnormal renal function (11.8 µg•h/mL).  The safety of emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide has not \nbeen established in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated CrCl ≥ 15 mL/min and \n< 30 mL/min). \n \nExposures of emtricitabine and tenofovir in 12 patients with end stage renal disease (estimated \nCrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis who received emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide in \ncombination with elvitegravir + cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet (E/C/F/TAF) in Study \nGS-US-292-1825 were significantly higher than in patients with normal renal function.  No clinically \nrelevant differences in tenofovir alafenamide pharmacokinetics were observed in patients with \nend stage renal disease on chronic haemodialysis as compared to those with normal renal function.  \nThere were no new safety issues identified in patients with end stage renal disease on chronic \nhaemodialysis receiving emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide, given with elvitegravir + cobicistat as \na fixed-dose combination tablet (see section 4.8). \n \nThere are no pharmacokinetic data on emtricitabine or tenofovir alafenamide in patients with end stage \nrenal disease (estimated CrCl < 15 mL/min) not on chronic haemodialysis.  The safety of emtricitabine \nand tenofovir alafenamide has not been established in these patients. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency.  Renal \nelimination of rilpivirine is negligible.  In patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal \ndisease, plasma concentrations may be increased due to alteration of drug absorption, distribution \nand/or metabolism secondary to renal dysfunction.  As rilpivirine is highly bound to plasma proteins, \nit is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (see \nsection 4.9). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine have not been studied in patients with varying degrees of \nhepatic insufficiency; however emtricitabine is not significantly metabolised by liver enzymes, so the \nimpact of liver impairment should be limited. \n \nRilpivirine hydrochloride is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver.  In a study comparing \n8 patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) to 8 matched controls and 8 patients \nwith moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) to 8 matched controls, the multiple dose \nexposure of rilpivirine was 47% higher in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 5% higher in \n\n\n\n33 \n\npatients with moderate hepatic impairment.  However, it may not be excluded that the \npharmacologically active, unbound, rilpivirine exposure is significantly increased in moderate \nimpairment.  Rilpivirine has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh \nClass C) (see section 4.2). \n \nClinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir alafenamide or its metabolite \ntenofovir were not observed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.  In patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment, total plasma concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide and tenofovir are \nlower than those seen in subjects with normal hepatic function.  When corrected for protein binding, \nunbound (free) plasma concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide in severe hepatic impairment and \nnormal hepatic function are similar. \n \nHepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection \nThe pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine, rilpivirine and tenofovir alafenamide have not been fully \nevaluated in patients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or C virus. \n \nPregnancy and postpartum \nAfter taking rilpivirine 25 mg once daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen, the total exposure of \nrilpivirine was lower during pregnancy (similar for the 2nd and 3rd trimester) compared with \npostpartum.  The decrease in the unbound free fraction of rilpivirine exposure (i.e., active) during \npregnancy compared to postpartum was less pronounced than for total exposure of rilpivirine. \n \nIn women receiving rilpivirine 25 mg once daily during the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, mean intra-\nindividual values for total rilpivirine Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin values were 21%, 29% and 35% lower, \nrespectively, as compared to postpartum; during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin \nvalues were 20%, 31% and 42% lower, respectively, as compared to postpartum. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data on emtricitabine reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies \nof safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to \nreproduction and development. \n \nNon-clinical data on rilpivirine hydrochloride reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of \nsafety pharmacology, drug disposition, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \nand development.  Liver toxicity associated with liver enzyme induction was observed in rodents.  In \ndogs cholestasis-like effects were noted. \n \nCarcinogenicity studies with rilpivirine in mice and rats revealed tumorigenic potential specific for \nthese species, but are regarded as of no relevance for humans. \n \nNon-clinical studies of tenofovir alafenamide in rats and dogs revealed bone and kidney as the primary \ntarget organs of toxicity.  Bone toxicity was observed as reduced bone mineral density in rats and dogs \nat tenofovir exposures at least four times greater than those expected after administration of Odefsey.  \nA minimal infiltration of histiocytes was present in the eye in dogs at tenofovir alafenamide and \ntenofovir exposures of approximately 4 and 17 times greater, respectively, than those expected after \nadministration of Odefsey. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in conventional genotoxicity assays. \n \nBecause there is a lower tenofovir exposure in rats and mice after the administration of tenofovir \nalafenamide compared to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, carcinogenicity studies and a rat \nperi-postnatal study were conducted only with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.  No special hazard for \nhumans was revealed in conventional studies of carcinogenic potential and toxicity to reproduction \nand development.  Reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, \nfertility, pregnancy or foetal parameters.  However, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate reduced the viability \nindex and weight of pups in a peri-postnatal toxicity study at maternally toxic doses. \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n \n6.

What Odefsey is and what it is used for \n \nOdefsey is an antiviral medicine used to treat infection by the Human Immunodeficiency \nVirus (HIV).  It is a single tablet that contains a combination of three active substances: \nemtricitabine, rilpivirine and tenofovir alafenamide.  Each of these active substances works by \ninterfering with an enzyme called ‘reverse transcriptase’, which is essential for the HIV-1 virus to \nmultiply. \n \nOdefsey reduces the amount of HIV in your body.  This will improve your immune system and reduce \nthe risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection. \n \nOdefsey is used in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, who weigh at least 35 kg. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Odefsey \n \nDo not take Odefsey \n \n• If you are allergic to emtricitabine, rilpivirine, tenofovir alafenamide or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n \n• If you are currently taking any of the following medicines: \n\n- carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (used to treat epilepsy \nand prevent seizures) \n\n- rifabutin, rifampicin and rifapentine (used to treat some bacterial infections such as \ntuberculosis) \n\n- omeprazole, dexlansoprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole and \nesomeprazole (used to prevent and treat stomach ulcers, heartburn, acid reflux disease) \n\n\n\n44 \n\n- dexamethasone (a corticosteroid medicine used to treat inflammation and suppress the \nimmune system) when taken by mouth or injected (except as a single dose treatment) \n\n- products that contain St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal remedy used \nfor depression and anxiety) \n\n \n If this applies to you, do not take Odefsey and tell your doctor immediately. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nYou must remain under the care of your doctor while taking Odefsey. \n \nYou can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective \nantiretroviral therapy.  Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other \npeople.  This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Odefsey you may still develop \ninfections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Odefsey: \n \n• If you have liver problems or a history of liver disease, including hepatitis.  Patients with \n\nliver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with antiretrovirals, have a \nhigher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications.  If you have hepatitis B infection, \nyour doctor will carefully consider the best treatment regimen for you. \n\n \nIf you have hepatitis B infection, liver problems may become worse after you stop taking \nOdefsey.  It is important not to stop taking Odefsey without talking to your doctor: see \nsection 3, Do not stop taking Odefsey. \n \n\n• If you are taking any medicines that may cause a life-threatening irregular heartbeat (Torsades \nde Pointes). \n\n \nWhile you are taking Odefsey \n \nOnce you start taking Odefsey, look out for: \n \n• Signs of inflammation or infection \n• Joint pain, stiffness or bone problems \n \n If you notice any of these symptoms, tell your doctor immediately.  For more information see \n\nsection 4, Possible side effects. \n \nIt is possible that in the future, long-term users of Odefsey may get kidney problems. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nDo not give this medicine to children aged 11 years or under, or weighing less than 35 kg.  The \nuse of Odefsey in children aged 11 years or under or weighing less than 35 kg has not yet been \nstudied. \n \nOther medicines and Odefsey \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  Odefsey may interact with other medicines.  As a result, the amounts of Odefsey or other \nmedicines in your blood may be affected.  This may stop your medicines from working properly, or \nmay make any side effects worse.  In some cases, your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check \nyour blood levels. \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nMedicines that must never be taken with Odefsey: \n \n\n- carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (used to treat epilepsy \nand prevent seizures) \n\n- rifabutin, rifampicin and rifapentine (used to treat some bacterial infections such as \ntuberculosis) \n\n- omeprazole, dexlansoprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole and \nesomeprazole (used to prevent and treat stomach ulcers, heartburn, acid reflux disease) \n\n- dexamethasone (a corticosteroid medicine used to treat inflammation and suppress the \nimmune system) when taken by mouth or injected (except as a single dose treatment) \n\n- products that contain St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal remedy used \nfor depression and anxiety) \n\n \n If you are taking any of these medicines, do not take Odefsey and tell your doctor immediately. \n \nOther types of medicine: \n \nTalk to your doctor if you are taking: \n \n• Any medicines used for treating HIV \n\n \n• Any medicines containing: \n\n- tenofovir alafenamide \n- tenofovir disoproxil \n- lamivudine \n- adefovir dipivoxil \n\n \n• Antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections containing: \n\n- clarithromycin \n- erythromycin \nThese medicines can increase the amount of rilpivirine and tenofovir alafenamide (components \nof Odefsey) in your blood.  Your doctor will give you a different medicine. \n\n \n• Antifungal medicines used to treat fungal infections: \n\n- ketoconazole \n- fluconazole \n- itraconazole \n- posaconazole \n- voriconazole \nThese medicines can increase the amount of rilpivirine and tenofovir alafenamide (components \nof Odefsey) in your blood.  Your doctor will give you a different medicine. \n\n \n• Medicines for stomach ulcers, heartburn or acid reflux such as: \n\n- antacids (aluminium/magnesium hydroxide or calcium carbonate) \n- H2-antagonists (famotidine, cimetidine, nizatidine or ranitidine) \nThese medicines can decrease the amount of rilpivirine (a component of Odefsey) in your \nblood.  If you are taking one of these medicines your doctor will either give you a different \nmedicine, or recommend how and when you take that medicine: \n\n \n- If you are taking an antacid, take it at least 2 hours before or at least 4 hours after \n\nOdefsey. \n \n\n- If you are taking an H2-antagonist, take it at least 12 hours before or at least 4 hours \nafter Odefsey.  H2-antagonists can only be taken once a day if you take Odefsey.  \nH2-antagonists should not be taken in a twice a day regimen.  Talk to your doctor about \nan alternative regimen (see How to take Odefsey). \n\n \n\n\n\n46 \n\n• Ciclosporin, a medicine used to reduce the strength of the body’s immune system: \nThis medicine can increase the amount of rilpivirine and tenofovir alafenamide (components of \nOdefsey) in your blood.  Your doctor will give you a different medicine. \n \n\n• Methadone, a medicine used to treat opiate addiction, as your doctor may need to change your \nmethadone dose. \n\n \n• Dabigatran etexilate, a medicine used to treat heart conditions, as your doctor may need to \n\nmonitor the levels of this medicine in your blood. \n \n\n Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines.  Do not stop your treatment without \ncontacting your doctor. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n• If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \n\nask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n• Use effective contraception while taking Odefsey. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine when pregnant. \n \nIf you have taken Odefsey during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and \nother diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child.  In children whose mothers took \nnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection \nagainst HIV outweighed the risk of side effects. \n \nDo not breast-feed during treatment with Odefsey.  This is because some of the active substances \nin this medicine pass into human breast milk.  It is also recommended that you do not breast-feed to \navoid passing the virus to the baby in breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nDo not drive or operate machines if you feel tired, sleepy or dizzy after taking your medicine. \n \nOdefsey contains lactose and sodium \n \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n If any of these applies to you, talk to your doctor before taking Odefsey. \n \n \n3. How to take Odefsey \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.  Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is: \n \nAdults: one tablet each day with food \nAdolescents 12 years of age and older, who weigh at least 35 kg: one tablet each day with food \n \nDo not chew, crush or split the tablet. \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nIf you are taking an antacid such as aluminium/magnesium hydroxide, or calcium carbonate, take it \nat least 2 hours before or at least 4 hours after Odefsey. \n \nIf you are taking an H2-antagonist such as famotidine, cimetidine, nizatidine or ranitidine, take it at \nleast 12 hours before or at least 4 hours after Odefsey.  H2-antagonists can only be taken once a day if \nyou take Odefsey.  H2-antagonists should not be taken twice a day.  Talk to your doctor about an \nalternative regimen. \n \nIf you are on dialysis, take your daily dose of Odefsey following completion of dialysis. \n \nIf you take more Odefsey than you should \n \nIf you accidentally take more than the recommended dose of Odefsey you may be at increased risk of \nexperiencing possible side effects with this medicine (see section 4, Possible side effects). \n \nContact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice.  Keep or take the tablet \nbottle with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. \n \nIf you forget to take Odefsey \n \nIt is important not to miss a dose of Odefsey. \n \nIf you do miss a dose: \n• If you notice within 12 hours of the time you usually take Odefsey, you must take the tablet as \n\nsoon as possible.  Always take the tablet with food.  Then take the next dose as usual. \n• If you notice 12 hours or more after the time you usually take Odefsey, then do not take the \n\nmissed dose.  Wait and take the next dose, with food, at your usual time. \n \nIf you vomit less than 4 hours after taking Odefsey, take another tablet with food.  If you vomit \nmore than 4 hours after taking Odefsey you do not need to take another tablet until your next \nregularly scheduled tablet. \n \nDo not stop taking Odefsey \n \nDo not stop taking Odefsey without talking to your doctor.  Stopping Odefsey can seriously affect \nyour response to future treatment.  If Odefsey is stopped for any reason, speak to your doctor before \nyou restart taking Odefsey tablets. \n \nWhen your supply of Odefsey starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist.  This is \nvery important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a \nshort time.  The disease may then become harder to treat. \n \nIf you have both HIV infection and hepatitis B, it is especially important not to stop your Odefsey \ntreatment without talking to your doctor first.  You may require blood tests for several months after \nstopping treatment.  In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is \nnot recommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening. \n \n Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, \n\nparticularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n\n\n\n48 \n\nPossible side effects: tell a doctor immediately \n \n• Any signs of inflammation or infection.  In some patients with advanced HIV infection \n\n(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak \nimmune system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon \nafter HIV treatment is started.  It is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement in \nthe body’s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present \nwith no obvious symptoms. \n\n \n• Autoimmune disorders, when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue, may also occur \n\nafter you start taking medicines for HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many \nmonths after the start of treatment.  Look out for any symptoms of infection or other symptoms \nsuch as: \n- muscle weakness \n- weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body \n- palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity \n\n If you notice these or any symptoms of inflammation or infection, tell your doctor \nimmediately. \n\n \nVery common side effects \n(may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n• difficulty sleeping (insomnia) \n• headache \n• dizziness \n• feeling sick (nausea) \n \nTests may also show: \n• increased levels of cholesterol and/or pancreatic amylase (a digestive enzyme) in the blood \n• increased levels of liver enzymes in the blood \n \nCommon side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n• decreased appetite \n• depression \n• abnormal dreams \n• sleep disorders \n• depressed mood \n• feeling sleepy (somnolence) \n• tiredness \n• stomach pain or discomfort \n• being sick (vomiting) \n• feeling bloated \n• dry mouth \n• wind (flatulence) \n• diarrhoea \n• rash \n \nTests may also show: \n• low white blood cell count (a reduced white blood cell count can make you more prone to \n\ninfection) \n• low platelet count (a type of blood cell involved in clotting blood) \n• decrease in haemoglobin in your blood \n• increased fatty acids (triglycerides), bilirubin or lipase in the blood \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nUncommon side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n• signs or symptoms of inflammation or infection \n• low red blood cell count (anaemia) \n• severe skin reactions including rash accompanied by fever, swelling and liver problems \n• problems with digestion resulting in discomfort after meals \n• swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat (angioedema) \n• itching (pruritus) \n• hives (urticaria) \n• joint pain (arthralgia) \n \n If any of the side effects get serious tell your doctor. \n \nOther effects that may be seen during HIV treatment \n \nThe frequency of the following side effects is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \n• Bone problems.  Some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as Odefsey \n\nmay develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood \nsupply to the bone).  Taking this type of medicine for a long time, taking corticosteroids, \ndrinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being overweight, may be some of \nthe many risk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are: \n- joint stiffness \n- joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) \n- difficulty with movement \n\n If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet.  You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety \nof this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Odefsey \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and bottle after {EXP}.  \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in the original package in order to protect from moisture.  Keep the bottle tightly closed. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.  Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use.  These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n50 \n\n6.
