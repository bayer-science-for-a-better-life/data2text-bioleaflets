PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in pre-filled syringe.  \nMilky-white liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza caused by A (H1N1v) 2009 virus (see section 4.4). \nFocetria should be used in accordance with Official Guidance. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe dose recommendations take into account the safety and immunogenicity data from clinical studies \nin healthy subjects.  \n \nPosology \n \nAdults (18-60 years):  \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nImmunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after one dose of Focetria H1N1v suggest that a single \ndose may be sufficient. \nIf a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first \nand second dose.  \n \nElderly (>60 years): \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks.  \nPaediatric population \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 3\n\nChildren and adolescents aged 3-17 years: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nImmunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after one dose of Focetria H1N1v suggest that a single \ndose may be sufficient. If a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three \nweeks between the first and second dose.  \n \nChildren aged 6 months to 35 months: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nThere is a further immune response to a second dose of 0.5 ml administered after an interval of three \nweeks. \n \nChildren aged less than 6 months: \nNo data are available in children aged less than 6 months (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \nVaccination is not currently recommended in this age group. \n \nIt is recommended that subjects who receive a first dose of Focetria, should complete the vaccination \ncourse with Focetria H1N1v (see section 4.4). \nThe use of a second dose should take into consideration the information provided in \nsections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1. \n \nMethod of administration \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection preferably into the deltoid muscle or \nanterolateral thigh (depending on the muscle mass). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues \n(egg and chicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)) of this vaccine. \n \nSee section 4.4 for special warnings and special precautions for use. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe vaccine can only be expected to protect against influenza caused by \nA/California/07/2009 (H1N1)v-like strains. \n \nCaution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other \nthan anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients and to residues (eggs and \nchicken protein, ovalbumin, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)). \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nImmunisation should be postponed in patients with severe febrile illness or acute infection. \n \nFocetria should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \nThere are no data with Focetria using the subcutaneous route. Therefore, healthcare providers need to \nassess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with \nthrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless \nthe potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings. \nCases of convulsion with and without fever have been reported in subjects vaccinated with Focetria. \nThe majority of febrile convulsions occurred in paediatric subjects. Some cases were observed in \nsubjects with a history of epilepsy. Particular attention should be given to subjects suffering from \nepilepsy and the physician should inform the subjects (or parents) about the possibility to experience \nconvulsion. (See section 4.8). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 4\n\n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \nA protective response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). \n \nIn the event that a second dose is to be administered it should be noted that there are no safety, \nimmunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of Focetria with other H1N1v vaccines. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFocetria H1N1v may be co-administered with a non adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. Data on \nco-administration of Focetria H1N1v with a non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza subunit vaccine in \nhealthy adults aged 18-60 years of age did not suggest any interference in the immune response to \nFocetria. The immune response to the seasonal antigens was satisfactory.  \nCo-administration was not associated with higher rates of local or systemic reactions compared to \nadministration of Focetria alone.  \nThe same study demonstrated that previous administration of adjuvanted or unadjuvanted seasonal \ninfluenza vaccines to adults and elderly does not interfere with the immune response to Focetria. \nTherefore the data indicate that Focetria may be co-administered with non adjuvanted seasonal \ninfluenza vaccines (with injections made into opposite limbs). \n \nThere are no data on co-administration of Focetria with other vaccines. \nIf co-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on \nseparate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA \nmethod for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, \nHTLV-1. In such cases, the Western Blot method is negative. These transitory false positive results \nmay be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nSafety data are available in pregnant women exposed to Focetria in particular during second and third \ntrimesters. Postmarketing spontaneously reported adverse events, an interventional study and large \nobservational studies do not suggest direct or indirect harmful effects of Focetria exposure on pregnancy.  \nFurther, data from vaccinations with seasonal interpandemic inactivated trivalent vaccines in pregnant \nwomen do not indicate that adverse foetal and maternal outcomes were attributable to the vaccine. \nHealth care providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering Focetria vaccine \nto pregnant women, taking into consideration official recommendations. \n \nBreast-feeding \nFocetria may be administered to lactating women. \n \nFertility \nAn animal study with H5N1 mock-up vaccine did not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 \u201cUndesirable Effects\u201d may affect the ability to drive \nor use machines. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 5\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\uf0b7 Clinical trials \n \nAdverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency: \nVery common (\uf0b31/10),  \nCommon (\uf0b31/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon (\uf0b31/1,000 to <1/100),  \nRare (\uf0b31/10,000 to <1/1,000),  \nVery rare (<1/10,000). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness: \n \nAdult and Elderly  \n \nIn a clinical trial 131 adults and 123 elderly were exposed to two doses of the 7.5 \u00b5g Focetria. \nThe safety profile of Focetria was similar to that of the H5N1 mock up vaccines. Most of the reactions \nwere mild in nature and of short duration. The incidence of symptoms observed in subjects \nover 60 years of age was generally lower as compared to the 18-60 years old population. \n \nVery common: pain, induration and erythema, myalgia, headache, sweating, malaise and fatigue  \n \nIn clinical trials with different formulations (H5N3, H9N2 and H5N1) approximately 3400 subjects \nwere exposed to the mock-up vaccines.  \nMost of the reactions were mild in nature, of short duration and qualitatively similar to those induced \nby conventional seasonal influenza vaccines. It is widely accepted that the adjuvant effect leading to \nincreased immunogenicity is associated with a slightly higher frequency of local reactions (mostly \nmild pain) compared with conventional, nonadjuvanted influenza vaccines. There were fewer reactions \nafter the second vaccination compared with the first.  \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trials with the mock-up vaccine are listed below.  \nThe incidence of symptoms observed in subjects over 60 years of age was lower as compared to \nthe 18-60 years old population. \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: headache \nRare: convulsions \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: sweating \nUncommon: urticaria \nRare: eye swelling \n \nMuscoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \nVery common: myalgia \nCommon: arthralgia  \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: nausea \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: injection site swelling, injection site pain, injection site induration, injection site \nredness, fatigue, malaise and shivering \nCommon: injection site ecchymosis and fever \nUncommon: influenza like illness \nRare: anaphylaxis \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 6\n\nThe common reactions usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. \n \nPaediatric population \nChildren and adolescents 6 months to 17 years of age \n \nClinical trials with Focetria H1N1v \nSafety data after the first and second dose in children and adolescents suggest a comparable safety \nprofile with that reported for the H5N1 mock-up vaccine formulation.  \nAdverse reactions in the week following vaccination from 87 children 3-8 years old and 95 children \nand adolescents 9-17 years old receiving the 7.5 \u00b5g formulation were reported as follows: \n \n Injection 1 Injection 2 \nChildren (3 to 8 years of age) N=87 N=85 \nAny adverse reaction 67% 61% \nLocal 56% 49% \nSystemic 32% 31% \nFever \u2265 38\u00b0C to 38.9\u00b0C 3%  1%  \nFever 39\u00b0C to 39.9\u00b0C 0% 1% \nFever \u2265 40\u00b0 C 0% 0% \nAny other AE 13% 15% \nAdolescents (9 to 17 years of age) N=95 N=94 \nAny adverse reaction 67% 55% \nLocal 60% 49% \nSystemic 38% 26% \nFever \u226538\u00b0C to 38.9\u00b0C 2% 1% \nFever 39\u00b0C to 39.9\u00b0C 0% 0% \nFever \u2265 40\u00b0 C 0% 0% \nAny other AE 11% 9% \n\n \nData in children and adolescents 3-17 years suggest a slight decrease in reactogenicity after the second \ndose, with no increase in rates of fever. \n \nVery common reactions reported in children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age: \nPain, induration and erythema, malaise, myalgia, headache and fatigue. \n \nAdverse reactions in the week following vaccination from 80 infants 6-11 months old \nand 82 toddlers 12-35 months old, receiving the 7.5 \u00b5g formulation were reported as follows:  \n \n Injection 1 Injection 2 \nInfants (6 to 11 months of age) N=80 N=75 \nAny adverse reaction 79% 65% \nLocal 44% 29% \nSystemic 69% 55% \nFever \u226538\u00b0C to 38.9\u00b0C  9%  6%  \nFever 39\u00b0C to 39.9\u00b0C 2% 4% \nFever \u2265 40\u00b0 C 0% 0% \nAny other AE 29% 28% \nToddlers (12 to 35 months of age) N=82 N=81 \nAny adverse reaction 70% 70% \nLocal 50% 48% \nSystemic 55% 44% \nFever \u226538\u00b0C to 38.9\u00b0C  10%  11%  \nFever 39\u00b0C to 39.9\u00b0C 4% 1% \nFever \u2265 40\u00b0 C 1% 0% \nAny other AE 21% 22% \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 7\n\nData in infants and toddlers 6-35 months of age suggest a slight decrease in reactogenicity after the \nsecond dose, with no increase in rates of fever. \n \nVery common reactions reported in 233 infants and toddlers 6 to 35 months of age: \nTenderness, erythema, irritability, unusual crying, sleepiness, diarrhoea and change in eating habits. \nInduration was a common reaction in toddlers but was less common in infants. \n \n\uf0b7 Post-marketing surveillance \n \nFocetria H1N1v \n \nIn addition to the adverse reactions reported in the clinical trials, the following have been reported \nduring post-marketing experience with Focetria H1N1v: \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nLymphadenopathy. \n \nCardiac disorders \nPalpitation, tachycardia. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nAsthenia. \n \nMuscoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \nMuscular weakness, pain in extremities. \n \nRespiratory disorders \nCough. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nGeneralised skin reactions including pruritus, urticaria or non-specific rash; angioedema. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nGastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. \n \nNervous system disorders \nHeadache, dizziness, somnolence, syncope.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza caused by A(H1N1v) 2009 virus (see section 4.4). \nFocetria should be used in accordance with Official Guidance. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe dose recommendations take into account the safety and immunogenicity data from clinical studies \nin healthy subjects.  \n \nPosology \n \nAdults (18-60 years): \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nImmunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after one dose of Focetria H1N1v suggest that a single \ndose may be sufficient.  \nIf a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first \nand second dose.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 14\n\nElderly (>60 years): \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nChildren and adolescents aged 3-17 years: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nImmunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after one dose of Focetria H1N1v suggest that a single \ndose may be sufficient. \nIf a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first \nand second dose.  \n \nChildren aged 6 months to 35 months: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nThere is a further immune response to a second dose of 0.5 ml administered after an interval of three \nweeks. \n \nChildren aged less than 6 months: \nNo data are available in children aged less than 6 months (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \nVaccination is not currently recommended in this age group. \n \nIt is recommended that subjects who receive a first dose of Focetria, should complete the vaccination \ncourse with Focetria H1N1v (see section 4.4). \nThe use of a second dose should take into consideration the information provided in \nsections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1. \n \nMethod of administration \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection preferably into the deltoid muscle or \nanterolateral thigh (depending on the muscle mass). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues \n(egg and chicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)) of this vaccine. \n \nSee section 4.4. for special warnings and special precautions for use. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe vaccine can only be expected to protect against influenza caused by \nA/California/07/2009 (H1N1)v-like strains. \n \nCaution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other \nthan anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients, to thiomersal and to \nresidues (eggs and chicken protein, ovalbumin, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)). \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nImmunisation should be postponed in patients with severe febrile illness or acute infection. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 15\n\nFocetria should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \nThere are no data with Focetria using the subcutaneous route. Therefore, healthcare providers need to \nassess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with \nthrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless \nthe potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings. \n \nCases of convulsion with and without fever have been reported in subjects vaccinated with Focetria. \nThe majority of febrile convulsions occurred in paediatric subjects. Some cases were observed in subjects \nwith a history of epilepsy. Particular attention should be given to subjects suffering from epilepsy and \nthe physician should inform the subjects (or parents) about the possibility to experience convulsion. \n(See section 4.8). \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \nA protective response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). \n \nIn the event that a second dose is to be administered it should be noted that there are no safety, \nimmunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of Focetria with other H1N1v vaccines. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nFocetria H1N1v may be co-administered with a non adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. Data on \nco-administration of Focetria H1N1v with a non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza subunit vaccine in \nhealthy adults aged 18-60 years of age did not suggest any interference in the immune response to \nFocetria. The immune response to the seasonal antigens was satisfactory.  \n \nCo-administration was not associated with higher rates of local or systemic reactions compared to \nadministration of Focetria alone. \nThe same study demonstrated that previous administration of adjuvanted or unadjuvanted seasonal \ninfluenza vaccines to adults and elderly does not interfere with the immune response to Focetria. \nTherefore the data indicate that Focetria may be co-administered with non adjuvanted seasonal \ninfluenza vaccines (with injections made into opposite limbs). \n \nThere are no data on co-administration of Focetria with other vaccines.  \nIf co-administration with another vaccine is indicated, immunisation should be carried out on separate \nlimbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA \nmethod for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1(HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, \nHTLV-1 have been observed. In such cases, the Western Blot method is negative. These transitory \nfalse-positive results may due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nSafety data are available in pregnant women exposed to Focetria in particular during second and third \ntrimesters. Postmarketing spontaneously reported adverse events, an interventional study and large \nobservational studies do not suggest direct or indirect harmful effects of Focetria exposure on pregnancy.  \nFurther, data from vaccinations with seasonal interpandemic inactivated trivalent vaccines in pregnant \nwomen do not indicate that adverse foetal and maternal outcomes were attributable to the vaccine. \nHealth care providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering Focetria vaccine \nto pregnant women, taking into consideration official recommendations. \n \nBreast-feeding \nFocetria may be administered to lactacting women. \n \nFertility \nAn animal study with H5N1 mock-up vaccine did not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 16\n\n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 \u201cUndesirable Effects\u201d may affect the ability to drive \nor use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\uf0b7 Clinical trials \n \nAdverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency: \nVery common (\uf0b31/10),  \nCommon (\uf0b31/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon (\uf0b31/1,000 to <1/100),  \nRare (\uf0b31/10,000 to <1/1,000),  \nVery rare (<1/10,000). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness: \n \nAdults and elderly \n \nIn clinical trial 131 adults and 123 elderly were exposed to two doses of the 7.5 \u00b5g Focetria. \nThe safety profile of Focetria was similar to that of the H5N1 mock up vaccines. Most of the reactions \nwere mild in nature and of short duration. The incidence of symptoms observed in subjects \nover 60 years of age was generally lower as compared to the 18-60 years old population. \n \nVery common: pain, induration and erythema, myalgia, headache, sweating, malaise and fatigue  \n \nIn clinical trials with different formulations (H5N3, H9N2 and H5N1) approximately 3400 subjects \nwere exposed to the candidate vaccine.  \nMost of the reactions were mild in nature, of short duration and qualitatively similar to those induced \nby conventional seasonal influenza vaccines. It is widely accepted that the adjuvant effect leading to \nincreased immunogenicity is associated with a slightly higher frequency of local reactions (mostly \nmild pain) compared with conventional, nonadjuvanted influenza vaccines. There were fewer reactions \nafter the second vaccination compared with the first.  \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trials with the mock-up vaccine are listed below.  \nThe incidence of symptoms observed in subjects over 60 years of age was lower as compared to \nthe 18-60 years old population. \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: headache \nRare: convulsions \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: sweating \nUncommon: urticaria \nRare: eye swelling \n \nMuscoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \nVery common: myalgia \nCommon: arthralgia  \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: nausea \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 17\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: injection site swelling, injection site pain, injection site induration, injection site \nredness, fatigue, malaise and shivering \n \nCommon: injection site ecchymosis and fever \nUncommon: influenza like illness \nRare: anaphylaxis \n \nThe common reactions usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. \n \nPaediatric population \nChildren and adolescents 6 months to 17 years of age \n \nClinical trials with Focetria H1N1v \nSafety data after the first and second dose in children and adolescents suggest a comparable safety \nprofile with that reported for the H5N1 mock-up vaccine formulation.  \nAdverse reactions in the week following vaccination from 87 children 3-8 years old and 95 children \nand adolescents 9-17 years old, receiving the 7.5 \u00b5g formulation were reported as follows:  \n \n Injection 1 Injection 2 \nChildren (3 to 8 years of age) N=87 N=85 \nAny adverse reaction 67% 61% \nLocal 56% 49% \nSystemic 32% 31% \nFever \u226538\u00b0C to 38.9\u00b0C 3% 1% \nFever 39\u00b0C to 39.9\u00b0C 0% 1% \nFever \u2265 40\u00b0 C 0% 0% \nAny other AE 13% 15% \nAdolescents (9 to 17 years of age) N=95 N=94 \nAny adverse reaction 67% 55% \nLocal 60% 49% \nSystemic 38% 26% \nFever \u226538\u00b0C to 38.9\u00b0C 2% 1% \nFever 39\u00b0C to 39.9\u00b0C 0% 0% \nFever \u2265 40\u00b0 C 0% 0% \nAny other AE 11% 9% \n\n \nData in children and adolescents 3-17 years suggest a slight decrease in reactogenicity after the second \ndose, with no increase in rates of fever. \n \nVery common reactions reported in children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age: \nPain, induration and erythema, malaise, myalgia, headache and fatigue. \n Me\n\ndic\nina\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n au\nth\n\nor\nise\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 18\n\nAdverse reactions in the week following vaccination from 80 infants 6-11 months old \nand 82 toddlers 12-35 months old, receiving the 7.5 \u00b5g formulation were reported as follows:  \n \n Injection 1 Injection 2 \nInfants (6 to 11 months of age) N=80 N=75 \nAny adverse reaction 79% 65% \nLocal 44% 29% \nSystemic 69% 55% \nFever \u226538\u00b0C to 38.9\u00b0C  9%  6%  \nFever 39\u00b0C to 39.9\u00b0C 2% 4% \nFever \u2265 40\u00b0 C 0% 0% \nAny other AE 29% 28% \nToddlers (12 to 35 months of age) N=82 N=81 \nAny adverse reaction 70% 70% \nLocal 50% 48% \nSystemic 55% 44% \nFever \u226538\u00b0C to 38.9\u00b0C  10%  11%  \nFever 39\u00b0C to 39.9\u00b0C 4% 1% \nFever \u2265 40\u00b0 C 1% 0% \nAny other AE 21% 22% \n\n \nData in infants and toddlers 6-35 months of age suggest a slight decrease in reactogenicity after the \nsecond dose, with no increase in rates of fever. \n \nVery common reactions reported in 233 infants and toddlers 6 to 35 months of age: \nTenderness, erythema, irritability, unusual crying, sleepiness, diarrhoea and change in eating habits. \nInduration was a common reaction in toddlers but was less common in infants. \n \n\uf0b7 Post-marketing surveillance \n \nFocetria H1N1v \n \nIn addition to the adverse reactions reported in the clinical trials, the following have been reported \nduring post-marketing experience with Focetria H1N1v: \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nLymphadenopathy. \n \nCardiac disorders \nPalpitation, tachycardia. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nAsthenia. \n \nMuscoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \nMuscular weakness, pain in extremities. \n \nRespiratory disorders \nCough. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nGeneralised skin reactions including pruritus, urticaria or non-specific rash; angioedema. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nGastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 19\n\nNervous system disorders \nHeadache, dizziness, somnolence, syncope.

How FOCETRIA is given \n \nYour doctor or nurse will administer the vaccine in accordance with official recommendations.  \nThe vaccine will be injected into a muscle (usually in the upper arm).  \n \nAdults  \nA dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine will be given. \nClinical data suggest that a single dose may be sufficient. \nIf a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first \nand second dose. \n \nElderly:  \nA dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine and a second dose of 0.5 ml at least three weeks later. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 38\n\n \nUse in children and adolescents \n \nChildren and adolescents 3-17 years of age: \nYou or your child will receive one dose of 0.5 ml vaccine. \nAvailable clinical data suggest that a single dose may be sufficient. \nIf a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first \nand second dose. \n \nChildren 6 months to 35 months: \nYou or your child will receive one dose of 0.5 ml vaccine.  \nIf a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first \nand second dose. \n \nChildren aged less than 6 months of age: \nVaccination is currently not recommended in this age group. \n \nWhen Focetria is given for the first dose, it is recommended that Focetria (and not another vaccine \nagainst H1N1v) be given for the complete vaccination course. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Focetria can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \nAllergic reactions may occur following vaccination, in rare cases leading to shock. Doctors are aware \nof this possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases. \n \nIn the clinical studies with the vaccine, most side effects were mild in nature and short term. \nThe side-effects are generally similar to those related to the seasonal flu vaccine. \n \nThe side effects listed below have occurred with Focetria in clinical studies in adults, including the elderly: \n \nVery common (affects more than 1 user in 10): \nPain, hardening of the skin at the injection site, injection site redness, injection site swelling, pain at the \nsite of injection, aching muscles, headache, sweating, fatigue, generally feeling unwell and shivering \n \nCommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 100): \nBruising of the skin at the injection site, fever and nausea \n \nUncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000): \nFlu like symptoms \n \nRare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000): \nConvulsion, eye swelling and anaphylaxis \n \nThese side effects usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. If they persist, CONSULT \nYOUR DOCTOR. \n \nSide effects from clinical studies in children \n \nA clinical study was conducted with the same vaccine in children. General side effects reported very \ncommonly in the 6 months-35 months of age group per dose were irritability, unusual crying, \nsleepiness, diarrhoea and change in eating habits. Among the adolescents the very common events \nwere: sweating, nausea and chills. Very commonly reported reactions in both children and adolescents \nwere pain, hardening of the skin at the injection site, injection site redness, generally feeling unwell, \nmuscle ache, headache and fatigue. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 39\n\nOther side effects \n \nThe side effects listed below have occurred in the days or weeks after vaccination with Focetria. \n \nGeneralised skin reactions including itching, urticaria (hives), rash or swelling of the skin and mucous \nmembranes. \nDisorders of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. \nHeadache, dizziness, drowsiness, fainting. \nNeurological disorders such as severe stabbing or throbbing pain along one or more nerves, tingling, \nfits, and neuritis (inflammation of nerves).  \nSwollen lymph nodes, palpitations, weakness, pain in the extremities and cough. \nAllergic reactions possibly with shortness of breath, wheezing, swelling of the throat, or leading to a \ndangerous decrease of blood pressure, which, if untreated, may lead to shock. Doctors are aware of \nthis possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases. \n \nData in children and adolescents suggest a slight decrease in reactogenicity after the second dose of \nthe vaccine, with no increase in rates of fever. \n \nIn addition, the side effects listed below have occurred in the days or weeks after vaccination with \nadjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines given routinely every year to prevent flu. These side effects \nmay occur with Focetria. \n \nRare: \nLow blood platelet count which can result in bleeding or bruising.  \n \nVery rare: \nVasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels which can cause skin rashes, joint pain and kidney \nproblems), exudative erythema multiforme. \nNeurological disorders such as encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the central nervous system),  \nand a type of paralysis known as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome.  \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet.  \n \n \n5. How to store FOCETRIA \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use Focetria after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and the label. The expiry date \nrefers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C).  \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \nDo not freeze.  \n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \ndispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 40\n\n6.

The multidose vial should preferably be used within 24 hours after first withdrawal. \n \nData are available that suggest that multidose vials could be used up to a maximum of 72 hours after \nfirst withdrawal, although such pro-longed storage periods should not be the preferred option. \n \n \n \nAny unused vaccine or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 42\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX IV \n \n\nSCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS RECOMMENDING THE VARIATION \nTO THE TERMS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 43\n\nScientific conclusions  \nTaking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Focetria, the scientific \nconclusions of PRAC are as follows:  \nBased on the findings of an observational study conducted in >2000 pregnant women, reflecting the \nuse of Focetria in pregnant women, influenza A (H1N1) vaccination with Focetria does not seem to \nbe associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, especially in the second or \nthird trimesters of pregnancy. Therefore, the relevant SmPC wording currently stating the limited \navailability of clinical data in pregnant women, is recommended to be changed to reflect the newly \navailable information. \nTherefore, in view of available data regarding the use of Focetria during pregnancy, the PRAC \nconsidered that changes to the product information were warranted. The CHMP agrees with the \nscientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n \nGrounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  \nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for Focetria, the CHMP is of the opinion that the \nbenefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance influenza vaccine \nh1n1v (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) is favourable subject to the proposed changes to \nthe product information. \nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

leading to shock. doctors are aware of this possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases. in the clinical studies with the vaccine, most side effects were mild in nature and short term. the side-effects are generally similar to those related to the seasonal flu vaccine. the side effects listed below have occurred with focetria in clinical studies in adults, including the elderly: very common (affects more than 1 user in 10): pain, hardening of the skin at the injection site, injection site redness, injection site swelling, pain at the site of injection, aching muscles, headache, sweating, fatigue, generally feeling unwell and shivering common (affects 1 to 10 users in 100): bruising of the skin at the injection site, fever and nausea uncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000): flu like symptoms rare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000): convulsion, eye swelling and anaphylaxis these side effects usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. if they persist, consult your doctor. side effects from clinical studies in children a clinical study was conducted with the same vaccine in children. general side effects reported very commonly in the 6 months-35 months of age group per dose were irritability, unusual crying, sleepiness, diarrhoea and change in eating habits. among the adolescents the very common events were: sweating, nausea and chills. very commonly reported reactions in both children and adolescents were pain, hardening of the skin at the injection site, injection site redness, generally feeling unwell, muscle ache, headache and fatigue. other side effects the side effects listed below have occurred in the days or weeks after vaccination with focetria. generalised skin reactions including itching, urticaria (hives), rash or swelling of the skin and mucous membranes. disorders of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. headache, dizziness, drowsiness, fainting. neurological disorders such as severe stabbing or throbbing pain along one or more nerves, tingling, fits, and neuritis (inflammation of nerves). swollen lymph nodes, palpitations, weakness, pain in the extremities and cough. allergic reactions possibly with shortness of breath, wheezing, swelling of the throat, or leading to a dangerous decrease of blood pressure, which, if untreated, may lead to shock. doctors are aware of this possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases. data in children and adolescents suggest a slight decrease in reactogenicity after the second dose of the vaccine, with no increase in rates of fever. in addition, the side effects listed below have occurred in the days or weeks after vaccination with adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines given routinely every year to prevent flu. these side effects may occur with focetria. rare: low blood platelet count which can result in bleeding or bruising. very rare: vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels which can cause skin rashes, joint pain and kidney problems), exudative erythema multiforme. neurological disorders such as encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the central nervous system), and a type of paralysis known as guillain-barr\u00e9 syndrome. if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet.",
