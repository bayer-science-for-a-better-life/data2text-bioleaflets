NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nMAVENCLAD 10 mg tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach tablet contains 10 mg of cladribine.\n\nExcipients with known effect\n\nEach tablet contains 64 mg sorbitol.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nTablet.\n\nWhite, round, biconvex tablets of 8.5 mm diameter, engraved with 'C' on one side and '10' on the other \nside.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nMAVENCLAD is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with highly active relapsing multiple \nsclerosis (MS) as defined by clinical or imaging features (see section 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with MAVENCLAD must be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the \ntreatment of MS.\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended cumulative dose of MAVENCLAD is 3.5 mg/kg body weight over 2 years, \nadministered as 1 treatment course of 1.75 mg/kg per year. Each treatment course consists of \n2 treatment weeks, one at the beginning of the first month and one at the beginning of the second \nmonth of the respective treatment year. Each treatment week consists of 4 or 5 days on which a patient \nreceives 10 mg or 20 mg (one or two tablets) as a single daily dose, depending on body weight. For \ndetails, see Tables 1 and 2 below.\n\nFollowing completion of the 2 treatment courses, no further cladribine treatment is required in years 3 \nand 4 (see section 5.1). Re-initiation of therapy after year 4 has not been studied.\n\nCriteria for initiating and continuing therapy\n\nLymphocyte counts must be\n normal before initiating MAVENCLAD in year 1,\n at least 800 cells/mm³ before initiating MAVENCLAD in year 2.\n\nIf necessary, the treatment course in year 2 can be delayed for up to 6 months to allow for recovery of \nlymphocytes. If this recovery takes more than 6 months, the patient should not receive MAVENCLAD \nanymore.\n\n\n\n3\n\nDistribution of dose\n\nThe distribution of the total dose over the 2 years of treatment is provided in Table 1. For some weight \nranges the number of tablets may vary from one treatment week to the next. Use of oral cladribine in \npatients weighing less than 40 kg has not been investigated.\n\nTable 1 Dose of MAVENCLAD per treatment week by patient weight in each treatment year\n\nWeight range Dose in mg (number of 10 mg tablets) per treatment week\n\nkg Treatment week 1 Treatment week 2 \n\n40 to <50 40 mg (4 tablets) 40 mg (4 tablets)\n\n50 to <60 50 mg (5 tablets) 50 mg (5 tablets)\n\n60 to <70 60 mg (6 tablets) 60 mg (6 tablets)\n\n70 to <80 70 mg (7 tablets) 70 mg (7 tablets)\n\n80 to <90 80 mg (8 tablets) 70 mg (7 tablets)\n\n90 to <100 90 mg (9 tablets) 80 mg (8 tablets)\n\n100 to <110 100 mg (10 tablets) 90 mg (9 tablets)\n\n110 and above 100 mg (10 tablets) 100 mg (10 tablets)\n\nTable 2 shows how the total number of tablets per treatment week is distributed over the individual \ndays. It is recommended that the daily cladribine doses in each treatment week be taken at intervals of \n24 hours at approximately the same time each day. If a daily dose consists of two tablets, both tablets \nare taken together as a single dose.\n\nTable 2 MAVENCLAD 10 mg tablets per week day\nTotal number of tablets \n\nper week\nDay 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Day 5\n\n4 1 1 1 1 0\n5 1 1 1 1 1\n6 2 1 1 1 1\n7 2 2 1 1 1\n8 2 2 2 1 1\n9 2 2 2 2 1\n\n10 2 2 2 2 2\n\nA missed dose must be taken as soon as remembered on the same day according to the treatment \nschedule.\n\nA missed dose must not be taken together with the next scheduled dose on the following day. In the \ncase of a missed dose, the patient must take the missed dose on the following day, and extend the \nnumber of days in that treatment week. If two consecutive doses are missed, the same rule applies, and \nthe number of days in the treatment week is extended by two days.\n\nConcomitant use of other oral medicinal products\n\nIt is recommended that administration of any other oral medicinal product be separated from that of \nMAVENCLAD by at least 3 hours during the limited number of days of cladribine administration (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nRenal impairment\n\nNo dedicated studies have been conducted in patients with renal impairment.\n\n\n\n4\n\nIn patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 to 89 mL/min), no dosage adjustment \nis considered necessary (see section 5.2).\n\nSafety and efficacy in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment have not been established. \nTherefore, MAVENCLAD is contraindicated in these patients (see section 4.3).\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nNo studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\nAlthough the importance of hepatic function for the elimination of cladribine is considered negligible \n(see section 5.2), in the absence of data, use of MAVENCLAD is not recommended in patients with \nmoderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >6).\n\nElderly\n\nClinical studies with oral cladribine in MS did not include patients over 65 years of age; therefore, it is \nnot known whether they respond differently from younger patients.\n\nCaution is recommended when MAVENCLAD is used in elderly patients, taking into account the \npotential greater frequency of decreased hepatic or renal function, concomitant diseases and other \nmedicinal therapies.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety and efficacy of MAVENCLAD in patients below the age of 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nMAVENCLAD is for oral use. The tablets must be taken with water, and swallowed without chewing. \nThe tablets can be taken independent of food intake.\n\nAs the tablets are uncoated, they must be swallowed immediately once removed from the blister and \nnot be left exposed on surfaces or handled for any period of time greater than that required for dosing. \nIf a tablet is left on a surface, or if a broken or fragmented tablet is released from the blister, the area \nmust be thoroughly washed.\n\nThe patient's hands must be dry when handling the tablets and washed thoroughly afterwards.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nInfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n\nActive chronic infection (tuberculosis or hepatitis).\n\nInitiation of cladribine treatment in immunocompromised patients, including patients currently \nreceiving immunosuppressive or myelosuppressive therapy (see section 4.5).\n\nActive malignancy.\n\nModerate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60 mL/min) (see section 5.2).\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6).\n\n\n\n5\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHaematological monitoring\n\nCladribine's mode of action is closely linked to a reduction in lymphocyte count. The effect on \nlymphocyte count is dose-dependent. Decreases in neutrophil count, red blood cell count, haematocrit, \nhaemoglobin or platelet count compared to baseline values have also been observed in clinical studies, \nalthough these parameters usually remain within normal limits.\n\nAdditive haematological adverse reactions may be expected if cladribine is administered prior to or \nconcomitantly with other substances that affect the haematological profile (see section 4.5).\n\nLymphocyte counts must be determined\n before initiating MAVENCLAD in year 1,\n before initiating MAVENCLAD in year 2,\n 2 and 6 months after start of treatment in each treatment year. If the lymphocyte count is below \n\n500 cells/mm³, it should be actively monitored until values increase again.\n\nFor treatment decisions based on the patient's lymphocyte counts, see section 4.2 and subsection \n'Infections' below.\n\nInfections\n\nCladribine can reduce the body's immune defence and may increase the likelihood of infections. HIV \ninfection, active tuberculosis and active hepatitis must be excluded before initiation of cladribine (see \nsection 4.3).\n\nLatent infections may be activated, including tuberculosis or hepatitis. Therefore, screening for latent \ninfections, in particular tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, must be performed prior to initiation of \ntherapy in year 1 and year 2. Initiation of MAVENCLAD should be delayed until the infection has \nbeen adequately treated.\n\nA delay in initiation of cladribine should also be considered in patients with an acute infection until \nthe infection is fully controlled.\n\nParticular attention is recommended for patients who have no history of exposure to varicella zoster \nvirus. Vaccination of antibody-negative patients is recommended prior to initiation of cladribine \ntherapy. Initiation of treatment with MAVENCLAD should be postponed for 4 to 6 weeks to allow for \nthe full effect of vaccination to occur.\n\nThe incidence of herpes zoster was increased in patients on cladribine. If lymphocyte counts drop \nbelow 200 cells/mm³, anti-herpes prophylaxis according to local standard practice should be \nconsidered during the time of grade 4 lymphopenia (see section 4.8).\n\nPatients with lymphocyte counts below 500 cells/mm³ should be actively monitored for signs and \nsymptoms suggestive of infections, in particular herpes zoster. If such signs and symptoms occur, anti-\ninfective treatment should be initiated as clinically indicated. Interruption or delay of MAVENCLAD \nmay be considered until proper resolution of the infection.\n\nCases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported for parenteral \ncladribine in patients treated for hairy cell leukaemia with a different treatment regimen.\n\nIn the clinical study data base of cladribine in MS (1,976 patients, 8,650 patient years) no case of PML \nhas been reported. However, a baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed \nbefore initiating MAVENCLAD (usually within 3 months).\n\n\n\n6\n\nMalignancies\n\nIn clinical studies, events of malignancies were observed more frequently in cladribine-treated patients \ncompared to patients who received placebo (see section 4.8).\n\nMAVENCLAD is contraindicated in MS patients with active malignancies (see section 4.3). An \nindividual benefit-risk evaluation should be performed before initiating MAVENCLAD in patients \nwith prior malignancy. Patients treated with MAVENCLAD should be advised to follow standard \ncancer screening guidelines.\n\nContraception\n\nBefore initiation of treatment both in year 1 and year 2, women of childbearing potential and males \nwho could potentially father a child should be counselled regarding the potential for serious risk to the \nfoetus and the need for effective contraception (see section 4.6).\n\nWomen of childbearing potential must prevent pregnancy by use of effective contraception during \ncladribine treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose (see section 4.5).\n\nMale patients must take precautions to prevent pregnancy of their female partner during cladribine \ntreatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose.\n\nBlood transfusions\n\nIn patients who require blood transfusion, irradiation of cellular blood components is recommended \nprior to administration to prevent transfusion-related graft-versus-host disease. Consultation with a \nhaematologist is advised.\n\nSwitching to and from cladribine treatment\n\nIn patients who have previously been treated with immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive \nmedicinal products the mode of action and duration of effect of the other medicinal product should be \nconsidered prior to initiation of MAVENCLAD. A potential additive effect on the immune system \nshould also be considered when such medicinal products are used after treatment with MAVENCLAD \n(see section 4.5).\n\nWhen switching from another MS medicinal product, a baseline MRI should be performed (see \nsubsection 'Infections' above).\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nAlthough the importance of hepatic function for the elimination of cladribine is considered negligible \n(see section 5.2), in the absence of data, use of MAVENCLAD is not recommended in patients with \nmoderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >6) (see section 4.2).\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nMAVENCLAD contains hydroxypropylbetadex, which may be available for complex formation with \nother medicinal products, potentially leading to an increase in bioavailability of such a product \n(especially medicinal products with low solubility). Therefore, it is recommended that administration \nof any other oral medicinal product be separated from that of MAVENCLAD by at least 3 hours \nduring the limited number of days of cladribine administration.\n\nImmunosuppressive medicinal products\n\nInitiation of cladribine treatment is contraindicated in immunocompromised patients, including \npatients currently receiving immunosuppressive or myelosuppressive therapy with, e.g., methotrexate, \n\n\n\n7\n\ncyclophosphamide, cyclosporine or azathioprine, or chronic use of corticosteroids because of a risk of \nadditive effects on the immune system (see section 4.3).\n\nAcute short-term therapy with systemic corticosteroids can be administered during cladribine \ntreatment.\n\nOther disease-modifying medicinal products\n\nThe use of MAVENCLAD with interferon beta results in an increased risk of lymphopenia. Safety and \nefficacy of MAVENCLAD in combination with other disease-modifying treatments for MS have not \nbeen established. Concomitant treatment is not recommended.\n\nHaematotoxic medicinal products\n\nBecause of the cladribine-induced reduction in lymphocyte count, additive haematological adverse \nreactions may be expected if cladribine is administered prior to or concomitantly with other substances \nthat affect the haematological profile (e.g. carbamazepine). Careful monitoring of haematological \nparameters is recommended in such cases.\n\nLive or live attenuated vaccines\n\nTreatment with MAVENCLAD should not be initiated within 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination with live \nor attenuated live vaccines because of a risk of active vaccine infection. Vaccination with live or\nattenuated live vaccines should be avoided during and after cladribine treatment as long as the patient's \nwhite blood cell counts are not within normal limits.\n\nPotent ENT1, CNT3 and BCRP transporter inhibitors\n\nAt the level of cladribine absorption, the only conceivable interaction pathway of clinical relevance \nappears to be the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP or ABCG2). Inhibition of BCRP in the \ngastrointestinal tract may increase the oral bioavailability and systemic exposure of cladribine. Known\nBCRP inhibitors, which may alter the pharmacokinetics of BCRP substrates by 20% in vivo, include \neltrombopag.\n\nIn vitro studies indicate that cladribine is a substrate of the equilibrative nucleoside (ENT1) and \nconcentrative nucleoside (CNT3) transport proteins. Accordingly, the bioavailability, intracellular \ndistribution and renal elimination of cladribine may theoretically be altered by potent ENT1 and CNT3 \ntransporter inhibitors such as dilazep, nifedipine, nimodipine, cilostazol, sulindac or reserpine.\nHowever, net effects in terms of potential cladribine exposure alterations are difficult to predict.\n\nAlthough the clinical relevance of such interactions is unknown, it is recommended that co-\nadministration of potent ENT1, CNT3 or BCRP inhibitors be avoided during the 4- to 5-day cladribine \ntreatment. If this is not possible, selection of alternative concomitant medicinal products with no, or \nminimal ENT1, CNT3 or BCRP transporter inhibiting properties should be considered. If this is not \npossible, dose reduction to the minimum mandatory dose of medicinal products containing these \ncompounds, separation in the timing of administration and careful patient monitoring is recommended.\n\nPotent BCRP and P-gp transporter inducers\n\nThe effects of potent inducers of the efflux transporters BCRP and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) on the \nbioavailability and disposition of cladribine have not been formally studied. A possible decrease in \ncladribine exposure should be considered if potent BCRP (e.g. corticosteroids) or P-gp (e.g.\nrifampicin, St. John's Wort) transporter inducers are co-administered.\n\n\n\n8\n\nHormonal contraceptives\n\nIt is currently unknown whether cladribine may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting \nhormonal contraceptives. Therefore, women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives should \nadd a barrier method during cladribine treatment and for at least 4 weeks after the last dose in each \ntreatment year (see section 4.6).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nContraception in males and females\n\nBefore initiation of treatment both in year 1 and year 2, women of childbearing potential and males \nwho could potentially father a child should be counselled regarding the potential for serious risk to the \nfoetus and the need for effective contraception.\n\nIn women of childbearing potential, pregnancy must be excluded before the initiation of \nMAVENCLAD in year 1 and year 2, and prevented by use of effective contraception during cladribine \ntreatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose. Women using systemically acting hormonal \ncontraceptives should add a barrier method during cladribine treatment and for at least 4 weeks after \nthe last dose in each treatment year (see section 4.5). Women who become pregnant under therapy \nwith MAVENCLAD should discontinue treatment.\n\nAs cladribine interferes with DNA synthesis, adverse effects on human gametogenesis could be \nexpected (see section 5.3). Therefore, male patients must take precautions to prevent pregnancy of \ntheir partner during cladribine treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose.\n\nPregnancy\n\nBased on human experience with other substances inhibiting DNA synthesis, cladribine could cause \ncongenital malformations when administered during pregnancy. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\n\nMAVENCLAD is contraindicated in pregnant women (see section 4.3).\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether cladribine is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious \nadverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding is contraindicated during treatment with \nMAVENCLAD and for 1 week after the last dose (see section 4.3).\n\nFertility\n\nIn mice, there were no effects on fertility or the reproductive function of offspring. However, testicular \neffects were observed in mice and monkeys (see section 5.3).\n\nAs cladribine interferes with DNA synthesis, adverse effects on human gametogenesis could be \nexpected. Therefore, male patients must take precautions to prevent pregnancy of their partner during \ncladribine treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose (see above).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nMAVENCLAD has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n\n\n9\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most clinically relevant adverse reactions reported in MS patients who received cladribine at the \nrecommended cumulative dose of 3.5 mg/kg over 2 years in clinical studies were lymphopenia and \nherpes zoster. The incidence of herpes zoster was higher during the period of grade 3 or 4 \nlymphopenia (<500 to 200 cells/mm³ or <200 cells/mm³) compared to the time when the patients were \nnot experiencing grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia (see section 4.4).\n\nList of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions described in the list below are derived from pooled data from clinical studies in MS \nin which oral cladribine was used as monotherapy at a cumulative dose of 3.5 mg/kg. The safety \ndatabase from these studies comprises 923 patients.\n\nThe following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter:\n\nVery common (≥1/10)\nCommon (≥1/100 to <1/10)\nUncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100)\nRare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000)\nVery rare (<1/10,000)\nFrequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)\n\nInfections and infestations\n\nCommon: Oral herpes, dermatomal herpes zoster.\nVery rare: Tuberculosis (see section 4.4).\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders\n\nVery common: Lymphopenia.\nCommon: Decrease in neutrophil count.\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\n\nCommon: Rash, alopecia.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nLymphopenia\n\nIn clinical studies, 20% to 25% of the patients treated with a cumulative dose of cladribine 3.5 mg/kg \nover 2 years as monotherapy developed transient grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia. Grade 4 lymphopenia was \nseen in less than 1% of the patients. The largest proportion of patients with grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia \nwas seen 2 months after the first cladribine dose in each year (4.0% and 11.3% of patients with \ngrade 3 lymphopenia in year 1 and year 2, 0% and 0.4% of patients with grade 4 lymphopenia in \nyear 1 and year 2). It is expected that most patients recover to either normal lymphocyte counts or \ngrade 1 lymphopenia within 9 months.\n\nTo decrease the risk for severe lymphopenia, lymphocyte counts must be determined before, during \nand after cladribine treatment (see section 4.4) and strict criteria for initiating and continuing \ncladribine treatment must be followed (see section 4.2).\n\n\n\n10\n\nMalignancies\n\nIn clinical studies and long-term follow-up of patients treated with a cumulative dose of 3.5 mg/kg \noral cladribine, events of malignancies were observed more frequently in cladribine-treated patients \n(10 events in 3,414 patient-years [0.29 events per 100 patient-years]) compared to patients who \nreceived placebo (3 events in 2,022 patient-years [0.15 events per 100 patient-years]) (see section 4.4).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is limited experience with overdose of oral cladribine. Lymphopenia is known to be dose-\ndependent (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nParticularly close monitoring of haematological parameters is recommended in patients who have been \nexposed to an overdose of cladribine.\n\nThere is no known specific antidote to an overdose of cladribine. Treatment consists of careful \nobservation and initiation of appropriate supportive measures. Discontinuation of MAVENCLAD may \nneed to be considered. Because of the rapid and extensive intracellular and tissue distribution, \nhaemodialysis is unlikely to eliminate cladribine to a significant extent.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Selective Immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AA40\n\nMechanism of action\n\nCladribine is a nucleoside analogue of deoxyadenosine. A chlorine substitution in the purine ring \nprotects cladribine from degradation by adenosine deaminase, increasing the intracellular residence \ntime of the cladribine prodrug. Subsequent phosphorylation of cladribine to its active triphosphate \nform, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine triphosphate (Cd-ATP), is particularly efficiently achieved in \nlymphocytes, due to their constitutively high deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) and relatively low \n5'-nucleotidase (5'-NTase) levels. A high DCK to 5'-NTase ratio favours the accumulation of Cd-ATP, \nmaking lymphocytes particularly susceptible to cell death. As a result of a lower DCK/5'-NTase ratio \nother bone marrow derived cells are less affected than lymphocytes. DCK is the rate limiting enzyme \nfor conversion of the cladribine prodrug into its active triphosphate form, leading to selective \ndepletion of dividing and non-dividing T and B cells.\n\nThe primary apoptosis-inducing mechanism of action of Cd-ATP has direct and indirect actions on \nDNA synthesis and mitochondrial function. In dividing cells, Cd-ATP interferes with DNA synthesis \nvia inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase and competes with deoxyadenosine triphosphate for \nincorporation into DNA by DNA polymerases. In resting cells cladribine causes DNA single-strand \nbreaks, rapid nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide consumption, ATP depletion and cell death. There is \nevidence that cladribine can also cause direct caspase-dependent and -independent apoptosis via the \nrelease of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor into the cytosol of non-dividing cells.\n\n\n\n11\n\nMS pathology involves a complex chain of events in which different immune cell types, including \nautoreactive T and B cells play a key role. The mechanism by which cladribine exerts its therapeutic \neffects in MS is not fully elucidated but its predominant effect on B and T lymphocytes is thought to \ninterrupt the cascade of immune events central to MS.\n\nVariations in the expression levels of DCK and 5'-NTases between immune cell subtypes may explain \ndifferences in immune cell sensitivity to cladribine. Because of these expression levels, cells of the \ninnate immune system are less affected than cells of the adaptive immune system.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nCladribine has been shown to exert long-lasting effects by preferentially targeting lymphocytes and \nthe autoimmune processes involved in the pathophysiology of MS.\n\nAcross studies, the largest proportion of patients with grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia (<500 to \n200 cells/mm³ or <200 cells/mm³) was seen 2 months after the first cladribine dose in each year, \nindicating a time gap between cladribine plasma concentrations and the maximum haematological \neffect.\n\nAcross clinical studies, data with the proposed cumulative dose of 3.5 mg/kg body weight show a \ngradual improvement in the median lymphocyte counts back to the normal range at week 84 from the \nfirst dose of cladribine (approximately 30 weeks after the last dose of cladribine). The lymphocyte \ncounts of more than 75% of patients returned to the normal range by week 144 from the first dose of \ncladribine (approximately 90 weeks after the last dose of cladribine).\n\nTreatment with oral cladribine leads to rapid reductions in circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. CD8+ \nT cells have a less pronounced decrease and a faster recovery than CD4+ T cells, resulting in a \ntemporarily decreased CD4 to CD8 ratio. Cladribine reduces CD19+ B cells and CD16+/CD56+ \nnatural killer cells, which also recover faster than CD4+ T cells.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nRelapsing-remitting MS\n\nEfficacy and safety of oral cladribine were evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled clinical study (CLARITY) in 1,326 patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Study objectives \nwere to evaluate the efficacy of cladribine versus placebo in reducing the annualised relapse rate \n(ARR) (primary endpoint), slowing disability progression and decreasing active lesions as measured \nby MRI.\n\nPatients received either placebo (n = 437), or a cumulative dose of cladribine of 3.5 mg/kg (n = 433) \nor 5.25 mg/kg body weight (n = 456) over the 96-week (2-year) study period in 2 treatment courses. \nPatients randomised to the 3.5 mg/kg cumulative dose received a first treatment course at weeks 1 and \n5 of the first year and a second treatment course at weeks 1 and 5 of the second year. Patients \nrandomised to the 5.25 mg/kg cumulative dose received additional treatment at weeks 9 and 13 of the \nfirst year. The majority of patients in the placebo (87.0%) and the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg (91.9%) and \n5.25 mg/kg (89.0%) treatment groups completed the full 96 weeks of the study.\n\nPatients were required to have at least 1 relapse in the previous 12 months. In the overall study \npopulation, the median age was 39 years (range 18 to 65), and the female to male ratio was \napproximately 2:1. The mean duration of MS prior to study enrolment was 8.7 years, and the median \nbaseline neurological disability based on Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score \nacross all treatment groups was 3.0 (range 0 to 6.0). Over two thirds of the study patients were \ntreatment-naive for MS disease-modifying drugs (DMDs). The remaining patients were pre-treated \nwith either interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, glatiramer acetate or natalizumab.\n\n\n\n12\n\nPatients with relapsing-remitting MS receiving cladribine 3.5 mg/kg showed statistically significantly \nimprovements in the annualised relapse rate, proportion of patients relapse-free over 96 weeks, \nproportion of patients free of sustained disability over 96 weeks and time to 3-month EDSS \nprogression compared to patients on placebo (see Table 3).\n\nTable 3 Clinical outcomes in the CLARITY study (96 weeks)\n\nParameter\nPlacebo\n(n = 437)\n\nCladribine cumulative dose\n3.5 mg/kg\n(n = 433)\n\n5.25 mg/kg\n(n = 456)\n\nAnnualised relapse rate (95% CI) 0.33 (0.29, 0.38) 0.14* (0.12, 0.17) 0.15* (0.12, 0.17)\nRelative reduction (cladribine vs. \nplacebo)\n\n57.6% 54.5%\n\nProportion of patients relapse-free \nover 96 weeks\n\n60.9% 79.7% 78.9%\n\nTime to 3-month EDSS progression, \n10th percentile (months)\n\n10.8 13.6 13.6\n\nHazard ratio (95% CI)\n0.67 (0.48, 0.93)\n\np = 0.018\n0.69 (0.49, 0.96)\n\np = 0.026\n* p <0.001 compared to placebo\n\nIn addition, the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg treatment group was statistically significantly superior to placebo \nwith regard to number and relative reduction of T1 Gd+ lesions, active T2 lesions and combined \nunique lesions as demonstrated in brain MRI over the entire 96 weeks of the study. Patients taking \ncladribine compared to the placebo treatment group had 86% relative reduction in the mean number of \nT1 Gd+ lesions (adjusted mean number for cladribine 3.5 mg/kg, and placebo groups were 0.12 and \n0.91, respectively), 73% relative reduction in the mean number of active T2 lesions (adjusted mean \nnumber for cladribine 3.5 mg/kg, and placebo groups were 0.38 and 1.43, respectively) and 74% \nrelative reduction in the mean number of combined unique lesions per patient per scan (adjusted mean \nnumber for cladribine 3.5 mg/kg, and placebo groups were 0.43 and 1.72, respectively) (p <0.001 \nacross all 3 MRI outcomes).\n\nPost-hoc analysis of time to 6-month confirmed EDSS progression resulted in a 47% reduction of the \nrisk of disability progression in the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg compared to placebo (hazard ratio = 0.53, \n95% CI [0.36, 0.79], p <0.05); in the placebo group the 10th percentile was reached at 245 days, and \nnot reached at all during the study period in the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg group.\n\nAs shown in Table 3 above, higher cumulative doses did not add any clinically meaningful benefit, but \nwere associated with a higher incidence in ≥grade 3 lymphopenia (44.9% in the 5.25 mg/kg group vs. \n25.6% in the 3.5 mg/kg group).\n\nPatients who had completed the CLARITY study could be enrolled in CLARITY Extension. In this \nextension study, 806 patients received either placebo or a cumulative dose of cladribine 3.5 mg/kg (in \na regimen similar to that used in CLARITY) over the 96-week study period. The primary objective of \nthis study was safety, while efficacy endpoints were exploratory.\n\nThe magnitude of the effect in reducing the frequency of relapses and slowing disability progression in \npatients receiving the 3.5 mg/kg dose over 2 years was maintained in years 3 and 4 (see section 4.2).\n\nEfficacy in patients with high disease activity\n\nPost-hoc subgroup efficacy analyses have been conducted in patients with high disease activity treated \nwith oral cladribine at the recommended 3.5 mg/kg cumulative dose. These included\n patients with 1 relapse in the previous year and at least 1 T1 Gd+ lesion or 9 or more T2 lesions, \n\nwhile on therapy with other DMDs,\n patients with 2 or more relapses in the previous year, whether on DMD treatment or not.\n\n\n\n13\n\nIn the analyses of the CLARITY data, a consistent treatment effect on relapses was observed with the \nannualised relapse rate ranging from 0.16 to 0.18 in the cladribine groups and 0.47 to 0.50 in the \nplacebo group (p <0.0001). Compared to the overall population, a greater effect was observed in time \nto 6-month sustained disability where cladribine reduced the risk of disability progression by 82% \n(hazard ratio = 0.18, 95% CI [0.07, 0.47]). For placebo the 10th percentile for disability progression \nwas reached between 16 and 23 weeks, while for the cladribine groups it was not reached during the \nentire study.\n\nSecondary progressive MS with relapses\n\nA supportive study in patients treated with cladribine as an add-on to interferon beta vs. placebo + \ninterferon beta also included a limited number of patients with secondary progressive MS \n(26 patients). In these patients, treatment with cladribine 3.5 mg/kg resulted in a reduction of the \nannualised relapse rate compared to placebo (0.03 versus 0.30, risk ratio: 0.11, p <0.05). There was no \ndifference in annualised relapse rate between patients with relapsing-remitting MS and patients with \nsecondary progressive MS with relapses. An effect on disability progression could not be shown in \neither subgroup.\n\nPatients with secondary progressive MS were excluded in the CLARITY study. However, a post-hoc \nanalysis of a mixed cohort including CLARITY and ONWARD patients, defined by a baseline EDSS \nscore of ≥3.5 as a proxy for secondary progressive MS, showed a similar reduction in annualised \nrelapse rate compared to patients with an EDSS score below 3.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nMAVENCLAD in all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple sclerosis (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nCladribine is a prodrug that has to be phosphorylated intracellularly to become biologically active. \nCladribine pharmacokinetics were studied following oral and intravenous administration in MS \npatients and patients with malignancies, and in in vitro systems.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing oral administration, cladribine is rapidly absorbed. Administration of 10 mg cladribine \nresulted in a cladribine mean Cmax in the range of 22 to 29 ng/mL and corresponding mean AUC in the \nrange of 80 to 101 ngh/mL (arithmetic means from various studies).\n\nWhen oral cladribine was given in fasted state, median Tmax was 0.5 h (range 0.5 to 1.5 h). When \nadministered with a high-fat meal, cladribine absorption was delayed (median Tmax 1.5 h, range 1 to \n3 h) and Cmax was reduced by 29% (based on geometric mean), while AUC was unchanged. The \nbioavailability of 10 mg oral cladribine was approximately 40%.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe volume of distribution is large, indicating extensive tissue distribution and intracellular uptake. \nStudies revealed a mean volume of distribution of cladribine in the range of 480 to 490 L. The plasma \nprotein binding of cladribine is 20%, and independent of plasma concentration.\n\nThe distribution of cladribine across biological membranes is facilitated by various transport proteins, \nincluding ENT1, CNT3 and BCRP.\n\n\n\n14\n\nIn vitro studies indicate that cladribine efflux is only minimally P-gp related. Clinically relevant \ninteractions with inhibitors of P-gp are not expected. The potential consequences of P-gp induction on \nthe bioavailability of cladribine have not been formally studied.\n\nIn vitro studies showed negligible transporter-mediated uptake of cladribine into human hepatocytes.\n\nCladribine has the potential to penetrate the blood brain barrier. A small study in cancer patients has \nshown a cerebrospinal fluid/plasma concentration ratio of approximately 0.25.\n\nCladribine and/or its phosphorylated metabolites are substantially accumulated and retained in human \nlymphocytes. In vitro, intra- versus extracellular accumulation ratios were found to be around 30 to 40 \nalready 1 hour after cladribine exposure.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nThe metabolism of cladribine was studied in MS patients following the administration of a single \n10-mg tablet and a single 3-mg intravenous dose. Following both oral and intravenous administration, \nthe parent compound cladribine was the main component present in plasma and urine. The metabolite \n2-chloroadenine was a minor metabolite both in plasma and in urine, e.g. accounting only for ≤3% of \nplasma parent drug exposure after oral administration. Only traces of other metabolites could be found \nin plasma and in urine.\n\nIn hepatic in vitro systems, negligible metabolism of cladribine was observed (at least 90% was \nunchanged cladribine).\n\nCladribine is not a relevant substrate to cytochrome P450 enzymes and does not show significant \npotential to act as inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 \nand CYP3A4. Inhibition of these enzymes or genetic polymorphisms (e.g. CYP2D6, CYP2C9 or \nCYP2C19) are not expected to result in clinically significant effects on cladribine pharmacokinetics or \nexposure. Cladribine has no clinically meaningful inductive effect on CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and \nCYP3A4 enzymes.\n\nAfter entering the target cells, cladribine is phosphorylated to cladribine monophosphate (Cd-AMP) \nby DCK (and also by deoxyguanosine kinase in the mitochondria). Cd-AMP is further phosphorylated \nto cladribine diphosphate (Cd-ADP) and cladribine triphosphate (Cd-ATP). The dephosphorylation \nand deactivation of Cd-AMP is catalysed by cytoplasmic 5'-NTase. In a study of the intracellular \npharmacokinetics of Cd-AMP and Cd-ATP in patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia, the \nlevels of Cd-ATP were approximately half of the Cd-AMP levels.\n\nIntracellular half-life of Cd-AMP was 15 h. Intracellular half-life of Cd-ATP was 10 h.\n\nElimination\n\nBased on pooled population pharmacokinetic data from various studies, the median values for \nelimination were 22.2 L/h for renal clearance and 23.4 L/h for non-renal clearance. Renal clearance \nexceeded the glomerular filtration rate, indicating active renal tubular secretion of cladribine.\n\nThe non-renal part of the elimination of cladribine (approximately 50%) consists of negligible hepatic \nmetabolism and of extensive intracellular distribution and trapping of the active cladribine principle \n(Cd-ATP) within the targeted intracellular compartment (i.e. the lymphocytes) and subsequent \nelimination of intracellular Cd-ATP according to the life-cycle and elimination pathways of these \ncells.\n\nThe estimated terminal half-life for a typical patient from the population pharmacokinetic analysis is \napproximately 1 day. This however does not result in any drug accumulation after once daily dosing as \nthis half-life only accounts for a small portion of the AUC.\n\n\n\n15\n\nDose and time dependence\n\nAfter oral administration of cladribine across a dose range from 3 to 20 mg, Cmax and AUC increased \nin a dose-proportional fashion, suggesting that absorption is not affected by rate- or capacity-limited \nprocesses up to a 20 mg oral dose.\n\nNo significant accumulation of cladribine concentration in plasma has been observed after repeated \ndosing. There is no indication that cladribine pharmacokinetics might change in a time-dependent \nfashion after repeated administration.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nNo studies have been conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of cladribine in elderly or in \npaediatric MS patients, or in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment.\n\nA population kinetic analysis did not show any effect of age (range 18 to 65 years) or gender on \ncladribine pharmacokinetics.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nRenal clearance of cladribine was shown to be dependent on creatinine clearance. Based on a \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis including patients with normal renal function and with mild renal \nimpairment, total clearance in patients with mild renal impairment (CLCR = 60 mL/min) is expected to \ndecrease moderately, leading to an increase in exposure of 25%.\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nThe role of hepatic function for the elimination of cladribine is considered negligible.\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions\n\nA drug interaction study in MS patients showed that the bioavailability of 10 mg oral cladribine was \nnot altered when co-administered with pantoprazole.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical safety pharmacological and toxicological assessment of cladribine in animal models \nrelevant for the safety assessment of cladribine did not yield significant findings other than those \npredicted by the pharmacologic mechanism of cladribine. The primary target organs identified in the \nrepeat-dose toxicology studies by parenteral routes (intravenous or subcutaneous) up to 1-year \nduration in mice and monkeys were the lymphoid and haematopoietic system. Other target organs \nafter longer administration (14 cycles) of cladribine to monkeys by subcutaneous route were the \nkidneys (karyomegaly of renal tubular epithelium), adrenals (cortex atrophy and decreased \nvacuolation), gastrointestinal tract (mucosa atrophy) and testes. Effects on the kidneys were also seen \nin mice.\n\nMutagenicity\n\nCladribine is incorporated into DNA strands and inhibits DNA synthesis and repair. Cladribine did not \ninduce gene mutation in bacteria or mammalian cells, but it was clastogenic causing chromosomal \ndamage in mammalian cells in vitro at a concentration which was 17-fold above the expected clinical \nCmax. In vivo clastogenicity in mice was detected at 10 mg/kg, which was the lowest dose tested.\n\n\n\n16\n\nCarcinogenicity\n\nThe carcinogenic potential of cladribine was assessed in a long-term 22-month study with \nsubcutaneous administration in mice and in a short-term 26-week study by oral route in transgenic \nmice.\n\n In the long-term carcinogenicity study in mice, the highest dose used was 10 mg/kg, which was \nseen to be genotoxic in the mouse micronucleus study (equivalent to approximately 16-fold the \nexpected human exposure in AUC in patients taking the maximum daily dose of 20 mg \ncladribine). No increased incidence of lymphoproliferative disorders or other tumour types \n(apart from Harderian gland tumours, predominantly adenomas) was seen in mice. Harderian \ngland tumours are not considered to be of clinical relevance, as humans do not have comparable \nanatomical structures.\n\n In the short-term carcinogenicity study in Tg rasH2 mice, no cladribine-related increase in \nincidence of lymphoproliferative disorders or other tumour types was seen at any dose tested up \nto 30 mg/kg per day (equivalent to approximately 25-fold the expected human exposure in AUC \nin patients taking the maximum daily dose of 20 mg cladribine).\n\nCladribine was also assessed in a 1-year monkey study by the subcutaneous route. No increased \nincidence in lymphoproliferative disorders and no tumours were seen in this study.\n\nAlthough cladribine may have a potential for genotoxicity, long-term data in mice and monkeys did \nnot provide any evidence of a relevant increased carcinogenicity risk in humans.\n\nReproduction toxicity\n\nWhile there were no effects on female fertility, reproductive function or general performance of \noffspring, cladribine was shown to be embryolethal when administered to pregnant mice, and the \ncompound was teratogenic in mice (also following treatment of the males only) and rabbits. The \nobserved embryolethal and teratogenic effects are consistent with the pharmacologic mechanisms of \ncladribine. In a male mouse fertility study, malformed foetuses with agenesis of portions of \nappendage(s) distal the humerus and/or femur were seen. The incidence of affected mouse foetuses in \nthis study was in the same range of spontaneous incidence of amelia and phocomelia in this strain of \nmice. However, considering cladribine genotoxicity, male-mediated effects related to potential genetic \nalteration of differentiating sperm cells cannot be excluded.\n\nCladribine did not affect the fertility of male mice, but observed testicular effects were reduced \ntesticular weights and increased numbers of non-motile sperm. Testicular degeneration and reversible \ndecrease in spermatozoa with rapid progressive motility were also seen in the monkey. Histologically, \ntesticular degeneration was only seen in one male monkey in a 1-year subcutaneous toxicity study.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What MAVENCLAD is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take MAVENCLAD\n3. How to take MAVENCLAD\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store MAVENCLAD\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What MAVENCLAD is and what it is used for\n\nMAVENCLAD contains the active substance cladribine, a cytotoxic (cell killing) substance that works \nmostly on lymphocytes, cells of the immune system that are involved in inflammation.\n\nMAVENCLAD is a medicine used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS) in adults. MS is a disease in \nwhich inflammation destroys the protective sheath around the nerves.\n\nTreatment with MAVENCLAD has been shown to reduce flare-ups of symptoms and to slow down \nprogression of disability.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take MAVENCLAD\n\nDo not take MAVENCLAD\n\n- if you are allergic to cladribine or any of the other ingredients of MAVENCLAD (listed in \nsection 6).\n\n- if you are HIV positive, meaning you are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus \n(HIV).\n\n- if you have active tuberculosis or liver inflammation (hepatitis).\n\n- if you have a weakened immune system due to medical conditions or because you are taking \nother medicines that weaken your immune system or reduce the production of blood cells in \nyour bone marrow. These include:\n- ciclosporin, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine (used to suppress the immune system, \n\nfor example after organ transplantation);\n- methotrexate (used to treat conditions such as psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis);\n- long-term corticosteroids (used to reduce inflammation, for example in asthma).\nSee also 'Other medicines and MAVENCLAD'.\n\n\n\n31\n\n- if you have active cancer.\n\n- if you have moderate or severe kidney problems.\n\n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding (see also 'Pregnancy and breast-feeding').\n\nDo not take MAVENCLAD and talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure if any of the \nabove applies to you.\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking MAVENCLAD.\n\nBlood tests\n\nYou will have blood tests before you start treatment to check that you can take MAVENCLAD. The \ndoctor will also do blood tests during and after treatment to check that you can continue to take \nMAVENCLAD, and that you are not developing any complications from the treatment.\n\nInfections\n\nYou will be tested to see if you have any infections before you start MAVENCLAD treatment. It is \nimportant to talk to your doctor if you think you have an infection. Symptoms of infections can \ninclude: fever, aching, painful muscles, headache, generally feeling unwell or yellowing of the eyes.\nYour doctor may delay treatment, or interrupt it, until the infection clears up.\n\nShingles\n\nIf necessary, you will be vaccinated against shingles before you start treatment. You will need to wait \nbetween 4 and 6 weeks for the vaccination to take effect. Tell your doctor immediately if you get \nsymptoms of shingles, a common complication of MAVENCLAD (see section 4), which may need \nspecific treatment.\n\nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\n\nIf you believe your MS is getting worse or if you notice any new symptoms, for example changes in \nmood or behaviour, memory lapses, speech and communication difficulties, talk to your doctor as \nsoon as possible. These may be the symptoms of a rare brain disorder caused by infection and called \nprogressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a serious condition that may lead to \nsevere disability or death. \n\nAlthough PML has not been observed with MAVENCLAD, as a precaution, you may have a head \nMRI (magnetic resonance imaging) before you start treatment.\n\nCancer\n\nSingle events of cancer have been observed in patients who had received cladribine in clinical studies. \nTalk to your doctor if you have previously had cancer. Your doctor will decide the best treatment \noptions for you. As a precautionary measure, you should follow standard cancer screening \nrecommendations, as advised by your doctor.\n\nContraception\n\nMen and women must use effective contraception during MAVENCLAD treatment and for at least \n6 months after the last dose. This is important because MAVENCLAD can seriously harm your baby.\n\n\n\n32\n\nSee also 'Pregnancy and breast-feeding'.\n\nBlood transfusions\n\nIf you require blood transfusions, tell the doctor that you are taking MAVENCLAD. You may have to \nhave the blood irradiated to prevent complications.\n\nChanging treatments\n\nIf you change from other MS treatments to MAVENCLAD, your doctor will check that your blood \ncell counts (lymphocytes) are normal before you start treatment.\n\nIf you change from MAVENCLAD to other MS treatments, talk to your doctor. There can be overlaps \nin the effect on your immune system.\n\nLiver problems\n\nTalk to your doctor before taking MAVENCLAD if you have liver problems.\n\nChildren and adolescents\n\nUse of MAVENCLAD is not recommended in patients below the age of 18 years, because it has not \nbeen investigated in this age group.\n\nOther medicines and MAVENCLAD\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nDo not start MAVENCLAD together with medicines that weaken your immune system or reduce the \nproduction of blood cells by your bone marrow. These include:\n\n- ciclosporin, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine (used to suppress the immune system, for \nexample after organ transplantation);\n\n- methotrexate (used to treat conditions such as psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis);\n\n- long-term corticosteroids (used to reduce inflammation, for example in asthma). Short-term \ncorticosteroids can be used when advised by your doctor.\n\nDo not use MAVENCLAD together with other medicines for MS unless specifically advised by your \ndoctor. Such medicines include alemtuzumab, daclizumab, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, glatiramer \nacetate, interferon beta, natalizumab or teriflunomide.\n\nDo not take MAVENCLAD at the same time as any other medicine. Leave a gap of at least \n3 hours between taking MAVENCLAD and other medicines taken by mouth. MAVENCLAD \ncontains hydroxypropylbetadex that may interact with other medicines in your stomach.\n\nTalk to your doctor, if you are or have been treated with:\n\n- medicines which may affect your blood cells (for example carbamazepine, used to treat \nepilepsy). Your doctor may need to supervise you more closely.\n\n- certain types of vaccines (live and live attenuated vaccines). If you have been vaccinated within \nthe last 4 to 6 weeks, MAVENCLAD therapy must be delayed. You must not receive such \nvaccines during MAVENCLAD treatment. Your immune system must have recovered before \nyou can be vaccinated, and blood tests will check this.\n\n\n\n33\n\n- dilazep, nifedipine, nimodipine, reserpine, cilostazol or sulindac (used to treat the heart, high \nblood pressure, vascular conditions or inflammation), or eltrombopag (used to treat conditions \nassociated with bleeding). Your doctor will tell you what to do if you have to take these \nmedicines.\n\n- rifampicin (used to treat certain types of infection), St. John's wort (used to treat depression) or \ncorticosteroids (used to suppress inflammation). Your doctor will tell you what to do if you \nhave to take these medicines.\n\nTalk to your doctor if you take hormonal contraceptives (e.g. \"the pill\"). You need a second method \nof contraception during MAVENCLAD treatment and for at least 4 weeks after the last dose.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\nDo not take MAVENCLAD if you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant. This is important \nbecause MAVENCLAD may seriously harm your baby.\n\nYou must use effective methods of contraception to avoid becoming pregnant during \nMAVENCLAD treatment and for 6 months after taking the last dose. Talk to your doctor if you take \nhormonal contraceptives (e.g. \"the pill\"). You need a second method of contraception during \nMAVENCLAD treatment and for at least 4 weeks after the last dose. If you get pregnant more than \n6 months after the last dose in year 1, no safety risk is expected but this will mean that you cannot \nreceive treatment with MAVENCLAD while you are pregnant.\n\nIf you are male, you must use effective methods of contraception to prevent your partner from getting \npregnant, whilst you are treated with MAVENCLAD and for 6 months after the last dose.\n\nYour doctor will give you guidance on appropriate methods of contraception.\n\nDo not take MAVENCLAD, if you are breast-feeding. If your doctor believes that MAVENCLAD is \nessential for you, your doctor will advise you to stop breast-feeding.\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nMAVENCLAD does not affect your ability to drive or use machines.\n\nMAVENCLAD contains sorbitol\n\nThis medicine contains 64 mg sorbitol in each tablet.\n\n3. How to take MAVENCLAD\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.\n\nTreatment courses\n\nYou will be given MAVENCLAD as two treatment courses over 2 years.\nEach treatment course consists of 2 treatment weeks, which are one month apart at the beginning of \neach treatment year.\nA treatment week consists of 4 or 5 days on which you receive 1 or 2 tablets daily (see Table 1).\n\n\n\n34\n\nExample: if you start your treatment mid April, you take your tablets as shown.\n\nTable 1\n\nYear 1 Year 2\n\n1st treatment week 1 or 2 tablets daily for 4 \nor 5 days, mid April\n\n1st treatment week 1 or 2 tablets daily for 4 or \n5 days, mid April\n\n2nd treatment week 1 or 2 tablets daily for 4 \nor 5 days, mid May\n\n2nd treatment week 1 or 2 tablets daily for 4 or \n5 days, mid May\n\nBefore you start a treatment course, your doctor will do a blood test to check that the levels of \nlymphocytes (a type of white blood cells) are in an acceptable range. If this is not the case, your \ntreatment will be delayed.\n\nOnce you have completed the 2 treatment courses over 2 years, your doctor will continue to monitor \nyour health for another 2 years, in which you do not need to take the medicine.\n\nDose\n\n1. You will be prescribed the correct number of tablets for each treatment week, based on your \nbody weight as shown in Table 2.\n\n2. You will need one or more packs to provide the correct number of tablets.\n3. When you receive your supply of medicine, check that you have the correct number of tablets.\n4. In the left column of the table below find the row that fits your body weight (in kg), and then \n\ncheck the number of tablets that should be in the pack(s) for the treatment week you will be \nstarting.\n\n5. If the number of tablets in your pack(s) is different from the number shown for your weight in \nthe table below, speak to your doctor. \n\n6. Note that for some weight ranges the number of tablets may vary from one treatment week to \nthe next.\n\nExample: if you weigh 85 kg and are about to start treatment week 1, you will be given 8 tablets.\n\nTable 2\n\nYour weight Number of tablets to take\n\nYear 1 treatment course Year 2 treatment course\n\nTreatment \nweek 1\n\nTreatment \nweek 2\n\nTreatment \nweek 1\n\nTreatment \nweek 2\n\nless than 40 kg Your doctor will tell you the number of tablets to take\n\n40 to less than 50 kg 4 4 4 4\n\n50 to less than 60 kg 5 5 5 5\n\n60 to less than 70 kg 6 6 6 6\n\n70 to less than 80 kg 7 7 7 7\n\n80 to less than 90 kg 8 7 8 7\n\n90 to less than 100 kg 9 8 9 8\n\n100 to less than 110 kg 10 9 10 9\n\n110 kg and above 10 10 10 10\n\nHow to take your medicine\n\nTake the tablet(s) at about the same time each day. Swallow them without chewing. You do not have \nto take the tablets at meal times. You can take them with meals or between meals.\n\n\n\n35\n\nRead the 'Step-by-Step Guide' at the end of this package leaflet on how to handle the child-\nresistant package and how to take the tablets included in the pack.\n\nImportant\n\n- Ensure your hands are dry before picking up your tablet(s).\n- Push your tablet(s) through the blister and swallow immediately.\n- Do not leave your tablet(s) exposed on surfaces, for example on a table, or handle the tablet \n\nlonger than necessary.\n- If a tablet is left on a surface or if it breaks and fragments fall from the blister, the area must be \n\nthoroughly washed.\n- Thoroughly wash your hands after handling the tablets.\n- If you lose a tablet, contact your doctor for advice.\n\nDuration of a treatment week\n\nDepending on the total number of tablets you have been prescribed, you have to take them over 4 or \n5 days, in each treatment week.\nTable 3 shows how many tablets (1 or 2 tablets) you have to take on each day. If your daily dose is \n2 tablets, take them at the same time.\n\nExample: if you have to take 8 tablets, you would take 2 tablets on Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, then 1 tablet\non Day 4 and Day 5.\n\nTable 3\n\nTotal number of tablets \nper treatment week\n\nDay 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Day 5\n\n4 1 1 1 1 0\n\n5 1 1 1 1 1\n\n6 2 1 1 1 1\n\n7 2 2 1 1 1\n\n8 2 2 2 1 1\n\n9 2 2 2 2 1\n\n10 2 2 2 2 2\n\nIf you take more MAVENCLAD than you should\n\nIf you have taken more tablets than you should, contact your doctor immediately. Your doctor will \ndecide if you need to stop treatment or not.\n\nThere is limited experience with overdose of MAVENCLAD. It is known that the more medicine you \ntake the less lymphocytes may be present in your body, resulting in lymphopenia (see section 4).\n\nIf you forget to take MAVENCLAD\n\nIf you miss a dose and you remember on \nthe same day you were supposed to take it\n\nIf you miss a dose and do not remember it until \nthe following day\n\nTake the missed dose on that day. Do not take the missed dose along with the next \nscheduled dose.\nTake the missed dose on the next day and extend the \nnumber of days in that treatment week.\n\n\n\n36\n\nExample: If you forget to take the Day 3 dose and do not remember it until Day 4, take the Day 3 dose \non Day 4, and extend the total number of days in the treatment week by 1 day. If you miss \n2 consecutive doses (for example both Day 3 and Day 4 doses), take the missed doses for the next \n2 days, and then extend the treatment week by 2 days.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nLymphopenia and shingles\n\nThe most important side effect is a reduction in the number of white blood cells called lymphocytes \n(lymphopenia), which is very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) and may be severe. \nLymphopenia may increase the risk of getting an infection. An infection commonly seen with \nMAVENCLAD is shingles.\n\nTell your doctor immediately if you have symptoms of shingles such as a 'band' of severe pain and \nblistering rash, typically on one side of the upper body or the face. Other symptoms may be headache, \nburning, tingling, numbness or itchiness of the skin in the affected area, feeling generally unwell or \nfeverish in the early stages of infection.\n\nShingles will need to be treated, and MAVENCLAD treatment may need to be stopped until the \ninfection is cleared.\n\nOther common side effects - may affect up to 1 in 10 people\n- cold sore (oral herpes)\n- rash\n- hair loss\n- reduction in the number of certain white blood cells (neutrophils)\n\nVery rare side effect - may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people\n- tuberculosis\n\nReporting of side effects\n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine.\n\n5.
