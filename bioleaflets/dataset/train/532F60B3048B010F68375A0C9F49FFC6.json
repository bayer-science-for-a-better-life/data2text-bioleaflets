This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nMepsevii 2 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach mL of concentrate contains 2 mg vestronidase alfa*. Each vial of 5 mL concentrate contains \n10 mg vestronidase alfa. \n \n \n*Vestronidase alfa is a recombinant form of human beta-glucuronidase (rhGUS) and is produced in \nChinese Hamster Ovary cell culture by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect \n \nEach vial contains 17.8 mg sodium. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate).  \nColourless to slightly yellow solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMepsevii is indicated for the treatment of non-neurological manifestations of Mucopolysaccharidosis \nVII (MPS VII; Sly syndrome).  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be supervised by a healthcare professional experienced in the management of \npatients with MPS VII or other inherited metabolic disorders. Administration of vestronidase alfa \nshould be carried out by an appropriately trained healthcare professional with the ability to manage \nmedical emergencies. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of vestronidase alfa is 4 mg/kg of body weight administered by intravenous \ninfusion every two weeks. \n \nTo minimise the risk of hypersensitivity reactions, a non-sedating antihistamine with or without an \nantipyretic medicinal product should be administered 30-60 minutes prior to the start of the infusion \n(see section 4.4). Infusion should be avoided if the patient has an acute febrile or respiratory illness at \nthe time. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThe safety and efficacy of vestronidase alfa in patients older than 65 years have not been established. \nNo alternative dose regimen is recommended in these patients (see section 5.1).  \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nThe safety and efficacy of vestronidase alfa in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been \nevaluated. No alternative dose regimen is recommended in these patients. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe posology in the paediatric population is the same as in adults. Currently available data are \ndescribed in section 4.8 and section 5.1.  \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nFor intravenous use only. \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \nThe total diluted volume of the solution for infusion should be administered with a rate titration \nregimen over approximately 4 hours. \n \nThe rate of infusion should be as follows: in the first hour, 2.5% of the total volume will be infused, \nwith the balance infused over the subsequent three hours. Any dead space in the lines should be \naccounted for to ensure 2.5% of the total infusion volume is delivered into the patient\u2019s bloodstream \nduring the first hour of infusion. The lowest rate administered to a patient in the clinical development \nprogram was 0.5 mL/hour during the first 30 minutes of infusion, followed by 1 mL/hour over the next \n30 minutes, equalling 0.75 mL as the lowest total volume infused during the first hour.  \n \nDo not flush the line containing vestronidase alfa to avoid a rapid bolus of infused enzyme. Due to the \nlow infusion rate, additional sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion may be added \nthrough a separate line (piggyback or Y tube) to maintain sufficient intravenous flow. After the first \nhour, the rate can be increased to infuse the remainder of the solution for infusion over 3 hours as \ntolerated according to the recommended rate guidelines in Table 2. \n \nThe infusion rate may be slowed, temporarily interrupted or discontinued in the event of \nhypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.4).  \n \nDo not infuse Mepsevii with other medicinal products in the infusion tubing. Compatibility with other \nmedicinal products has not been evaluated. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nLife-threatening hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance or to any of the \nexcipients listed in section 6.1 (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe effects of treatment with vestronidase alfa should be periodically evaluated and discontinuation of \ntreatment should be considered in cases where clear benefits (including stabilisation of disease \nmanifestations) are not observed.  \n \nAs end organ damage progresses over time, it is more difficult for the treatment to reverse the damage \nor to show improvements. It should be considered by the treating physician that the administration of \nvestronidase alfa does not affect the irreversible complications (e.g. skeletal deformities).  \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nVestronidase alfa, at the exposure observed in humans, is not expected to cross the blood-brain-barrier \nand therefore it is not likely to impact the neurological manifestations of the disease. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis \n \nSerious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with vestronidase alfa; \ntherefore, appropriate medical support should be readily available when vestronidase alfa is \nadministered.  \n \nInfusion should be avoided if the patient has an acute febrile or respiratory illness at the time.  \n \nIt is recommended that premedication with non-sedating antihistamines with or without antipyretics be \nadministered 30-60 minutes prior to the start of the infusion (see section 4.2).  \n \nIt is important to administer vestronidase alfa according to the recommended infusion rate schedule \n(see Table 2 in section 6.6).  \n \nIf severe hypersensitivity reactions occur, immediately stop the infusion of vestronidase alfa and \ninitiate appropriate treatment. Management of hypersensitivity reactions should be based on the \nseverity of the reaction and include temporary interruption or discontinuation of the infusion and/or \nadministration of additional antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or corticosteroids for mild to moderate \nreactions. Consider rapid sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion for decreased blood \npressure and oxygen for hypoxia. Patients should be observed for a minimum of 60 minutes after \ncompleting the infusion of vestronidase alfa.  \n \nPatients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions and instructed to \nseek immediate medical care should such signs and symptoms occur. The risks and benefits of re-\nadministering vestronidase alfa should be considered following a severe hypersensitivity reaction. \n \nSpinal/Cervical cord compression \n \nSpinal or cervical cord compression is a known and serious complication of MPS VII. During enzyme \nreplacement therapy, spinal cord injury can occur due to improved neck and spine mobility. Patients \nwith MPS VII receiving vestronidase alfa should be monitored for signs and symptoms of spinal cord \ncompression or neck instability including neck or back pain, weakness of limbs, changes in reflexes or \nurinary and faecal incontinence. Appropriate clinical treatment should be immediately sought. \n \nSodium restricted diet  \n \nThis medicinal product contains 17.8 mg sodium per vial and is administered in sodium chloride \n9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion (see section 6.6). For each vial dosed, including the \ncorresponding diluent volume, the sodium intake is 35.5 mg sodium. This amount is equivalent to \n1.8% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake for sodium (2 g). Mepsevii is considered high \nin sodium. This should be taken into consideration during dilution of the medicinal product for \npatients on a controlled sodium diet or for those patients with congestive heart failure needing to \nrestrict sodium and total water intake. \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. Because it is a recombinant human protein and its \nenzyme action is within the lysosome, vestronidase alfa is not expected to interact with other \nmedicinal products. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data on the use of vetronidase alfa in pregnant women. Animal studies with vestronidase \nalfa do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy or embryo-foetal \ndevelopment (see section 5.3).  \n \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of vestronidase alfa during pregnancy, \nunless the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the potential theoretical risks to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere are no data from studies in breast-feeding women. It is not known whether vestronidase alfa is \nexcreted in human milk, but systemic exposure via breast-milk is not expected. Due to lack of human \ndata, vestronidase alfa should only be administered to a breast-feeding woman if the potential benefit \nof vestronidase alfa to the mother and the benefit of breast-feeding to the infant outweighs the \npotential theoretical risks to the infant. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data are available on the effect of vestronidase alfa on fertility. Animal studies with \nvestronidase alfa do not indicate any impact on male or female fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nMepsevii has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nThe assessment of adverse reactions was based on the exposure of 23 patients from 4 clinical trials, \naged 5 months to 25 years, who received vestronidase alfa at doses up to 4 mg/kg once every two \nweeks for up to 136 weeks. Nineteen patients were younger than 18 years of age.  \n \nThe most common adverse reactions from 4 clinical trials in 23 patients treated with vestronidase alfa \nwere anaphylactoid reaction (13%), urticaria (13%), infusion site swelling (13%), infusion site \nextravasation (8.7%), pruritus (8.7%), diarrhoea (8.7%) and rash (8.7%). Most adverse reactions were \nmild to moderate in severity. There was a single adverse reaction of febrile convulsion observed in one \npatient (4.3%); the patient recovered without sequelae.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nTable 1 lists the adverse reactions reported from 4 clinical trials in 23 patients treated with Mepsevii.  \nAdverse reactions are presented by System Organ Class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as \nvery common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1000 to < 1/100), rare \n( \u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), and very rare (< 1/10,000).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nTable 1 Adverse reactions reported in patients treated with Mepsevii \nMedDRA System Organ Class MedDRA Preferred \n\nTerm \nFrequency \n\nImmune system disorders Anaphylactoid reaction Very common  \nNervous system disorders Febrile convulsion* Common \nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea Common  \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Urticaria \n\nRash** \nPruritus \n\nVery common \nCommon  \nCommon  \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nInfusion site swelling*** \nInfusion site extravasation \n\nVery common \nCommon  \n\n*Refer to description of selected adverse reactions for details on the febrile convulsion reported in 1 of 23 trial \npatients. \n** Rash includes grouped PTs of rash, rash papular, rash pruritic, rash maculo-papular, papule, and macule \n***One adverse reaction of Peripheral swelling is included within the frequency of Infusion site swelling as the \nevent is classified as intravenous catheter issue. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \n \nFebrile Convulsion  \n \nOne patient receiving a vestronidase alfa dose of 4 mg/kg experienced a febrile convulsion during \ntreatment at the week 66, within 3 days of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis vaccination. The infusion was \nstopped, the patient received anticonvulsants, antipyretics and antibiotics, and the febrile convulsion \nresolved. The patient subsequently was re-challenged without recurrence and continued on \nvestronidase alfa treatment. This event was assessed as possibly related to vestronidase alfa due to the \ntemporal association with the infusion.  \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nSeventeen out of 23 patients (74%) from 4 clinical trials developed anti-recombinant human beta-\nglucuronidase (rhGUS) antibodies (ADA), ten of whom further developed neutralizing antibodies \n(NAb) on at least one occasion, but not consistently over time. There is no definitive correlation \nbetween the antibody titre and neutralizing antibody development. In most patients, a pattern of \nattenuated immunogenicity with chronic exposure was suggested by declining antibody titres over \ntime on continuous treatment. The presence of ADA (non-NAb and NAb) does not appear to affect \nreduction in the pharmacodynamic marker, urinary glycosaminoglycans (uGAGs) and development of \nhypersensitivity reactions, including infusion associated reactions.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no experience with overdoses of vestronidase alfa. For the management of adverse reactions, \nsee sections 4.4 and 4.8.  \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, enzymes, ATC code: \nA16AB18 \n\n\n\n7 \n\nMechanism of action \n \nMucopolysaccharidosis VII is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the deficiency of beta-\nglucuronidase (GUS) that results in glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) accumulation in cells throughout the \nbody leading to multisystem tissue and organ damage.  \n \nVestronidase alfa is a recombinant form of human GUS and is intended to provide exogenous GUS \nenzyme for uptake into cellular lysosomes and subsequent catabolism of accumulated GAGs in \naffected tissues. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe clinical program for vestronidase alfa included 23 treatment na\u00efve patients with MPS VII from \n4 clinical trials, aged 5 months to 25 years, who received vestronidase alfa at doses up to 4 mg/kg once \nevery two weeks for up to 132 weeks. Nineteen patients were younger than 18 years of age. \n \nStudies 301 and 202 \nIn a multi-centre, randomized, placebo-controlled, Blind-Start, single-crossover Phase 3 trial (Study \nUX003-CL301, referred to as Study 301), 12 patients with MPS VII received vestronidase alfa \n4 mg/kg every two weeks for 24 to 48 weeks. The patients were randomized in a blinded manner into \n4 groups: 3 patients received vestronidase alfa immediately for 48 weeks (Group A), 3 patients \nreceived placebo for 8 weeks then vestronidase alfa for 40 weeks (Group B), 3 patients received \nplacebo for 16 weeks then vestronidase alfa for 32 weeks (Group C), and 3 patients received placebo \nfor 24 weeks then vestronidase alfa for 24 weeks (Group D). Patients who were enrolled in Study 301 \nwere eligible to roll over to Study UX003-CL202 (referred to as Study 202), an open-label extension \ntrial in which patients received additional doses of vestronidase alfa at 4 mg/kg intravenously every \nother week for up to 144 weeks.  \n \nOf the 12 patients enrolled in the UX003-CL301, 4 were male and 8 were female and ranged in ages \nfrom 8 to 25 years (median 14 years). Nine patients were younger than 18 years of age. MPS VII \ndiagnosis was confirmed by GUS enzyme activity assay for 5 patients, by genotyping for 3 patients, \nand via both enzyme assay and genotyping for 4 patients. Patients with MPS VII who received \nHematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant therapy were excluded in this study. The extremely small \npopulation of patients with MPS VII globally necessitated the enrolment of all patients able to \nparticipate in this clinical trial, resulting in a highly variable group. Clinical endpoints were not \nassessable in some patients due to their extent of disease, age or level of cognition (23 out of \n72 assessments [~32%] in 6 domains for 12 patients were non-assessable at baseline).  \n \nThe primary endpoint was the percent reduction in urinary GAG excretion (Dermatan Sulfate, DS) \nbefore and after 24 weeks of treatment with vestronidase alfa. The key secondary endpoint was the \nmulti-domain clinical responder index (MDRI) score consisting of six domains [six-minute walk test \n(6MWT), forced vital capacity (FVC), shoulder flexion, visual acuity, Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of \nMotor Proficiency (BOT-2) fine motor and gross motor function] after 24 weeks of treatment and \nfatigue total score as measured by the Pediatric Quality of Life Multidimensional Fatigue Scale \n(PedsQL). \n \nMinimal important differences (MIDs) were pre-specified for the six MDRI domains plus fatigue, \nwhich are: 6MWT (\u226523 meters and \u226510% change from baseline), FVC (5% absolute change or 10% \nrelative change from baseline in FVC%pred), shoulder flexion (20 degree change of both shoulder \nrange of motion), visual acuity (3 lines (corrected, both eyes), BOT-2 fine motor (fine motor precision: \nchange of 0.72, and manual dexterity: change of 1.47), BOT-2 gross motor (balance: 0.57, and running \nspeed and agility: 0.59), and fatigue (10 points of total score). \n \nPrimary Endpoint \n \nAfter 24 weeks of treatment with vestronidase alfa, a rapid and sustained, highly significant reduction \nin uGAG (DS) excretion was achieved with a LS mean (\u00b1SE) percentage change of -64.82% \n\n\n\n8 \n\n(\u00b12.468%) (p<0.0001). All 12 patients were responders, pre-specified as \u2265 50% reduction in uGAG on \nat least one visit during the first 24 weeks of treatment. In addition, uGAG response (% change from \nstudy week 0) shows a similar magnitude of reduction in uGAG in all groups after crossover to active \ntreatment. \n \nKey Secondary Endpoint: Multi-Domain Clinical Responder Index (MDRI) \n \nFor the clinical (secondary) endpoints, beneficial responses were observed although not in all patients. \nAfter 24 weeks of vestronidase alfa treatment, the overall MDRI results, both pre-specified and \npost-hoc (6 MDRI domains plus fatigue domain) analyses, were positive with an increase of \n+0.5 domains (p=0.0527) and +0.8 domains (p=0.0433) including fatigue, respectively (t-test).  \n \nOther Investigations \nStudy UX003-CL201 (referred to as Study 201) was a single arm, open-label, dose exploration trial \nthat enrolled three MPS VII patients, ranging in age from 5 years to 25 years. After 120 weeks of \nexposure to vestronidase alfa, one patient demonstrated a 21% improvement over baseline in forced \nvital capacity (FVC% predicted) on pulmonary function testing in addition to a 105 meter \nimprovement in the 6MWT. Two other patients with baseline hepatosplenomegaly had reduction in \nliver volume (24% and 53%) and spleen volume (28% and 47%) after 36 weeks of treatment.  \n \nStudy UX003-CL203 (referred to as Study 203) was an open-label, uncontrolled single arm study that \nenrolled eight patients less than 5 years of age who received vestronidase alfa at a dose of 4 mg/kg \nvestronidase alfa every two weeks for 48 weeks of treatment period and additional up to 240 weeks \nduring optional continuation period. The study evaluated reduction of urinary GAG excretion, growth \nvelocity and hepatosplenomegaly.  \n \nuGAG reduction \n \nTreatment with vestronidase alfa resulted in a rapid and sustained, significant (p<0.0001) reduction in \nuGAG DS excretion with an LS mean (SE) percent change of -60% (6.6) at Week 4 which was \nsustained at -61% (6.4) at Week 48. Subjects who entered the Continuation Period up to Week 132 \nexperienced further reduction in uGAG DS. \n \nGrowth \n \nAt baseline, all 8 subjects had impaired growth. The mean (SD) standing height z-score improved \nfrom baseline by +0.196 (0.30) at Week 48. A non-significant trend toward increased growth velocity \nwas observed after vestronidase alfa treatment, from a mean (SD) z-score of -2.59 (1.49) at baseline to \n-0.392 (2.10) post-baseline (p=0.27). \n \nHepatomegaly \n \nAll subjects with hepatomegaly assessed by ultrasound examination at Baseline (n=3/8) had decreased \nliver size to within normal range for age and sex prior to study termination. \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019. This means that due to \nthe rarity of the disease, it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal \nproduct. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every \nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of vestronidase alfa were evaluated in a total of 23 MPS VII patients including \n19 paediatric patients and 4 adults from 3 clinical trials. After repeated dosing of 4 mg/kg every other \nweek, the maximal serum concentration (Cmax) was 17.3 \u00b1 9.6 \u00b5g/mL (mean \u00b1 s.d.; range: 4.7 to \n35.7 \u00b5g/mL) and the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable \nconcentration (AUC0-t) was 50.9 \u00b1 32.2 \u00b5g*h/mL (mean \u00b1 s.d.; range: 17.4 to 153 \u00b5g*h/mL). The \npharmacokinetics of vestronidase alfa are time independent with repeat dosing. The limited \npharmacokinetic data at steady state suggest dose proportional increase in exposure of vestronidase \nalfa over the dose range of 1 - 4 mg/kg every other week. \n \nDistribution \nAfter repeated dosing of 4 mg/kg every other week in MPS VII patients, the mean \u00b1 standard \ndeviation the total volume of distribution (Vss) was 0.26 \u00b1 0.13 L/kg (range: 0.10 to 0.60 L/kg). \n \nBiotransformation \nVestronidase alfa is a recombinant human enzyme and is therefore eliminated by proteolytic \ndegradation into small peptides and amino acids. \n \nElimination \nAfter repeated dosing of 4 mg/kg every other week in MPS VII patients, the mean \u00b1 standard \ndeviation of the total clearance (CL) was 0.079 \u00b1 0.045 L/h/kg (range: 0.038 to 0.20 L/h/kg); the mean \n\u00b1 standard deviation of the elimination half-life (t1/2) was 2.6 \u00b1 0.6 hours (range: 0.9 to 3.6 hours).  \n \nExcretion \nNo excretion studies have been conducted in humans. Vestronidase alfa is not expected to be \neliminated through renal or faecal excretion.   \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single-dose toxicity in rats, repeated dose toxicity in MPS VII mice and juvenile \nmonkeys, fertility and embryo-foetal development in rats or rabbits, and pre- and postnatal \ndevelopment in rats. \n \nGenotoxicity studies and carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with vestronidase alfa. \nBased on mechanism of action, rhGUS is not expected to be tumorigenic. \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nSodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate  \nSodium chloride \nHistidine  \nPolysorbate 20 \nWater for injections \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in \nsection 6.6. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n36 months \n\n\n\n10 \n\nAfter dilution: Chemical and physical in-use stability of the diluted medicinal product has been \ndemonstrated for up to 36 hours under refrigeration at 2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C followed by up to 6 hours at room \ntemperature up to a maximum of 25\u00b0C. \n \nFrom a microbiological safety point of view, the diluted product should be used immediately. If not \nused immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user, \nbut should normally not be longer than 36 hours at 2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C followed by up to 6 hours at room \ntemperature up to a maximum of 25\u00b0C. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C).  \nDo not freeze.  \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light.  \nFor storage conditions after dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container  \n \nColourless glass vial (Ph. Eur. Type I) with a rubber stopper with fluoro-resin coating, and an \naluminium over seal with a plastic flip-off cap.  \n \nPack size: 1 vial containing 5 mL of concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nEach vial of Mepsevii is intended for single use only. Mepsevii must be diluted with sodium chloride \n9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection using aseptic technique according to the steps described below. \nThe diluted solution for infusion should be administered to patients using a low-protein binding \ninfusion bag and set (a non di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate [DEHP] bag could be used) and the application \nof an infusion set equipped with an in-line, low-protein binding 0.2 \u03bcm filter is recommended. \n \n\n1. Determine the number of vials to be diluted based on the patient\u2019s actual weight and the \nrecommended dose of 4 mg/kg, using the following calculations (a-b): \n\na. Total dose (mg) = Patient\u2019s weight (kg) x 4 mg/kg (recommended dose) \nb. Total number of vials = Total dose (mg) divided by 10 mg/vial \n\n2.  Round to the next whole vial and remove the required number of vials (refer to Table 2) from \nthe refrigerator to allow them to reach room temperature up to a maximum of 25\u00b0C. Do not \nheat, microwave or shake vials.  \n\na. Volume (mL) of calculated dose = Total dose (mg) divided by the 2 mg/mL \nconcentration \n\n3.  Dilute the calculated dose 1:1 using equal volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution \nfor injection for intravenous infusion. The total infusion volume is based on the total Mepsevii \ndose and volume (refer to Table 2). The above calculated dose diluted 1:1 in sodium chloride \n9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection should be added to a new empty infusion bag. Dilution \npreparation should be done at room temperature. \n\n4. Prior to withdrawing Mepsevii from the vial, visually inspect for particulate matter and \ndiscolouration. The Mepsevii concentrate solution for infusion should be colourless to slightly \nyellow. Do not use if the solution is discoloured or if there is particulate matter in the solution. \n\n5. Slowly withdraw Mepsevii from the appropriate number of vials using caution to avoid \nexcessive agitation and any air or frothing. A sufficiently large needle (18 gauge) should be \nused to minimise bubbles in the solution. \n\n6. Slowly add Mepsevii to the infusion bag using care to avoid agitation, ensuring liquid to liquid \ncontact without generating bubbles or turbulence.  \n\n\n\n11 \n\n7.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.  \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet (see section 4). \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Mepsevii is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you are given Mepsevii  \n3. How Mepsevii is given \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Mepsevii  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Mepsevii is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Mepsevii is \nMepsevii contains an enzyme called vestronidase alfa. This belongs to a group of medicines called \nenzyme replacement therapies. It is used in adults and children of all ages with MPS VII to treat non-\nneurological manifestations of the disease (mucopolysaccharidosis VII, also known as Sly Syndrome).  \n \nWhat is MPS VII \nMPS VII is an illness that runs in families, where the body does not produce enough of an enzyme \ncalled beta\u2013glucuronidase. \n- This enzyme helps to break down sugars in the body called mucopolysaccharides. \n- Mucopolysaccharides are made in the body and they help build bones, cartilage, skin, and \n\ntendons. \n- These sugars are re-cycled all the time \u2013 new ones are made and old ones are broken down.  \n- Without enough beta\u2013glucuronidase, parts of these sugars build up in cells, leading to damage \n\nin the body. \n \nHow Mepsevii works  \nThis medicine replaces beta-glucuronidase \u2013 this helps to break down the sugars that collect in the \ntissues of people with MPS VII.  \n- Treatment may improve various signs and symptoms of illness, like walking difficulties and \n\ntiredness. \n \n\nStarting treatment early in children may stop the illness getting worse and reduce permanent damage. \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Mepsevii  \n \nYou must not be given Mepsevii: \n\n\n\n23 \n\n- If you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to vestronidase alfa or any of the other \ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor before you are given Mepsevii. \n\nThe effects of treatment with vestronidase alfa should be periodically evaluated and discontinuation of \ntreatment should be considered in cases where clear benefits (including stabilisation of disease \nmanifestations) are not observed. \n\nIt should be considered that the administration of vestronidase alfa does not affect the irreversible \ncomplications (e.g. skeletal deformities). \n\nLook out for side effects \n\n- You may have side effects while you are being given Mepsevii or for up to a day afterwards. \nThese side effects are called infusion reactions because they are caused by the infusion (drip) of \nthe medicine. They may include an allergic reaction (see section 4). If you have an infusion \nreaction, tell your doctor straight away. \n\n- If you have an allergic reaction during your infusion your doctor may slow down, or stop your \ninfusion. Your doctor may also give (or have given) you other medicines to manage the allergic \nreaction such as an antihistamine or corticosteroid or an antipyretic, a medicine to reduce fever.  \n\nOther symptoms to look out for \n\n- If you have neck or back pain, feel numb in your arms or legs, or experience lack of control \nover passing water (urine) or stools, tell your doctor straight away. These problems can be \nsigns of the illness and may be caused by pressure on your spinal cord. \n\n \nOther medicines and Mepsevii \nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine. \n \nYou will not be given Mepsevii if you are pregnant unless treatment is clearly necessary. Discuss with \nyour doctor if the benefits of using Mepsevii are greater than the possible risks to your unborn baby. \nThis is because there is no experience on the use of Mepsevii during pregnancy. \n \nIt is not known whether Mepsevii passes into breast milk, but transfer of the medication to your baby \nis not expected. Discuss with your doctor if the benefits of using Mepsevii are greater than the \npotential risk to your baby while breast-feeding.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nMepsevii is not likely to affect you being able to drive or use machines.  \n \nMepsevii contains sodium \nThis medicine contains 17.8 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 5-mL vial, \nand is administered with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL as a diluent. Each vial dosed is therefore \nequivalent to 1.8% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. Take \nthis into account if you are on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n \n3. How Mepsevii is given \n \nTreatment with Mepsevii should be started and monitored by your doctor.  \n- Your doctor or nurse will give Mepsevii to you by an infusion (drip) into a vein. \n- The medicine has to be diluted before being given. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n- Your doctor may give (or have given) you some medicines to manage the allergic reaction such \nas an antihistamine or corticosteroid or an antipyretic, a medicine to reduce fever. \n\n \nDose \nThe dose you will receive is based on how much you weigh.  \n- The recommended dose is 4 mg for each kg of body weight. \n- The dose is given every two weeks through a drip into a vein (intra-venous infusion).  \n- Each infusion will be given over about 4 hours.  \n \nIf you are given more Mepsevii than you should \nMepsevii is given to you and monitored by your doctor. He or she will check that the correct dose has \nbeen given and take action as needed.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSide effects were mainly seen while patients were being given the medicine or within a day after the \ninfusion (infusion reactions).  \n \nTell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the following side effects \u2013 you may need urgent \nmedical treatment: \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n- Severe allergic reaction (anaphylactoid reaction) \u2013 Symptoms of severe allergic reaction may \n\ninclude shortness of breath, wheezing, difficulty breathing, and swelling of the face and tongue. \nYour doctor may give (or have given) you other medicines to manage the allergic reaction such \nas an antihistamine or corticosteroid or an antipyretic, a medicine to reduce fever. \n\n- Hives (urticaria) \n- Swelling at the infusion site including leaking into the tissue around the vein (infusion site \n\nswelling or infusion site extravasation) \n \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n- Itching of the skin (pruritus) \n- Loose stools (diarrhoea) \n- Rash \n- Fever with involuntary contractions of muscles of face or limbs (febrile convulsion) \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Mepsevii \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton after \u2018EXP\u2019. The expiry \ndate refers to the last day of that month. \n \nUnopened vials: \n- Store in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). \n- Do not freeze. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n- Store in the original package in order to protect from light. \n- Do not use this medicine if you notice particles. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.

(listed in section 6). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before you are given mepsevii. the effects of treatment with vestronidase alfa should be periodically evaluated and discontinuation of treatment should be considered in cases where clear benefits (including stabilisation of disease manifestations) are not observed. it should be considered that the administration of vestronidase alfa does not affect the irreversible complications (e.g. skeletal deformities). look out for side effects - you may have side effects while you are being given mepsevii or for up to a day afterwards. these side effects are called infusion reactions because they are caused by the infusion (drip) of the medicine. they may include an allergic reaction (see section 4). if you have an infusion reaction, tell your doctor straight away. - if you have an allergic reaction during your infusion your doctor may slow down, or stop your infusion. your doctor may also give (or have given) you other medicines to manage the allergic reaction such as an antihistamine or corticosteroid or an antipyretic, a medicine to reduce fever. other symptoms to look out for - if you have neck or back pain, feel numb in your arms or legs, or experience lack of control over passing water (urine) or stools, tell your doctor straight away. these problems can be signs of the illness and may be caused by pressure on your spinal cord. other medicines and mepsevii tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine. you will not be given mepsevii if you are pregnant unless treatment is clearly necessary. discuss with your doctor if the benefits of using mepsevii are greater than the possible risks to your unborn baby. this is because there is no experience on the use of mepsevii during pregnancy. it is not known whether mepsevii passes into breast milk, but transfer of the medication to your baby is not expected. discuss with your doctor if the benefits of using mepsevii are greater than the potential risk to your baby while breast-feeding. driving and using machines mepsevii is not likely to affect you being able to drive or use machines. mepsevii contains sodium this medicine contains 17.8 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 5-ml vial, and is administered with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml as a diluent. each vial dosed is therefore equivalent to 1.8% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. take this into account if you are on a controlled sodium diet.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "mepsevii", "Type":
