This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section \n4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nDeltyba 50 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 50 mg delamanid. \n \nExcipient with known effect: each film-coated tablet contains 100 mg lactose (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nRound, yellow, film-coated tablet. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDeltyba is indicated for use as part of an appropriate combination regimen for pulmonary multi-drug \nresistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in adult patients when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be \ncomposed for reasons of resistance or tolerability (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with delamanid should be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the management \nof multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. \n \nDelamanid must always be administered as part of an appropriate combination regimen for the treatment of \nmultidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). Treatment with an appropriate \ncombination regimen should continue after completion of the 24-week delamanid treatment period according \nto WHO guidelines. \n \nIt is recommended that delamanid is administered by directly observed therapy (DOT). \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose for adults is 100 mg twice daily for 24 weeks. \n \nElderly patients (> 65 years of age) \nNo data are available in the elderly.  \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is considered necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. There are no \n\n\n\n3 \n\ndata on the use of delamanid in patients with severe renal impairment and its use is not recommended (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is considered necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Delamanid is not \nrecommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of delamanid in children and adolescents below 18 years has not yet been \nestablished. \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \nFor oral use. \nDelamanid should be taken with food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Serum albumin < 2.8 g/dL (see section 4.4 regarding use in patients with serum albumin \u22652.8 g/dL) \n- Taking medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. carbamazepine). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThere are no data on treatment with delamanid for more than 24 consecutive weeks.  \n \nThere are no clinical data on the use of delamanid to treat  \n- extra pulmonary tuberculosis (e.g. central nervous system, bone)  \n- infections due to Mycobacterial species other than those of the M. tuberculosis complex \n- latent infection with M. tuberculosis \nThere are no clinical data on the use of delamanid as part of combination regimens used to treat drug-\nsusceptible M. tuberculosis. \n \nResistance to delamanid \nDelamanid must only be used in an appropriate combination regimen for MDR-TB treatment as \nrecommended by WHO to prevent development of resistance to delamanid. \n \nQT prolongation \nQT prolongation has been observed in patients treated with delamanid. This prolongation increases slowly \nover time in the first 6-10 weeks of treatment and remains stable therafter. QTc prolongation is very closely \ncorrelated with the major delamanid metabolite DM-6705. Plasma albumin and CYP3A4 regulate the \nformation and metabolism of DM-6705 respectively (see Special Considerations below). \n \nGeneral recommendations \nIt is recommended that electrocardiograms (ECG) should be obtained before initiation of treatment and \nmonthly during the full course of treatment with delamanid. If a QTcF >500 ms is observed either before the \nfirst dose of delamanid or during delamanid treatment, treatment with delamanid should either not be started \nor should be discontinued. If the QTc interval duration exceeds 450/470 ms for male/female patients during \ndelamanid treatment, these patients should be administered more frequent ECG monitoring. It is also \nrecommended that serum electrolytes, e.g. potassium, are obtained at baseline and corrected if \nabnormal. \n \nSpecial Considerations \n \nCardiac risk factors \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTreatment with delamanid should not be initiated in patients with the following risk factors unless the \npossible benefit of delamanid is considerd to outweigh the potential risks. Such patients should receive very \nfrequent monitoring of ECG throughout the full delamanid treatment period. \n- Known congenital prolongation of the QTc-interval or any clinical condition known to prolong the \n\nQTc interval or QTc > 500 ms.  \n- History of symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias or with clinically relevant bradycardia.  \n- Any predisposing cardiac conditions for arrhythmia such as severe hypertension, left ventricular \n\nhypertrophy (including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) or congestive cardiac failure accompanied by \nreduced left ventricle ejection fraction.  \n\n- Electrolyte disturbances, particularly hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia or hypomagnesaemia. \n- Taking medicinal products that are known to prolong the QTc interval. These include (but are not \n\nlimited to): \n-  Antiarrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone, disopyramide, dofetilide, ibutilide, procainamide, quinidine, \n\nhydroquinidine, sotalol). \n- Neuroleptics (e.g. phenothiazines, sertindole, sultopride, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, \n mesoridazine, pimozide, or thioridazine), antidepressive agents. \n- Certain antimicrobial agents, including: \n\n- macrolides (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin) \n- moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin (see section 4.4 regarding use with other fluoroquinolones) \n- bedaquiline \n- triazole antifungal agents \n- pentamidine \n- saquinavir \n\n- Certain non-sedating antihistamines (e.g. terfenadine, astemizole, mizolastine) \n- Certain antimalarials with QT-prolonging potential (e.g. halofantrine, quinine, chloroquine, \n\nartesunate/amodiaquine, dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine). \n-  Cisapride, droperidol, domperidone, bepridil, diphemanil, probucol, levomethadyl, methadone, vinca \n\nalkaloids, arsenic trioxide. \n \nHypoalbuminaemia \nIn a clinical study, the presence of hypoalbuminaemia was associated with an increased risk of prolongation \nof the QTc interval in delamanid treated patients. Delamanid is contraindicated in patients with albumin \n<2.8 g/dL (see section 4.3). Patients who commence delamanid with serum albumin <3.4 g/dL or experience \na fall in serum albumin into this range during treatment should receive very frequent monitoring of ECGs \nthroughout the full delamanid treatment period. \n \nCo-administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 \nCo-administration of delamanid with a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (lopinavir/ritonavir) was associated with \na 30% higher exposure to the metabolite DM-6705, which has been associated with QTc prolongation. \nTherefore if co-administration of delamanid with any strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 is considered necessary it \nis recommended that there is very frequent monitoring of ECGs, throughout the full delamanid treatment \nperiod. \n \nCo-administration of delamanid with quinolones \nAll QTcF prolongations above 60 ms were associated with concomitant fluoroquinolone use. Therefore if co-\nadministration is considered to be unavoidable in order to construct an adequate treatment regimen for MDR-\nTB it is recommended that there is very frequent monitoring of ECGs throughout the full delamanid \ntreatment period. \n \nHepatic impairment \nDeltyba is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and \n5.2). \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \nThe complete metabolic profile of delamanid in man has not yet been fully elucidated (see sections 4.5 and \n5.2). Therefore the potential for drug-drug interactions of clinical significance to occur with delamanid and \n\n\n\n5 \n\nthe possible consequences, including the total effect on the QTc interval, cannot be predicted with \nconfidence. \n \nExcipients \nDeltyba film-coated tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \nthe Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe complete metabolic profile and mode of elimination of delamanid has not yet been fully elucidated (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2) \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on Deltyba \n \nCytochrome P450 3A4 inducers \nClinical drug-drug interactions studies in healthy subjects indicated a reduced exposure to delamanid, of up \nto 45% following 15 days of concomitant administration of the strong inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP) \n3A4 (Rifampicin 300 mg daily) with delamanid (200 mg daily). No clinically relevant reduction in \ndelamanid exposure was observed with the weak inducer efavirenz when administered at a dose of 600 mg \ndaily for 10 days in combination with delamanid 100 mg twice daily. \n \nAnti-HIV medicines \nIn clinical drug-drug interaction studies in healthy subjects, delamanid was administered alone (100 mg \ntwice daily) and with tenofovir disoproxil (245 mg daily) or lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg daily) for 14 \ndays and with efavirenz for 10 days (600 mg daily). Delamanid exposure remained unchanged (<25% \ndifference) with anti-HIV medicines tenofovir disoproxil and efavirenz but was slightly increased with the \ncombination anti-HIV medicine containing lopinavir/ritonavir. \n \nEffects of Deltyba on other medicinal products \n \nIn-vitro studies showed that delamanid did not inhibit CYP450 isozymes. \nIn-vitro studies showed that delamanid and metabolites did not have any effect on the transporters MDR1(p-\ngp), BCRP, OATP1, OATP3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and BSEP, at concentrations of \napproximately 5 to 20 fold greater than the Cmax at steady state. However, since the concentrations in the gut \ncan potentially be much greater than these multiples of the Cmax, there is a potential for delamanid to have an \neffect on these transporters. \n \nAnti-Tuberculosis medicines \nIn a clinical drug-drug interaction study in healthy subjects, delamanid was administred alone (200 mg daily) \nand with rifampicin/isoniazid/pyrazinamide (300/720/1800 mg daily) or ethambutol (1100 mg daily) for 15 \ndays. Exposure of concomitant anti-TB drugs (rifampicin [R]/ isoniazid [H]/ pyrazinamide [Z]) was not \naffected. Co-administration with delamanid significantly increased steady state plasma concentrations of \nethambutol by approximately 25%, the clinical relevance is unknown. \n \nAnti-HIV medicines \nIn a clinical drug-drug interaction study in healthy subjects, delamanid was administred alone (100 mg twice \ndaily) and tenofovir disoproxil (245 mg daily), lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg daily) for 14 days and with \nefavirenz for 10 days (600 mg daily). Delamanid given in combination with the anti-HIV-medicines, \ntenofovir disoproxil, lopinavir/ritonavir and efavirenz, did not affect the exposure to these medicinal \nproducts. \n \nMedicinal products with the potential to prolong QTc \nCare must be taken in using delamanid in patients already receiving medicines associated with QT \nprolongation (see section 4.4). Co-administration of moxifloxacin and delamanid in MDR-TB patients has \nnot been studied. Moxifloxacin is not recommended for use in patients treated with delamanid \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are very limited data from the use of delamanid in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \nDeltyba is not recommended in pregnant women or in women of childbearing potential unless they are using \na reliable form of contraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether this medicinal product or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of delamanid and/or its metabolites in milk. Because \na potential risk to the breast-feeding infant cannot be ruled out , it is recommended that women should not \nbreastfeed during treatment with Deltyba. \n \nFertility \nDeltyba had no effect on male or female fertility in animals (see section 5.3). There are no clinical data on \nthe effects of delamanid on fertility in humans. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, patients \nshould be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience any adverse reaction with a potential \nimpact on the ability to perform these activities (e.g. headache and tremor are very common). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequently observed adverse drug reactions in patients treated with delamanid + Optimised \nBackground Regimen (OBR) (i.e. incidence > 10%) are nausea (32,9%), vomiting (29,9%), headache (27.6%), \ninsomnia (27.3%), dizziness (22.4%), tinnitus (16.5%), hypokalaemia (16.2%), gastritis (15.0%), decreased \nappetite (13.1%), and asthenia (11.3%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe list of adverse drug reactions and frequencies are based on the results from 2 double-blind placebo \ncontrolled clinical trials (delamanid plus OBR, n = 662 vs placebo plus OBR n = 330). The adverse drug \nreactions are listed by MedDRA System Organ Class and Preferred Term. Within each System Organ Class, \nadverse reactions are listed under frequency categories of very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot \nbe estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order \nof decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable: Adverse drug reactions to delamanid \n \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nFrequency \nuncommon \n\nFrequency \ncommon \n\nFrequency \nvery common \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nHerpes zoster \nOropharyngeal candidiasis \nTinea versicolor* \n\n  \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nLeukopenia \nThrombocytopaenia \n\nAnaemia* \nEosinophilia* \n\nReticulocytosis \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\nDehydration \nHypocalcaemia \nHypercholesterolaemia \n\nHypertriglyceridaemia Hypokalaemia \nDecreased \nappetite \nHyperuricaemia* \n\n\n\n7 \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\nAggression \nDelusional disorder, persecutory \ntype \nPanic disorder \nAdjustment disorder with \ndepressed mood \nNeurosis \nDysphoria \nMental disorder \nSleep disorder \nLibido increased* \n \n\nPsychotic disorder \nAgitation \nAnxiety and anxiety \ndisorder \nDepression and depressed \nmood \nRestlessness \n\nInsomnia \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nLethargy \nBalance disorder \nRadicular pain \nPoor quality sleep \n\nNeuropathy peripheral \nSomnolence* \nHypoaesthesia \n \n\nDizziness* \nHeadache \nParaesthesia \nTremor \n\nEye disorders Conjunctivitis allergic* Dry eye* \nPhotophobia \n\n \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n Ear pain Tinnitus \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\nAtrioventricular block first degree \nVentricular extrasystoles* \nSupraventricular extrasystoles \n\n Palpitations \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n Hypertension \nHypotension \nHaematoma* \nHot flush* \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Dyspnoea \nCough \nOropharyngeal pain \nThroat irritation \nDry throat* \nRhinorrhoea* \n\nHaemoptysis \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nDysphagia \nParaesthesia oral \nAbdominal tenderness* \n\nGastritis* \nConstipation* \nAbdominal pain \nAbdominal pain lower \nDyspepsia \nAbdominal discomfort \n\nVomiting \nDiarrhoea* \nNausea \nAbdominal pain \nupper \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\nHepatic function abnormal   \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nAlopecia* \nEosinophilic pustular folliculitis* \nPruritus generalised* \nRash erythematous \n\nDermatitis \nUrticaria \nRash pruritic* \nPruritus* \nRash maculo-papular* \nRash* \nAcne \nHyperhidrosis \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n Osteochondrosis \nMuscular weakness \nMusculoskeletal pain* \nFlank pain \nPain in extremity \n\nArthralgia* \nMyalgia* \n\n\n\n8 \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\nUrinary retention \nDysuria* \nNocturia \n\nHaematuria* \n \n\n \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nFeeling hot Pyrexia* \nChest pain \nMalaise \nChest discomfort* \nOedema peripheral* \n\nAsthenia \n\nInvestigations Electrocardiogram ST segment \ndepression \nTransaminases increased* \nActivated partial thromboplastin \ntime prolonged* \nGamma-glutamyltransferase \nincreased* \nBlood cortisol decreased \nBlood pressure increased \n\nBlood cortisol increased Electrocardiogra\nm QT prolonged \n\n* The frequency for these events was lower for the combined delamanid plus OBR group in comparison to the \nplacebo plus OBR group. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nECG QT interval prolongation \nIn patients receiving 200 mg delamanid total daily dose in the phase 2 and 3 trials, the mean placebo \ncorrected increase in QTcF from baseline ranged from 4.7 - 7.6 ms at 1 month and 5.3 ms - 12.1 ms at 2 \nmonths, respectively. The incidence of a QTcF interval > 500 ms ranged from 0.6% (1/161) - 2.1% (7/341) \nin patients receiving delamanid 200 mg total daily dose versus 0% (0/160) - 1.2% (2/170) of patients \nreceiving placebo + OBR, while the incidence of QTcF change from baseline > 60ms ranged from 3.1% \n(5/161) - 10.3% (35/341) in patients receiving delamanid 200 mg total daily dose versus 0% (0/160) - 7.1% \n(12/170) in patients receiving placebo. \n \nPalpitations \nFor patients receiving 100 mg delamanid + OBR twice daily, the frequency was 8.1% (frequency category \ncommon) in comparison to a frequency of 6.3% in patients receiving placebo + OBR twice daily. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo cases of delamanid overdose have been observed in clinical trials. However, additional clinical data \nshowed that in patients receiving 200 mg twice daily, i.e. total 400 mg delamanid per day, the overall safety \nprofile is comparable to that in patients receiving the recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily. Albeit, some \nreactions were observed at a higher frequency and the rate of QT prolongation increased in a dose-related \nmanner. Treatment of overdose should involve immediate measures to remove delamanid from the \ngastrointestinal tract and supportive care as required. Frequent ECG monitoring should be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycobacterials, antibiotics, ATC code: J04AK06. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\n \nMode of action \nThe pharmacological mode of action of delamanid involves inhibition of the synthesis of the mycobacterial \ncell wall components, methoxy-mycolic and keto-mycolic acid. The identified metabolites of delamanid do \nnot show anti-mycobacterial activity. \n \nActivity against specific pathogens \nDelamanid has no in vitro activity against bacterial species other than mycobacteria. \n \nResistance \nMutation in one of the 5 coenzyme F420 genes is suggested as the mechanism for resistance against \ndelamanid in mycobacteria. In mycobacteria, the in vitro frequencies of spontaneous resistance to delamanid \nwere similar to those for isoniazid, and were higher than those for rifampicin. Resistance to delamanid has \nbeen documented to occur during treatment (see section 4.4). Delamanid does not show cross-resistance with \nany of the currently used anti-tuberculosis drugs. \n \nSusceptibility testing breakpoints \nIn clinical trials resistance to delamanid has been defined as any growth in the presence of a delamanid \nconcentration of 0.2 \u03bcg/mL that is greater than 1% of that on drug-free control cultures on Middlebrook \n7H11 medium. \n \nData from clinical studies \nDelamanid has been evaluated in two, double-blind, placebo controlled trials for the treatment of MDR TB. \nThe analyses of SCC were conducted on the modified intent to treat population which included patients who \nhad positive cultures at baseline and the isolate was resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin, i.e., had MDR \nTB.  \n \nIn the first trial (Trial 204), 64/141 (45.4%) patients randomised to receive delamanid 100 mg BID + OBR \nand 37/125 (29.6%) of patients randomised to receive placebo (PLC) + OBR achieved two-month sputum \nculture conversion (SCC) (i.e. growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to no growth over the first 2 months \nand maintained for 1 more month) (p=0.0083). The time to SCC for the group randomised to 100 mg BID \nwas also found to be faster than for the group randomised to receive placebo + OBR (p=0.0056). \n \nIn the second trial (Trial 213), delamanid was administered orally at 100 mg BID as an add-on therapy to an \nOBR for 2 months followed by 200 mg once daily for 4 months. The median time to SCC was 51 days in the \ndelamanid + OBR group compared with 57 days in the PLC + OBR group (p = 0.0562 using the stratified \nmodified Peto-Peto modification of Gehan\u2019s Wilcoxon rank sum test). The proportion of patients achieving \nSCC (sputum culture conversion) after the 6-month treatment period was 87.6% (198/226) in the delamanid \n+ OBR treatment group compared to 86.1% (87/101) in the placebo + OBR treatment group (p=0.7131).  \nAll missing cultures up to the time of SCC were assumed to be positive cultures in the primary analysis. Two \nsensitivity analyses were conducted - a last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) analysis and an analysis \nusing \u201cbookending\u201d methodology (which required that the previous and subsequent cultures were both \nobserved negative cultures to impute a negative result, otherwise a positive result was imputed). Both \nshowed a 13-day shorter median time to SCC in the delamanid + OBR group (p=0.0281 for LOCF and \np=0.0052 for \u201cbookending\u201d). \n \nDelamanid resistance (defined as MIC \u2265 0.2 \u00b5g/ml) has been observed at baseline in 2 of 316 patients in \nTrial 204 and 2 of 511 patients in Trial 213 (4 of 827 patients [0.48%]). Delamanid resistance emerged in 4 \nof 341 patients (1.2%) randomised to receive delamanid for 6 months in Trial 213. These four patients were \nonly receiving two other medicinal products in addition to delamanid. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Deltyba in \none or more subsets of the paediatric population in {treatment in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis} (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nThis medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called \u2018conditional approval\u2019 scheme. This means that \nfurther evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. \nThe European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every year \nand this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nOral bioavailability of delamanid improves when administered with a standard meal, by about 2.7 fold \ncompared to fasting conditions. Delamanid plasma exposure increases less than proportionally with \nincreasing dose. \n \nDistribution \nDelamanid highly binds to all plasma proteins with a binding to total proteins of \u226599.5%. Delamanid has a \nlarge apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F of 2,100 L). \n \nBiotransformation \nDelamanid is primarily metabolised in plasma by albumin and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. The complete \nmetabolic profile of delamanid has not yet been elucidated, and there is a potential for drug interactions with \nother co-administered medications, if significant unknown metabolites are discovered. The identified \nmetabolites do not show anti-mycobacterial activity but some contribute to QTc prolongation, mainly DM-\n6705. Concentrations of the identified metabolites progressively increase to steady state after 6 to 10 weeks.  \n \nElimination \nDelamanid disappears from plasma with a t1/2 of 30-38 hours. Delamanid is not excreted in urine. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \nNo studies have been performed in paediatric patients. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nLess than 5% of an oral dose of delamanid is recovered from urine. Mild renal impairment (50 mL/min < \nCrCLN < 80 mL/min) does not appear to affect delamanid exposure. Therefore no dose adjustment is needed \nfor patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. It is not known whether delamanid and metabolites will \nbe significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is considered necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Delamanid is not \nrecommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. \n \nElderly patients (\u2265 65 years) \nNo patients of \u2265 65 years of age were included in clinical trials. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no specific hazard for humans based on conventional studies for genotoxicity and \ncarcinogenic potential. Delamanid and/or its metabolites have the potential to affect cardiac repolarisation \nvia blockade of hERG potassium channels. In the dog, foamy macrophages were observed in lymphoid tissue \nof various organs during repeat-dose toxicity studies. The finding was shown to be partially reversible; the \nclinical relevance of this finding is unknown. Repeat-dose toxicity studies in rabbits revealed an inhibitory \neffect of delamanid and/or its metabolites on vitamin K-dependent blood clotting. In rabbits reproductive \nstudies, embryo-fetal toxicity was observed at maternally toxic dosages. Pharmacokinetic data in animals \nhave shown excretion of delamanid /metabolites into breast milk. In lactating rats, the Cmax for delamanid \nin breast milk was 4-fold higher than that of the blood. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n6.

Your doctor \nmay also perform a blood test to check the concentration of some minerals and proteins which are important \nfor the function of your heart. \n \nTell your doctor if you have one of the following conditions: \n\u2022 you have reduced levels of albumin, potassium, magnesium or calcium in the blood \n\u2022 you have been told that you have heart problems, for example a slow heart rhythm (bradycardia) or \n\nhave a history of heart attack (myocardial infarction) \n\u2022 if you have a condition called congenital long QT syndrome or have a serious heart disease or \n\nproblems with heart rhythm. \n\u2022 you have liver disease or kidney disease. \n\u2022 you have HIV. \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \nChildren  \nDeltyba is not suitable for children under age 18. \n \nOther medicines and Deltyba \nTell your doctor... \n- if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including medicines or herbal \n\nremedies obtained without prescription,  \n- if you are taking medicines to treat an abnormal heart rhythm (e.g. amiodarone, disopyramide, dofetilide, \n\nibutilide, procainamide, quinidine, hydroquinidine, sotalol). \n- if you are taking medicines to treat psychoses (e.g. phenothiazines, sertindole, sultopride, chlorpromazine, \n\nhaloperidol, mesoridazine, pimozide, or thioridazine) or depression \n- if you are taking certain antimicrobial medicines (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin, moxifloxacin, \n\nsparfloxacin, bedaquiline, or pentamidine).  \n- if you are taking triazole antifungal medicines (e.g. fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole). \n-  if you are taking certain medicines to treat allergic reactions (e.g. terfenadine, astemizole, mizolastine). \n-  if you are taking certain medicines to treat malaria (e.g. halofantrine, quinine, chloroquine, \n\nartesunate/amodiaquine, dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine) \n-  if you are taking any of the following: cisapride (used to treat stomach disorders), droperidol (used \n\nagainst vomiting and migraine), domperidone (used against nausea and vomiting), diphemanil (used to \ntreat stomach disorders or excessive sweating), probucol (lowers the level of cholesterol in the \nbloodstream), levomethadyl or methadone (used for the treatment of opiate addiction), vinca alkaloids \n(anti-cancer medicines), or arsenic trioxide (used to treat certain types of leukaemia). \n\n-  if you are taking HIV-medicines containing lopinavir/ritonavir, or saquinavir. \nYou may be more at risk for dangerous changes of the heart rhythm. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDeltyba may cause harm to an unborn baby. It is not usually recommended for use during pregnancy. \nIt is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to get \npregnant. Your doctor will weigh up the benefits to you against the risks to your baby of taking Deltyba \nwhilst you are pregnant. \nIt is not known if delamanid passes into breast milk in humans. Breast-feeding is not recommended during \ntreatment with Deltyba. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDeltyba is not expected to have an influence on your ability to drive and use machines. If you experience \nside effects that might affect your ability to concentrate and react, do not drive or use machines. \n \nDeltyba contains lactose monohydrate. \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before \ntaking this medicinal product. \n \n \n3. How to take Deltyba \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you \nare not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is two 50 mg tablets taken twice a day (morning and evening) as advised by your \ndoctor. The tablets should be taken during or just after a meal. Swallow the tablets with water. \n \nIf you take more Deltyba than you should \nIf you have taken more tablets than your prescribed dose, contact your doctor or your local hospital. \nRemember to take the pack with you so that it is clear what medicine you have taken. \n \nIf you forget to take Deltyba \nIf you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember it. However, if it is nearly time for the next dose, just \n\n\n\n24 \n\nskip the missed dose. \n \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. \n \nIf you stop taking Deltyba  \nDO NOT stop taking the tablets unless your doctor tells you to. Stopping too early could allow the bacteria \nto recover and to become resistant to delamanid. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
