NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nEVOTAZ 300 mg/150 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains atazanavir sulphate corresponding to 300 mg atazanavir and 150 mg \nof cobicistat. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet  \n \nPink, oval, biconvex, film-coated tablet of approximate dimensions of 19 mm x 10.4 mm, debossed \nwith \"3641\" on one side and plain on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEVOTAZ is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of \nHIV-1 infected adults without known mutations associated with resistance to atazanavir (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of EVOTAZ is one tablet once daily taken orally with food (see section 5.2). \n \nAdvice on missed doses \nIf EVOTAZ is missed within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, patients should be instructed to \ntake the prescribed dose of EVOTAZ with food as soon as possible. If this is noticed later than \n12 hours of the time it is usually taken, the missed dose should not be taken and the patient should \nresume the usual dosing schedule. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nBased on the very limited renal elimination of cobicistat and atazanavir, no special precautions or dose \nadjustments of EVOTAZ are required for patients with renal impairment. \n \nEVOTAZ is not recommended for patients undergoing haemodialysis (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  \n \nCobicistat has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular \nsecretion of creatinine without affecting actual renal glomerular function. EVOTAZ should not be \ninitiated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 70 ml/min if any co-administered medicinal \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n \n\nproduct (e.g. emtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil or adefovir) requires dose adjustment \nbased on creatinine clearance (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThere are no pharmacokinetic data regarding the use of EVOTAZ in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nAtazanavir and cobicistat are metabolised by the hepatic system. Atazanavir should be used with \ncaution in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment. However, atazanavir must not \nbe used in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) to severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic \nimpairment. No dose adjustment of cobicistat is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic \nimpairment. Cobicistat has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and is not \nrecommended in these patients.  \n \nEVOTAZ should be used with caution in patients with mild hepatic impairment. EVOTAZ must not \nbe used in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nPaediatric population \nEVOTAZ should not be used in children less than 3 months of age because of safety concerns \nespecially taking into account the potential risk of kernicterus associated with the atazanavir \ncomponent. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of EVOTAZ in children less than 18 years of age have not been established. \nCurrently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. \n \nPregnancy and postpartum \nTreatment with EVOTAZ during pregnancy results in low atazanavir exposure. Therefore, therapy \nwith EVOTAZ should not be initiated during pregnancy, and women who become pregnant during \ntherapy with EVOTAZ should be switched to an alternative regimen (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nEVOTAZ is to be taken orally with food (see section 5.2). The film-coated tablet should be swallowed \nwhole and must not be chewed, broken, cut or crushed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nCo-administration with the following medicinal products that are strong inducers of the CYP3A4 \nisoform of cytochrome P450 due to the potential for loss of therapeutic effect (see section 4.5):  \n carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (antiepileptics) \n St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) (herbal product)  \n rifampicin (antimycobacterial) \n \nCo-administration with the following medicinal products due to the potential for serious and/or life-\nthreatening adverse reactions (see section 4.5):  \n colchicine, when used in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment (antigout) (see \n\nsection 4.5) \n sildenafil - when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (see sections 4.4 \n\nand 4.5 for co-administration for the treatment of erectile dysfunction), avanafil (PDE5 \ninhibitors)  \n\n dabigatran (anticoagulant) \n simvastatin and lovastatin (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) (see section 4.5)  \n lomitapide (lipid-modifying agent) \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n \n\n grazoprevir-containing products, including elbasvir/grazoprevir fixed dose combination (used to \ntreat chronic hepatitis C infection) (see section 4.5) \n\n glecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed dose combination (see section 4.5) \n substrates of CYP3A4 or the UGT1A1 isoform of UDP-glucuronyltransferase and have narrow \n\ntherapeutic windows: \n alfuzosin (alpha-1-adrenoreceptor antagonist)  \n amiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, quinidine, systemic lidocaine \n\n(antiarrhythmics/antianginals)  \n astemizole, terfenadine (antihistamines) \n cisapride (gastrointestinal motility agent)  \n ergot derivatives (e.g. dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergonovine) \n pimozide, quetiapine, lurasidone (antipsychotics/neuroleptics) (see section 4.5)  \n ticagrelor (platelet aggregation inhibitor)  \n triazolam, midazolam administered orally (sedatives/hypnotics) (for caution on \n\nparenterally administered midazolam, see section 4.5).  \n \nModerate to severe hepatic impairment. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission \nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nThe choice of EVOTAZ in adult patients should be based on individual viral resistance testing and the \npatient’s treatment history (see section 5.1). \n \nPregnancy \nTreatment with atazanavir/cobicistat 300/150 mg during the second and third trimester has been \nshown to result in low atazanavir exposure. Cobicistat levels decrease and may not provide sufficient \nboosting. The substantial reduction in atazanavir exposure may result in virological failure and an \nincreased risk of mother to child transmission of HIV infection. Therefore, therapy with EVOTAZ \nshould not be initiated during pregnancy, and women who become pregnant during therapy with \nEVOTAZ should be switched to an alternative regimen (see sections 4.2 and 4.6). \n \nPatients with co-existing conditions \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe use of EVOTAZ is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. \nEVOTAZ should be used with caution in patients with mild hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 \nand 5.2). \n \nAtazanavir \nAtazanavir is primarily hepatically metabolised and increased plasma concentrations were observed in \npatients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). The safety and efficacy of atazanavir have \nnot been established in patients with significant underlying liver disorders. Patients with chronic \nhepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe \nand potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions (see section 4.8). In case of concomitant antiviral \ntherapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant Summary of Product Characteristics for \nthese medicinal products. \n \nPatients with previous liver dysfunction or patients with chronic active hepatitis have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be \nmonitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n \nCobicistat \nCobicistat has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). \n \nRenal impairment  \nEVOTAZ is not recommended in patients undergoing haemodialysis (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nEffects on estimated creatinine clearance  \nCobicistat has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular \nsecretion of creatinine. This effect on serum creatinine, leading to a decrease in the estimated creatine \nclearance, should be taken into consideration when EVOTAZ is administered to patients in whom the \nestimated creatinine clearance is used to guide aspects of their clinical management, including \nadjusting doses of co-administered medicinal products. For more information consult the cobicistat \nSummary of Product Characteristics. \n \nEVOTAZ should not be initiated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 70 ml/min if one or \nmore co-administered medicinal product requires dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance (e.g. \nemtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil or adefovir; see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). \n \nAs atazanavir and cobicistat are highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that they will be \nsignificantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nThere are currently inadequate data to determine whether co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and \ncobicistat is associated with a greater risk of renal adverse reactions compared with regimens that \ninclude tenofovir disoproxil without cobicistat. \n \nQT prolongation \nDose related asymptomatic prolongations in PR interval with atazanavir, a component of EVOTAZ \nhave been observed in clinical studies. Caution should be used with medicinal products known to \ninduce PR prolongations. In patients with pre-existing conduction problems (second degree or higher \natrioventricular or complex bundle-branch block), EVOTAZ should be used with caution and only if \nthe benefits exceed the risk (see section 5.1). Particular caution should be used when prescribing \nEVOTAZ in association with medicinal products which have the potential to increase the QT interval \nand/or in patients with pre-existing risk factors (bradycardia, long congenital QT, electrolyte \nimbalances (see sections 4.8 and 5.3). \n \nHaemophiliac patients \nThere have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and \nhaemarthroses, in type A and B haemophiliac patients treated with protease inhibitors. In some \npatients additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with \nprotease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal \nrelationship has been suggested, although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated. \nHaemophiliac patients should, therefore, be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \n \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to the disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose, reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nIn clinical studies, atazanavir has been shown to induce dyslipidaemia to a lesser extent than \ncomparators.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n \n\nHyperbilirubinaemia \n \nReversible elevations in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin related to inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyl \ntransferase (UGT) have occurred in patients receiving atazanavir (see section 4.8). Hepatic \ntransaminase elevations that occur with elevated bilirubin in patients receiving EVOTAZ should be \nevaluated for alternative aetiologies. Alternative antiretroviral therapy to EVOTAZ may be considered \nif jaundice or scleral icterus is unacceptable to a patient. \n \nIndinavir is also associated with indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinaemia due to inhibition of \nUGT. Combinations of EVOTAZ and indinavir have not been studied and co-administration of these \nmedicinal products is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nCholelithiasis \n \nCholelithiasis has been reported in patients receiving atazanavir (see section 4.8). Some patients \nrequired hospitalisation for additional management and some had complications. If signs or symptoms \nof cholelithiasis occurs, temporary interruption or discontinuation of treatment may be considered. \n \nChronic kidney disease \n \nChronic kidney disease in HIV-infected patients treated with atazanavir, with or without ritonavir, has \nbeen reported during post-marketing surveillance. A large prospective observational study has shown \nan association between an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease and cumulative exposure to \natazanavir/ritonavir-containing regimen in HIV-infected patients with an initially normal eGFR. This \nassociation was observed independently of exposure to tenofovir disoproxil. Regular monitoring of the \nrenal function of patients should be maintained throughout the treatment duration (see section 4.8).  \n \nNephrolithiasis \n \nNephrolithiasis has been reported in patients receiving atazanavir (see section 4.8). Some patients \nrequired hospitalisation for additional management and some had complications. In some cases, \nnephrolithiasis has been associated with acute renal failure or renal insufficiency. If signs or symptoms \nof nephrolithiasis occurs, temporary interruption or discontinuation of treatment may be considered. \n \nImmune reactivation syndrome \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, \nand Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and \ntreatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune \nhepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported \ntime to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nOsteonecrosis \n \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nRash and associated syndromes \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n \n\n \nRashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 3 weeks \nof starting therapy with atazanavir, a component of EVOTAZ. \n \nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme, toxic skin eruptions and drug rash with \neosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported in patients receiving \natazanavir. Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for skin \nreactions. EVOTAZ or any other medicinal product containing atazanavir should be discontinued if \nsevere rash develops. \n \nThe best results in managing these events come from early diagnosis and immediate interruption of \nany suspect medicines. If the patient has developed SJS or DRESS associated with the use of \nEVOTAZ, EVOTAZ may not be restarted. \n \nCo-administration with antiretroviral medicinal products \n \nEVOTAZ is indicated for use with other antiretrovirals for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. EVOTAZ \nshould not be used in combination with products containing the same active components including \natazanavir, cobicistat or with fixed-dose products that contain cobicistat. EVOTAZ should not be used \nin combination with another antiretroviral that requires pharmacokinetic enhancement (i.e., another \nprotease inhibitor or elvitegravir) since dosing recommendations for such combinations have not been \nestablished and may result in decreased plasma concentrations of atazanavir and/or the other \nantiretroviral leading to loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. Co-administration of \nEVOTAZ with other protease inhibitors is not recommended. Because atazanavir is a component of \nEVOTAZ, co-administration of EVOTAZ with nevirapine or efavirenz is not recommended (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nEVOTAZ should not be used in combination with ritonavir or medicinal products containing ritonavir \ndue to similar pharmacological effects of cobicistat and ritonavir on CYP3A (see section 4.5). \n \nInteractions with other medicinal products  \n \nAtazanavir is metabolised principally by CYP3A4. Cobicistat is a strong mechanism-based CYP3A \ninhibitor and is a CYP3A substrate. Co-administration of EVOTAZ and medicinal products that \ninduce CYP3A4 is contraindicated or not recommended (see sections 4.3 and 4.5) because, in addition \nto decreased plasma concentrations of atazanavir due to induction of CYP3A4, decreased plasma \nconcentrations of cobicistat could result in cobicistat plasma levels that are insufficient to achieve \nadequate pharmacoenhancement of atazanavir. \n \nIncreased plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A (including \natazanavir) are observed on co-administration with cobicistat. Higher plasma concentrations of co-\nadministered medicinal products can result in increased or prolonged therapeutic effects or adverse \nreactions. For medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A these higher plasma concentrations may \npotentially lead to severe, life-threatening or fatal events (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nCo-administration of EVOTAZ with medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the \nclearance of atazanavir and cobicistat, resulting in increased atazanavir and cobicistat plasma \nconcentrations (see section 4.5). \n \nUnlike ritonavir, cobicistat is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or \nUGT1A1. If switching from atazanavir boosted with ritonavir to EVOTAZ, caution is required during \nthe first two weeks of treatment with EVOTAZ, particularly if doses of any concomitantly \nadministered medicinal products have been titrated or adjusted during use of ritonavir as a \npharmacoenhancer (see section 4.5). \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n \n\nCobicistat is a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor and is metabolised to a minor extent by CYP2D6. \nCo-administration with EVOTAZ can increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are \nmetabolised by CYP2D6 (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nBecause atazanavir is a component of EVOTAZ, the combination of EVOTAZ with atorvastatin is not \nrecommended (see section 4.5). \n \nPDE5 inhibitors used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction \nParticular caution should be used when prescribing PDE5-inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, or \navanafil) for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in patients receiving EVOTAZ. Co-administration of \nEVOTAZ with these medicinal products is expected to substantially increase their concentrations and \nmay result in PDE5-associated adverse reactions such as hypotension, visual changes and priapism \n(see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration of voriconazole and EVOTAZ is not recommended unless an assessment of the \nbenefit/risk justifies the use of voriconazole (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of EVOTAZ and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolized by \nCYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic \ncorticosteroid effects, including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration of EVOTAZ with warfarin has the potential to produce serious and/or \nlife-threatening bleeding due to increased warfarin plasma concentrations, and it is recommended that \nthe INR (International Normalized Ratio) be monitored (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration of EVOTAZ with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is not recommended due to the \ndecreased solubility of atazanavir as intra-gastric pH increase with PPIs (see section 4.5).  \n \nContraception requirements \nPlasma concentrations of drospirenone are increased following administration of \ndrospirenone/ethinyloestradiol with atazanavir/cobicistat. If drospirenone/ethinyloestradiol is co-\nadministered with atazanavir/cobicistat, clinical monitoring is recommended due to the potential for \nhyperkalemia. \n \nData are not available to make recommendations regarding the use of EVOTAZ with other oral \ncontraceptives. Alternative forms of contraception (non-hormonal) should be considered (see \nsection 4.5). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDrug interaction trials were not conducted for EVOTAZ. As EVOTAZ contains atazanavir and \ncobicistat, any interactions that have been identified with these active substances individually may \noccur with EVOTAZ. \n \nComplex or unknown mechanisms of drug interaction preclude extrapolation of ritonavir drug \ninteractions to certain cobicistat drug interactions. The recommendations given for concomitant use of \natazanavir and other medicinal products may, therefore, differ depending on whether atazanavir is \nboosted with ritonavir or cobicistat. In particular, atazanavir boosted with cobicistat is more sensitive \nfor CYP3A induction (see section 4.3 and the interaction table). Caution is also required during the \nfirst time of treatment if switching the pharmacoenhancer from ritonavir to cobicistat (see section 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products that affect atazanavir/cobicistat exposure  \n \nAtazanavir is metabolised in the liver through CYP3A4. \nCobicistat is a CYP3A substrate and is metabolised to a minor extent by CYP2D6. \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n \n\n \nConcomitant use contraindicated \nCo-administration of EVOTAZ with medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A (such as \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, and St. John’s wort [Hypericum perforatum]) \nmay result in decreased plasma concentrations of atazanavir and/or cobicistat, leading to loss of \ntherapeutic effect and possible development of resistance to atazanavir (see section 4.3 and Table 1).  \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \nCo-administration of EVOTAZ with medicinal products containing ritonavir or cobicistat, which are \nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A, may result in additional boosting and increased plasma concentration of \natazanavir. \n \nCo-administration of EVOTAZ with medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may result in increased \nplasma concentration of atazanavir and/or cobicistat. Some examples include, but are not limited to, \nitraconazole, ketoconazole and voriconazole (see Table 1). \n \nCo-administration of EVOTAZ with medicinal products that are moderate to weak inducers of \nCYP3A may result in decreased plasma concentration of atazanavir and/or cobicistat, leading to loss \nof therapeutic effect and possible development of resistance to atazanavir. Some examples include, but \nare not limited to etravirine, nevirapine, efavirenz, fluticasone and bosentan (see Table 1). \n \nMedicinal products that may be affected by atazanavir/cobicistat \n \nAtazanavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and UGT1A1. Atazanavir is a weak to moderate inhibitor of \nCYP2C8. Atazanavir has been shown in vivo not to induce its own metabolism, nor to increase the \nbiotransformation of some medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4.  \n \nCobicistat is a strong mechanism-based CYP3A inhibitor and a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor. Cobicistat \ninhibits the transporters p-glycoprotein (P-gp), BCRP, MATE1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. \nCobicistat is not expected to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19.  \nCobicistat is not expected to induce CYP3A4 or P-gp. Unlike ritonavir, cobicistat is not an inducer of \nCYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or UGT1A1. \n \nConcomitant use contraindicated \nCo-administration of medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A and have narrow therapeutic \nindeces and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or \nlife-threatening events are contraindicated with EVOTAZ. These medicinal products include \nalfuzosin, amiodarone, astemizole, bepridil, cisapride, colchicine, dronedarone, ergot deriviatives (e.g. \ndihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergonovine), lomitapide, lovastatin, orally \nadministered midazolam, pimozide, quetiapine, quinidine, lurasidone, simvastatin, sildenafil (when \nused to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension), avanafil, systemic lidocaine, ticagrelor, terfenadine and \ntriazolam. \n \nCo-administration of EVOTAZ with grazoprevir-containing products, including elbasvir/grazoprevir \nfixed dose combination (used to treat chronic hepatitis C infection) is contraindicated because of the \nincrease in grazoprevir and elbasvir plasma concentrations and potential for the increase in risk of \nALT elevations associated with the increase in grazoprevir concentrations (see section 4.3 and \nTable 1). Co-administration of EVOTAZ with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed dose combination is \ncontraindicated because of the potential increase in the risk of ALT elevations due to a significant \nincrease in glecaprevir and pibrentasvir plasma concentrations (see section 4.3). \n \nIncreased plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A, CYP2C8, \nCYP2D6 and/or UGT1A1 are expected when co-administered with EVOTAZ. Co-administration of \nEVOTAZ in patients receiving medicinal products that are substrates of the transporters P-gp, BCRP, \nMATE1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 may result in increased plasma concentrations of the \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n \n\nco-administered medicinal products (see section 4.4). Co-administration with dabigatran, a substrate of \nP-gp, is contraindicated. Clinically significant interactions between EVOTAZ and substrates of \nCYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 are not expected. \n \nInteraction table \n \nInteractions between EVOTAZ and other medicinal products are listed in Table 1 below (increase is \nindicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”). The recommendations shown in Table 1 are \nbased on either drug interaction trials of unboosted atazanavir, atazanavir boosted with ritonavir, \ncobicistat or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of the interaction and potential for \nserious adverse reactions or loss of therapeutic effect of EVOTAZ. If available, 90% confidence \nintervals (CI) are shown in parentheses. The studies presented in Table 1 were conducted in healthy \nsubjects unless otherwise noted. \n \nTable 1: Interactions between EVOTAZ and other medicinal products \n \n\nMedicinal products by

Co-administration with \nEVOTAZ may cause a large \nincrease in the concentration of \nthese benzodiazepines. Based on \ndata for other CYP3A4 inhibitors, \nplasma concentrations of \nmidazolam are expected to be \nsignificantly higher when \nmidazolam is given orally. Data \nfrom concomitant use of parenteral \nmidazolam with other protease \ninhibitors suggest a possible 3-4 \nfold increase in midazolam plasma \nlevels. \n\nEVOTAZ should not be \nco-administered with triazolam or \norally administered midazolam \n(see section 4.3), whereas caution \nshould be used with \nco-administration of EVOTAZ and \nparenteral midazolam. If \nEVOTAZ is co-administered with \nparenteral midazolam, it should be \ndone in an intensive care unit \n(ICU) or similar setting which \nensures close clinical monitoring \nand appropriate medical \nmanagement in case of respiratory \ndepression and/or prolonged \nsedation. Dosage adjustment for \nmidazolam should be considered, \nespecially if more than a single \ndose of midazolam is \nadministered. \n\nBuspirone \nClorazepate \nDiazepam  \nEstazolam  \nFlurazepam  \nZolpidem  \n\nConcentrations of these \nsedatives/hypnotics may be \nincreased when co-administered \nwith EVOTAZ. \n \nThe mechanism of interaction is \ninhibition of CYP3A4 by \ncobicistat. \n\nFor these sedatives/hypnotics, \ndose reduction may be necessary \nand concentration monitoring is \nrecommended. \n \n\nGASTROINTESTINAL MOTILITY AGENTS \n\nCisapride  EVOTAZ must not be used in \ncombination with medicinal \nproducts that are substrates of \nCYP3A4 and have a narrow \ntherapeutic index. \n\nCo-administration of EVOTAZ \nand cisapride is contraindicated \n(see section 4.3). \n\n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nEVOTAZ is not recommended during pregnancy nor should it be initiated in pregnant patients; an \nalternative regimen is recommended (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). This is due to substantially lower \nexposures of cobicistat and consequently, lower exposures of co-administered antiretroviral agents, \nincluding atazanavir, during the second and third trimesters, compared to postpartum. \n \nAnimal studies with EVOTAZ are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n \n\nBreast-feeding \n \nAtazanavir, an active component of EVOTAZ, has been detected in human milk. It is unknown if \ncobicistat/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Studies in animals have been shown excretion of \ncobicistat/metabolites in milk. Because of both the potential for HIV transmission and the potential for \nserious adverse reactions in breast-feeding infants, women should be instructed not to breast-feed if \nthey are receiving EVOTAZ.  \n \nFertility \n \nThe effect of EVOTAZ on fertility in humans has not been studied. In a nonclinical fertility and early \nembryonic development study in rats, atazanavir altered oestrus cycling with no effects on mating or \nfertility (see section 5.3). No human data on the effect of cobicistat on fertility are available. Animal \nstudies do not indicate harmful effects of cobicistat on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nEVOTAZ has a minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines.  Dizziness may occur \nfollowing administration of regimens containing atazanavir and cobicistat (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe overall safety profile of EVOTAZ is based on available data from clinical trials conducted with \natazanavir, atazanavir boosted with either cobicistat or ritonavir, and post-marketing data. \n \nAs EVOTAZ contains atazanavir and cobicistat, the adverse reactions associated with each of the \nindividual components may be expected. \n \nIn a Phase III study (GS-US-216-0114), the most frequently reported adverse reactions in the \natazanavir boosted with cobicistat group were associated with elevated bilirubin levels (see Table 2).  \n \nIn two controlled clinical trials, where subjects received atazanavir alone (400 mg once daily) or \natazanavir (300mg daily) boosted with ritonavir (100mg daily), the most frequently reported adverse \nreactions were nausea, diarrhoea and jaundice. In the majority of cases, jaundice was reported within a \nfew days to a few months after the initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \n \nChronic kidney disease in HIV-infected patients treated with atazanavir, with or without ritonavir, has \nbeen reported during postmarketing surveillance (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are listed by system organ class and frequency: very common (≥1/10), common \n(≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) and rare (≥1/10,000 to 1/1,000). Within each \nfrequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n \nTable 2: Tabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n \n\nSystem Organ Class \nFrequency \n\nAdverse Reactions \n\nImmune system disorders \nuncommon hypersensitivity \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \ncommon increased appetite \nuncommon weight decreased, weight gain, anorexia  \n\nPsychiatric disorders \ncommon insomnia, abnormal dreams \nuncommon depression, sleep disorder, disorientation, anxiety  \n\nNervous system disorders \ncommon headache, dizziness, somnolence, dysgeusia \nuncommon peripheral neuropathy, syncope, amnesia \n\nEye disorders \nvery common ocular icterus \n\nCardiac disorders \nuncommon torsades de pointesa \nrare QTc prolongationa, oedema, palpitation \n\nVascular disorders \nuncommon hypertension \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nuncommon dyspnoea \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nvery common nausea \ncommon vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, \n\nflatulence, dry mouth \nuncommon pancreatitis, gastritis, stomatitis aphthous \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \nvery common jaundice \ncommon hyperbilirubinaemia \nuncommon hepatitis, cholelithiasisa, cholestasisa \nrare hepatosplenomegaly, cholecystitisa \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \ncommon rash \nuncommon pruritus, erythema multiformea,b, toxic skin eruptionsa,b, drug rash with \n\neosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndromea,b, angioedemaa, \nurticaria, alopecia \n\nrare Stevens-Johnson syndromea,b, vesiculobullous rash, eczema, vasodilatation \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nuncommon myalgia, muscle atrophy, arthralgia \nrare myopathy \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \nuncommon nephrolithiasisa, haematuria, proteinuria, pollakiuria, interstitial nephritis, \n\nchronic kidney diseasea \nrare kidney pain \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \nuncommon gynaecomastia \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n \n\nSystem Organ Class \nFrequency \n\nAdverse Reactions \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \ncommon fatigue \nuncommon pyrexia, asthenia, chest pain, malaise \nrare gait disturbance \n\na These adverse reactions were identified through post-marketing surveillance; however, the frequencies \nwere estimated from a statistical calculation based on the total number of patients exposed to atazanavir \n(with and without ritonavir) in randomised controlled and other available clinical trials (n = 2321). \nb See section Description of selected adverse reactions for more details. \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nImmune reactivation syndrome and autoimmune disorders \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nOsteonecrosis \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART. The frequency of this is unknown \n(see section 4.4). \n \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy \n(see section 4.4). \n \nRash and associated syndromes \nRashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 3 weeks \nof starting therapy with atazanavir. \n \nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme, toxic skin eruptions and drug rash with \neosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported with the use of \natazanavir (see section 4.4). \n \nRenal impairment \nCobicistat, a component of EVOTAZ, has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due \nto inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine. An increase from baseline in serum creatinine solely \ndue to cobicistat’s inhibitory effect generally does not exceed 0.4 mg/dl. \n \nIn study GS-US-216-0114, decreases in estimated creatinine clearance occurred early in treatment \nwith cobicistat, after which they stabilised. The mean (± SD) change in estimated glomerular filtration \nrate (eGFR) by Cockcroft-Gault method after 144 weeks of treatment was -15.1 ± 16.5 ml/min in the \natazanavir boosted with cobicistat plus emtricitabine and tenofovir DF fixed-dose combination group \nand -8.0 ± 16.8 ml/min in the atazanavir boosted with ritonavir plus emtricitabine and tenofovir DF \nfixed-dose combination group. \n \nEffects on the liver  \nIn study GS-US-216-0114, through 144 weeks of treatment hyperbilirubinaemia (> 1 x ULN) was \ncommon: 97.7% in the atazanavir boosted with cobicistat plus emtricitabine and tenofovir DF \nfixed-dose combination group, and 97.4% in the atazanavir boosted with ritonavir plus emtricitabine \nand tenofovir DF fixed-dose combination group. However, a higher percentage of subjects in the \natazanavir boosted with cobicistat group had increases in total bilirubin > 2 x ULN than those in the \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n \n\natazanavir boosted with ritonavir group (88.0% versus 80.9%). The rates of study drug discontinuation \ndue to bilirubin-related adverse events were low and similar in both groups (4.9% in the \ncobicistat-boosted group and 4.0% in the ritonavir-boosted group). An increase of > 3 x ULN in \nalanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase was recorded in 12.8% of subjects in the \ncobicistat-boosted group and 9.0% in the ritonavir-boosted group. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \nThe most frequently reported laboratory abnormality in patients receiving regimens containing \natazanavir and one or more NRTIs was elevated total bilirubin reported predominantly as elevated \nindirect [unconjugated] bilirubin (87% Grade 1, 2, 3, or 4). Grade 3 or 4 elevation of total bilirubin \nwas noted in 37% (6% Grade 4). Among experienced patients treated with atazanavir 300 mg once \ndaily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily for a median duration of 95 weeks, 53% had Grade 3-4 total \nbilirubin elevations. Among naïve patients treated with atazanavir 300 mg once daily with 100 mg \nritonavir once daily for a median duration of 96 weeks, 48% had Grade 3-4 total bilirubin elevations \n(see section 4.4). \n \nOther marked clinical laboratory abnormalities (Grade 3 or 4) reported in ≥ 2% of patients receiving \nregimens containing atazanavir and one or more NRTIs included: elevated creatine kinase (7%), \nelevated alanine aminotransferase/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (ALT/SGPT) (5%), low \nneutrophils (5%), elevated aspartate aminotransferase/serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase \n(AST/SGOT) (3%), and elevated lipase (3%). \n \nTwo percent of patients treated with atazanavir experienced concurrent Grade 3-4 ALT/AST and \nGrade 3-4 total bilirubin elevations. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn clinical studies, paediatric patients 3 months to less than 18 years of age had a mean duration of \ntreatment with atazanavir of 115 weeks. The safety profile in these studies was overall comparable to \nthat seen in adults. Both asymptomatic first-degree (23%) and second-degree (1%) atrioventricular \nblock were reported in paediatric patients. The most frequently reported laboratory abnormality in \npaediatric patients receiving atazanavir was elevation of total bilirubin (≥ 2.6 times ULN, Grade 3-4) \nwhich occurred in 45% of patients. \n \nOther special populations \n \nPatients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus \nCo-infected patients with hepatitis B and/or C were more likely to have baseline hepatic transaminase \nelevations than those without chronic viral hepatitis. No differences in frequency of bilirubin \nelevations were observed between these patients and those without viral hepatitis. The frequency of \ntreatment emergent hepatitis or transaminase elevations in co-infected patients was comparable \nbetween atazanavir and comparator regimens (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus co-infection: \nIn GS-US-216-0114, 3.6% of subjects were hepatitis B virus surface antigen positive and 5.3% were \nhepatitis C virus seropositive. Subjects with significant liver function test abnormalities generally had \nabnormal baseline transaminases (AST or ALT), underlying chronic or acute hepatitis B or C \nco-infection, concomitant hepatotoxic medicinal products (e.g., isoniazid), or a medical history of \nalcoholism or alcohol abuse. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nHuman experience of acute overdose with EVOTAZ is limited. \n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with EVOTAZ. If overdose occurs with EVOTAZ, the \npatient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity. Treatment should consist of general supportive \nmeasures including monitoring of vital signs and ECG as well as observation of the patient’s clinical \nstatus. Since atazanavir and cobicistat are extensively metabolised by the liver and highly protein \nbound, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of this medicinal product. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use; antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, \ncombinations. ATC code: J05AR15 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nEVOTAZ is a fixed-dose combination of the antiviral drug atazanavir boosted by the pharmacokinetic \nenhancer cobicistat. \n \nAtazanavir \nAtazanavir is an azapeptide HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI). The compound selectively inhibits the \nvirus-specific processing of viral Gag-Pol proteins in HIV-1 infected cells, thus preventing formation \nof mature virions and infection of other cells. \n \nCobicistat \nCobicistat is a selective, mechanism-based inhibitor of cytochromes P450 of the CYP3A subfamily. \nInhibition of CYP3A-mediated metabolism by cobicistat enhances the systemic exposure of CYP3A \nsubstrates, such as atazanavir, where bioavailability is limited and half-life is shortened by \nCYP3A-dependent metabolism. \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro \n \nAtazanavir \nAtazanavir exhibits anti-HIV-1 (including all clades tested) and anti-HIV-2 activity in cell culture. \n \nCobicistat \nCobicistat has no antiviral activity. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nEffect of cobicistat on atazanavir pharmacokinetics \nThe antiretroviral effect of EVOTAZ is due to the atazanavir component. The activity of cobicistat as \na pharmacokinetic enhancer to atazanavir has been demonstrated in pharmacokinetic trials. In these \npharmacokinetic trials, the exposure of atazanavir 300 mg with cobicistat 150 mg was consistent with \nthat observed when boosted with ritonavir 100 mg. EVOTAZ is bioequivalent to atazanavir 300 mg \nonce daily in combination with cobicistat 150 mg once daily coadministered as single agents (see \nsection 5.2).  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nIn treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients \nThe safety and efficacy of atazanavir with cobicistat in HIV-1 infected patients were evaluated in the \nrandomised, double-blind, active-controlled phase 3 study GS-US-216-0114 in HIV-1 infected \npatients with baseline estimated creatinine clearance above 70 ml/min who were treatment-naïve \n(n = 692). \n \nPatients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either atazanavir 300 mg with cobicistat 150 mg \nonce daily or atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily, each administered with a fixed \nbackground regimen containing tenofovir DF 300 mg and emtricitabine 200 mg administered as a \nfixed-dose combination tablet. Randomisation was stratified by screening HIV-1 RNA level \n(≤100,000 copies/ml or >100,000 copies/ml). Virologic response rate was evaluated in both treatment \narms and virologic response was defined as achieving an undetectable viral load (<50 HIV-1 \nRNA copies/ml). Viruses were known to be susceptible to atazanavir, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF \nat baseline. \n \nThe demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between the atazanavir with cobicistat and \natazanavir with ritonavir groups. The median age of subjects was 36 years (range: 19-70). The median \nbaseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.81 log10 copies/ml (range: 3.21-6.44). The median baseline CD4+ \ncell count was 352 cells/mm3 (range: 1-1455) and 16.9% had CD4+ cell counts ≤200 cells/mm3. The \npercentage of subjects with baseline viral loads >100,000 copies/ml was 39.7%.

Cobicistat does not select any HIV \nresistance mutations, due to its lack of antiviral activity. \n \nAtazanavir \nIn clinical trials of antiretroviral treatment naive patients treated with unboosted atazanavir, the I50L \nsubstitution, sometimes in combination with an A71V change, is the signature resistance substitution \nfor atazanavir. Resistance levels to atazanavir ranged from 3.5- to 29-fold without evidence of \nphenotypic cross resistance to other PIs. For more information consult the REYATAZ Summary of \nProduct Characteristics. \n \nAtazanavir with cobicistat \nLimited data are available on the development of resistance to atazanavir boosted with cobicistat. \n \nIn an analysis of treatment-failure subjects who received atazanavir 300 mg co-administered with \ncobicistat 150 mg in study GS-US-216-0114 through Week 144, evaluable genotypic data from paired \nbaseline and treatment-failure isolates were available for all 21 virologic failures in this group (6%, \n21/344). Among the 21 subjects, 3 developed the emtricitabine-associated resistance substitution \nM184V. No subject developed the tenofovir-associated resistance substitution K65R or K70E or any \nprimary resistance substitution associated with protease inhibitors. In the group receiving atazanavir \n300 mg co-administered with ritonavir 100 mg, evaluable genotypic data was available for all \n19 virologic failures (5%, 19/348). Among the 19 patients, 1 developed the emtricitabine-associated \nresistance substitution M184V with no tenofovir or protease inhibitor associated resistance \nsubstitutions. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nEVOTAZ in the treatment of HIV-1 infection (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nOne EVOTAZ tablet is bioequivalent to one atazanavir capsule (300 mg) plus one cobicistat tablet \n(150 mg) following single oral dose administration with a light meal in healthy subjects (n=62). \n \nThe following statements reflect the pharmacokinetic properties of atazanavir in combination with \ncobicistat or the individual components of EVOTAZ. \n \nAbsorption \nIn a trial where HIV-infected subjects (n=22) were instructed to take atazanavir 300 mg with cobicistat \n150 mg once daily with food, the steady-state atazanavir Cmax, AUCtau and Ctau (mean ± SD) values \nwere 3.9 ± 1.9 μg/ml, 46.1 ± 26.2 μg•hr/ml and 0.80 ± 0.72 μg/ml, respectively. Steady-state cobicistat \nCmax, AUCtau and Ctau (mean ± SD) values were 1.5 ± 0.5 μg/ml, 11.1 ± 4.5 μg•hr/ml and \n0.05 ± 0.07 μg/ml, respectively (n=22).  \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n \n\n \nFood effect \nAdministration of a single dose of EVOTAZ with a light meal (336 kcal, 5.1 g fat, 9.3 g protein) \nresulted in a 42% increase in atazanavir Cmax, a 28% increase in atazanavir AUC, a 31% increase in \ncobicistat Cmax, and a 24% increase in cobicistat AUC relative to the fasting state. Administration of a \nsingle dose of EVOTAZ with a high fat meal (1,038 kcal, 59 g fat, 37 g protein) resulted in a 14% \nreduction in atazanavir Cmax with no change in atazanavir AUC or cobicistat exposures (Cmax, AUC) \nrelative to the fasting state. The 24-hour atazanavir concentration following a high-fat meal was \nincreased approximately 23% due to delayed absorption; the median Tmax increased from 2.0 to \n3.5 hours. Cmax and AUCs after a high fat meal decreased 36% and 25% in comparison to a light meal, \nrespectively; however, the 24-hour atazanavir concentration was similar when EVOTAZ was given \nwith a light meal and a high fat meal. To enhance bioavailability, EVOTAZ is to be taken with food. \n \nDistribution \n \nAtazanavir \nAtazanavir was approximately 86% bound to human serum proteins over a concentration range of 100 \nto 10,000 ng/ml. Atazanavir binds to both alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and albumin to a similar \nextent (89% and 86%, respectively, at 1,000 ng/ml). In a multiple-dose study in HIV-infected patients \ndosed with 400 mg of atazanavir once daily with a light meal for 12 weeks, atazanavir was detected in \nthe cerebrospinal fluid and semen. \n \nCobicistat \nCobicistat is 97-98% bound to human plasma proteins and the mean plasma to blood drug \nconcentration ratio was 2. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nAtazanavir \nStudies in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes have demonstrated that \natazanavir is principally metabolised by CYP3A4 isozyme to oxygenated metabolites. Metabolites are \nthen excreted in the bile as either free or glucuronidated metabolites. Additional minor metabolic \npathways consist of N-dealkylation and hydrolysis. Two minor metabolites of atazanavir in plasma \nhave been characterised. Neither metabolite demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity. \n \nCobicistat \nCobicistat is metabolised via CYP3A (major)- and CYP2D6 (minor)-mediated oxidation and does not \nundergo glucuronidation. Following oral administration of [14C]cobicistat, 99% of circulating \nradioactivity in plasma was unchanged cobicistat. Low levels of metabolites are observed in urine and \nfaeces and do not contribute to the CYP3A inhibitory activity of cobicistat. \n \nElimination \n \nAtazanavir \nFollowing a single 400 mg dose of [14C]atazanavir, 79% and 13% of the total radioactivity was \nrecovered in the faeces and urine, respectively. Unchanged drug accounted for approximately 20% and \n7% of the administered dose in the faeces and urine, respectively. Mean urinary excretion of \nunchanged drug was 7% following 2 weeks of dosing at 800 mg once daily. In HIV-infected adult \npatients (n=33, combined studies), the mean half-life within a dosing interval for atazanavir was \n12 hours at steady state following a dose of 300 mg daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with a light \nmeal.  \n \nCobicistat \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n \n\nFollowing oral administration of [14C]cobicistat, 86% and 8.2% of the dose were recovered in faeces \nand urine, respectively. The median terminal plasma half-life of cobicistat following administration of \ncobicistat is approximately 3-4 hours. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nAtazanavir \nAtazanavir demonstrates nonlinear pharmacokinetics with greater than dose-proportional increases in \nAUC and Cmax values over the dose range of 200 mg to 800 mg once daily.  \n \nCobicistat \nCobicistat exposures are non-linear and greater than dose-proportional over the range of 50 mg to \n400 mg, consistent with a mechanism-based CYP3A inhibitor. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nAtazanavir \nIn healthy subjects, the renal elimination of unchanged atazanavir was approximately 7% of the \nadministered dose. There are no pharmacokinetic data available for atazanavir in combination with \ncobicistat in patients with renal insufficiency. Atazanavir has been studied in adult patients with severe \nrenal impairment (n=20), including those on haemodialysis, at multiple doses of 400 mg once daily. \nAlthough this study presented some limitations (i.e., unbound drug concentrations not studied), results \nsuggested that the atazanavir pharmacokinetic parameters were decreased by 30% to 50% in patients \nundergoing haemodialysis compared to patients with normal renal function. The mechanism of this \ndecrease is unknown (see sections 4.2 and 4.4.) \n \nCobicistat \nA study of the pharmacokinetics of cobicistat was performed in non-HIV-1 infected subjects with \nsevere renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min). No meaningful differences \nin cobicistat pharmacokinetics were observed between subjects with severe renal impairment and \nhealthy subjects, consistent with low renal clearance of cobicistat. \n \nHepatic impairment \nAtazanavir \nAtazanavir is metabolised and eliminated primarily by the liver. The effects of hepatic impairment on \nthe pharmacokinetics of atazanavir given with cobicistat have not been studied. Concentrations of \natazanavir given with cobicistat are expected to be increased in patients with impaired hepatic function \n(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nCobicistat \nCobicistat is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver. A study of the pharmacokinetics of \ncobicistat was performed in non-HIV-1 infected subjects with moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh Class B). No clinically relevant differences in cobicistat pharmacokinetics were observed \nbetween subjects with moderate impairment and healthy subjects. The effect of severe hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh Class C) on the pharmacokinetics of cobicistat has not been studied. \n \nElderly \nThe pharmacokinetics of atazanavir and cobicistat, alone or in combination, have not been evaluated \nin an elderly population (65 years of age and older). \n \nPaediatric population \nNo data are available on the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir and cobicistat in combination in paediatric \npatients. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n \n\nGender \nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to gender have been identified for atazanavir or \ncobicistat.  \n \nRace \nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to ethnicity have been identified for atazanavir \nor cobicistat. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn a 3-month combination oral toxicity study of atazanavir and cobicistat in rats, there were no \ntoxicologic interactions apparent as no additive or synergistic toxicities were observed. When \ncompared to their single-agent profiles all findings could be attributed to either atazanavir or \ncobicistat.  \n \nIn an ex vivo rabbit pharmacology study, isolated hearts were exposed to atazanavir, cobicistat, or \natazanavir and cobicistat in combination. Each single agent produced effects on left ventricular \ncontractility and PR prolongation at concentrations at least 35-fold higher than the free atazanavir and \ncobicistat concentrations at the recommended human dose (RHD) Cmax. When administered in \ncombination, no clear additive or synergistic cardiovascular effects were observed at atazanavir and \ncobicistat concentrations at least 2-fold higher than the free atazanavir and cobicistat concentrations at \nthe RHD Cmax.  \n \nThe following statements reflect the preclinical safety results of the individual active substances of \nEVOTAZ. \n \nAtazanavir \n \nIn repeat-dose toxicity studies, conducted in mice, rats, and dogs, atazanavir-related findings were \ngenerally confined to the liver and included generally minimal to mild increases in serum bilirubin and \nliver enzymes, hepatocellular vacuolation and hypertrophy, and, in female mice only, hepatic \nsingle-cell necrosis. Systemic exposures of atazanavir in mice (males), rats, and dogs at doses \nassociated with hepatic changes were at least equal to that observed in humans given 400 mg \nonce daily. In female mice, atazanavir exposure at a dose that produced single-cell necrosis was \n12 times the exposure in humans given 400 mg once daily. Serum cholesterol and glucose were \nminimally to mildly increased in rats but not in mice or dogs. \n \nDuring in vitro studies, cloned human cardiac potassium channel (hERG), was inhibited by 15% at a \nconcentration (30 μM) of atazanavir corresponding to 30 fold the free drug concentration at Cmax in \nhumans. Similar concentrations of atazanavir increased by 13% the action potential duration (APD90) \nin rabbit Purkinje fibres study. Electrocardiographic changes (sinus bradycardia, prolongation of PR \ninterval, prolongation of QT interval, and prolongation of QRS complex) were observed only in an \ninitial 2 week oral toxicity study performed in dogs. Subsequent 9 month oral toxicity studies in dogs \nshowed no drug-related electrocardiographic changes. The clinical relevance of these non-clinical data \nis unknown. Potential cardiac effects of this product in humans cannot be ruled out (see sections 4.4 \nand 4.8). The potential for PR prolongation should be considered in cases of overdose \n(see section 4.9). \n \nIn a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, atazanavir altered oestrus cycling with no \neffects on mating or fertility. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats or rabbits at maternally toxic \ndoses. In pregnant rabbits, gross lesions of the stomach and intestines were observed in dead or \nmoribund does at maternal doses 2 and 4 times the highest dose administered in the definitive \nembryo-development study. In the pre- and postnatal development assessment in rats, atazanavir \nproduced a transient reduction in body weight in the offspring at a maternally toxic dose. Systemic \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n \n\nexposure to atazanavir at doses that resulted in maternal toxicity was at least equal to or slightly \ngreater than that observed in humans given 400 mg once daily. \n \nAtazanavir was negative in an Ames reverse-mutation assay but did induce chromosomal aberrations \nin vitro in both the absence and presence of metabolic activation. In in vivo studies in rats, atazanavir \ndid not induce micronuclei in bone marrow, DNA damage in duodenum (comet assay), or unscheduled \nDNA repair in liver at plasma and tissue concentrations exceeding those that were clastogenic in vitro. \n \nIn long-term carcinogenicity studies of atazanavir in mice and rats, an increased incidence of benign \nhepatic adenomas was seen in female mice only. The increased incidence of benign hepatic adenomas \nin female mice was likely secondary to cytotoxic liver changes manifested by single-cell necrosis and \nis considered to have no relevance for humans at intended therapeutic exposures. There were no \ntumorigenic findings in male mice or in rats. \n \nAtazanavir increased opacity of bovine corneas in an in vitro ocular irritation study, indicating it may \nbe an ocular irritant upon direct contact with the eye. \n \nCobicistat \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose \ntoxicity, genotoxicity, and toxicity to reproduction and development. No teratogenic effects were \nobserved in rats and rabbit developmental toxicity studies. In rats, ossification changes in the spinal \ncolumn and sternebra of foetuses occurred at a dose that produced significant maternal toxicity. \n \nEx vivo rabbit studies and in vivo dog studies suggest that cobicistat has a low potential for QT \nprolongation, and may slightly prolong the PR interval and decrease left ventricular function at mean \nconcentrations at least 10-fold higher than the human exposure at the recommended 150 mg daily \ndose. \n \nA long-term carcinogenicity study of cobicistat in rats revealed tumourigenic potential specific for this \nspecies that is regarded as of no relevance for humans. A long-term carcinogenicity study in mice did \nnot show any carcinogenic potential. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What EVOTAZ is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take EVOTAZ \n3. How to take EVOTAZ \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store EVOTAZ \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What EVOTAZ is and what it is used for \n \nEVOTAZ contains two active substances: \n atazanavir, an antiviral (or antiretroviral) medicine. It is one of a group called protease \n\ninhibitors. These medicines control human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by stopping \nproduction of a protein that HIV needs for its multiplication. They work by reducing the amount \nof HIV in your body and this in turn, strengthens your immune system. In this way atazanavir \nreduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection. \n\n cobicistat, a booster (pharmacokinetic enhancer) to help improve the effects of atazanavir. \nCobicistat, does not directly treat your HIV, but boosts the levels of atazanavir in the blood. It \ndoes this by slowing down the breakdown of atazanavir which will make it stay in the body for \nlonger. \n\n \nEVOTAZ may be used by adults aged 18 years of age and older who are infected with HIV, the virus \nthat causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). It is used in combination with other \nanti-HIV medicines to help control your HIV infection. Your doctor will discuss with you which \ncombination of these medicines with EVOTAZ is best for you. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take EVOTAZ \n \nDo not take EVOTAZ \n if you are allergic to atazanavir, cobicistat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \n\nin section 6) \n if you have moderate to severe liver problems \n if you are taking any of these medicines: see also Other medicines and EVOTAZ  \n\n rifampicin (an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis) \n carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (antiepileptics used to prevent seizures) \n astemizole or terfenadine (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms, these medicines may \n\nbe available without prescription); cisapride (used to treat gastric reflux, sometimes called \nheartburn); pimozide (used to treat schizophrenia); amiodarone, dronedarone, quinidine, \n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n \n\nlidocaine (injectable) or bepridil (used to correct heart rhythm); ergotamine, \ndihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergometrine and methylergonovine (used to treat \nheadaches); and alfuzosin (used to treat enlarged prostatic gland) \n\n quetiapine (used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder); \nlurasidone (used to treat schizophrenia) \n\n medicines containing St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum, a herbal preparation). \n triazolam and oral (taken by mouth) midazolam (used to help you sleep and/or to relieve \n\nanxiety) \n simvastatin, lovastatin, and lomitapide (used to lower blood cholesterol) \n avanafil (used to treat erectile dysfunction) \n colchicine (used to treat gout), if you have kidney and/or liver problems \n dabigatran and ticagrelor (used to prevent and reduce the blood clots) \n grazoprevir-containing products, including elbasvir/grazoprevir fixed dose combination, and \n\nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed dose combination (used to treat chronic hepatitis C infection) \n \nDo not take sildenafil with EVOTAZ when sildenafil is used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial \nhypertension. Sildenafil is also used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Tell your doctor if you \nare using sildenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. \n \nTell your doctor at once if any of these apply to you. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nSome people will need special care before or while taking EVOTAZ. Talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking EVOTAZ.  \n \nEVOTAZ is not a cure for HIV infection. You may continue to develop infections or other illnesses \nlinked to HIV infection. You can still pass on HIV to other people when taking this medicine, \nalthough the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your doctor the \nprecautions needed to avoid infecting other people. \n \nMake sure your doctor knows: \n if you have liver problems \n if you develop signs or symptoms of gall stones (pain in your right side). Gall stones have been \n\nreported in patients taking atazanavir, a component of EVOTAZ.  \n if you have type A or B haemophilia. You may notice increased bleeding. \n if you have problems with your kidneys or require haemodialysis. Kidney stones have been \n\nreported in patients taking atazanavir, a component of EVOTAZ. If you develop signs or \nsymptoms of kidney stones (pain in your side, blood in your urine, pain when you urinate), \nplease inform your doctor immediately \n\n if you are taking oral contraceptives (\"the Pill\") to prevent pregnancy. If you are currently \nusing an oral contraceptive or using a patch contraceptive to prevent pregnancy, you should use \nan additional or different type of contraception (e.g. condom) \n\n \nIn some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs \nand symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is \nstarted. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, \nenabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you \nnotice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately. In addition to the \nopportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system \nattacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your \nHIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you \nnotice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in \nhands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, \nplease inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n \n\nSome patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe \nimmunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for \ndeveloping this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the \nhip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor. \n \nHyperbilirubinaemia (an increase in the level of bilirubin in the blood) has occurred in patients \nreceiving EVOTAZ. The signs may be a mild yellowing of the skin or eyes. If you notice any of these \nsymptoms please inform your doctor. \n \nSerious skin rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, may develop in patients taking EVOTAZ.

It is unknown if cobicistat, the other \ncomponent of EVOTAZ, is excreted in human milk but it has been shown in animals that it is excreted \nin milk. Talk to your doctor about breast-feeding if you are taking EVOTAZ. Patients should not \nbreast-feed while taking EVOTAZ. It is recommended that women infected with HIV do not \nbreast-feed because the virus might be transmitted through the breast milk.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome patients have reported dizziness when taking atazanavir or cobicistat, active substances of \nEVOTAZ. If you feel dizzy or lightheaded, do not drive, use any tools or use machines and contact \nyour doctor immediately. \n \n \n3.

The tablets have a poor taste, therefore swallow the tablet whole; do \nnot crush or chew the tablets. This will help ensure you get the full dose. \n \nIf you take more EVOTAZ than you should \nIf you accidentally take more EVOTAZ than your doctor recommended, contact your doctor at once or \ncontact the nearest hospital for advice. \n \nIf you forget to take EVOTAZ \nIf you miss a dose of EVOTAZ by 12 hours or less, take it right away with food and then take your \nnext scheduled dose at the usual time. If you miss a dose and it is more than 12 hours from the time \nyou should have taken EVOTAZ, do not take the missed dose. Wait and take the next dose at the usual \ntime.
