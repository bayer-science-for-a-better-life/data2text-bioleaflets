NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTeysuno 15 mg/4.35 mg/11.8 mg hard capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach hard capsule contains 15 mg tegafur, 4.35 mg gimeracil and 11.8 mg oteracil (as \nmonopotassium). \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach hard capsule contains 70.2 mg lactose monohydrate. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule (capsule). \n \nThe capsule has an opaque white body and opaque brown cap imprinted “TC448” in grey. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTeysuno is indicated in adults for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer when given in combination \nwith cisplatin (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTeysuno should only be prescribed by a qualified physician experienced in treating cancer patients \nwith anti-neoplastic medicinal products.   \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended standard dose of Teysuno when administered in combination with cisplatin is \n25 mg/m2 (expressed as tegafur content) twice daily, morning and evening, for 21 consecutive days \nfollowed by 7 days rest (1 treatment cycle).  This treatment cycle is repeated every 4 weeks.   \n \nThe standard and reduced Teysuno and cisplatin doses and calculations according to body surface area \n(BSA) for doses of Teysuno given in combination with cisplatin are provided in Table 1 and Table 2, \nrespectively.  The patient's BSA must be recalculated and the Teysuno dose adjusted accordingly if a \npatient’s weight increases or decreases by ≥10% from the one used for the previous calculation of \nBSA and the change is clearly not related to fluid retention. \n \nThe recommended dose of cisplatin with this regimen is 75 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion \nadministered once every 4 weeks.  Cisplatin should be discontinued after 6 cycles without withdrawal \nof Teysuno.  If cisplatin is discontinued before 6 cycles, Teysuno treatment alone can be resumed \nwhen the criteria for restarting it are met. \n \nPatients treated with Teysuno in combination with cisplatin should be closely monitored and \nlaboratory tests, including haematology, liver function, renal function, and serum electrolytes, should \nbe performed frequently.  Treatment should be discontinued if progressive disease or intolerable \ntoxicity is observed. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nRefer to the cisplatin summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for pretreatment  hyperhydration.   \n \nPatients should be provided with outpatient prescriptions for anti-emetic and anti-diarrhoeal medicinal \nproducts. \n \nTeysuno doses \n \nTable 1: Standard dose and dose reductions allowed for Teysuno and/or for cisplatin  \n \n\nMedicinal \nproduct \n\nStandard dose \n(mg/m2) \n\n Dose reduction 1 \n(mg/m2) \n\n Dose reduction 2 \n(mg/m2) \n\nTeysuno 25a → 20a → 15a \nand/or \nCisplatin 75 → 60 → 45 \na Expressed as tegafur content. \n\n \nTeysuno dose calculations \n \nTable 2: Standard and reduced dose calculations by body surface area (m2) \n \n\nTeysuno dose Each dose in mg \n(each dosing)a \n\nTotal daily dose \nin mga \n\nNumber of capsules for each dose \n(2 doses/day) \n\nStandard dosea: 25 mg/m2   15 mg capsulea \n(brown/white) \n\n20 mg capsulea \n(white) \n\nBSA ≥ 2.30 m2 60 120 0 3 \nBSA = 2.10 - 2.29 m2 55 110 1 2 \nBSA = 1.90 - 2.09 m2 50 100 2 1 \nBSA = 1.70 - 1.89 m2 45 90 3 0 \nBSA = 1.50 - 1.69 m2 40 80 0 2 \nBSA = 1.30 - 1.49 m2 35 70 1 1 \nBSA ≤ 1.29 m2 30 60 2 0 \nFirst dose reductiona: to 20 mg/m2 \nBSA ≥ 2.13 m2 45 90 3 0 \nBSA = 1.88 - 2.12 m2 40 80 0 2 \nBSA = 1.63 - 1.87 m2 35 70 1 1 \nBSA = 1.30 - 1.62 m2 30 60 2 0 \nBSA ≤ 1.29 m2 20 40 0 1 \nSecond dose reductiona: to 15 mg/m2 \nBSA ≥ 2.17 m2 35 70 1 1 \nBSA = 1.67 - 2.16 m2 30 60 2 0 \nBSA = 1.30 - 1.66 m2 20 40 0 1 \nBSA ≤ 1.29 m2 15 30 1 0 \nCalculate BSA to 2 decimal places. \na Expressed as tegafur content. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nAdjustments during treatment \n \nGeneral \n \nToxicity due to Teysuno administration should be managed with symptomatic treatment and/or \ntreatment interruption or dose reduction.  Patients taking Teysuno should be informed of the risks and \ninstructed to contact their physician immediately if moderate or severe toxicity occurs.   \n \nDoses omitted for toxicity are not replaced; and, if a patient vomits after taking a dose, this dose \nshould not be replaced. \n \nOnce the Teysuno dose has been reduced, it should not be increased again. \n \nTeysuno dose modification criteria \n \nDose modifications for toxicity should be made according to Tables 1, 3, 4, and 5.  A maximum of \ntwo consecutive dose reductions for each medicinal product, as described in Table 1, can be applied in \ncase of toxicity.  Each dose reduction results in approximately 20-25% reduction of dose.  See Table 2 \nfor the details of the number of Teysuno capsules to be administered for each dose level.  For \nminimum criteria for resumption of Teysuno treatment, see Table 6. \n \nTeysuno dose modifications for toxicity when used in combination with cisplatin can be made in two \nways. \n \nDuring a 4-week cycle of treatment \n \nTeysuno should only be given on Days 1 to 21 of each cycle, i.e., treatment should not be given on \nDays 22 to 28 of a cycle.  Treatment days missed in a cycle where medicinal product was held due to \ntoxicity should not be replaced.   \n \nDuring a treatment cycle, dose adjustment should be performed for each individual medicinal product \nthat is considered to be causally related to the toxicity, if such a distinction can be made.  If both \nmedicinal products are considered to be causing the toxicity or it is not possible to distinguish them, \nthen dose reduction should be performed for both according to the recommended dose reduction \nschedule.   \n \nAt the initiation of subsequent cycles of treatment \n \nIf a treatment delay is indicated for either Teysuno or cisplatin, then administration of both medicinal \nproducts should be delayed until the requirements for restarting both are met unless one of the \nmedicinal products has been permanently discontinued.  \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nDose modifications for Teysuno for adverse reactions in general except for haematologic and renal \ntoxicities \n \nTable 3: Teysuno dose reduction schedule for treatment-related toxicities in general, except for \nhaematologic and renal toxicities \n \n\nToxicity gradesa Teysuno dose changes within a 21-day \ntreatment cycle \n\nTeysuno dose adjustment \nfor next dose / next cycle \n\nGrade 1 \nAny occurrence Maintain treatment at same dose level None \nGrade 2b,c \nAny occurrence Suspend treatment until Grade 0 or 1 None \nGrade 3 or higherc \nFirst occurrence Suspend treatment until Grade 0 or 1 Reduce by 1 dose level from \n\nprevious level \nSecond occurrence Suspend treatment until Grade 0 or 1 Reduce by 1 dose level from \n\nprevious level \nThird occurrence Discontinue treatment Discontinue treatment \na According to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) of the Cancer Therapy \nEvaluation Program, US National Cancer Institute, version 3.0. \nb For Grade 2 nausea and/or vomiting, the anti-emetic therapy should be optimized prior to a suspension of \nTeysuno. \nc At the discretion of the treating physician, patients may continue with treatment without reduction or \ninterruption for adverse reactions (irrespective of grade) considered unlikely to become serious or life-\nthreatening (e.g., alopecia, changes in sexual function, and dry skin). \n\n \nDose modifications for renal toxicities \n \nCreatinine clearance (CrCl) must be determined for every cycle before the start of treatment on Day 1.   \n \nTable 4: Teysuno and cisplatin dose modification according to creatinine clearance values at the start \nof a cycle of treatment \n \n\nCreatinine \nclearance \n\nTeysuno dose modification at the \nstart of the cycle of treatment \n\nCisplatin dose modification at the \nstart of the cycle of treatment \n\n≥50 ml/min No dose modification No dose modification \n30 to 49 ml/min Start treatment at one reduced dose \n\nlevel \nStart cisplatin treatment at a 50% \ndose reduction from the previous \n\ncycle \n<30 ml/mina Suspend treatment until resumption \n\ncriterion (≥30 ml/min) is met and \nthen start treatment at one reduced \n\ndose level \n\nSuspend cisplatin treatment until \nresumption criterion (≥30 ml/min) is \nmet and then start treatment at a 50% \n\ndose reduction from the previous \ncycle \n\na Treatment for patients with CrCl <30 ml/min is not recommended unless the benefits of Teysuno \ntreatment clearly outweigh the risks.

Refer to “Dose modifications for special populations / Renal impairment for \nguidance.” \n\n \nDose modifications for special populations \n \nRenal impairment \n \n\n• Mild renal impairment (CrCl 51 to 80 ml/min) \n \n\nNo adjustment of the standard dose is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment (see \nsection 5.2). \n\n \n• Moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to 50 ml/min) \n\n \nThe recommended standard dose in patients with moderate renal impairment is 20 mg/m2 twice \ndaily (expressed as tegafur content) (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \n\n \n• Severe renal impairment (CrCl below 30 ml/min) \n\n \nAlthough roughly similar daily exposure to 5-FU would be expected in patients with severe \nrenal impairment at a dose of 20 mg/m2 once daily compared to 30 mg/m2 twice daily in patients \nwith normal renal function (see section 5.2), administration of Teysuno is not recommended due \nto possibly higher incidence of adverse events of the blood and lymphatic system disorders \nunless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nNo data is available regarding Teysuno administration in patients with end stage renal disease \nrequiring dialysis (see section 4.3). \n\n \nElderly   \n \nNo adjustment of the standard dose is recommended in patients >70 years old (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nHepatic impairment \n \nNo adjustment of the standard dose is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment (see \nsection 5.2).   \n \nEthnicity \n \nNo adjustment of the standard dose is recommended for patients of Asian ethnicity (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Teysuno in children and adolescents under 18 years old have not been \nestablished.  No data are available.  Therefore, Teysuno should not be administered to children or \nadolescents under 18 years of age. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe capsules should be taken by mouth with water at least 1 hour before or 1 hour after a meal (see \nsection 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to any of the active substances (tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil) or to any of the \n\nexcipients listed in 6.1. \n \n• History of severe and unexpected reactions to fluoropyrimidine therapy. \n \n• Known complete dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency (see section 4.4). \n \n• Pregnancy and breast-feeding. \n \n• Severe bone marrow suppression (severe leukopaenia, neutropaenia, or thrombocytopaenia; see \n\nsection 4.2, Table 5). \n \n• End stage renal disease patients requiring dialysis. \n \n• Co-administration of other fluoropyrimidines with Teysuno. \n \n• Recent or concomitant treatment with brivudine (see section 4.4 and 4.5 for drug-drug \n\ninteraction). \n \n• Contraindications for cisplatin; refer to the cisplatin SmPC. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDose limiting toxicities include diarrhoea and dehydration.  Most adverse reactions are reversible and \ncan be managed by symptomatic therapy, dose interruptions and dose reductions. \n \nBone marrow suppression  \n \nTreatment-related bone marrow suppression, including neutropaenia, leukopaenia, thrombocytopaenia, \nanaemia, and pancytopaenia, has been reported among patients treated with Teysuno in combination \nwith cisplatin.  Patients with low white blood cell counts should be monitored carefully for infection \nand risk of other complications of neutropaenia and treated as medically indicated (e.g., with \nantibiotics, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [G-CSF]).  Patients with low platelet counts are at \nincreased risk for bleeding and should be monitored carefully.  The dose should be modified as \nrecommended in section 4.2. \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \n \nAdministration of Teysuno in hepatitis B virus carriers, HBc antigen negative and HBc antibody \npositive patients, or HBs antigen negative and HBs antibody positive patients may result in \nreactivation of hepatitis B. \n \nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Teysuno. Experts in liver \ndisease and in the treatment of hepatitis B should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients \nwith positive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease) and for patients who test \npositive for HBV infection during treatment. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with Teysuno \nshould be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy, and \nfollow-up monitoring for hepatic function tests or viral markers are recommended. \nDiarrhoea  \n \nPatients with diarrhoea should be carefully monitored and given fluid and electrolyte replacement if \nthey become dehydrated.  Prophylactic treatment for diarrhoea should be administered as indicated.  \nStandard anti-diarrhoeal therapy (e.g., loperamide) and intravenous fluids/electrolytes should be \ninitiated early when diarrhoea develops.  Dose suspension/adjustment should be implemented with the \noccurrence of Grade 2 or higher diarrhoea if symptoms persist despite adequate treatment. \n \nDehydration  \n \nDehydration and any associated electrolyte disturbances should be prevented or corrected at onset.  \nPatients with anorexia, asthenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, stomatitis, and gastrointestinal \nobstruction should be monitored closely for signs of dehydration.  Dehydration should be managed \naggressively with rehydration and other appropriate measures.  If Grade 2 (or higher) dehydration \noccurs, treatment should be immediately suspended and the dehydration corrected.  Treatment should \nnot be resumed until dehydration and its underlying causes are corrected or adequately controlled.  \nDose modifications should be applied for the precipitating adverse reaction as necessary (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nRenal toxicity  \n \nTreatment with Teysuno in combination with cisplatin may be associated with a transient decline of \nglomerular filtration rate caused primarily by pre-renal factors (e.g., dehydration, electrolyte \nimbalance, etc).  Adverse reactions of Grade 3 or higher such as increased blood creatinine, decreased \ncreatinine clearance, toxic nephropathy, and acute renal failure have all been reported in patients \nreceiving Teysuno in combination with cisplatin (see section 4.8).  To detect early changes in renal \nfunction during treatment, renal parameters should be closely monitored (e.g., serum creatinine, CrCl).  \nIf deterioration of glomerular filtration rate is observed, Teysuno and/or cisplatin dose should be \nadjusted according to Table 4, and appropriate supportive measures taken (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nDehydration and diarrhoea may increase the risk of renal toxicity for cisplatin.  Hyperhydration \n(forced diuresis) should be administered according to the cisplatin SmPC to reduce the risk of renal \ntoxicity associated with cisplatin therapy.   \n \nGimeracil increases 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) exposure by inhibiting DPD, the primary enzyme for \nmetabolizing 5-FU.  Gimeracil is primarily cleared by the kidney (see section 5.2); so, in patients with \nrenal insufficiency gimeracil renal clearance is decreased and 5-FU exposure thus increased.  \nTreatment-related toxicities can be expected to increase as 5-FU exposure increases (see section 5.2).   \n \nSevere renal impairment \n \nTreatment with Teysuno is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment due to possibly \nhigher incidence of adverse events of the blood and lymphatic system and the possibility of \nunexpectedly higher exposure to 5-FU as a result of fluctuations in renal function in these patients, \nunless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). \n \nOcular toxicity  \n \nThe most common treatment-related ocular disorders among patients in studies in Europe/United \nStates of America (EU/USA) treated with Teysuno in combination with cisplatin were lacrimal \ndisorders (8.8%), including increased lacrimation, dry eye, and acquired dacryostenosis (see \nsection 4.8).   \n \nMost ocular reactions will resolve or improve with suspension of medicinal product and proper \ntreatment (instillation of artificial tears, antibiotic eye drops, implantation of glass or silicone tubes in \nlacrimal punctas or canaliculi, and/or use of spectacles rather than contact lenses).  Efforts should be \nmade to ensure early detection of ocular reactions, including an early ophthalmologic consultation in \nthe event of any persistent or vision-reducing ocular symptoms such as lacrimation or corneal \nsymptoms.   \n \nRefer to the cisplatin SmPC for eye disorders observed with cisplatin therapy. \n \nCoumarin-derivative anticoagulant \n \nPatients receiving oral coumarin-derivative anticoagulant therapy must have their anticoagulant \nresponse (International Normalized Ratio for prothrombin time [INR] or prothrombin time [PT]) \nmonitored closely and the anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly (see section 4.5).  The use of \ncoumarin-derivative anticoagulant in clinical trials has been associated with elevated INR and \ngastrointestinal bleeding, bleeding tendency, haematuria, and anaemia in patients receiving Teysuno \ntherapy.   \n \nBrivudine \n \nBrivudine must not be administered concomitantly with Teysuno. Fatal cases have been reported \nfollowing capecitabine interaction. There must be at least a 4-week waiting period between end of \ntreatment with brivudine and start of Teysuno therapy. Treatment with brivudine can be started 24 \nhours after the last dose of Teysuno (see section 4.3 and 4.5). \nIn the event of accidental administration of brivudine to patients being treated with Teysuno, effective \nmeasures should be taken to reduce the toxicity of Teysuno. Immediate admission to hospital is \nrecommended. All measures should be initiated to prevent systemic infections and dehydration. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nDPD inducers \n \nIf a DPD inducer were to be concomitantly administered with Teysuno, the exposure of 5-FU might \nnot reach the efficacious level.  However, since no DPD inducers are currently known, the interaction \nbetween a DPD inducer and Teysuno cannot be evaluated. \n \nDihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency: \n\nDPD activity is rate limiting in the catabolism of 5-fluorouracil (see Section 5.2). Patients with DPD \ndeficiency are therefore at increased risk of fluoropyrimidines-related toxicity including for example \nstomatitis, diarrhoea, mucosal inflammation, neutropenia and neurotoxicity. \n\nDPD-deficiency related toxicity usually occurs during the first cycle of treatment or after dose increase. \n\nComplete DPD deficiency \n\nComplete DPD deficiency is rare (0.01-0.5% of Caucasians). Patients with complete DPD deficiency \nare at high risk of life-threatening or fatal toxicity and must not be treated with Teysuno (see section \n4.3).  \n\nPartial DPD deficiency \n\nPartial DPD deficiency is estimated to affect 3-9% of the Caucasian population. Patients with partial \nDPD deficiency are at increased risk of severe and potentially life-threatening toxicity. A reduced \nstarting dose should be considered to limit this toxicity. DPD deficiency should be considered as a \nparameter to be taken into account in conjunction with other routine measures for dose reduction. Initial \ndose reduction may impact the efficacy of treatment. In the absence of serious toxicity, subsequent doses \nmay be increased with careful monitoring.  \n\nTesting for DPD deficiency \n\nPhenotype and/or genotype testing prior to the initiation of treatment with Teysuno is recommended \ndespite uncertainties regarding optimal pre-treatment testing methodologies. Consideration should be \ngiven to applicable clinical guidelines.  \n\nGenotypic characterisation of DPD deficiency  \n\nPre-treatment testing for rare mutations of the DPYD gene can identify patients with DPD deficiency. \n\nThe four DPYD variants c.1905+1G>A [also known as DPYD*2A], c.1679T>G [DPYD*13], \nc.2846A>T and c.1236G>A/HapB3 can cause complete absence or reduction of DPD enzymatic \nactivity. Other rare variants may also be associated with an increased risk of severe or life-threatening \ntoxicity.  \n\nCertain homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in the DPYD gene locus (e.g. combinations \nof the four variants with at least one allele of c.1905+1G>A or c.1679T>G) are known to cause complete \nor near complete absence of DPD enzymatic activity. \n\nPatients with certain heterozygous DPYD variants (including c.1905+1G>A, c.1679T>G, c.2846A>T \nand c.1236G>A/HapB3 variants) have increased risk of severe toxicity when treated with \nfluoropyrimidines.  \n\nThe frequency of the heterozygous c.1905+1G>A genotype in the DPYD gene in Caucasian patients is \naround 1%, 1.1% for c.2846A>T, 2.6-6.3% for c.1236G>A/HapB3 variants and 0.07 to 0.1% for \nc.1679T>G.  \n\nData on the frequency of the four DPYD variants in other populations than Caucasian is limited. At the \npresent, the four DPYD variants (c.1905+1G>A, c.1679T>G, c.2846A>T and c.1236G>A/HapB3) are \nconsidered virtually absent in populations of African (-American) or Asian origin.  \n\n\n\n11 \n\nPhenotypic characterisation of DPD deficiency \n\nFor phenotypic characterisation of DPD deficiency the measurement of pre-therapeutic blood levels of \nthe endogenous DPD substrate uracil (U) in plasma is recommended. \n\nElevated pre-treatment uracil concentrations are associated with an increased risk of toxicity. Despite \nuncertainties on uracil thresholds defining complete and partial DPD deficiency, a blood uracil level ≥ \n16 ng/ml and < 150 ng/ml should be considered indicative of partial DPD deficiency and associated \nwith an increased risk for fluoropyrimidine toxicity. A blood uracil level ≥ 150 ng/ml should be \nconsidered indicative of complete DPD deficiency and associated with a risk for life-threatening or fatal \nfluoropyrimidine toxicity.  \n\n \nMicrosatellite instability (MSI) \n \nTeysuno has not been studied in gastric cancer patients with MSI.  The association between 5-FU \nsensitivity and MSI in patients with gastric cancer is unclear and the association between Teysuno and \nMSI in gastric cancer is unknown. \n \nGlucose/galactose intolerance/malabsorption \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose.  Patients with rare hereditory problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose/galactose malabasorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \nOther oral fluorpyrimidines \n \nNo clinical trials are available comparing Teysuno versus other oral 5-FU compounds.  Therefore, \nTeysuno cannot be used as a substitute for other oral 5-FU products. \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed in adult or paediatric patients. \n \nBrivudine \n \nA clinically significant interaction between brivudine and fluoropyrimidines (e.g. capecitabine, 5-\nFluorouracil, tegafur), resulting from the inhibition of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase by brivudine, \nhas been described. This interaction, which leads to increased fluoropyrimidine toxicity, is potentially \nfatal. Therefore, brivudine must not be administered concomitantly with Teysuno (see section 4.3 and \n4.4). There must be at least a 4-week waiting period between end of treatment with brivudine and start \nof Teysuno therapy. Treatment with brivudine can be started 24 hours after the last dose of Teysuno. \n \nOther fluoropyrimidines \n \nCo-administration of other fluoropyrimidines such as capecitabine, 5-FU, tegafur, or flucytosine can \nlead to additive toxicities, and is contraindicated.  A minimum washout period of 7 days is \nrecommended between administration of Teysuno and other fluoropyrimidines.  The washout period \ndescribed in the SmPC of other fluoropyrimidine medicinal products should be followed if Teysuno is \nto be administered subsequent to other fluoropyrimidine medicinal products. \n \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nCYP2A6 inhibitors \n \nAs CYP2A6 is the major enzyme responsible for the conversion of tegafur to 5-FU, co-administration \nof a known CYP2A6 inhibitor and Teysuno should be avoided as effectiveness of Teysuno could be \ndecreased (see section 5.2).  \n \nFolinate/folinic acid \n \nNo data are available on the concomitant use of folinic acid with Teysuno in combination with \ncisplatin.  However, metabolites of folinate/folinic acid will form a ternary structure with thymidylate \nsynthase and fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP), potentially increasing the cytotoxicity of \n5-FU.  Caution is advised as folinic acid is known to enhance the activity of 5-FU. \n \nNitroimidazoles, including metronidazole and misonidazole \n \nNo data are available on the concomitant use of nitromidazoles with Teysuno in combination with \ncisplatin.  However, nitromidazoles may reduce clearance of 5-FU and thus increase plasma levels of \n5-FU.  Caution is advised as co-administration may increase the toxicity of Teysuno. \n \nMethotrexate \n \nNo data are available on the concomitant use of methotrexate with Teysuno in combination with \ncisplatin.  However, polyglutamated methotrexate inhibits thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate \nreductase, potentially increasing cytotoxicity of 5-FU.  Caution is advised as co-administration may \nincrease the toxicity of Teysuno. \n \nClozapine \n \nNo data are available on the concomitant use of clozapine with Teysuno in combination with cisplatin.  \nHowever, due to possible additive pharmacodynamic effects (myelotoxicity), caution is advised as co-\nadministration may increase the risk and severity of haematologic toxicity of Teysuno.  \n \nCimetidine \n \nNo data are available on the concomitant use of cimetidine with Teysuno in combination with \ncisplatin.  However, co-administration may decrease clearance and, thus increase plasma levels of \n5-FU.  Caution is advised as co-administration may increase the toxicity of Teysuno. \n \nCoumarin-derivative anticoagulant \n \nThe activity of a coumarin-derivative anticoagulant was enhanced by Teysuno.  Caution is advised as \nco-administration of Teysuno and coumarin anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of bleeding \n(see section 4.4).   \n \nPhenytoin \n \nFluoropyrimidines may increase phenytoin plasma concentration when administered concomitantly \nwith phenytoin causing phenytoin toxicity.  Frequent monitoring of phenytoin blood/plasma levels is \nadvised when Teysuno and phenytoin are administered concomitantly.  If indicated, the dose of \nphenytoin should be adjusted according to the phenytoin SmPC.  If phenytoin toxicity develops, \nappropriate measures should be taken.   \n \nOther \n \nBased on non-clinical data, allopurinol may decrease anti-tumour activity due to suppression of \nphosphorylation of 5-FU.  Therefore, concurrent administration with Teysuno should be avoided.   \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nFood \n \nAdministration of Teysuno with a meal reduced exposure to oteracil and gimeracil, with a more \npronounced effect for oteracil than for gimeracil (see section 5.2).  It should be taken with water at \nleast 1 hour before or 1 hour after a meal (see section 4.2). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving \ntreatment with this medicinal product.   \n \nContraceptive measures must be taken by both male and female patients during and up to 6 months \nafter stopping treatment with Teysuno.   \n \nPregnancy \n \nTeysuno is contraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3).  There have been some case reports of \nfoetal abnormalities.  Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity.  As with other \nfluoropyrimidines, Teysuno administration caused embryolethality and teratogenicity in animals (see \nsection 5.3).  If the patient becomes pregnant while receiving Teysuno, treatment should be \ndiscontinued and the potential risk to the foetus must be explained.  Genetic counseling should be \nconsidered. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nTeysuno is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3).  It is not known whether Teysuno \nor its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in \nanimals have shown excretion of Teysuno or its metabolites in milk (for details see section 5.3).   \n \nA risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  Breast-feeding must be discontinued while receiving \ntreatment with Teysuno. \n \nFertility \n \nNo data are available on the effect of Teysuno in combination with cisplatin on human fertility.  Non-\nclinical studies demonstrated that Teysuno did not appear to affect male or female fertility in the rat \n(see section 5.3). \n \nRefer to the cisplatin SmPC for the effects of cisplatin on fertility, pregnancy and lactation. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTeysuno has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines as fatigue, dizziness, blurred \nvision, and nausea are common adverse reactions of Teysuno in combination with cisplatin.   \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nThe overall safety profile of Teysuno in combination with cisplatin is based primarily on clinical study \ndata from 593 patients with advanced gastric cancer treated with this regimen.  In addition, there is \npost-marketing experience in over 866,000 Asian (mainly Japanese) patients. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nAmong 593 patients treated with Teysuno in combination with cisplatin, the most common severe \nadverse reactions (Grade 3 or higher with frequency of at least 10%) were neutropaenia, anaemia, and \nfatigue. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following headings are used to rank the adverse reactions by frequency: very common (≥1/10), \ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare \n(<1/10,000), and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).  The frequencies of very \ncommon, common, and uncommon adverse reactions are from 593 patients treated with Teysuno in \ncombination with cisplatin in clinical trials.  The frequencies of medically relevant rare and very rare \nadverse reactions are estimated from post-marketing surveillance of 866,000 patients in Asia (mostly \nJapanese) treated with Teysuno-based therapy.  Each term is presented in its most common category \nonly and within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness.   \n \nTable 7: Adverse reactions

Investigations system organ class (SOC) have been reallocated to clinically appropriate SOCs \nrelated to their target organ.   \nDifferent MedDRA preferred terms that were considered clinically similar have been grouped into a single term. \nb incl corneal epithelium defect, corneal erosion, corneal lesion, corneal opacity, corneal perforation, keratitis, punctate \nkeratitis, ulcerative keratitis, limbal stem cell deficiency, visual acuity reduced, visual impairment, vision blurred. \n \n\n \nOther clinical studies with Teysuno in combination with cisplatin \n \nAlthough studies of Teysuno in combination with cisplatin that were conducted in Japan utilised doses \nand dosing schedules that differed from this regimen, the safety profile from these studies was similar, \nwith the most common toxicities being haematologic, gastrointestinal, fatigue, and anorexia.  \n \nPost-marketing surveillance experience in gastric cancer patients \n \nThe safety profile of Teysuno in a post-marketing safety surveillance study in Japan of 4,177 patients \ntreated with Teysuno for advanced gastric cancer was generally similar to that seen with this regimen \nand in the Japanese registration studies (i.e., major toxicities were leukocytopaenia, anorexia, and \nnausea/vomiting).   \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nOcular toxicity   \n \nTerms for treatment-related ocular toxicities have been combined as follows.  The only Grade 3 or \nhigher adverse reaction was reduced visual acuity.   \n• Vision disorder includes adverse reactions of blurred vision, diplopia, photopsia, reduced visual \n\nacuity, and blindness;  \n• Lacrimal disorder includes adverse reactions of increased lacrimation, dry eye, and acquired \n\ndacryostenosis;  \n• Eye disorder includes adverse reactions of eye pruritus, ocular hyperaemia, eye irritation, eye \n\ndisorder, and foreign body sensation in eyes.   \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nNeuropathy \n \nCentral and peripheral neuropathy has been reported in patients treated with Teysuno in combination \nwith cisplatin.  The term peripheral neuropathy includes the following reported adverse reactions: \nperipheral sensory neuropathy, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, peripheral neuropathy, polyneuropathy, \nneurotoxicity, and dysaesthesia.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (see section 4.2) \n \nComparison of safety between 71 patients ≥70 years old (elderly) and 450 patients <70 years old \ntreated with Teysuno in combination with cisplatin in the FLAGS study demonstrated that the \nincidence of all Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions (62% vs 52%), all serious adverse reactions (30% \nvs 19%), and the rate of premature withdrawal due to adverse reactions from both Teysuno and \ncisplatin (21% vs 12%) appeared to be higher among patients ≥70 years old.  A population \npharmacokinetics analysis demonstrated that 5-FU exposure also tended to increase with age, but the \nextent of the increase was within the range of individual variability.  These changes with age were \nrelated to changes in renal function as measured by creatinine clearance (see section 5.2).   \n \nGender  \n \nThere were no clinically relevant differences in safety between males (N=382) and females (N=139) in \nthe FLAGS study.  \n \nPatients with renal impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, and 5.2) \n \nComparison of 218 patients with mild renal impairment at baseline (CrCl 51 to 80 ml/min) to \n297 patients with normal renal function at baseline (CrCl >80 ml/min) treated with Teysuno in \ncombination with cisplatin in the FLAGS study indicated that there were no clinically significant \ndifferences in safety between patients with mild renal impairment and patients with normal renal \nfunction.   \n \nIn a study performed in patients with renal impairment, the most common adverse reactions reported \nover all cycles across all cohorts were diarrhoea (57.6%), nausea (42.4%), vomiting (36.4%), fatigue \n(33.3%) and anaemia (24.2%). In this study, 7 patients with moderate renal impairment were treated \nwith 20 mg/m2 Teysuno twice daily, while 7 patients with severe renal impairment received Teysuno \n20 mg/m2 once daily.  No dose limiting toxicities were observed in Cycle 1 in patients with moderate \nor severe renal impairment. The incidence of blood and lymphatic systems disorders adverse reactions \nobserved across all cycles in the moderate and severe renal impairment patients were 28.6% and \n44.4%, respectively. The dose for one patient in the severe cohort was reduced to 13.2 mg/m2 once \ndaily at the start of Cycle 12 due to an adverse reaction (Grade 2 diarrhoea) in Cycle 11. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo studies have been performed with Teysuno alone or in combination with cisplatin in paediatric \npatients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n18 \n\n \nThe highest single dose of Teysuno taken was 1400 mg; this patient developed leukopenia (Grade 3).   \nManifestations of acute overdose reported include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, mucositis, \ngastrointestinal irritation, bleeding, bone marrow depression, and respiratory failure.  Medical \nmanagement of overdose should include customary therapeutic and supportive medical interventions \naimed at correcting the presenting clinical manifestations and preventing their possible complications. \n \nThere is no known antidote available in case of overdose.   \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, antimetabolites, ATC code: L01BC53. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTeysuno is an oral fluoropyrimidine anti-cancer medicinal product.  It is a fixed dose combination of \nthree active substances, tegafur, which after absorption is converted into the anti-cancer substance \n5-FU; gimeracil, a dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) inhibitor to prevent degradation of 5-FU \nby the body; and, oteracil, an orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT) inhibitor that decreases the \nactivity of 5-FU in normal gastrointestinal mucosa.  The combination of tegafur, gimeracil, and \noteracil was set at 1:0.4:1 molar ratio as optimum in order to maintain 5-FU exposure and thus sustain \nanti-tumour activity while reducing toxicity associated with 5-FU alone. \n \nTegafur is a prodrug of 5-FU with good oral bioavailability.  Following oral administration, tegafur is \ngradually converted to 5-FU in vivo, mainly by CYP2A6 enzyme activity in the liver.  5-FU is \nmetabolised by the liver enzyme DPD.  5-FU is activated within cells by phosphorylation to its active \nmetabolite, 5-fluoro-deoxyuridine-monophosphate (FdUMP).  FdUMP and reduced folate are bound \nto thymidylate synthase leading to formation of a ternary complex which inhibits DNA synthesis.  In \naddition, 5-fluorouridine-triphosphate (FUTP) is incorporated into RNA causing disruption of RNA \nfunctions.   \n \nGimeracil inhibits the metabolism of 5-FU by reversibly and selectively inhibiting DPD, the primary \nmetabolic enzyme for 5-FU, so that higher plasma concentrations of 5-FU are achieved with the \nadministration of a lower dose of tegafur.   \n \nAfter oral administration, oteracil was distributed at high concentrations in normal gastrointestinal \ntract tissues while considerably lower concentrations were seen in blood and tumour tissue in animal \nstudies.   \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn a dose escalation study comparing the tolerability of 5-FU in Teysuno and tegafur + gimeracil (no \noteracil), the 25 mg/m2 dose level could not be attained in the absence of oteracil due to the occurrence \nof dose limiting toxicities (Grade 3 diarrhoea in 2 patients, and cardio-respiratory arrest in 1 patient) in \nthe tegafur+gimeracil arm.  The 5-FU pharmacokinetic profile was similar in the presence and absence \nof oteracil. \n \nMean 5-FU maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve \n(AUC) values were approximately 3-fold higher after Teysuno administration than after administration \nof tegafur alone, despite a 16-fold lower Teysuno dose (50 mg of tegafur) compared to tegafur alone \n(800 mg), and are attributed to inhibition of DPD by gimeracil.  Maximum plasma uracil concentration \nwas observed at 4 hours, with a return to baseline levels within approximately 48 hours after dosing, \nindicating the reversibility of the DPD inhibition by gimeracil. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nA study of the effect of Teysuno on cardiac repolarisation conducted in advanced cancer patients met \nthe definition for a negative study according to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) \nguidelines.  No consistent relationship was seen between absolute QTcF interval values or change \nfrom Baseline values and maximum plasma concentration of Teysuno components. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nA Phase I study established the current regimen by evaluating cohorts of Teysuno and cisplatin of \n30 mg/m2 and 60 mg/m2 (dose-limiting toxicities [DLTs] seen were fatigue, and diarrhoea and \ndehydration); 25 mg/m2 and 60 mg/m2; and 25 mg/m2 and 75 mg/m2.  Despite the lack of DLTs in the \nlast cohort, the dose of cisplatin was not elevated beyond 75 mg/m2. \n \nIn the Phase III FLAGS study, there was no apparent relationship between 5-FU AUC \n(Teysuno/cisplatin arm) and 5-FU concentration (5-FU/cisplatin arm) during Cycle 1 and efficacy \noutcomes of overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS).   \n \nIn the Phase III FLAGS study, there was no apparent relationship between 5-FU AUC \n(Teysuno/cisplatin arm) and 5-FU concentration (5-FU/cisplatin arm) during Cycle 1 and efficacy \noutcomes of overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS).   \n \n \nA Phase I study was conducted to evaluate the PK of the components of Teysuno and their metabolites \nin cancer patients with impaired renal function compared to those with normal renal function. In this \nstudy, antitumor activity was measured by best overall tumour response. The majority (70.4%) of \npatients had Stable Disease as a best response (based on Investigator’s assessment using RECIST \ncriteria) and 29.6% patients had Progressive Disease as their best overall response. No dose limiting \ntoxicities were observed in the first cycle of treatment. \n \nAdvanced gastric cancer \n \nData from a multicentre, multinational (excluding Asia), randomised, controlled, open-label Phase III \nclinical study (FLAGS) support the use of Teysuno in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of \npatients with advanced gastric cancer.  In this study, 521 patients were randomised to treatment with \nTeysuno (25 mg/m2 orally twice daily for 21 days followed by a 7-day rest period) and cisplatin \n(75 mg/m2 intravenous infusion once every 4 weeks); and 508 patients were randomised to treatment \nwith 5-FU (1000 mg/m2/24 hours as a continuous intravenous infusion on Days 1 through 5 repeated \nevery 4 weeks) and cisplatin (100 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion on Day 1 repeated every 4 weeks).  \nPatient characteristics are provided in Table 8.   \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nTable 8: Demographics and baseline characteristics of patients in the FLAGS study \n Teysuno + Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 \n\n(N=521) \n5-FU + Cisplatin 100 mg/m2 \n\n(N=508) \nGender, n (%) \n Male \n Female \n\n \n382 (73) \n139 (27) \n\n \n347 (68) \n161 (32) \n\nAge, years \n Median (Range) \n ≥65, n (%) \n\n \n59 (18-83) \n160 (31) \n\n \n60 (20-85) \n164 (32) \n\nRace, n (%) \n White \n Black or African American \n Asian \n American Indian or Alaska Native \n Other \n\n \n447 (86) \n\n5 (1.0) \n4 (0.8) \n4 (0.8) \n\n61 (12) \n\n \n438 (86) \n\n7 (1.4) \n4 (0.8) \n6 (1.2) \n\n53 (10) \nECOG Performance Status, n (%) \n 0 \n 1 \n\n \n226 (43) \n295 (57) \n\n \n200 (39) \n308 (61) \n\nLocation of primary lesion, n (%) \n Stomach \n Gastro-oesophageal junction \n Both \n\n \n438 (84) \n82 (16) \n\n1 (0.2) \n\n \n417 (82) \n88 (17) \n\n3 (0.6) \nMetastatic disease, n (%) \n ≥2 metastatic sites \n\n497 (95) \n340 (65) \n\n488 (96) \n327 (64) \n\n \n \nFor the primary endpoint of overall survival, Teysuno in combination with cisplatin was non-inferior \nto 5-FU in combination with cisplatin (see Table 9).

Eighteen additional PK studies were performed using the relevant regimen \nas monotherapy.  All studies were performed in cancer patients. \n \nAbsorption \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nAfter administration of a single dose of 50 mg Teysuno (expressed as tegafur content) in man \n(approximately 30 mg/m2 based on body surface area of 1.56 to 2.10 m2 for a typical patient; N=14), \nthe median Tmax for Teysuno components tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil was 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 hours, \nrespectively, and the mean ± standard deviation (SD) AUC0-inf and Cmax was 14595 ± 4340 ng.hr/ml \nand 1762 ± 279 ng/ml for tegafur, 1884 ± 640 ng.hr/ml and 452 ± 102 ng/ml for gimeracil, \n556 ± 281 ng.hr/ml and 112 ± 52 ng/ml for oteracil.  The median Tmax for 5-FU was 2.0 hours and the \nmean AUC0-inf and Cmax was 842 ± 252 ng.hr/ml and 174 ± 58 ng/ml.  Levels of tegafur, gimeracil, \noteracil and 5-FU were quantifiable through 10 hours postdose.  After administration of 30 mg/m2 \ndoses, steady-state conditions are reached for tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil at the latest by Day 8.   \n \nAfter multiple dose administration (30 mg/m2, expressed as tegafur content, twice daily for 14 days; \nN=10), the median Tmax of tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil was 0.8, 1.0, and 2.0 hours, respectively, \nand the corresponding mean ± SD AUC(0-12h) and Cmax was 19967 ± 6027 ng.hr/ml and \n2970 ± 852 ng/ml for tegafur, 1483 ± 527 ng.hr/ml and 305 ± 116 ng/ml for gimeracil, and \n692 ± 529 ng.hr/ml and 122 ± 82 ng/ml for oteracil.  The median Tmax for 5-FU was 2.0 hours and the \nmean AUC(0-12h) and Cmax was 870 ± 405 ng.hr/ml and 165 ± 62 ng/ml, respectively.   \n \nAdministration of Teysuno under fed conditions resulted in decreased AUC0-inf  for oteracil of \napproximately 71% and gimeracil of approximately 25% relative to fasting administration.  \nConcomitant administration of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) reduced the effect of food on the \npharmacokinetic profile of oteracil, but not by a sufficient margin to completely negate the food effect.  \nThere was a 15% decrease in AUC0-inf  for 5-FU under fed versus fasting conditions, and tegafur \nexposure was not altered by food (thus demonstrating absence of a food effect). \n \nMean AUC0-inf and Cmax for 5-FU were approximately 3-fold greater following administration of \nTeysuno (50 mg expressed as tegafur content) than following administration of tegafur alone \n(800 mg), while AUC0-inf and Cmax values for the 5-FU metabolite α-fluoro-β-alanine (FBAL) were \napproximately 15- to 22-fold lower following administration of Teysuno than following administration \nof tegafur.   \n \nThe oteracil component of Teysuno did not affect the pharmacokinetic profiles of 5-FU, tegafur, \ngimeracil, FBAL, or uracil.  The gimeracil component did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of \ntegafur. \n \nDistribution \n \nOteracil, gimeracil, 5-FU, and tegafur were 8.4%, 32.2%, 18.4%, and 52.3% protein bound, \nrespectively.  The protein binding in human serum was not concentration-dependent over a range of \n0.1 to 1.0 µg/ml for oteracil, gimeracil, and 5-FU and 1.2 to 11.8 µg/ml for tegafur. \n \nThere are no clinical data on the distribution of radiolabeled components of Teysuno.  Although no \nintravenous data are available for Teysuno in humans, the volume of distribution could be roughly \nestimated from the apparent volume of distribution and urinary excretion data as 16 l/m2, 17 l/m2, and \n23 l/m2 for tegafur, gimeracil and oteracil, respectively. \n\nBiotransformation \n \nThe main metabolic pathway for tegafur is through conversion to 5-FU via CYP2A6 in the liver, \nwhereas gimeracil was stable in human liver homogenate (S9 fraction) with adenosine 3’-phosphate \n5'-phosphosulfphate lithium salt (PAPS; a co-factor for sulfotransferase) or nicotinamide adenine \ndinucleotide phosphate (NADPH).  Based on the results of in vitro studies, a part of oteracil is \nnon-enzymatically degraded to 5-azauracil (5-AZU) by gastric fluid, and is then converted to cyanuric \nacid (CA) in the digestive tract.  5-AZU and CA do not inhibit OPRT enzyme activity.  Only a small \namount of oteracil is metabolised in the liver because of its low permeability.  \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nIn vitro evaluation using human liver microsomes indicated that neither tegafur, gimeracil nor oteracil \nshowed any relevant inhibitory effects on enzyme activities of the cytochrome P450 isoforms tested \n(i.e., CYP1A1/2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8/9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4).   \n \nIn vitro evaluation using primary cultures of human hepatocytes indicated that tegafur (0.7-70 µM), \ngimeracil (0.2-25 µM) and oteracil (0.04-4 µM) had little or no inductive effect on CYP1A2, CYP2B6 \nor CYP3A4/5 metabolic activities.  \n \nUsing plasma uracil concentrations to assess DPD activity in clinical studies, no marked changes in \nplasma uracil concentrations were observed after administration of a single 800 mg dose of tegafur \nwhile plasma uracil concentrations increased markedly after administration of a single 50 mg dose of \nTeysuno (reflecting DPD inhibition by gimeracil).  Following both single dose (50 mg) and multiple \ndose (30 mg/m2 twice daily) administration of Teysuno in man, maximum uracil concentrations \nreflecting DPD inhibition were observed approximately 4 hours postdose.  Similar inhibition was seen \nfollowing single and multiple dosing.  The plasma concentrations of uracil returned to baseline levels \napproximately 48 hours after dosing indicating reversibility of DPD inhibition by gimeracil. \n \nElimination \n \nIn man, the apparent terminal elimination half-life (T1/2) of 5-FU observed after administration of \nTeysuno (containing tegafur, a 5-FU prodrug) was longer (approximately 1.6 - 1.9 hours) than that \npreviously reported after intravenous administration of 5-FU (10 to 20 minutes).  Following a single \ndose of Teysuno, T1/2 values ranged from 6.7 to 11.3 hours for tegafur, from 3.1 to 4.1 hours for \ngimeracil, and from 1.8 to 9.5 hours for oteracil. \n \nFollowing a single dose of Teysuno, approximately 3.8% to 4.2% of administered tegafur, 65% to \n72% of administered gimeracil, and 3.5% to 3.9% of administered oteracil were excreted unchanged in \nthe urine.  Among the metabolites, 9.5% to 9.7% of the administered tegafur was excreted in the urine \nas 5-FU and approximately 70% to 77% as FBAL, accounting for approximately 83% to 91% of the \nadministered Teysuno dose (total tegafur + 5-FU + FBAL).  There was no effect of gimeracil on renal \nclearance of tegafur, FBAL, and 5-FU following administration of Teysuno as compared to their \nclearance following administration of tegafur alone.   \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nIn a Japanese Phase I study that utilized 5 dose groups with doses ranging from 25 to 200 mg/body, \nthere was a dose-proportional increase in exposure for tegafur, gimeracil and oteracil.  However, the \nincrease in 5-FU exposure tended to be greater than proportional to the increasing tegafur dose.   \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nA population PK analysis of Teysuno components and metabolites assessed the influence of various \nfactors, including gender, age, food, ethnicity (Caucasian vs Asian), renal function, and hepatic \nfunction in 315 patients.  Renal function, as reflected by creatinine clearance, was the primary factor \nthat influenced gimeracil exposure and 5-FU exposure.  As renal function decreased, there was an \nincrease in 5-FU steady state exposure.  This analysis also demonstrated that the trend in changes in \nTeysuno pharmacokinetics observed with increasing age was related to change in renal function as \nmeasured by creatinine clearance. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn a Phase I Teysuno monotherapy study that investigated the pharmacokinetics of components and \nmetabolites in patients with normal and impaired renal function, patients with mild renal impairment \n(CrCl 51 to 80 ml/min) receiving the same monotherapy dose of 30 mg/m2 twice daily (the maximum \ntolerated dose for monotherapy) as patients with normal renal function (CrCl >80 ml/min) had an \nincrease in mean 5-FU AUC0-inf relative to that of the normal patients.  Patients with moderate renal \nimpairment (CrCl 30 to 50 ml/min) who received a reduced dose of 20 mg/m2 twice daily showed no \n\n\n\n23 \n\nsignificant increase in mean 5-FU AUC0-inf relative to that of the normal group.  The increase in 5-FU \nexposure in patients with mild renal impairment in this study together with the results of simulation in \nthe population pharmacokinetic analysis suggest that a Teysuno dose of 25 mg/m2 twice daily in \npatients with mild renal impairment could achieve 5-FU plasma concentrations similar to those \nobtained in patients with normal renal function receiving 30 mg/m2 twice daily as monotherapy and \nalso those with moderate renal impairment receiving 20 mg/m2 twice daily.   \n \nFollowing a reduced dose of Teysuno 20 mg/m2 administered once daily to the severe renal \nimpairment group (CrCl < 30 ml/min), the single-dose AUC0-inf and multiple-dose AUC0-τ values for \n5-FU were approximately 2-fold higher in the severe renal impairment group compared to those \nobserved in the normal renal function group receiving 30 mg/m2 twice daily. Therefore, the daily \nexposure to 5-FU would be expected to be comparable in these groups, since the daily exposure in \npatients in the severe renal impairment group is based on the administration of Teysuno once a day, \nwhile the daily exposure to 5-FU in the patients with normal renal function is based on the \nadministration of Teysuno twice daily. However, it is to be noted that the exposure to 5-FU can be \nvariable and unexpectedly higher in patients with severe renal impairment due to the impact of \nfluctuations in renal function in these patients. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nThere were no significant differences in AUCs of 5-FU, tegafur, gimeracil, or oteracil after either \nsingle or multiple dose administration of Teysuno 30 mg/m2 twice daily in patients with mild, \nmoderate, or severe hepatic impairment compared to those with normal hepatic function.  After single \ndose administration, there was a statistically significant decrease in 5-FU and gimeracil Cmax for the \nsevere hepatic impairment group relative to that of the normal group, but this difference was not \nobserved after multiple dose administration.   \n \nEthnic differences \n \nA Phase I study investigated the pharmacokinetics of Teysuno monotherapy in Asian (Chinese/Malay) \nand Caucasian (US) patients.  Consistent with the lower CYP2A6 activity in the Asian patients, \ntegafur AUC0-12 was higher and T1/2 was longer in the Asian group compared to the Caucasian group.  \nGimeracil and uracil AUC0-12 values were comparable between the two groups, suggesting that DPD \ninhibition was similar for the Asian and Caucasian groups.  Exposure of 5-FU was not statistically \nsignificantly different between the two groups.  Oteracil AUC0-12 in the Asian group was \napproximately half that of the Caucasian group, however, this difference was not statistically \nsignificant due to its large individual variability. \n \nStudies in Japanese patients have suggested an effect of CYP2A6*4 polymorphism on Teysuno \npharmacokinetics.  Although CYP2A6 variants are associated with pharmacokinetic variability of \ntegafur, the AUC of gimeracil, which is affected by renal function, is the key determinant in the \npharmacokinetic variability of 5-FU.  In the Phase III (FLAGS) study, tegafur AUC was significantly \nhigher in patients with the CYP2A6*4 allele, however, no significant difference was found for 5-FU \nAUC and for the incidence of adverse reactions.  Therefore, the CYP2A6 polymorphism differences \nbetween Asian and Western populations do not appear to be the key determinant for differences in the \nMTD between populations.  However, limited data available on CYP2A6*4/*4 genotype in Japanese \npatients treated with Teysuno suggest significantly decreased 5-FU levels in this subpopulation.  No \ndose advice for this subpopulation can be provided.  This CYP2A6*4 allele is uncommon in the \nCaucasian population. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo pharmacokinetc studies have been conducted with Teysuno in paediatric patients. \n \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \nRepeat-dose toxicity studies in rats, dogs and monkeys produced changes typically associated with \nadministration of an anti-cancer medicinal product eliciting cytotoxic effects on populations of rapidly \ndividing cells, such as anaemia, decrease in the immune and digestive system function, disruption of \nspermatogenesis, and atrophy in male and female reproductive organs.   \n \nTreatment with Teysuno produced various skin effects in rat (keratosis of footpad and tail) and dog \n(skin crusts and erosions).  In addition, hyperpigmentation in the skin and eyes and corneal opacity in \ndogs and cataracts in rats were observed following repeat dosing.  These changes were reversible.   \n \nTeysuno does not appear to affect male or female fertility in the rat; however, administration at any \ntime after conception resulted in a range of external, visceral, and skeletal foetal abnormalities in rat \nand rabbit.  There is therefore a high risk for developmental toxicity at clinical doses, primarily due to \ntegafur (5-FU) and to oteracil to a lesser extent. \n \nTeysuno was not carcinogenic in either the rat or the mouse.  Teysuno was not found to be mutagenic \nwhen tested in the in vitro Ames assay.  Teysuno was clastogenic in vitro using Chinese hamster lung \ncells and was weakly clastogenic in vivo in mouse bone marrow. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTeysuno is indicated in adults for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer when given in combination \nwith cisplatin (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTeysuno should only be prescribed by a qualified physician experienced in treating cancer patients \nwith anti-neoplastic medicinal products.   \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended standard dose of Teysuno when administered in combination with cisplatin is \n25 mg/m2 (expressed as tegafur content) twice daily, morning and evening, for 21 consecutive days \nfollowed by 7 days rest (1 treatment cycle).  This treatment cycle is repeated every 4 weeks.   \n \nThe standard and reduced Teysuno and cisplatin doses and calculations according to body surface area \n(BSA) for doses of Teysuno given in combination with cisplatin are provided in Table 1 and Table 2, \nrespectively.  The patient's BSA must be recalculated and the Teysuno dose adjusted accordingly if a \npatient’s weight increases or decreases by ≥10% from the one used for the previous calculation of \nBSA and the change is clearly not related to fluid retention. \n \nThe recommended dose of cisplatin with this regimen is 75 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion \nadministered once every 4 weeks.  Cisplatin should be discontinued after 6 cycles without withdrawal \nof Teysuno.  If cisplatin is discontinued before 6 cycles, Teysuno treatment alone can be resumed \nwhen the criteria for restarting it are met. \n \nPatients treated with Teysuno in combination with cisplatin should be closely monitored and \nlaboratory tests, including haematology, liver function, renal function, and serum electrolytes, should \nbe performed frequently.  Treatment should be discontinued if progressive disease or intolerable \ntoxicity is observed. \n \nRefer to the cisplatin summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for pretreatment  hyperhydration.   \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \nPatients should be provided with outpatient prescriptions for anti-emetic and anti-diarrhoeal medicinal \nproducts. \n \nTeysuno doses \n \nTable 1: Standard dose and dose reductions allowed for Teysuno and/or for cisplatin  \n \n\nMedicinal \nproduct \n\nStandard dose \n(mg/m2) \n\n Dose reduction 1 \n(mg/m2) \n\n Dose reduction 2 \n(mg/m2) \n\nTeysuno 25a → 20a → 15a \nand/or \nCisplatin 75 → 60 → 45 \na Expressed as tegafur content. \n\n \nTeysuno dose calculations \n \nTable 2: Standard and reduced dose calculations by body surface area (m2) \n \n\nTeysuno dose Each dose in mg \n(each dosing)a \n\nTotal daily dose \nin mga \n\nNumber of capsules for each dose \n(2 doses/day) \n\nStandard dosea: 25 mg/m2   15 mg capsulea \n(brown/white) \n\n20 mg capsulea \n(white) \n\nBSA ≥ 2.30 m2 60 120 0 3 \nBSA = 2.10 - 2.29 m2 55 110 1 2 \nBSA = 1.90 - 2.09 m2 50 100 2 1 \nBSA = 1.70 - 1.89 m2 45 90 3 0 \nBSA = 1.50 - 1.69 m2 40 80 0 2 \nBSA = 1.30 - 1.49 m2 35 70 1 1 \nBSA ≤ 1.29 m2 30 60 2 0 \nFirst dose reductiona: to 20 mg/m2 \nBSA ≥ 2.13 m2 45 90 3 0 \nBSA = 1.88 - 2.12 m2 40 80 0 2 \nBSA = 1.63 - 1.87 m2 35 70 1 1 \nBSA = 1.30 - 1.62 m2 30 60 2 0 \nBSA ≤ 1.29 m2 20 40 0 1 \nSecond dose reductiona: to 15 mg/m2 \nBSA ≥ 2.17 m2 35 70 1 1 \nBSA = 1.67 - 2.16 m2 30 60 2 0 \nBSA = 1.30 - 1.66 m2 20 40 0 1 \nBSA ≤ 1.29 m2 15 30 1 0 \nCalculate BSA to 2 decimal places. \na Expressed as tegafur content. \n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nAdjustments during treatment \n \nGeneral \n \nToxicity due to Teysuno administration should be managed with symptomatic treatment and/or \ntreatment interruption or dose reduction.  Patients taking Teysuno should be informed of the risks and \ninstructed to contact their physician immediately if moderate or severe toxicity occurs.   \n \nDoses omitted for toxicity are not replaced; and, if a patient vomits after taking a dose, this dose \nshould not be replaced. \n \nOnce the Teysuno dose has been reduced, it should not be increased again. \n \nTeysuno dose modification criteria \n \nDose modifications for toxicity should be made according to Tables 1, 3, 4, and 5.  A maximum of \ntwo consecutive dose reductions for each medicinal product, as described in Table 1, can be applied in \ncase of toxicity.  Each dose reduction results in approximately 20-25% reduction of dose.  See Table 2 \nfor the details of the number of Teysuno capsules to be administered for each dose level.  For \nminimum criteria for resumption of Teysuno treatment, see Table 6. \n \nTeysuno dose modifications for toxicity when used in combination with cisplatin can be made in two \nways. \n \nDuring a 4-week cycle of treatment \n \nTeysuno should only be given on Days 1 to 21 of each cycle, i.e., treatment should not be given on \nDays 22 to 28 of a cycle.  Treatment days missed in a cycle where  medicinal product was held due to \ntoxicity should not be replaced.   \n \nDuring a treatment cycle, dose adjustment should be performed for each individual medicinal product \nthat is considered to be causally related to the toxicity, if such a distinction can be made.  If both \nmedicinal products are considered to be causing the toxicity or it is not possible to distinguish them, \nthen dose reduction should be performed for both according to the recommended dose reduction \nschedule.   \n \nAt the initiation of subsequent cycles of treatment \n \nIf a treatment delay is indicated for either Teysuno or cisplatin, then administration of both medicinal \nproducts should be delayed until the requirements for restarting both are met unless one of the \nmedicinal products has been permanently discontinued.  \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nDose modifications for Teysuno for adverse reactions in general except for haematologic and renal \ntoxicities \n \nTable 3: Teysuno dose reduction schedule for treatment-related toxicities in general, except for \nhaematologic and renal toxicities \n \n\nToxicity gradesa Teysuno dose changes within a 21-day \ntreatment cycle \n\nTeysuno dose adjustment \nfor next dose / next cycle \n\nGrade 1 \nAny occurrence Maintain treatment at same dose level None \nGrade 2b,c \nAny occurrence Suspend treatment until Grade 0 or 1 None \nGrade 3 or higherc \nFirst occurrence Suspend treatment until Grade 0 or 1 Reduce by 1 dose level from \n\nprevious level \nSecond occurrence Suspend treatment until Grade 0 or 1 Reduce by 1 dose level from \n\nprevious level \nThird occurrence Discontinue treatment Discontinue treatment \na According to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) of the Cancer Therapy \nEvaluation Program, US National Cancer Institute, version 3.0. \nb For Grade 2 nausea and/or vomiting, the anti-emetic therapy should be optimized prior to a suspension of \nTeysuno. \nc At the discretion of the treating physician, patients may continue with treatment without reduction or \ninterruption for adverse reactions (irrespective of grade) considered unlikely to become serious or life-\nthreatening (e.g., alopecia, changes in sexual function, and dry skin). \n\n \nDose modifications for renal toxicities \n \nCreatinine clearance (CrCl) must be determined for every cycle before the start of treatment on Day 1.   \n \nTable 4: Teysuno and cisplatin dose modification according to creatinine clearance values at the start \nof a cycle of treatment \n \n\nCreatinine \nclearance \n\nTeysuno dose modification at the \nstart of the cycle of treatment \n\nCisplatin dose modification at the \nstart of the cycle of treatment \n\n≥50 ml/min No dose modification No dose modification \n30 to 49 ml/min Start treatment at one reduced dose \n\nlevel \nStart cisplatin treatment at a 50% \ndose reduction from the previous \n\ncycle \n<30 ml/mina Suspend treatment until resumption \n\ncriterion (≥30 ml/min) is met and \nthen start treatment at one reduced \n\ndose level \n\nSuspend cisplatin treatment until \nresumption criterion (≥30 ml/min) is \nmet and then start treatment at a 50% \n\ndose reduction from the previous \ncycle \n\na Treatment for patients with CrCl <30 ml/min is not recommended unless the benefits of Teysuno \ntreatment clearly outweigh the risks.

Refer to “Dose modifications for special populations / Renal impairment for \nguidance.” \n\n \nDose modifications for special populations \n \nRenal impairment \n \n\n• Mild renal impairment (CrCl 51 to 80 ml/min) \n \n\nNo adjustment of the standard dose is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment (see \nsection 5.2). \n\n \n• Moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to 50 ml/min) \n\n \nThe recommended standard dose in patients with moderate renal impairment is 20 mg/m2 twice \ndaily (expressed as tegafur content) (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \n\n \n• Severe renal impairment (CrCl below 30 ml/min) \n\n \nAlthough roughly similar daily exposure to 5-FU would be expected in patients with severe \nrenal impairment at a dose of 20 mg/m2 once daily compared to 30 mg/m2 twice daily in patients \nwith normal renal function (see section 5.2), administration of Teysuno is not recommended due \nto possibly higher incidence of adverse events of the blood and lymphatic system disorders \nunless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nNo data is available regarding Teysuno administration in patients with end stage renal disease \nrequiring dialysis (see section 4.3). \n\n \nElderly   \n \nNo adjustment of the standard dose is recommended in patients >70 years old (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nHepatic impairment \n \nNo adjustment of the standard dose is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment (see \nsection 5.2).   \n \nEthnicity \n \nNo adjustment of the standard dose is recommended for patients of Asian ethnicity (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Teysuno in children and adolescents under 18 years old have not been \nestablished.  No data are available.  Therefore, Teysuno should not be administered to children or \nadolescents under 18 years of age. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe capsules should be taken by mouth with water at least 1 hour before or 1 hour after a meal (see \nsection 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to any of the active substances (tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil) or to any of the \n\nexcipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n• History of severe and unexpected reactions to fluoropyrimidine therapy. \n \n• Known complete dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency (see section 4.4). \n \n• Pregnancy and breast-feeding. \n \n• Severe bone marrow suppression (severe leukopaenia, neutropaenia, or thrombocytopaenia; see \n\nsection 4.2, Table 5). \n \n• End stage renal disease patients requiring dialysis. \n \n• Co-administration of other fluoropyrimidines with Teysuno. \n \n• Recent or concomitant treatment with brivudine (see section 4.4 and 4.5 for drug-drug \n\ninteraction). \n \n• Contraindications for cisplatin; refer to the cisplatin SmPC. \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDose limiting toxicities include diarrhoea and dehydration.  Most adverse reactions are reversible and \ncan be managed by symptomatic therapy, dose interruptions and dose reductions. \n \nBone marrow suppression  \n \nTreatment-related bone marrow suppression, including neutropaenia, leukopaenia, thrombocytopaenia, \nanaemia, and pancytopaenia, has been reported among patients treated with Teysuno in combination \nwith cisplatin.  Patients with low white blood cell counts should be monitored carefully for infection \nand risk of other complications of neutropaenia and treated as medically indicated (e.g., with \nantibiotics, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [G-CSF]).  Patients with low platelet counts are at \nincreased risk for bleeding and should be monitored carefully.  The dose should be modified as \nrecommended in section 4.2. \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \n \nAdministration of Teysuno in hepatitis B virus carriers, HBc antigen negative and HBc antibody \npositive patients, or HBs antigen negative and HBs antibody positive patients may result in \nreactivation of hepatitis B. \n \nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Teysuno. Experts in liver \ndisease and in the treatment of hepatitis B should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients \nwith positive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease) and for patients who test \npositive for HBV infection during treatment. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with Teysuno \nshould be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy, and \nfollow-up monitoring for hepatic function tests or viral markers are recommended. \n \nDiarrhoea  \n \nPatients with diarrhoea should be carefully monitored and given fluid and electrolyte replacement if \nthey become dehydrated.  Prophylactic treatment for diarrhoea should be administered as indicated.  \nStandard anti-diarrhoeal therapy (e.g., loperamide) and intravenous fluids/electrolytes should be \ninitiated early when diarrhoea develops.  Dose suspension/adjustment should be implemented with the \noccurrence of Grade 2 or higher diarrhoea if symptoms persist despite adequate treatment. \n \nDehydration  \n \nDehydration and any associated electrolyte disturbances should be prevented or corrected at onset.  \nPatients with anorexia, asthenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, stomatitis, and gastrointestinal \nobstruction should be monitored closely for signs of dehydration.  Dehydration should be managed \naggressively with rehydration and other appropriate measures.  If Grade 2 (or higher) dehydration \noccurs, treatment should be immediately suspended and the dehydration corrected.  Treatment should \nnot be resumed until dehydration and its underlying causes are corrected or adequately controlled.  \nDose modifications should be applied for the precipitating adverse reaction as necessary (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nRenal toxicity  \n \nTreatment with Teysuno in combination with cisplatin may be associated with a transient decline of \nglomerular filtration rate caused primarily by pre-renal factors (e.g., dehydration, electrolyte \nimbalance, etc).  Adverse reactions of Grade 3 or higher such as increased blood creatinine, decreased \ncreatinine clearance, toxic nephropathy, and acute renal failure have all been reported in patients \nreceiving Teysuno in combination with cisplatin (see section 4.8).  To detect early changes in renal \nfunction during treatment, renal parameters should be closely monitored (e.g., serum creatinine, CrCl).  \nIf deterioration of glomerular filtration rate is observed, Teysuno and/or cisplatin dose should be \nadjusted according to Table 4, and appropriate supportive measures taken (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \nDehydration and diarrhoea may increase the risk of renal toxicity for cisplatin.  Hyperhydration \n(forced diuresis) should be administered according to the cisplatin SmPC to reduce the risk of renal \ntoxicity associated with cisplatin therapy.   \n \nGimeracil increases 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) exposure by inhibiting DPD, the primary enzyme for \nmetabolizing 5-FU.  Gimeracil is primarily cleared by the kidney (see section 5.2); so, in patients with \nrenal insufficiency gimeracil renal clearance is decreased and 5-FU exposure thus increased.  \nTreatment-related toxicities can be expected to increase as 5-FU exposure increases (see section 5.2).   \n \nSevere renal impairment \n \nTreatment with Teysuno is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment due to possibly \nhigher incidence of adverse events of the blood and lymphatic system and the possibility of \nunexpectedly higher exposure to 5-FU as a result of fluctuations in renal function in these patients, \nunless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). \n \nOcular toxicity  \n \nThe most common treatment-related ocular disorders among patients in studies in Europe/United \nStates of America (EU/USA) treated with Teysuno in combination with cisplatin were lacrimal \ndisorders (8.8%), including increased lacrimation, dry eye, and acquired dacryostenosis (see \nsection 4.8).   \n \nMost ocular reactions will resolve or improve with suspension of medicinal product and proper \ntreatment (instillation of artificial tears, antibiotic eye drops, implantation of glass or silicone tubes in \nlacrimal punctas or canaliculi, and/or use of spectacles rather than contact lenses).  Efforts should be \nmade to ensure early detection of ocular reactions, including an early ophthalmologic consultation in \nthe event of any persistent or vision-reducing ocular symptoms such as lacrimation or corneal \nsymptoms.   \n \nRefer to the cisplatin SmPC for eye disorders observed with cisplatin therapy. \n \nCoumarin-derivative anticoagulant \n \nPatients receiving oral coumarin-derivative anticoagulant therapy must have their anticoagulant \nresponse (International Normalized Ratio for prothrombin time [INR] or prothrombin time [PT]) \nmonitored closely and the anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly (see section 4.5).  The use of \ncoumarin-derivative anticoagulant in clinical trials has been associated with elevated INR and \ngastrointestinal bleeding, bleeding tendency, haematuria, and anaemia in patients receiving Teysuno \ntherapy.   \n \nBrivudine \n \nBrivudine must not be administered concomitantly with Teysuno. Fatal cases have been reported \nfollowing capecitabine interaction. There must be at least a 4-week waiting period between end of \ntreatment with brivudine and start of Teysuno therapy. Treatment with brivudine can be started 24 \nhours after the last dose of Teysuno (see section 4.3 and 4.5). \nIn the event of accidental administration of brivudine to patients being treated with Teysuno, effective \nmeasures should be taken to reduce the toxicity of Teysuno. Immediate admission to hospital is \nrecommended. All measures should be initiated to prevent systemic infections and dehydration. \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n \nDPD inducers \n \nIf a DPD inducer were to be concomitantly administered with Teysuno, the exposure of 5-FU might \nnot reach the efficacious level.  However, since no DPD inducers are currently known, the interaction \nbetween a DPD inducer and Teysuno can not be evaluated. \n \nDihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency: \n\nDPD activity is rate limiting in the catabolism of 5-fluorouracil (see Section 5.2). Patients with DPD \ndeficiency are therefore at increased risk of fluoropyrimidines-related toxicity including for example \nstomatitis, diarrhoea, mucosal inflammation, neutropenia and neurotoxicity. \n\nDPD-deficiency related toxicity usually occurs during the first cycle of treatment or after dose increase. \n\nComplete DPD deficiency \n\nComplete DPD deficiency is rare (0.01-0.5% of Caucasians). Patients with complete DPD deficiency \nare at high risk of life-threatening or fatal toxicity and must not be treated with Teysuno (see section \n4.3).  \n\nPartial DPD deficiency \n\nPartial DPD deficiency is estimated to affect 3-9% of the Caucasian population. Patients with partial \nDPD deficiency are at increased risk of severe and potentially life-threatening toxicity. A reduced \nstarting dose should be considered to limit this toxicity. DPD deficiency should be considered as a \nparameter to be taken into account in conjunction with other routine measures for dose reduction. Initial \ndose reduction may impact the efficacy of treatment. In the absence of serious toxicity, subsequent doses \nmay be increased with careful monitoring.  \n\nTesting for DPD deficiency \n\nPhenotype and/or genotype testing prior to the initiation of treatment with Teysuno is recommended \ndespite uncertainties regarding optimal pre-treatment testing methodologies. Consideration should be \ngiven to applicable clinical guidelines.  \n\nGenotypic characterisation of DPD deficiency  \n\nPre-treatment testing for rare mutations of the DPYD gene can identify patients with DPD deficiency. \n\nThe four DPYD variants c.1905+1G>A [also known as DPYD*2A], c.1679T>G [DPYD*13], \nc.2846A>T and c.1236G>A/HapB3 can cause complete absence or reduction of DPD enzymatic \nactivity. Other rare variants may also be associated with an increased risk of severe or life-threatening \ntoxicity.  \n\nCertain homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in the DPYD gene locus (e.g. combinations \nof the four variants with at least one allele of c.1905+1G>A or c.1679T>G) are known to cause complete \nor near complete absence of DPD enzymatic activity. \n\nPatients with certain heterozygous DPYD variants (including c.1905+1G>A, c.1679T>G, c.2846A>T \nand c.1236G>A/HapB3 variants) have increased risk of severe toxicity when treated with \nfluoropyrimidines.  \n\nThe frequency of the heterozygous c.1905+1G>A genotype in the DPYD gene in Caucasian patients is \naround 1%, 1.1% for c.2846A>T, 2.6-6.3% for c.1236G>A/HapB3 variants and 0.07 to 0.1% for \nc.1679T>G.  \n\n\n\n35 \n\nData on the frequency of the four DPYD variants in other populations than Caucasian is limited. At the \npresent, the four DPYD variants (c.1905+1G>A, c.1679T>G, c.2846A>T and c.1236G>A/HapB3) are \nconsidered virtually absent in populations of African (-American) or Asian origin.  \n\nPhenotypic characterisation of DPD deficiency \n\nFor phenotypic characterisation of DPD deficiency the measurement of pre-therapeutic blood levels of \nthe endogenous DPD substrate uracil (U) in plasma is recommended. \n\nElevated pre-treatment uracil concentrations are associated with an increased risk of toxicity. Despite \nuncertainties on uracil thresholds defining complete and partial DPD deficiency, a blood uracil level ≥ \n16 ng/ml and < 150 ng/ml should be considered indicative of partial DPD deficiency and associated \nwith an increased risk for fluoropyrimidine toxicity. A blood uracil level ≥ 150 ng/ml should be \nconsidered indicative of complete DPD deficiency and associated with a risk for life-threatening or fatal \nfluoropyrimidine toxicity.  \n\n \nMicrosatellite instability (MSI) \n \nTeysuno has not been studied in gastric cancer patients with MSI.  The association between 5-FU \nsensitivity and MSI in patients with gastric cancer is unclear and the association between Teysuno and \nMSI in gastric cancer is unknown. \n \nGlucose/galactose intolerance/malabsorption \n \nThis medicinal product contains lactose.  Patients with rare hereditory problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose/galactose malabasorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \nOther oral fluorpyrimidines \n \nNo clinical trials are available comparing Teysuno versus other oral 5-FU compounds.  Therefore, \nTeysuno cannot be used as a substitute for other oral 5-FU products. \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed in adult or paediatric patients. \n \nBrivudine \n \nA clinically significant interaction between brivudine and fluoropyrimidines (e.g. capecitabine, 5-\nFluorouracil, tegafur), resulting from the inhibition of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase by brivudine, \nhas been described. This interaction, which leads to increased fluoropyrimidine toxicity, is potentially \nfatal. Therefore, brivudine must not be administered concomitantly with Teysuno (see section 4.3 and \n4.4). There must be at least a 4-week waiting period between end of treatment with brivudine and start \nof Teysuno therapy. Treatment with brivudine can be started 24 hours after the last dose of Teysuno. \n \n \nOther fluoropyrimidines \n \nCo-administration of other fluoropyrimidines such as capecitabine, 5-FU, tegafur, or flucytosine can \nlead to additive toxicities, and is contraindicated.  A minimum washout period of 7 days is \nrecommended between administration of Teysuno and other fluoropyrimidines.  The washout period \ndescribed in the SmPC of other fluoropyrimidine medicinal products should be followed if Teysuno is \nto be administered subsequent to other fluoropyrimidine medicinal products. \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nCYP2A6 inhibitors \n \nAs CYP2A6 is the major enzyme responsible for the conversion of tegafur to 5-FU, co-administration \nof a known CYP2A6 inhibitor and Teysuno should be avoided as effectiveness of Teysuno could be \ndecreased (see section 5.2).  \n \nFolinate/folinic acid \n \nNo data are available on the concomitant use of folinic acid with Teysuno in combination with \ncisplatin.  However, metabolites of folinate/folinic acid will form a ternary structure with thymidylate \nsynthase and fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP), potentially increasing the cytotoxicity of \n5-FU.  Caution is advised as folinic acid is known to enhance the activity of 5-FU. \n \nNitroimidazoles, including metronidazole and misonidazole \n \nNo data are available on the concomitant use of nitromidazoles with Teysuno in combination with \ncisplatin.  However, nitromidazoles may reduce clearance of 5-FU and thus increase plasma levels of \n5-FU.  Caution is advised as co-administration may increase the toxicity of Teysuno. \n \nMethotrexate \n \nNo data are available on the concomitant use of methotrexate with Teysuno in combination with \ncisplatin.  However, polyglutamated methotrexate inhibits thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate \nreductase, potentially increasing cytotoxicity of 5-FU.  Caution is advised as co-administration may \nincrease the toxicity of Teysuno. \n \nClozapine \n \nNo data are available on the concomitant use of clozapine with Teysuno in combination with cisplatin.  \nHowever, due to possible additive pharmacodynamic effects (myelotoxicity), caution is advised as co-\nadministration may increase the risk and severity of haematologic toxicity of Teysuno.  \n \nCimetidine \n \nNo data are available on the concomitant use of cimetidine with Teysuno in combination with \ncisplatin.  However, co-administration may decrease clearance and, thus increase plasma levels of \n5-FU.  Caution is advised as co-administration may increase the toxicity of Teysuno. \n \nCoumarin-derivative anticoagulant \n \nThe activity of a coumarin-derivative anticoagulant was enhanced by Teysuno.  Caution is advised as \nco-administration of Teysuno and coumarin anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of bleeding \n(see section 4.4).   \n \nPhenytoin \n \nFluoropyrimidines may increase phenytoin plasma concentration when administered concomitantly \nwith phenytoin causing phenytoin toxicity.  Frequent monitoring of phenytoin blood/plasma levels is \nadvised when Teysuno and phenytoin are administered concomitantly.  If indicated, the dose of \nphenytoin should be adjusted according to the phenytoin SmPC.  If phenytoin toxicity develops, \nappropriate measures should be taken.   \n \nOther \n \nBased on non-clinical data, allopurinol may decrease anti-tumour activity due to suppression of \nphosphorylation of 5-FU.  Therefore, concurrent administration with Teysuno should be avoided.   \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nFood \n \nAdministration of Teysuno with a meal reduced exposure to oteracil and gimeracil, with a more \npronounced effect for oteracil than for gimeracil (see section 5.2).  It should be taken with water at \nleast 1 hour before or 1 hour after a meal (see section 4.2). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving \ntreatment with this medicinal product.   \n \nContraceptive measures must be taken by both male and female patients during and up to 6 months \nafter stopping treatment with Teysuno.   \n \nPregnancy \n \nTeysuno is contraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3).  There have been some case reports of \nfoetal abnormalities.  Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity.  As with other \nfluoropyrimidines, Teysuno administration caused embryolethality and teratogenicity in animals (see \nsection 5.3).  If the patient becomes pregnant while receiving Teysuno, treatment should be \ndiscontinued and the potential risk to the foetus must be explained.  Genetic counseling should be \nconsidered. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nTeysuno is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3).  It is not known whether Teysuno \nor its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in \nanimals have shown excretion of Teysuno or its metabolites in milk (for details see section 5.3).   \n \nA risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  Breast-feeding must be discontinued while receiving \ntreatment with Teysuno. \n \nFertility \n \nNo data are available on the effect of Teysuno in combination with cisplatin on human fertility.  \nNon-clinical studies demonstrated that Teysuno did not appear to affect male or female fertility in the \nrat (see section 5.3). \n \nRefer to the cisplatin SmPC for the effects of cisplatin on fertility, pregnancy and lactation. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTeysuno has a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines as fatigue, dizziness, \nblurred vision, and nausea are common adverse reactions of Teysuno in combination with cisplatin.   \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nThe overall safety profile of Teysuno in combination with cisplatin is based primarily on clinical study \ndata from 593 patients with advanced gastric cancer treated with this regimen.  In addition, there is \npost-marketing experience in over 866,000 Asian (mainly Japanese) patients. \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nAmong 593 patients treated with Teysuno in combination with cisplatin, the most common severe \nadverse reactions (Grade 3 or higher with frequency of at least 10%) were neutropaenia, anaemia, and \nfatigue. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following headings are used to rank the adverse reactions by frequency: very common (≥1/10), \ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare \n(<1/10,000), and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).  The frequencies of very \ncommon, common, and uncommon adverse reactions are from 593 patients treated with Teysuno in \ncombination with cisplatin in clinical trials.  The frequencies of medically relevant rare and very rare \nadverse reactions are estimated from post-marketing surveillance of 866,000 patients in Asia (mostly \nJapanese) treated with Teysuno-based therapy.  Each term is presented in its most common category \nonly and within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness.   \n \nTable 7: Adverse reactions

keratitis, limbal stem cell deficiency visual acuity reduced, visual impairment, vision blurred. \n \n\n \nOther clinical studies with Teysuno in combination with cisplatin \n \nAlthough studies of Teysuno in combination with cisplatin that were conducted in Japan utilised doses \nand dosing schedules that differed from this regimen, the safety profile from these studies was similar, \nwith the most common toxicities being haematologic, gastrointestinal, fatigue, and anorexia.  \n \nPost-marketing surveillance experience in gastric cancer patients \n \nThe safety profile of Teysuno in a post-marketing safety surveillance study in Japan of 4,177 patients \ntreated with Teysuno for advanced gastric cancer was generally similar to that seen with this regimen \nand in the Japanese registration studies (i.e., major toxicities were leukocytopaenia, anorexia, and \nnausea/vomiting).   \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nOcular toxicity   \n \nTerms for treatment-related ocular toxicities have been combined as follows.  The only Grade 3 or \nhigher adverse reaction was reduced visual acuity.   \n• Vision disorder includes adverse reactions of blurred vision, diplopia, photopsia, reduced visual \n\nacuity, and blindness;  \n• Lacrimal disorder includes adverse reactions of increased lacrimation, dry eye, and acquired \n\ndacryostenosis;  \n• Eye disorder includes adverse reactions of eye pruritus, ocular hyperaemia, eye irritation, eye \n\ndisorder, and foreign body sensation in eyes.   \n \n\n\n\n41 \n\nNeuropathy \n \nCentral and peripheral neuropathy has been reported in patients treated with Teysuno in combination \nwith cisplatin.  The term peripheral neuropathy includes the following reported adverse reactions: \nperipheral sensory neuropathy, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, peripheral neuropathy, polyneuropathy, \nneurotoxicity, and dysaesthesia.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (see section 4.2) \n \nComparison of safety between 71 patients ≥70 years old (elderly) and 450 patients <70 years old \ntreated with Teysuno in combination with cisplatin in the FLAGS study demonstrated that the \nincidence of all Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions (62% vs 52%), all serious adverse reactions (30% \nvs 19%), and the rate of premature withdrawal due to adverse reactions from both Teysuno and \ncisplatin (21% vs 12%) appeared to be higher among patients ≥70 years old.  A population \npharmacokinetics analysis demonstrated that 5-FU exposure also tended to increase with age, but the \nextent of the increase was within the range of individual variability.  These changes with age were \nrelated to changes in renal function as measured by creatinine clearance (see section 5.2).   \n \nGender  \n \nThere were no clinically relevant differences in safety between males (N=382) and females (N=139) in \nthe FLAGS study.  \n \nPatients with renal impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, and 5.2) \n \nComparison of 218 patients with mild renal impairment at baseline (CrCl 51 to 80 ml/min) to \n297 patients with normal renal function at baseline (CrCl >80 ml/min) treated with Teysuno in \ncombination with cisplatin in the FLAGS study indicated that there were no clinically significant \ndifferences in safety between patients with mild renal impairment and patients with normal renal \nfunction.   \n \nIn a study performed in patients with renal impairment, the most common adverse reactions reported \nover all cycles across all cohorts were diarrhoea (57.6%), nausea (42.4%), vomiting (36.4%), fatigue \n(33.3%) and anaemia (24.2%). In this study, 7 patients with moderate renal impairment were treated \nwith 20 mg/m2 Teysuno twice daily, while 7 patients with severe renal impairment received Teysuno \n20 mg/m2 once daily. No dose limiting toxicities were observed in Cycle 1 in patients with moderate \nor severe renal impairment. The incidence of blood and lymphatic systems disorders adverse reactions \nobserved across all cycles in the moderate and severe renal impairment patients were 28.6% and \n44.4%, respectively. The dose for one patient in the severe cohort was reduced to 13.2 mg/m2 once \ndaily at the start of Cycle 12 due to an adverse reaction (Grade 2 diarrhoea) in Cycle 11.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo studies have been performed with Teysuno alone or in combination with cisplatin in paediatric \npatients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n42 \n\n \nThe highest single dose of Teysuno taken was 1400 mg; this patient developed leukopenia (Grade 3).   \nManifestations of acute overdose reported include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, mucositis, \ngastrointestinal irritation, bleeding, bone marrow depression, and respiratory failure.  Medical \nmanagement of overdose should include customary therapeutic and supportive medical interventions \naimed at correcting the presenting clinical manifestations and preventing their possible complications. \n \nThere is no known antidote available in case of overdose.   \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, antimetabolites, ATC code: L01BC53. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTeysuno is an oral fluoropyrimidine anti-cancer medicinal product.  It is a fixed dose combination of \nthree active substances, tegafur, which after absorption is converted into the anti-cancer substance \n5-FU; gimeracil, a dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) inhibitor to prevent degradation of 5-FU \nby the body; and, oteracil, an orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT) inhibitor that decreases the \nactivity of 5-FU in normal gastrointestinal mucosa.  The combination of tegafur, gimeracil, and \noteracil was set at 1:0.4:1 molar ratio as optimum in order to maintain 5-FU exposure and thus sustain \nanti-tumour activity while reducing toxicity associated with 5-FU alone. \n \nTegafur is a prodrug of 5-FU with good oral bioavailability.  Following oral administration, tegafur is \ngradually converted to 5-FU in vivo, mainly by CYP2A6 enzyme activity in the liver.  5-FU is \nmetabolised by the liver enzyme DPD.  5-FU is activated within cells by phosphorylation to its active \nmetabolite, 5-fluoro-deoxyuridine-monophosphate (FdUMP).  FdUMP and reduced folate are bound \nto thymidylate synthase leading to formation of a ternary complex which inhibits DNA synthesis.  In \naddition, 5-fluorouridine-triphosphate (FUTP) is incorporated into RNA causing disruption of RNA \nfunctions.   \n \nGimeracil inhibits the metabolism of 5-FU by reversibly and selectively inhibiting DPD, the primary \nmetabolic enzyme for 5-FU, so that higher plasma concentrations of 5-FU are achieved with the \nadministration of a lower dose of tegafur.   \n \nAfter oral administration, oteracil was distributed at high concentrations in normal gastrointestinal \ntract tissues while considerably lower concentrations were seen in blood and tumour tissue in animal \nstudies.   \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn a dose escalation study comparing the tolerability of 5_FU in Teysuno and tegafur + gimeracil (no \noteracil), the 25 mg/m2 dose level could not be attained in the absence of oteracil due to the occurrence \nof dose limiting toxicities (Grade 3 diarrhoea in 2 patients, and cardio-respiratory arrest in 1 patient) in \nthe tegafur+gimeracil arm.  The 5-FU pharmacokinetic profile was similar in the presence and absence \nof oteracil. \n \nMean 5-FU maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve \n(AUC) values were approximately 3-fold higher after Teysuno administration than after administration \nof tegafur alone, despite a 16-fold lower Teysuno dose (50 mg of tegafur) compared to tegafur alone \n(800 mg), and are attributed to inhibition of DPD by gimeracil.  Maximum plasma uracil concentration \nwas observed at 4 hours, with a return to baseline levels within approximately 48 hours after dosing, \nindicating the reversibility of the DPD inhibition by gimeracil. \n \n\n\n\n43 \n\nA study of the effect of Teysuno on cardiac repolarisation conducted in advanced cancer patients met \nthe definition for a negative study according to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) \nguidelines.  No consistent relationship was seen between absolute QTcF interval values or change \nfrom Baseline values and maximum plasma concentration of Teysuno components. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nA Phase I study established the current regimen by evaluating cohorts of Teysuno and cisplatin of \n30 mg/m2 and 60 mg/m2 (dose-limiting toxicities [DLTs] seen were fatigue, and diarrhoea and \ndehydration); 25 mg/m2 and 60 mg/m2; and 25 mg/m2 and 75 mg/m2.  Despite the lack of DLTs in the \nlast cohort, the dose of cisplatin was not elevated beyond 75 mg/m2. \n \nIn the Phase III FLAGS study, there was no apparent relationship between 5-FU AUC \n(Teysuno/cisplatin arm) and 5-FU concentration (5-FU/cisplatin arm) during Cycle 1 and efficacy \noutcomes of overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS).   \n \n A Phase I study was conducted to evaluate the PK of the components of Teysuno and their \nmetabolites in cancer patients with impaired renal function compared to those with normal renal \nfunction. In this study, antitumor activity was measured by best overall tumour response. The majority \n(70.4%) of patients had Stable Disease as a best response (based on Investigator’s assessment using \nRECIST criteria) and 29.6% patients had Progressive Disease as their best overall response. No dose \nlimiting toxicities were observed in the first cycle of treatment. \n \nAdvanced gastric cancer \n \nData from a multicentre, multinational (excluding Asia), randomised, controlled, open-label Phase III \nclinical study (FLAGS) support the use of Teysuno in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of \npatients with advanced gastric cancer.  In this study, 521 patients were randomised to treatment with \nTeysuno (25 mg/m2 orally twice daily for 21 days followed by a 7-day rest period) and cisplatin \n(75 mg/m2 intravenous infusion once every 4 weeks); and 508 patients were randomised to treatment \nwith 5-FU (1000 mg/m2/24 hours as a continuous intravenous infusion on Days 1 through 5 repeated \nevery 4 weeks) and cisplatin (100 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion on Day 1 repeated every 4 weeks).  \nPatient characteristics are provided in Table 8.   \n \nTable 8: Demographics and baseline characteristics of patients in the FLAGS study \n\n Teysuno + Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 \n(N=521) \n\n5-FU + Cisplatin 100 mg/m2 \n(N=508) \n\nGender, n (%) \n Male \n Female \n\n \n382 (73) \n139 (27) \n\n \n347 (68) \n161 (32) \n\nAge, years \n Median (Range) \n ≥65, n (%) \n\n \n59 (18-83) \n160 (31) \n\n \n60 (20-85) \n164 (32) \n\nRace, n (%) \n White \n Black or African American \n Asian \n American Indian or Alaska Native \n Other \n\n \n447 (86) \n\n5 (1.0) \n4 (0.8) \n4 (0.8) \n\n61 (12) \n\n \n438 (86) \n\n7 (1.4) \n4 (0.8) \n6 (1.2) \n\n53 (10) \nECOG Performance Status, n (%) \n 0 \n 1 \n\n \n226 (43) \n295 (57) \n\n \n200 (39) \n308 (61) \n\nLocation of primary lesion, n (%) \n Stomach \n Gastro-oesophageal junction \n Both \n\n \n438 (84) \n82 (16) \n\n1 (0.2) \n\n \n417 (82) \n88 (17) \n\n3 (0.6) \nMetastatic disease, n (%) \n ≥2 metastatic sites \n\n497 (95) \n340 (65) \n\n488 (96) \n327 (64) \n\n \n \n\n\n\n44 \n\nFor the primary endpoint of overall survival, Teysuno in combination with cisplatin was non-inferior \nto 5-FU in combination with cisplatin (see Table 9).

Eighteen additional PK studies were performed using the relevant regimen \nas monotherapy.  All studies were performed in cancer patients. \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter administration of a single dose of 50 mg Teysuno (expressed as tegafur content) in man \n(approximately 30 mg/m2 based on body surface area of 1.56 to 2.10 m2 for a typical patient; N=14), \nthe median Tmax for Teysuno components tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil was 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 hours, \nrespectively, and the mean ± standard deviation (SD) AUC0-inf and Cmax was 14595 ± 4340 ng.hr/ml \nand 1762 ± 279 ng/ml for tegafur, 1884 ± 640 ng.hr/ml and 452 ± 102 ng/ml for gimeracil, \n556 ± 281 ng.hr/ml and 112 ± 52 ng/ml for oteracil.  The median Tmax for 5-FU was 2.0 hours and the \nmean AUC0-inf and Cmax was 842 ± 252 ng.hr/ml and 174 ± 58 ng/ml.  Levels of tegafur, gimeracil, \noteracil and 5-FU were quantifiable through 10 hours postdose.  After administration of 30 mg/m2 \ndoses, steady-state conditions are reached for tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil at the latest by Day 8.   \n \nAfter multiple dose administration (30 mg/m2, expressed as tegafur content, twice daily for 14 days; \nN=10), the median Tmax of tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil was 0.8, 1.0, and 2.0 hours, respectively, \nand the corresponding mean ± SD AUC(0-12h) and Cmax was 19967 ± 6027 ng.hr/ml and \n2970 ± 852 ng/ml for tegafur, 1483 ± 527 ng.hr/ml and 305 ± 116 ng/ml for gimeracil, and \n692 ± 529 ng.hr/ml and 122 ± 82 ng/ml for oteracil.  The median Tmax for 5-FU was 2.0 hours and the \nmean AUC(0-12h) and Cmax was 870 ± 405 ng.hr/ml and 165 ± 62 ng/ml, respectively.   \n \nAdministration of Teysuno under fed conditions resulted in decreased AUC0-inf  for oteracil of \napproximately 71% and gimeracil of approximately 25% relative to fasting administration.  \nConcomitant administration of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) reduced the effect of food on the \npharmacokinetic profile of oteracil, but not by a sufficient margin to completely negate the food effect.  \nThere was a 15% decrease in AUC0-inf  for 5-FU under fed versus fasting conditions, and tegafur \nexposure was not altered by food (thus demonstrating absence of a food effect). \n \nMean AUC0-inf and Cmax for 5-FU were approximately 3-fold greater following administration of \nTeysuno (50 mg expressed as tegafur content) than following administration of tegafur alone \n(800 mg), while AUC0-inf and Cmax values for the 5-FU metabolite α-fluoro-β-alanine (FBAL) were \n\n\n\n45 \n\napproximately 15- to 22-fold lower following administration of Teysuno than following administration \nof tegafur.   \n \nThe oteracil component of Teysuno did not affect the pharmacokinetic profiles of 5-FU, tegafur, \ngimeracil, FBAL, or uracil.  The gimeracil component did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of \ntegafur. \n \nDistribution \n \nOteracil, gimeracil, 5-FU, and tegafur were 8.4%, 32.2%, 18.4%, and 52.3% protein bound, \nrespectively.  The protein binding in human serum was not concentration-dependent over a range of \n0.1 to 1.0 µg/ml for oteracil, gimeracil, and 5-FU and 1.2 to 11.8 µg/ml for tegafur. \n \nThere are no clinical data on the distribution of radiolabeled components of Teysuno.  Although no \nintravenous data are available for Teysuno in humans, the volume of distribution could be roughly \nestimated from the apparent volume of distribution and urinary excretion data as 16 l/m2, 17 l/m2, and \n23 l/m2 for tegafur, gimeracil and oteracil, respectively. \n\nBiotransformation \n \nThe main metabolic pathway for tegafur is through conversion to 5-FU via CYP2A6 in the liver, \nwhereas gimeracil was stable in human liver homogenate (S9 fraction) with adenosine 3’-phosphate \n5'-phosphosulfphate lithium salt (PAPS; a co-factor for sulfotransferase) or nicotinamide adenine \ndinucleotide phosphate (NADPH).  Based on the results of in vitro studies, a part of oteracil is \nnon-enzymatically degraded to 5-azauracil (5-AZU) by gastric fluid, and is then converted to cyanuric \nacid (CA) in the digestive tract.  5-AZU and CA do not inhibit OPRT enzyme activity.  Only a small \namount of oteracil is metabolised in the liver because of its low permeability.  \n \nIn vitro evaluation using human liver microsomes indicated that neither tegafur, gimeracil nor oteracil \nshowed any relevant inhibitory effects on enzyme activities of the cytochrome P450 isoforms tested \n(i.e., CYP1A1/2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8/9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4).   \n \nIn vitro evaluation using primary cultures of human hepatocytes indicated that tegafur (0.7-70 µM), \ngimeracil (0.2-25 µM) and oteracil (0.04-4 µM) had little or no inductive effect on CYP1A2, CYP2B6 \nor CYP3A4/5 metabolic activities.  \n \nUsing plasma uracil concentrations to assess DPD activity in clinical studies, no marked changes in \nplasma uracil concentrations were observed after administration of a single 800 mg dose of tegafur \nwhile plasma uracil concentrations increased markedly after administration of a single 50 mg dose of \nTeysuno (reflecting DPD inhibition by gimeracil).  Following both single dose (50 mg) and multiple \ndose (30 mg/m2 twice daily) administration of Teysuno in man, maximum uracil concentrations \nreflecting DPD inhibition were observed approximately 4 hours postdose.  Similar inhibition was seen \nfollowing single and multiple dosing.  The plasma concentrations of uracil returned to baseline levels \napproximately 48 hours after dosing indicating reversibility of DPD inhibition by gimeracil. \n \nElimination \n \nIn man, the apparent terminal elimination half-life (T1/2) of 5-FU observed after administration of \nTeysuno (containing tegafur, a 5-FU prodrug) was longer (approximately 1.6 - 1.9 hours) than that \npreviously reported after intravenous administration of 5-FU (10 to 20 minutes).  Following a single \ndose of Teysuno, T1/2 values ranged from 6.7 to 11.3 hours for tegafur, from 3.1 to 4.1 hours for \ngimeracil, and from 1.8 to 9.5 hours for oteracil. \n \nFollowing a single dose of Teysuno, approximately 3.8% to 4.2% of administered tegafur, 65% to \n72% of administered gimeracil, and 3.5% to 3.9% of administered oteracil were excreted unchanged in \nthe urine.  Among the metabolites, 9.5% to 9.7% of the administered tegafur was excreted in the urine \nas 5-FU and approximately 70% to 77% as FBAL, accounting for approximately 83% to 91% of the \n\n\n\n46 \n\nadministered Teysuno dose (total tegafur + 5-FU + FBAL).  There was no effect of gimeracil on renal \nclearance of tegafur, FBAL, and 5-FU following administration of Teysuno as compared to their \nclearance following administration of tegafur alone.   \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nIn a Japanese Phase I study that utilized 5 dose groups with doses ranging from 25 to 200 mg/body, \nthere was a dose-proportional increase in exposure for tegafur, gimeracil and oteracil.  However, the \nincrease in 5-FU exposure tended to be greater than proportional to the increasing tegafur dose.   \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nA population PK analysis of Teysuno components and metabolites assessed the influence of various \nfactors, including gender, age, food, ethnicity (Caucasian vs Asian), renal function, and hepatic \nfunction in 315 patients.  Renal function, as reflected by creatinine clearance, was the primary factor \nthat influenced gimeracil exposure and 5-FU exposure.  As renal function decreased, there was an \nincrease in 5-FU steady state exposure.  This analysis also demonstrated that the trend in changes in \nTeysuno pharmacokinetics observed with increasing age was related to change in renal function as \nmeasured by creatinine clearance. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn a Phase I Teysuno monotherapy study that investigated the pharmacokinetics of components and \nmetabolites in patients with normal and impaired renal function, patients with mild renal impairment \n(CrCl 51 to 80 ml/min) receiving the same monotherapy dose of 30 mg/m2 twice daily (the maximum \ntolerated dose for monotherapy) as patients with normal renal function (CrCl >80 ml/min) had an \nincrease in mean 5-FU AUC0-inf relative to that of the normal patients.  Patients with moderate renal \nimpairment (CrCl 30 to 50 ml/min) who received a reduced dose of 20 mg/m2 twice daily showed no \nsignificant increase in mean 5-FU AUC0-inf relative to that of the normal group.  The increase in 5-FU \nexposure in patients with mild renal impairment in this study together with the results of simulation in \nthe population pharmacokinetic analysis suggest that a Teysuno dose of 25 mg/m2 twice daily in \npatients with mild renal impairment could achieve 5-FU plasma concentrations similar to those \nobtained in patients with normal renal function receiving 30 mg/m2 twice daily as monotherapy and \nalso those with moderate renal impairment receiving 20 mg/m2 twice daily.   \n \nFollowing a reduced dose of Teysuno 20 mg/m2 administered once daily to the severe renal \nimpairment group (CrCl < 30 ml/min), the single-dose AUC0-inf and multiple-dose AUC0-τ values for \n5-FU were approximately 2-fold higher in the severe renal impairment group compared to those \nobserved in the normal renal function group receiving 30 mg/m2 twice daily. Therefore, the daily \nexposure to 5-FU would be expected to be comparable in these groups, since the daily exposure in \npatients in the severe renal impairment group is based on the administration of Teysuno once a day, \nwhile the daily exposure to 5-FU in the patients with normal renal function is based on the \nadministration of Teysuno twice daily. However, it is to be noted that the exposure to 5-FU can be \nvariable and unexpectedly higher in patients with severe renal impairment due to the impact of \nfluctuations in renal function in these patients. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nThere were no significant differences in AUCs of 5-FU, tegafur, gimeracil, or oteracil after either \nsingle or multiple dose administration of Teysuno 30 mg/m2 twice daily in patients with mild, \nmoderate, or severe hepatic impairment compared to those with normal hepatic function.  After single \ndose administration, there was a statistically significant decrease in 5-FU and gimeracil Cmax for the \nsevere hepatic impairment group relative to that of the normal group, but this difference was not \nobserved after multiple dose administration.   \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nEthnic differences \n \nA Phase I study investigated the pharmacokinetics of Teysuno monotherapy in Asian (Chinese/Malay) \nand Caucasian (US) patients.  Consistent with the lower CYP2A6 activity in the Asian patients, \ntegafur AUC0-12 was higher and T1/2 was longer in the Asian group compared to the Caucasian group.  \nGimeracil and uracil AUC0-12 values were comparable between the two groups, suggesting that DPD \ninhibition was similar for the Asian and Caucasian groups.  Exposure of 5-FU was not statistically \nsignificantly different between the two groups.  Oteracil AUC0-12 in the Asian group was \napproximately half that of the Caucasian group, however, this difference was not statistically \nsignificant due to its large individual variability. \n \nStudies in Japanese patients have suggested an effect of CYP2A6*4 polymorphism on Teysuno \npharmacokinetics.  Although CYP2A6 variants are associated with pharmacokinetic variability of \ntegafur, the AUC of gimeracil, which is affected by renal function, is the key determinant in the \npharmacokinetic variability of 5-FU.  In the Phase III (FLAGS) study, tegafur AUC was significantly \nhigher in patients with the CYP2A6*4 allele, however, no significant difference was found for 5-FU \nAUC and for the incidence of adverse reactions.  Therefore, the CYP2A6 polymorphism differences \nbetween Asian and Western populations do not appear to be the key determinant for differences in the \nMTD between populations.  However, limited data available on CYP2A6*4/*4 genotype in Japanese \npatients treated with Teysuno suggest significantly decreased 5-FU levels in this subpopulation.  No \ndose advice for this subpopulation can be provided.  This CYP2A6*4 allele is uncommon in the \nCaucasian population. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo pharmacokinetc studies have been conducted with Teysuno in paediatric patients. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeat-dose toxicity studies in rats, dogs and monkeys produced changes typically associated with \nadministration of an anti-cancer medicinal product eliciting cytotoxic effects on populations of rapidly \ndividing cells, such as anaemia, decrease in the immune and digestive system function, disruption of \nspermatogenesis, and atrophy in male and female reproductive organs.   \n \nTreatment with Teysuno produced various skin effects in rat (keratosis of footpad and tail) and dog \n(skin crusts and erosions).  In addition, hyperpigmentation in the skin and eyes and corneal opacity in \ndogs and cataracts in rats were observed following repeat dosing.  These changes were reversible.   \n \nTeysuno does not appear to affect male or female fertility in the rat; however, administration at any \ntime after conception resulted in a range of external, visceral, and skeletal foetal abnormalities in rat \nand rabbit.  There is therefore a high risk for developmental toxicity at clinical doses, primarily due to \ntegafur (5-FU) and to oteracil to a lesser extent. \n \nTeysuno was not carcinogenic in either the rat or the mouse.  Teysuno was not found to be mutagenic \nwhen tested in the in vitro Ames assay.  Teysuno was clastogenic in vitro using Chinese hamster lung \ncells and was weakly clastogenic in vivo in mouse bone marrow. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even \n\nif their symptoms are the same as yours. \n- If  you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible any side effects not \n\nlisted in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n \n1. What Teysuno is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Teysuno \n3. How to take Teysuno \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Teysuno  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What is teysuno and what is it used for \n \nTeysuno contains the active substances tegafur gimeracil and oteracil. \n \nTeysuno belongs to the fluoropyrimidine class of medicines known as “antineoplastic agents” which \nstop the growth of cancer cells. \n \nTeysuno is prescribed by doctors for the treatment of adults with advanced stomach (gastric) cancer \nand is taken with cisplatin, another anti-cancer medicine. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Teysuno \n \nDo not take Teysuno if you:  \n- are allergic to tegafur, gimeracil, oteracil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \n\nin section 6). \n- are taking other fluoropyrimidine anti-cancer medicine such as fluorouracil and capecitabine, or \n\nhave had severe and unexpected reactions to fluoropyrimidines  \n- know that you do not have any activity of the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) \n\n(complete DPD deficiency) \n- are pregnant or breast-feeding \n- have severe blood disorders \n- have kidney disease requiring dialysis \n- are being treated now or have been treated in the last 4 weeks with  brivudine as part of herpes \n\nzoster (chickenpox or shingles) therapy. \n \n\n  \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Teysuno if you have: \n\n- blood disorders \n- kidney disease \n- stomach and/or bowel problems such as pain, diarrhoea, vomiting and dehydration \n- eye disorders, such as “dry eye” or increased tearing \n\n\n\n63 \n\n-  a current or previous infection of the liver with the hepatitis B virus, since your doctor \nmay want to monitor you more closely \n\n-    a partial deficiency in the activity of the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) \n- a family member who has partial or complete deficiency of the enzyme \n\ndihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD)   \n \n\nDPD deficiency: DPD deficiency is a genetic condition that is not usually associated with health \nproblems unless you receive certain medicines. If you have DPD deficiency and take Teysuno, you are \nat an increased risk of severe side effects (listed under section 4 Possible side effects). It is \nrecommended to test you for DPD deficiency before start of treatment. If you have no activity of the \nenzyme you should not take Teysuno. If you have a reduced enzyme activity (partial deficiency) your \ndoctor might prescribe a reduced dose. If you have negative test results for DPD deficiency, severe \nand life-threatening side effects may still occur. \n\n \n \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nTeysuno is not recommended for children under 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Teysuno \nTell your doctor if you are taking , have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  \n \nYou must not take brivudine (an anti-viral medicine for the treatment of shingles or chickenpox) \nat the same time as Teysuno treatment (including during any rest periods when you are not \ntaking any Teysuno capsules).  \nIf you have taken brivudine you must wait for at least 4 weeks after stopping brivudine before \nstarting to take Teysuno. See also section “Do not take Teysuno”. \n \nAlso, you need to be particularly careful if you are taking any of the following: \n\n- other fluoropyrimidine based medicines such as the anti-fungal flucytosine. Teysuno cannot be \nsubstituted for other oral fluoropyrimidine medicine. \n- inhibitors of the enzyme CYP2A6 which activates Teysuno such as tranylcypromine and \nmethoxsalen \n- folinic acid (often used in chemotherapy with methotrexate) \n- blood-thinning medicines: coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin \n- medicines for the treatment of seizures or tremors such as phenytoin  \n- medicines that treat gout such as allopurinol \n\n \nTeysuno with food and drink \nTeysuno should be taken at least one hour before or one hour after a meal. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nBefore starting treatment, you must tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are pregnant, if you think you \nare pregnant, or if you intend to become pregnant. You must not take Teysuno if you are pregnant or \nthink you might be.  \nDuring and up to 6 months after treatment  with Teysuno, you must use contraceptive measures.  If \nyou become pregnant during this time, you must tell your doctor. \nYou must not breastfeed if you are taking Teysuno.  \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nUse caution when driving or operating a machine, as Teysuno may make you tired, nauseous or have \nblurred vision. If you have any doubts talk to your doctor. \n \nTeysuno contains \nLactose (one type of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some \nsugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n \n3. How to take Teysuno  \n \nAlways take Teysuno exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you \nare not sure. \n \nYour doctor will tell you what dose you need to take, when to take it and for how long you need to \ntake it. Your dose of Teysuno will be determined by your doctor based on your height and weight.  \nYour doctor may reduce the dose if you have side effects that are too severe. \n \nTeysuno capsules should be swallowed with water at least 1 hour before or 1 hour after a meal.  \nTeysuno must be taken twice daily (morning and evening).  \n \nTeysuno capsules are usually taken for 21 days followed by a 7 day rest period (when no capsules are \ntaken). This 28 day period is one treatment cycle.  The cycles are repeated. \n \nTeysuno will be given with another anti-cancer medicine called cisplatin. Cisplatin will be stopped \nafter 6 treatment cycles. Teysuno can be continued after stopping cisplatin. \n \nIf you take more Teysuno than you should \nIf you take more capsules than you should, contact your doctor immediately.   \n \nIf you forget to take Teysuno  \nDo not take the missed dose at all and do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \nInstead, continue your regular dosing schedule and check with your doctor. \n \nIf you stop taking Teysuno \nThere are no side effects caused by stopping treatment with Teysuno. In case you are using blood \nthinning or anti-seizure medicines, stopping Teysuno might require that your doctor adjusts the dose \nof your medicines.   \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.  \n \n \n4.

If you have DPD deficiency and take Teysuno, you are \nat an increased risk of severe side effects (listed under section 4 Possible side effects). It is \nrecommended to test you for DPD deficiency before start of treatment. If you have no activity of the \nenzyme you should not take Teysuno.
