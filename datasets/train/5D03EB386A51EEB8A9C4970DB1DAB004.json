PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nProlonged release suspension for injection.\nThe suspension is white to off-white. The suspension is pH neutral (approximately 7.0).\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is indicated for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in \nadult patients stabilised with paliperidone or risperidone.\n\nIn selected adult patients with schizophrenia and previous responsiveness to oral paliperidone or \nrisperidone, Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International may be used without prior stabilisation with oral \ntreatment if psychotic symptoms are mild to moderate and a long-acting injectable treatment is \nneeded.\n\n\n\n3\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nRecommended initiation of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is with a dose of 150 mg on \ntreatment day 1 and 100 mg one week later (day 8), both administered in the deltoid muscle in order to \nattain therapeutic concentrations rapidly (see section 5.2). The third dose should be administered one \nmonth after the second initiation dose. The recommended monthly maintenance dose is 75 mg; some \npatients may benefit from lower or higher doses within the recommended range of 25 to 150 mg based \non individual patient tolerability and/or efficacy. Patients who are overweight or obese may require \ndoses in the upper range (see section 5.2). Following the second initiation dose, monthly maintenance \ndoses can be administered in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle.\n\nAdjustment of the maintenance dose may be made monthly. When making dose adjustments, the \nprolonged release characteristics of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International should be considered (see \nsection 5.2), as the full effect of maintenance doses may not be evident for several months.\n\nSwitching from oral prolonged release paliperidone or oral risperidone to Paliperidone Janssen-\nCilag International\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International should be initiated as described at the beginning of \nsection 4.2 above. During monthly maintenance treatment with Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational, patients previously stabilised on different doses of paliperidone prolonged release tablets \ncan attain similar paliperidone steady-state exposure by injection. The Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational maintenance doses needed to attain similar steady-state exposure are shown as follows:\n\nDoses of paliperidone prolonged release tablets and Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International\nneeded to attain similar steady-state paliperidone exposure during maintenance treatment\n\nPrevious paliperidone\nprolonged release tablet dose\n\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International\ninjection\n\n3 mg daily 25-50 mg monthly\n6 mg daily 75 mg monthly\n9 mg daily 100 mg monthly\n12 mg daily 150 mg monthly\n\nPrevious oral paliperidone or oral risperidone can be discontinued at the time of initiation of treatment \nwith Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International. Some patients may benefit from gradual withdrawal.\nSome patients switching from higher paliperidone oral doses (e.g., 9-12 mg daily) to gluteal injections \nwith Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International may have lower plasma exposure during the first \n6 months after the switch. Therefore, alternatively, it could be considered to give deltoid injections for \nthe first 6 months.\n\nSwitching from risperidone long acting injection to Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International\nWhen switching patients from risperidone long acting injection, initiate Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational therapy in place of the next scheduled injection. Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International\nshould then be continued at monthly intervals. The one-week initiation dosing regimen including the \nintramuscular injections (day 1 and 8, respectively) as described in section 4.2 above is not required.\nPatients previously stabilised on different doses of risperidone long acting injection can attain similar \npaliperidone steady-state exposure during maintenance treatment with Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational monthly doses according to the following:\n\nDoses of risperidone long acting injection and Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International\nneeded to attain similar paliperidone exposure at steady-state\n\nPrevious risperidone long acting injection dose\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International\n\ninjection\n25 mg every 2 weeks 50 mg monthly\n\n37.5 mg every 2 weeks 75 mg monthly\n50 mg every 2 weeks 100 mg monthly\n\n\n\n4\n\nDiscontinuation of antipsychotic medicinal products should be made in accordance with appropriate \nprescribing information. If Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is discontinued, its prolonged\nrelease characteristics must be considered. The need for continuing existing extrapyramidal symptoms \n(EPS) medicine should be re-evaluated periodically.\n\nMissed doses\n\nAvoiding missed doses\nIt is recommended that the second initiation dose of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International be given \none week after the first dose. To avoid a missed dose, patients may be given the second dose 4 days \nbefore or after the one-week (day 8) time point. Similarly, the third and subsequent injections after the \ninitiation regimen are recommended to be given monthly. To avoid a missed monthly dose, patients \nmay be given the injection up to 7 days before or after the monthly time point.\n\nIf the target date for the second Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International injection (day 8 \u00b1 4 days) is \nmissed, the recommended reinitiation depends on the length of time which has elapsed since the \npatient's first injection.\n\nMissed second initiation dose (< 4 weeks from first injection)\nIf less than 4 weeks have elapsed since the first injection, then the patient should be administered the \nsecond injection of 100 mg in the deltoid muscle as soon as possible. A third Paliperidone \nJanssen-Cilag International injection of 75 mg in either the deltoid or gluteal muscles should be \nadministered 5 weeks after the first injection (regardless of the timing of the second injection). The \nnormal monthly cycle of injections in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle of 25 mg to 150 mg based on \nindividual patient tolerability and/or efficacy should be followed thereafter.\n\nMissed second initiation dose (4-7 weeks from first injection)\nIf 4 to 7 weeks have elapsed since the first injection of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International, \nresume dosing with two injections of 100 mg in the following manner:\n1. a deltoid injection as soon as possible\n2. another deltoid injection one week later\n3. resumption of the normal monthly cycle of injections in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle of \n\n25 mg to 150 mg based on individual patient tolerability and/or efficacy.\n\nMissed second initiation dose (> 7 weeks from first injection)\nIf more than 7 weeks have elapsed since the first injection of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International, \ninitiate dosing as described for the initial recommended initiation of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational above.\n\nMissed monthly maintenance dose (1 month to 6 weeks)\nAfter initiation, the recommended injection cycle of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is \nmonthly. If less than 6 weeks have elapsed since the last injection, then the previously stabilised dose \nshould be administered as soon as possible, followed by injections at monthly intervals.\n\nMissed monthly maintenance dose (> 6 weeks to 6 months)\nIf more than 6 weeks have elapsed since the last injection of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International,\nthe recommendation is as follows:\n\nFor patients stabilised with doses of 25 to 100 mg\n1. a deltoid injection as soon as possible at the same dose the patient was previously stabilised on\n2. another deltoid injection (same dose) one week later (day 8)\n3. resumption of the normal monthly cycle of injections in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle of \n\n25 mg to 150 mg based on individual patient tolerability and/or efficacy.\n\nFor patients stabilised with 150 mg\n1. a deltoid injection as soon as possible at the 100 mg dose\n\n\n\n5\n\n2. another deltoid injection one week later (day 8) at the 100 mg dose\n3. resumption of the normal monthly cycle of injections in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle of \n\n25 mg to 150 mg based on individual patient tolerability and/or efficacy.\n\nMissed monthly maintenance dose (> 6 months)\nIf more than 6 months have elapsed since the last injection of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational, initiate dosing as described for the initial recommended initiation of Paliperidone \nJanssen-Cilag International above.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nEfficacy and safety in elderly > 65 years have not been established.\n\nIn general, recommended dosing of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International for elderly patients with \nnormal renal function is the same as for younger adult patients with normal renal function. However, \nbecause elderly patients may have diminished renal function, dose adjustment may be necessary (see \nRenal impairment below for dosing recommendations in patients with renal impairment).\n\nRenal impairment\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International has not been systematically studied in patients with renal \nimpairment (see section 5.2). For patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance \u2265 50 to\n< 80 mL/min), recommended initiation of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is with a dose of \n100 mg on treatment day 1 and 75 mg one week later, both administered in the deltoid muscle. The \nrecommended monthly maintenance dose is 50 mg with a range of 25 to 100 mg based on patient \ntolerability and/or efficacy.\n\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min) (see section 4.4).\n\nHepatic impairment\nBased on experience with oral paliperidone, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or \nmoderate hepatic impairment. As paliperidone has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment, caution is recommended in such patients (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International in children and adolescents \n< 18 years of age have not been established. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is intended for intramuscular use only. It must not be \nadministered by any other route. It should be injected slowly, deep into the deltoid or gluteal muscle. \nEach injection should be administered by a health care professional. Administration should be in a \nsingle injection. The dose should not be given in divided injections.\n\nThe day 1 and day 8 initiation doses must each be administered in the deltoid muscle in order to attain \ntherapeutic concentrations rapidly (see section 5.2). Following the second initiation dose, monthly \nmaintenance doses can be administered in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle. A switch from gluteal \nto deltoid (and vice versa) should be considered in the event of injection site pain if the injection site \ndiscomfort is not well tolerated (see section 4.8). It is also recommended to alternate between left and\nright sides (see below).\n\nFor instructions for use and handling of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International, see package leaflet \n(information intended for medical or healthcare professionals).\n\n\n\n6\n\nDeltoid muscle administration\nThe recommended needle size for initial and maintenance administration of Paliperidone \nJanssen-Cilag International into the deltoid muscle is determined by the patient\u2019s weight. For those \n\u2265 90 kg, the 1\u00bd inch, 22 gauge needle (38.1 mm x 0.72 mm) is recommended. For those < 90 kg, the \n1-inch, 23 gauge needle (25.4 mm x 0.64 mm) is recommended. Deltoid injections should be \nalternated between the two deltoid muscles.\n\nGluteal muscle administration\nThe recommended needle size for maintenance administration of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational into the gluteal muscle is the 1\u00bd-inch, 22 gauge needle (38.1 mm x 0.72 mm). \nAdministration should be made into the upper-outer quadrant of the gluteal area. Gluteal injections \nshould be alternated between the two gluteal muscles.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to risperidone or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nUse in patients who are in an acutely agitated or severely psychotic state\n\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International should not be used to manage acutely agitated or severely \npsychotic states when immediate symptom control is warranted.\n\nQT interval\n\nCaution should be exercised when paliperidone is prescribed in patients with known cardiovascular \ndisease or family history of QT prolongation, and in concomitant use with other medicinal products\nthought to prolong the QT interval.\n\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome\n\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), characterised by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic \ninstability, altered consciousness, and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase levels has been reported \nto occur with paliperidone. Additional clinical signs may include myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and \nacute renal failure. If a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS, paliperidone should be \ndiscontinued.\n\nTardive dyskinesia/extrapyramidal symptoms\n\nMedicinal products with dopamine receptor antagonistic properties have been associated with the \ninduction of tardive dyskinesia characterised by rhythmical, involuntary movements, predominantly of \nthe tongue and/or face. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear, the discontinuation of all \nantipsychotics, including paliperidone, should be considered.\n\nCaution is warranted in patients receiving both, psychostimulants (e.g., methylphenidate) and \npaliperidone concomitantly, as extrapyramidal symptoms could emerge when adjusting one or both\nmedications. Gradual withdrawal of stimulant treatment is recommended (see section 4.5).\n\nLeucopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis\n\nEvents of leucopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported with Paliperidone \nJanssen-Cilag International. Agranulocytosis has been reported very rarely (< 1/10,000 patients) \nduring post-marketing surveillance. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low white blood \ncell count (WBC) or a drug-induced leucopenia/neutropenia should be monitored during the first few \nmonths of therapy and discontinuation of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International should be \nconsidered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative \n\n\n\n7\n\nfactors. Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other \nsymptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with \nsevere neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1 x 109/L) should discontinue Paliperidone \nJanssen-Cilag International and have their WBC followed until recovery.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\n\nAnaphylactic reactions in patients who have previously tolerated oral risperidone or oral paliperidone \nhave been rarely reported during post-marketing experience (see sections 4.1 and 4.8).\n\nIf hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International; initiate \ngeneral supportive measures as clinically appropriate and monitor the patient until signs and \nsymptoms resolve (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).\n\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus\n\nHyperglycaemia, diabetes mellitus, and exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes including diabetic coma \nand ketoacidosis, have been reported during treatment with paliperidone. Appropriate clinical \nmonitoring is advisable in accordance with utilised antipsychotic guidelines. Patients treated with \nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such \nas polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus should be \nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.\n\nWeight gain\n\nSignificant weight gain has been reported with Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International use. Weight \nshould be monitored regularly.\n\nUse in patients with prolactin-dependent tumours\n\nTissue culture studies suggest that cell growth in human breast tumours may be stimulated by \nprolactin. Although no clear association with the administration of antipsychotics has so far been \ndemonstrated in clinical and epidemiological studies, caution is recommended in patients with relevant \nmedical history. Paliperidone should be used with caution in patients with a pre-existing tumour that \nmay be prolactin-dependent.\n\nOrthostatic hypotension\n\nPaliperidone may induce orthostatic hypotension in some patients based on its alpha-blocking activity.\nBased on pooled data from the three placebo-controlled, 6-week, fixed-dose trials with oral \npaliperidone prolonged release tablets (3, 6, 9, and 12 mg), orthostatic hypotension was reported by \n2.5% of subjects treated with oral paliperidone compared with 0.8% of subjects treated with placebo. \nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International should be used with caution in patients with known \ncardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, myocardial infarction or ischaemia, conduction \nabnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions that predispose the patient to hypotension (e.g. \ndehydration and hypovolemia).\n\nSeizures\n\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International should be used cautiously in patients with a history of \nseizures or other conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nThe plasma concentrations of paliperidone are increased in patients with renal impairment and \ntherefore, dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment. Paliperidone \n\n\n\n8\n\nJanssen-Cilag International is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nNo data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). Caution is \nrecommended if paliperidone is used in such patients.\n\nElderly patients with dementia\n\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International has not been studied in elderly patients with dementia. \nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International should be used with caution in elderly patients with dementia \nwith risk factors for stroke.\n\nThe experience from risperidone cited below is considered valid also for paliperidone.\n\nOverall mortality\nIn a meta-analysis of 17 controlled clinical trials, elderly patients with dementia treated with other \natypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, and quetiapine had an \nincreased risk of mortality compared to placebo. Among those treated with risperidone, the mortality \nwas 4% compared with 3.1% for placebo.\n\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions\nAn approximately 3-fold increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse reactions has been seen in \nrandomised placebo-controlled clinical trials in the dementia population with some atypical \nantipsychotics, including risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine. The mechanism for this increased \nrisk is not known.\n\nParkinson\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies\n\nPhysicians should weigh the risks versus the benefits when prescribing Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational to patients with Parkinson\u2019s Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) since both \ngroups may be at increased risk of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome as well as having an increased \nsensitivity to antipsychotics. Manifestation of this increased sensitivity can include confusion, \nobtundation, postural instability with frequent falls, in addition to extrapyramidal symptoms.\n\nPriapism\n\nAntipsychotic medicinal products (including risperidone) with alpha-adrenergic blocking effects have \nbeen reported to induce priapism. During post-marketing surveillance, priapism has also been reported \nwith oral paliperidone, which is the active metabolite of risperidone. Patients should be informed to \nseek urgent medical care in case that priapism has not been resolved within 4 hours.\n\nBody temperature regulation\n\nDisruption of the body\u2019s ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic \nmedicinal products. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational to patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in \ncore body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant \nmedicinal products with anticholinergic activity or being subject to dehydration.\n\nVenous thromboembolism\n\nCases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with antipsychotic medicinal products. \nSince patients treated with antipsychotics often present with acquired risk factors for VTE, all possible \nrisk factors for VTE should be identified before and during treatment with Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational and preventative measures undertaken.\n\n\n\n9\n\nAntiemetic effect\n\nAn antiemetic effect was observed in preclinical studies with paliperidone. This effect, if it occurs in\nhumans, may mask the signs and symptoms of overdosage with certain medicinal products or of \nconditions such as intestinal obstruction, Reye\u2019s syndrome and brain tumour.\n\nAdministration\n\nCare must be taken to avoid inadvertent injection of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International into a \nblood vessel.\n\nIntraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome\n\nIntraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in patients \ntreated with medicinal products with alpha 1a-adrenergic antagonist effect, such as Paliperidone \nJanssen-Cilag International (see section 4.8).\n\nIFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. Current or past use of \nmedicinal products with alpha 1a-adrenergic antagonist effect should be made known to the \nophthalmic surgeon in advance of surgery. The potential benefit of stopping alpha 1 blocking therapy \nprior to cataract surgery has not been established and must be weighed against the risk of stopping the \nantipsychotic therapy.\n\nExcipients\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially \nsodium-free.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nCaution is advised when prescribing Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International with medicinal products\nknown to prolong the QT interval, e.g. class IA antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, disopyramide) and\nclass III antiarrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol), some antihistaminics, some other antipsychotics \nand some antimalarials (e.g. mefloquine). This list is indicative and not exhaustive.\n\nPotential for Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International to affect other medicines\n\nPaliperidone is not expected to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with medicinal \nproducts that are metabolised by cytochrome P-450 isozymes.\n\nGiven the primary central nervous system (CNS) effects of paliperidone (see section 4.8), Paliperidone \nJanssen-Cilag International should be used with caution in combination with other centrally acting \nmedicinal products, e.g., anxiolytics, most antipsychotics, hypnotics, opiates, etc. or alcohol.\n\nPaliperidone may antagonise the effect of levodopa and other dopamine agonists. If this combination \nis deemed necessary, particularly in end-stage Parkinson\u2019s disease, the lowest effective dose of each \ntreatment should be prescribed.\n\nBecause of its potential for inducing orthostatic hypotension (see section 4.4), an additive effect may \nbe observed when Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is administered with other therapeutic \nagents that have this potential, e.g., other antipsychotics, tricyclics.\n\nCaution is advised if paliperidone is combined with other medicinal products known to lower the \nseizure threshold (i.e., phenothiazines or butyrophenones, tricyclics or SSRIs, tramadol, mefloquine, \netc.).\n\n\n\n10\n\nCo-administration of oral paliperidone prolonged release tablets at steady-state (12 mg once daily) \nwith divalproex sodium prolonged release tablets (500 mg to 2,000 mg once daily) did not affect the \nsteady-state pharmacokinetics of valproate.\n\nNo interaction study between Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International and lithium has been \nperformed, however, a pharmacokinetic interaction is not likely to occur.\n\nPotential for other medicines to affect Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International\n\nIn vitro studies indicate that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 may be minimally involved in paliperidone \nmetabolism, but there are no indications in vitro nor in vivo that these isozymes play a significant role \nin the metabolism of paliperidone. Concomitant administration of oral paliperidone with paroxetine, a \npotent CYP2D6 inhibitor, showed no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of \npaliperidone.\n\nCo-administration of oral paliperidone prolonged release once daily with carbamazepine 200 mg twice \ndaily caused a decrease of approximately 37% in the mean steady-state Cmax and AUC of paliperidone. \nThis decrease is caused, to a substantial degree, by a 35% increase in renal clearance of paliperidone \nlikely as a result of induction of renal P-gp by carbamazepine. A minor decrease in the amount of \nactive substance excreted unchanged in the urine suggests that there was little effect on the CYP \nmetabolism or bioavailability of paliperidone during carbamazepine co-administration. Larger \ndecreases in plasma concentrations of paliperidone could occur with higher doses of carbamazepine. \nOn initiation of carbamazepine, the dose of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International should be \nre-evaluated and increased if necessary. Conversely, on discontinuation of carbamazepine, the dose of \nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International should be re-evaluated and decreased if necessary.\n\nCo-administration of a single dose of an oral paliperidone prolonged release tablet 12 mg with \ndivalproex sodium prolonged release tablets (two 500 mg tablets once daily) resulted in an increase of\napproximately 50% in the Cmax and AUC of paliperidone, likely as a result of increased oral \nabsorption. Since no effect on the systemic clearance was observed, a clinically significant interaction \nwould not be expected between divalproex sodium prolonged release tablets and Paliperidone \nJanssen-Cilag International intramuscular injection. This interaction has not been studied with \nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International.\n\nConcomitant use of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International with risperidone or with oral \npaliperidone\n\nSince paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone, caution should be exercised when \nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is co-administered with risperidone or with oral paliperidone \nfor extended periods of time. Safety data involving concomitant use of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational with other antipsychotics is limited.\n\nConcomitant use of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International with psychostimulants\n\nThe combined use of psychostimulants (e.g., methylphenidate) with paliperidone can lead to \nextrapyramidal symptoms upon change of either or both treatments (see section 4.4).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of paliperidone during pregnancy. Intramuscularly injected \npaliperidone palmitate and orally administered paliperidone were not teratogenic in animal studies, but \nother types of reproductive toxicity were seen (see section 5.3). Neonates exposed to paliperidone\nduring the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or \nwithdrawal symptoms that may vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been \nreports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding \n\n\n\n11\n\ndisorder. Consequently, newborns should be monitored carefully. Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nPaliperidone is excreted in the breast milk to such an extent that effects on the breast-fed infant are \nlikely if therapeutic doses are administered to breast-feeding women. Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational should not be used while breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\n\nThere were no relevant effects observed in the non-clinical studies.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPaliperidone can have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to \npotential nervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred (see \nsection 4.8). Therefore, patients should be advised not to drive or operate machines until their \nindividual susceptibility to Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is known.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe adverse drug reactions (ADRs) most frequently reported in clinical trials were insomnia, \nheadache, anxiety, upper respiratory tract infection, injection site reaction, parkinsonism, weight \nincreased, akathisia, agitation, sedation/somnolence, nausea, constipation, dizziness, musculoskeletal \npain, tachycardia, tremor, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, fatigue, and dystonia. Of these, \nakathisia and sedation/somnolence appeared to be dose-related.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe following are all ADRs that were reported with paliperidone by frequency category estimated \nfrom paliperidone palmitate clinical trials.

as \u201cnot known\u201d because they were not observed in paliperidone \npalmitate clinical trials. They were either derived from spontaneous post-marketing reports and frequency cannot be\ndetermined, or they were derived from risperidone (any formulation) or oral paliperidone clinical trials data and/or \npost-marketing reports.\n\nb Refer to \u2018Hyperprolactinaemia\u2019 below.\nc Refer to \u2018Extrapyramidal symptoms\u2019 below.\nd In placebo-controlled trials, diabetes mellitus was reported in 0.32% in Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International-treated \n\nsubjects compared to a rate of 0.39% in placebo group. Overall incidence from all clinical trials was 0.65% in all paliperidone \npalmitate-treated subjects\n\ne Insomnia includes: initial insomnia, middle insomnia; Convulsion includes: grand mal convulsion; Oedema includes:\ngeneralised oedema, oedema peripheral, pitting oedema. Menstrual disorder includes: menstruation delayed, menstruation \nirregular, oligomenorrhoea\n\nUndesirable effects noted with risperidone formulations\n\nPaliperidone is the active metabolite of risperidone, therefore, the adverse reaction profiles of these \ncompounds (including both the oral and injectable formulations) are relevant to one another.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nAnaphylactic reaction\nRarely, cases of anaphylactic reaction after injection with Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International\nhave been reported during post-marketing experience in patients who have previously tolerated oral \nrisperidone or oral paliperidone (see section 4.4).\n\nInjection site reactions\nThe most commonly reported injection site related adverse reaction was pain. The majority of these \nreactions were reported to be of mild to moderate severity. Subject evaluations of injection site pain \nbased on a visual analogue scale tended to lessen in frequency and intensity over time in all Phase 2 \nand 3 studies with Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International. Injections into the deltoid were perceived \nas slightly more painful than corresponding gluteal injections. Other injection site reactions were \nmostly mild in intensity and included induration (common), pruritus (uncommon) and nodules (rare).\n\n\n\n14\n\nExtrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)\nEPS included a pooled analysis of the following terms: parkinsonism (includes salivary \nhypersecretion, musculoskeletal stiffness, parkinsonism, drooling, cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, \nhypokinesia, masked facies, muscle tightness, akinesia, nuchal rigidity, muscle rigidity, parkinsonian \ngait, glabellar reflex abnormal, and parkinsonian rest tremor), akathisia (includes akathisia, \nrestlessness, hyperkinesia, and restless leg syndrome), dyskinesia (dyskinesia, muscle twitching, \nchoreoathetosis, athetosis, and myoclonus), dystonia (includes dystonia, hypertonia, torticollis, muscle \ncontractions involuntary, muscle contracture, blepharospasm, oculogyration, tongue paralysis, facial \nspasm, laryngospasm, myotonia, opisthotonus, oropharyngeal spasm, pleurothotonus, tongue spasm, \nand trismus), and tremor. It should be noted that a broader spectrum of symptoms are included that do \nnot necessarily have an extrapyramidal origin.\n\nWeight gain\nIn the 13-week study involving the 150 mg initiation dosing, the proportion of subjects with an \nabnormal weight increase \u2265 7% showed a dose-related trend, with a 5% incidence rate in the placebo \ngroup compared with rates of 6%, 8% and 13% in the Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International 25 mg, \n100 mg, and 150 mg groups, respectively.\n\nDuring the 33-week open-label transition/maintenance period of the long-term recurrence prevention \ntrial, 12% of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International-treated subjects met this criterion (weight gain \nof \u2265 7% from double-blind phase to endpoint); the mean (SD) weight change from open-label baseline \nwas + 0.7 (4.79) kg.\n\nHyperprolactinaemia\nIn clinical trials, median increases in serum prolactin were observed in subjects of both genders who \nreceived Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International. Adverse reactions that may suggest increase in \nprolactin levels (e.g., amenorrhoea, galactorrhoea, menstrual disturbances, gynaecomastia) were \nreported overall in < 1% of subjects.\n\nClass effects\n\nQT prolongation, ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), sudden \nunexplained death, cardiac arrest, and Torsade de pointes may occur with antipsychotics.\n\nCases of venous thromboembolism, including cases of pulmonary embolism and cases of deep vein \nthrombosis, have been reported with antipsychotic medicinal products (frequency unknown).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medical product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\n\nIn general, expected signs and symptoms are those resulting from an exaggeration of paliperidone\u2019s \nknown pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness and sedation, tachycardia and hypotension, QT \nprolongation, and extrapyramidal symptoms. Torsade de pointes and ventricular fibrillation have been \nreported in a patient in the setting of overdose with oral paliperidone. In the case of acute overdose, \nthe possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n15\n\nManagement\n\nConsideration should be given to the prolonged release nature of the medicinal product and the long \nelimination half-life of paliperidone when assessing treatment needs and recovery. There is no specific \nantidote to paliperidone. General supportive measures should be employed. Establish and maintain a \nclear airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.\n\nCardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous\nelectrocardiographic monitoring for possible arrhythmias. Hypotension and circulatory collapse should \nbe treated with appropriate measures such as intravenous fluid and/or sympathomimetic agents. In \ncase of severe extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic agents should be administered. Close \nsupervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, other antipsychotics. ATC code: N05AX13\n\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International contains a racemic mixture of (+)- and (-)-paliperidone.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nPaliperidone is a selective blocking agent of monoamine effects, whose pharmacological properties \nare different from that of traditional neuroleptics. Paliperidone binds strongly to serotonergic 5-HT2-\nand dopaminergic D2-receptors. Paliperidone also blocks alpha 1-adrenergic receptors and slightly \nless, H1-histaminergic and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. The pharmacological activity of the (+)- and \n(-)-paliperidone enantiomers are qualitatively and quantitatively similar.\n\nPaliperidone is not bound to cholinergic receptors. Even though paliperidone is a strong \nD2-antagonist, which is believed to relieve the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, it causes less \ncatalepsy and decreases motor functions less than traditional neuroleptics. Dominating central \nserotonin antagonism may reduce the tendency of paliperidone to cause extrapyramidal side effects.\n\nClinical efficacy\n\nAcute treatment of schizophrenia\nThe efficacy of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International in the acute treatment of schizophrenia was \nestablished in four short-term (one 9-week and three 13-week) double-blind, randomised, \nplacebo-controlled, fixed-dose studies of acutely relapsed adult inpatients who met DSM-IV criteria \nfor schizophrenia. The fixed doses of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International in these studies were \ngiven on days 1, 8, and 36 in the 9-week study, and additionally on day 64 of the 13-week studies. No \nadditional oral antipsychotic supplementation was needed during the acute treatment of schizophrenia \nwith Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International. The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as a \ndecrease in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores as shown in the table below. \nThe PANSS is a validated multi-item inventory composed of five factors to evaluate positive \nsymptoms, negative symptoms, disorganised thoughts, uncontrolled hostility/excitement and \nanxiety/depression. Functioning was evaluated using the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale. \nThe PSP is a validated clinician rated scale that measures personal and social functioning in four \ndomains: socially useful activities (work and study), personal and social relationships, self-care and \ndisturbing and aggressive behaviours.\n\nIn a 13-week study (n = 636) comparing three fixed doses of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International\n(initial deltoid injection of 150 mg followed by 3 gluteal or deltoid doses of either 25 mg/4 weeks, \n100 mg/4 weeks or 150 mg/4 weeks) to placebo, all three doses of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational were superior to placebo in improving the PANSS total score. In this study, both the \n\n\n\n16\n\n100 mg/4 weeks and 150 mg /4 weeks, but not the 25 mg/4 weeks, treatment groups demonstrated \nstatistical superiority to placebo for the PSP score. These results support efficacy across the entire \nduration of treatment and improvement in PANSS and was observed as early as day 4 with significant \nseparation from placebo in the 25 mg and 150 mg Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International groups by \nday 8.\n\nThe results of the other studies yielded statistically significant results in favour of Paliperidone \nJanssen-Cilag International, except for the 50 mg dose in one study (see table below).\n\nPositive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) Total Score - Change From Baseline to \nEnd Point- LOCF for Studies R092670-SCH-201, R092670-PSY-3003, R092670-PSY-3004 and \n\nR092670-PSY-3007: Primary Efficacy Analysis Set\nPlacebo 25 mg 50 mg 100 mg 150 mg\n\nR092670-PSY-3007*\nMean baseline (SD)\nMean change (SD)\nP-value (vs. Placebo)\n\nn = 160\n86.8 (10.31)\n-2.9 (19.26)\n\n--\n\nn = 155\n86.9 (11.99)\n-8.0 (19.90)\n\n0.034\n--\n\nn = 161\n86.2 (10.77)\n-11.6 (17.63)\n\n< 0.001\n\nn = 160\n88.4 (11.70)\n-13.2 (18.48)\n\n< 0.001\n\nR092670-PSY-3003\nMean baseline (SD)\nMean change (SD)\nP-value (vs. Placebo)\n\nn = 132\n92.4 (12.55)\n-4.1 (21.01)\n\n--\n--\n\nn = 93\n89.9 (10.78)\n-7.9 (18.71)\n\n0.193\n\nn = 94\n90.1 (11.66)\n-11.0 (19.06)\n\n0.019\n\nn = 30\n92.2 (11.72)\n-5.5 (19.78)\n\n--\n\nR092670-PSY-3004\nMean baseline (SD)\nMean change (SD)\nP-value (vs. Placebo)\n\nn = 125\n90.7 (12.22)\n-7.0 (20.07)\n\n--\n\nn = 129\n90.7 (12.25)\n-13.6 (21.45)\n\n0.015\n\nn = 128\n91.2 (12.02)\n-13.2 (20.14)\n\n0.017\n\nn = 131\n90.8 (11.70)\n-16.1 (20.36)\n\n< 0.001\n--\n\nR092670-SCH-201\nMean baseline (SD)\nMean change (SD)\nP-value (vs. Placebo)\n\nn = 66\n87.8 (13.90)\n6.2 (18.25)\n\n--\n--\n\nn = 63\n88.0 (12.39)\n-5.2 (21.52)\n\n0.001\n\nn = 68\n85.2 (11.09)\n-7.8 (19.40)\n\n< 0.0001\n--\n\n* For Study R092670-PSY-3007 an initiation dose of 150 mg was given to all subjects in the Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational treatment groups on day 1 followed by the assigned dose afterwards.\n\nNote: Negative change in score indicates improvement.\n\nMaintaining symptom control and delaying relapse of schizophrenia\nThe efficacy of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International in maintaining symptomatic control and \ndelaying relapse of schizophrenia was established in a longer-term double-blind, placebo-controlled, \nflexible-dose study involving 849 non-elderly adult subjects who met DSM-IV criteria for \nschizophrenia. This study included a 33-week open-label acute treatment and stabilisation phase, a \nrandomised, double-blind placebo-controlled phase to observe for relapse, and a 52-week open-label \nextension period. In this study, doses of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International included 25, 50, 75, \nand 100 mg administered monthly; the 75 mg dose was allowed only in the 52-week open-label \nextension. Subjects initially received flexible doses (25-100 mg) of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational during a 9-week transition period, followed by a 24-week maintenance period, where \nsubjects were required to have a PANSS score of \u2264 75. Dosing adjustments were only allowed in the \nfirst 12 weeks of the maintenance period. A total of 410 stabilised patients were randomised to either \nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International (median duration 171 days [range 1 day to 407 days]) or to \nplacebo (median duration 105 days [range 8 days to 441 days]) until they experienced a relapse of \nschizophrenia symptoms in the variable length double-blind phase. The trial was stopped early for \nefficacy reasons as a significantly longer time to relapse (p < 0.0001, Figure 1) was seen in patients \ntreated with Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International compared to placebo (hazard ratio = 4.32; 95% \nCI: 2.4-7.7).\n\n\n\n17\n\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier Plot of Time to Relapse \u2013 Interim Analysis (Intent-to-Treat Interim \nAnalysis Set)\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International in all subsets of the paediatric population in schizophrenia. \nSee section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption and distribution\n\nPaliperidone palmitate is the palmitate ester prodrug of paliperidone. Due to its extremely low water \nsolubility, paliperidone palmitate dissolves slowly after intramuscular injection before being \nhydrolysed to paliperidone and absorbed into the systemic circulation. Following a single \nintramuscular dose, the plasma concentrations of paliperidone gradually rise to reach maximum \nplasma concentrations at a median Tmax of 13 days. The release of the active substance starts as early \nas day 1 and lasts for at least 4 months.\n\nFollowing intramuscular injection of single doses (25-150 mg) in the deltoid muscle, on average, a \n28% higher Cmax was observed compared with injection in the gluteal muscle. The two initial deltoid \nintramuscular injections of 150 mg on day 1 and 100 mg on day 8 help attain therapeutic \nconcentrations rapidly. The release profile and dosing regimen of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational results in sustained therapeutic concentrations. The total exposure of paliperidone \nfollowing Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International administration was dose-proportional over a \n25-150 mg dose range, and less than dose-proportional for Cmax for doses exceeding 50 mg. The mean \nsteady-state peak:trough ratio for a Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International dose of 100 mg was 1.8 \nfollowing gluteal administration and 2.2 following deltoid administration. The median apparent \nhalf-life of paliperidone following Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International administration over the \ndose range of 25-150 mg ranged from 25-49 days.\n\n\n\n18\n\nThe absolute bioavailability of paliperidone palmitate following Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational administration is 100%.\n\nFollowing administration of paliperidone palmitate the (+) and (-) enantiomers of paliperidone \ninterconvert, reaching an AUC (+) to (-) ratio of approximately 1.6-1.8.\n\nThe plasma protein binding of racemic paliperidone is 74%.\n\nBiotransformation and elimination\n\nOne week following administration of a single oral dose of 1 mg immediate-release 14C-paliperidone, \n59% of the dose was excreted unchanged into urine, indicating that paliperidone is not extensively \nmetabolised in the liver. Approximately 80% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine \nand 11% in the faeces. Four metabolic pathways have been identified in vivo, none of which accounted \nfor more than 6.5% of the dose: dealkylation, hydroxylation, dehydrogenation, and benzisoxazole \nscission. Although in vitro studies suggested a role for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the metabolism of \npaliperidone, there is no evidence in vivo that these isozymes play a significant role in the metabolism \nof paliperidone. Population pharmacokinetics analyses indicated no discernible difference on the \napparent clearance of paliperidone after administration of oral paliperidone between extensive \nmetabolisers and poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 substrates. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes \nshowed that paliperidone does not substantially inhibit the metabolism of medicinal products\nmetabolised by cytochrome P450 isozymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8/9/10, CYP2D6, \nCYP2E1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5.\n\nIn vitro studies have shown that paliperidone is a P-gp substrate and a weak inhibitor of P-gp at high \nconcentrations. No in vivo data are available and the clinical relevance is unknown.\n\nLong acting paliperidone palmitate injection versus oral prolonged release paliperidone\n\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is designed to deliver paliperidone over a monthly period \nwhile prolonged release oral paliperidone is administered on a daily basis. The initiation regimen for \nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International (150 mg/100 mg in the deltoid muscle on day 1/day 8) was \ndesigned to rapidly attain steady-state paliperidone concentrations when initiating therapy without the \nuse of oral supplementation.\n\nIn general, overall initiation plasma levels with Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International were within \nthe exposure range observed with 6-12 mg prolonged release oral paliperidone. The use of the \nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International initiation regimen allowed patients to stay in this exposure \nwindow of 6-12 mg prolonged release oral paliperidone even on trough pre-dose days (day 8 and \nday 36). Because of the difference in median pharmacokinetic profiles between the two medicinal\nproducts, caution should be exercised when making a direct comparison of their pharmacokinetic \nproperties.\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nPaliperidone is not extensively metabolised in the liver. Although Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational was not studied on patients with hepatic impairment, no dose adjustment is required in \npatients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. In a study with oral paliperidone in subjects with \nmoderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), the plasma concentrations of free paliperidone \nwere similar to those of healthy subjects. Paliperidone has not been studied in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nThe disposition of a single oral dose paliperidone 3 mg prolonged release tablet was studied in \nsubjects with varying degrees of renal function. Elimination of paliperidone decreased with decreasing \n\n\n\n19\n\nestimated creatinine clearance. Total clearance of paliperidone was reduced in subjects with impaired \nrenal function by 32% on average in mild (CrCl = 50 to < 80 mL/min), 64% in moderate (CrCl = 30 to \n< 50 mL/min), and 71% in severe (CrCl = 10 to < 30 mL/min) renal impairment, corresponding to an \naverage increase in exposure (AUCinf) of 1.5, 2.6, and 4.8 fold, respectively, compared to healthy \nsubjects. Based on a limited number of observations with Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International in \nsubjects with mild renal impairment and pharmacokinetic simulations, a reduced dose is recommended \n(see section 4.2).\n\nElderly\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetics analysis showed no evidence of age related pharmacokinetics \ndifferences.\n\nBody mass index (BMI)/body weight\n\nPharmacokinetic studies with paliperidone palmitate have shown somewhat lower (10-20%) plasma \nconcentrations of paliperidone in patients who are overweight or obese in comparison with normal\nweight patients (see section 4.2).\n\nRace\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetics analysis of data from studies with oral paliperidone revealed no evidence \nof race-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone following Paliperidone \nJanssen-Cilag International administration.\n\nGender\n\nNo clinically significant differences were observed between men and women.\n\nSmoking status\n\nBased on in vitro studies utilising human liver enzymes, paliperidone is not a substrate for CYP1A2; \nsmoking should, therefore, not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone. Effect of \nsmoking on the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone was not studied with Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational. A population pharmacokinetic analysis based on data with oral paliperidone prolonged \nrelease tablets showed a slightly lower exposure to paliperidone in smokers compared with \nnon-smokers. The difference is unlikely to be of clinical relevance.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nRepeat-dose toxicity studies of intramuscularly injected paliperidone palmitate (the 1-month \nformulation) and orally administered paliperidone in rat and dog showed mainly pharmacological \neffects, such as sedation and prolactin-mediated effects on mammary glands and genitals. In animals \ntreated with paliperidone palmitate an inflammatory reaction was seen at the intramuscular injection \nsite. Occasionally abscess formation occurred.\n\nIn rat reproduction studies with oral risperidone, which is extensively converted to paliperidone in rats \nand humans, adverse effects were seen on the birth weight and survival of the offspring. No \nembryotoxicity or malformations were observed following intramuscular administration of \npaliperidone palmitate to pregnant rats up to the highest dose (160 mg/kg/day) corresponding to \n4.1 times the exposure level in humans at the maximum recommended dose of 150 mg. Other \ndopamine antagonists, when administered to pregnant animals, have caused negative effects on \nlearning and motor development in the offspring.\n\nPaliperidone palmitate and paliperidone were not genotoxic. In oral carcinogenicity studies of \nrisperidone in rats and mice, increases in pituitary gland adenomas (mouse), endocrine pancreas \nadenomas (rat), and mammary gland adenomas (both species) were seen. The carcinogenic potential \n\n\n\n20\n\nof intramuscularly injected paliperidone palmitate was assessed in rats. There was a statistically \nsignificant increase in mammary gland adenocarcinomas in female rats at 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg/month. \nMale rats showed a statistically significant increase in mammary gland adenomas and carcinomas at \n30 and 60 mg/kg/month which is 1.2 and 2.2 times the exposure level at the maximum recommended \nhuman 150 mg dose. These tumours can be related to prolonged dopamine D2 antagonism and \nhyperprolactinemia. The relevance of these tumour findings in rodents in terms of human risk is \nunknown.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is indicated for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in \nadult patients stabilised with paliperidone or risperidone.\n\nIn selected adult patients with schizophrenia and previous responsiveness to oral paliperidone or \nrisperidone, Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International may be used without prior stabilisation with oral \ntreatment if psychotic symptoms are mild to moderate and a long-acting injectable treatment is \nneeded.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nRecommended initiation of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is with a dose of 150 mg on \ntreatment day 1 and 100 mg one week later (day 8), both administered in the deltoid muscle in order to \nattain therapeutic concentrations rapidly (see section 5.2). The third dose should be administered one \nmonth after the second initiation dose. The recommended monthly maintenance dose is 75 mg; some \npatients may benefit from lower or higher doses within the recommended range of 25 to 150 mg based \non individual patient tolerability and/or efficacy. Patients who are overweight or obese may require \ndoses in the upper range (see section 5.2). Following the second initiation dose, monthly maintenance \ndoses can be administered in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle.\n\nAdjustment of the maintenance dose may be made monthly. When making dose adjustments, the \nprolonged release characteristics of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International should be considered (see \nsection 5.2), as the full effect of maintenance doses may not be evident for several months.\n\nSwitching from oral prolonged release paliperidone or oral risperidone to Paliperidone Janssen-\nCilag International\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International should be initiated as described at the beginning of \nsection 4.2 above. During monthly maintenance treatment with Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational, patients previously stabilised on different doses of paliperidone prolonged release tablets \ncan attain similar paliperidone steady-state exposure by injection. The Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational maintenance doses needed to attain similar steady-state exposure are shown as follows:\n\n\n\n23\n\nDoses of paliperidone prolonged release tablets and Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International\nneeded to attain similar steady-state paliperidone exposure during maintenance treatment\n\nPrevious paliperidone\nprolonged release tablet dose\n\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International\ninjection\n\n3 mg daily 25-50 mg monthly\n6 mg daily 75 mg monthly\n9 mg daily 100 mg monthly\n12 mg daily 150 mg monthly\n\nPrevious oral paliperidone or oral risperidone can be discontinued at the time of initiation of treatment \nwith Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International. Some patients may benefit from gradual withdrawal.\nSome patients switching from higher paliperidone oral doses (e.g., 9-12 mg daily) to gluteal injections \nwith Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International may have lower plasma exposure during the first \n6 months after the switch. Therefore, alternatively, it could be considered to give deltoid injections for \nthe first 6 months.\n\nSwitching from risperidone long acting injection to Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International\nWhen switching patients from risperidone long acting injection, initiate Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational therapy in place of the next scheduled injection. Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International\nshould then be continued at monthly intervals. The one-week initiation dosing regimen including the \nintramuscular injections (day 1 and 8, respectively) as described in section 4.2 above is not required.\nPatients previously stabilised on different doses of risperidone long acting injection can attain similar\npaliperidone steady-state exposure during maintenance treatment with Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational monthly doses according to the following:\n\nDoses of risperidone long acting injection and Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International\nneeded to attain similar paliperidone exposure at steady-state\n\nPrevious risperidone long acting injection dose\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International\n\ninjection\n25 mg every 2 weeks 50 mg monthly\n\n37.5 mg every 2 weeks 75 mg monthly\n50 mg every 2 weeks 100 mg monthly\n\nDiscontinuation of antipsychotic medicinal products should be made in accordance with appropriate \nprescribing information. If Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is discontinued, its prolonged\nrelease characteristics must be considered. The need for continuing existing extrapyramidal symptoms \n(EPS) medicine should be re-evaluated periodically.\n\nMissed doses\n\nAvoiding missed doses\nIt is recommended that the second initiation dose of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International be given \none week after the first dose. To avoid a missed dose, patients may be given the second dose 4 days \nbefore or after the one-week (day 8) time point. Similarly, the third and subsequent injections after the \ninitiation regimen are recommended to be given monthly. To avoid a missed monthly dose, patients \nmay be given the injection up to 7 days before or after the monthly time point.\n\nIf the target date for the second Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International injection (day 8 \u00b1 4 days) is \nmissed, the recommended reinitiation depends on the length of time which has elapsed since the \npatient's first injection.\n\nMissed second initiation dose (< 4 weeks from first injection)\nIf less than 4 weeks have elapsed since the first injection, then the patient should be administered the \nsecond injection of 100 mg in the deltoid muscle as soon as possible. A third Paliperidone Janssen-\nCilag International injection of 75 mg in either the deltoid or gluteal muscles should be administered \n5 weeks after the first injection (regardless of the timing of the second injection). The normal monthly \n\n\n\n24\n\ncycle of injections in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle of 25 mg to 150 mg based on individual \npatient tolerability and/or efficacy should be followed thereafter.\n\nMissed second initiation dose (4-7 weeks from first injection)\nIf 4 to 7 weeks have elapsed since the first injection of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International, \nresume dosing with two injections of 100 mg in the following manner:\n1. a deltoid injection as soon as possible\n2. another deltoid injection one week later\n3. resumption of the normal monthly cycle of injections in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle of \n\n25 mg to 150 mg based on individual patient tolerability and/or efficacy.\n\nMissed second initiation dose (> 7 weeks from first injection)\nIf more than 7 weeks have elapsed since the first injection of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International, \ninitiate dosing as described for the initial recommended initiation of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational above.\n\nMissed monthly maintenance dose (1 month to 6 weeks)\nAfter initiation, the recommended injection cycle of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is \nmonthly. If less than 6 weeks have elapsed since the last injection, then the previously stabilised dose \nshould be administered as soon as possible, followed by injections at monthly intervals.\n\nMissed monthly maintenance dose (> 6 weeks to 6 months)\nIf more than 6 weeks have elapsed since the last injection of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International, \nthe recommendation is as follows:\n\nFor patients stabilised with doses of 25 to 100 mg\n1. a deltoid injection as soon as possible at the same dose the patient was previously stabilised on\n2. another deltoid injection (same dose) one week later (day 8)\n3. resumption of the normal monthly cycle of injections in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle of \n\n25 mg to 150 mg based on individual patient tolerability and/or efficacy.\n\nFor patients stabilised with 150 mg\n1. a deltoid injection as soon as possible at the 100 mg dose\n2. another deltoid injection one week later (day 8) at the 100 mg dose\n3. resumption of the normal monthly cycle of injections in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle of \n\n25 mg to 150 mg based on individual patient tolerability and/or efficacy.\n\nMissed monthly maintenance dose (> 6 months)\nIf more than 6 months have elapsed since the last injection of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational, initiate dosing as described for the initial recommended initiation of Paliperidone \nJanssen-Cilag International above.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nEfficacy and safety in elderly > 65 years have not been established.\n\nIn general, recommended dosing of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International for elderly patients with \nnormal renal function is the same as for younger adult patients with normal renal function. However, \nbecause elderly patients may have diminished renal function, dose adjustment may be necessary (see \nRenal impairment below for dosing recommendations in patients with renal impairment).\n\nRenal impairment\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International has not been systematically studied in patients with renal \nimpairment (see section 5.2). For patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance \u2265 50 to \n< 80 mL/min), recommended initiation of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is with a dose of \n100 mg on treatment day 1 and 75 mg one week later, both administered in the deltoid muscle. The \n\n\n\n25\n\nrecommended monthly maintenance dose is 50 mg with a range of 25 to 100 mg based on patient \ntolerability and/or efficacy.\n\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min) (see section 4.4).\n\nHepatic impairment\nBased on experience with oral paliperidone, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or \nmoderate hepatic impairment. As paliperidone has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment, caution is recommended in such patients (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International in children and adolescents \n< 18 years of age have not been established. No data are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is intended for intramuscular use only. It must not be \nadministered by any other route. It should be injected slowly, deep into the deltoid or gluteal muscle. \nEach injection should be administered by a health care professional. Administration should be in a \nsingle injection. The dose should not be given in divided injections.\n\nThe day 1 and day 8 initiation doses must each be administered in the deltoid muscle in order to attain \ntherapeutic concentrations rapidly (see section 5.2). Following the second initiation dose, monthly \nmaintenance doses can be administered in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle. A switch from gluteal \nto deltoid (and vice versa) should be considered in the event of injection site pain if the injection site \ndiscomfort is not well tolerated (see section 4.8). It is also recommended to alternate between left and \nright sides (see below).\n\nFor instructions for use and handling of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International, see package leaflet \n(information intended for medical or healthcare professionals).\n\nDeltoid muscle administration\nThe recommended needle size for initial and maintenance administration of Paliperidone Janssen-\nCilag International into the deltoid muscle is determined by the patient\u2019s weight. For those \u2265 90 kg, \nthe 1\u00bd inch, 22 gauge needle (38.1 mm x 0.72 mm) is recommended. For those < 90 kg, the 1-inch, \n23 gauge needle (25.4 mm x 0.64 mm) is recommended. Deltoid injections should be alternated \nbetween the two deltoid muscles.\n\nGluteal muscle administration\nThe recommended needle size for maintenance administration of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational into the gluteal muscle is the 1\u00bd-inch, 22 gauge needle (38.1 mm x 0.72 mm). \nAdministration should be made into the upper-outer quadrant of the gluteal area. Gluteal injections \nshould be alternated between the two gluteal muscles.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to risperidone or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nUse in patients who are in an acutely agitated or severely psychotic state\n\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International should not be used to manage acutely agitated or severely \npsychotic states when immediate symptom control is warranted.\n\n\n\n26\n\nQT interval\n\nCaution should be exercised when paliperidone is prescribed in patients with known cardiovascular \ndisease or family history of QT prolongation, and in concomitant use with other medicinal products \nthought to prolong the QT interval.\n\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome\n\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), characterised by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic \ninstability, altered consciousness, and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase levels has been reported \nto occur with paliperidone. Additional clinical signs may include myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and \nacute renal failure. If a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS, paliperidone should be \ndiscontinued.\n\nTardive dyskinesia/extrapyramidal symptoms\n\nMedicinal products with dopamine receptor antagonistic properties have been associated with the \ninduction of tardive dyskinesia characterised by rhythmical, involuntary movements, predominantly of \nthe tongue and/or face. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear, the discontinuation of all \nantipsychotics, including paliperidone, should be considered.\n\nCaution is warranted in patients receiving both, psychostimulants (e.g., methylphenidate) and \npaliperidone concomitantly, as extrapyramidal symptoms could emerge when adjusting one or both \nmedications. Gradual withdrawal of stimulant treatment is recommended (see section 4.5).\n\nLeucopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis\n\nEvents of leucopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported with Paliperidone Janssen-\nCilag International. Agranulocytosis has been reported very rarely (< 1/10,000 patients) during \npost-marketing surveillance. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low white blood cell \ncount (WBC) or a drug-induced leucopenia/neutropenia should be monitored during the first few \nmonths of therapy and discontinuation of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International should be \nconsidered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative \nfactors. Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other \nsymptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with \nsevere neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1 x 109/L) should discontinue Paliperidone Janssen-\nCilag International and have their WBC followed until recovery.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\n\nAnaphylactic reactions in patients who have previously tolerated oral risperidone or oral paliperidone \nhave been rarely reported during post-marketing experience (see sections 4.1 and 4.8).\n\nIf hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International; initiate\ngeneral supportive measures as clinically appropriate and monitor the patient until signs and \nsymptoms resolve (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).\n\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus\n\nHyperglycaemia, diabetes mellitus, and exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes including diabetic coma \nand ketoacidosis, have been reported during treatment with paliperidone. Appropriate clinical \nmonitoring is advisable in accordance with utilised antipsychotic guidelines. Patients treated with \nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such \nas polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus should be \nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.\n\n\n\n27\n\nWeight gain\n\nSignificant weight gain has been reported with Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International use. Weight \nshould be monitored regularly.\n\nUse in patients with prolactin-dependent tumours\n\nTissue culture studies suggest that cell growth in human breast tumours may be stimulated by \nprolactin. Although no clear association with the administration of antipsychotics has so far been \ndemonstrated in clinical and epidemiological studies, caution is recommended in patients with relevant \nmedical history. Paliperidone should be used with caution in patients with a pre-existing tumour that \nmay be prolactin-dependent.\n\nOrthostatic hypotension\n\nPaliperidone may induce orthostatic hypotension in some patients based on its alpha-blocking activity.\nBased on pooled data from the three placebo-controlled, 6-week, fixed-dose trials with oral \npaliperidone prolonged release tablets (3, 6, 9, and 12 mg), orthostatic hypotension was reported by \n2.5% of subjects treated with oral paliperidone compared with 0.8% of subjects treated with placebo. \nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International should be used with caution in patients with known \ncardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, myocardial infarction or ischaemia, conduction \nabnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions that predispose the patient to hypotension (e.g.,\ndehydration and hypovolemia).\n\nSeizures\n\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International should be used cautiously in patients with a history of \nseizures or other conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nThe plasma concentrations of paliperidone are increased in patients with renal impairment and \ntherefore, dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment. Paliperidone \nJanssen-Cilag International is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nNo data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). Caution is \nrecommended if paliperidone is used in such patients.\n\nElderly patients with dementia\n\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International has not been studied in elderly patients with dementia. \nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International should be used with caution in elderly patients with dementia \nwith risk factors for stroke.\n\nThe experience from risperidone cited below is considered valid also for paliperidone.\n\nOverall mortality\nIn a meta-analysis of 17 controlled clinical trials, elderly patients with dementia treated with other \natypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, and quetiapine had an \nincreased risk of mortality compared to placebo. Among those treated with risperidone, the mortality \nwas 4% compared with 3.1% for placebo.\n\n\n\n28\n\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions\nAn approximately 3-fold increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse reactions has been seen in \nrandomised placebo-controlled clinical trials in the dementia population with some atypical \nantipsychotics, including risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine. The mechanism for this increased \nrisk is not known.\n\nParkinson\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies\n\nPhysicians should weigh the risks versus the benefits when prescribing Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational to patients with Parkinson\u2019s Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) since both \ngroups may be at increased risk of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome as well as having an increased \nsensitivity to antipsychotics. Manifestation of this increased sensitivity can include confusion, \nobtundation, postural instability with frequent falls, in addition to extrapyramidal symptoms.\n\nPriapism\n\nAntipsychotic medicinal products (including risperidone) with alpha-adrenergic blocking effects have \nbeen reported to induce priapism. During post-marketing surveillance, priapism has also been reported \nwith oral paliperidone, which is the active metabolite of risperidone. Patients should be informed to \nseek urgent medical care in case that priapism has not been resolved within 4 hours.\n\nBody temperature regulation\n\nDisruption of the body\u2019s ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic \nmedicinal products. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational to patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in \ncore body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant \nmedicinal products with anticholinergic activity or being subject to dehydration.\n\nVenous thromboembolism\n\nCases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with antipsychotic medicinal products. \nSince patients treated with antipsychotics often present with acquired risk factors for VTE, all possible \nrisk factors for VTE should be identified before and during treatment with Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational and preventative measures undertaken.\n\nAntiemetic effect\n\nAn antiemetic effect was observed in preclinical studies with paliperidone. This effect, if it occurs in\nhumans, may mask the signs and symptoms of overdosage with certain medicinal products or of \nconditions such as intestinal obstruction, Reye\u2019s syndrome and brain tumour.\n\nAdministration\n\nCare must be taken to avoid inadvertent injection of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International into a \nblood vessel.\n\nIntraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome\n\nIntraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in patients \ntreated with medicinal products with alpha 1a-adrenergic antagonist effect, such as Paliperidone \nJanssen-Cilag International (see section 4.8).\n\nIFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. Current or past use of \nmedicinal products with alpha 1a-adrenergic antagonist effect should be made known to the \nophthalmic surgeon in advance of surgery. The potential benefit of stopping alpha 1 blocking therapy \n\n\n\n29\n\nprior to cataract surgery has not been established and must be weighed against the risk of stopping the \nantipsychotic therapy.\n\nExcipients\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially \nsodium-free.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nCaution is advised when prescribing Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International with medicinal products \nknown to prolong the QT interval, e.g. class IA antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, disopyramide) and \nclass III antiarrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol), some antihistaminics, some other antipsychotics \nand some antimalarials (e.g. mefloquine). This list is indicative and not exhaustive.\n\nPotential for Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International to affect other medicines\n\nPaliperidone is not expected to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with medicinal \nproducts that are metabolised by cytochrome P-450 isozymes.\n\nGiven the primary central nervous system (CNS) effects of paliperidone (see section 4.8), Paliperidone \nJanssen-Cilag International should be used with caution in combination with other centrally acting \nmedicinal products, e.g., anxiolytics, most antipsychotics, hypnotics, opiates, etc. or alcohol.\n\nPaliperidone may antagonise the effect of levodopa and other dopamine agonists. If this combination \nis deemed necessary, particularly in end-stage Parkinson\u2019s disease, the lowest effective dose of each \ntreatment should be prescribed.\n\nBecause of its potential for inducing orthostatic hypotension (see section 4.4), an additive effect may \nbe observed when Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is administered with other therapeutic \nagents that have this potential, e.g., other antipsychotics, tricyclics.\n\nCaution is advised if paliperidone is combined with other medicinal products known to lower the \nseizure threshold (i.e., phenothiazines or butyrophenones, tricyclics or SSRIs, tramadol, mefloquine, \netc.).\n\nCo-administration of oral paliperidone prolonged release tablets at steady-state (12 mg once daily) \nwith divalproex sodium prolonged release tablets (500 mg to 2,000 mg once daily) did not affect the \nsteady-state pharmacokinetics of valproate.\n\nNo interaction study between Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International and lithium has been \nperformed, however, a pharmacokinetic interaction is not likely to occur.\n\nPotential for other medicines to affect Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International\n\nIn vitro studies indicate that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 may be minimally involved in paliperidone \nmetabolism, but there are no indications in vitro nor in vivo that these isozymes play a significant role\nin the metabolism of paliperidone. Concomitant administration of oral paliperidone with paroxetine, a \npotent CYP2D6 inhibitor, showed no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of \npaliperidone.\n\nCo-administration of oral paliperidone prolonged release once daily with carbamazepine 200 mg twice \ndaily caused a decrease of approximately 37% in the mean steady-state Cmax and AUC of paliperidone. \nThis decrease is caused, to a substantial degree, by a 35% increase in renal clearance of paliperidone\nlikely as a result of induction of renal P-gp by carbamazepine. A minor decrease in the amount of \nactive substance excreted unchanged in the urine suggests that there was little effect on the CYP \nmetabolism or bioavailability of paliperidone during carbamazepine co-administration. Larger \ndecreases in plasma concentrations of paliperidone could occur with higher doses of carbamazepine. \n\n\n\n30\n\nOn initiation of carbamazepine, the dose of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International should be \nre-evaluated and increased if necessary. Conversely, on discontinuation of carbamazepine, the dose of \nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International should be re-evaluated and decreased if necessary.\n\nCo-administration of a single dose of an oral paliperidone prolonged release tablet 12 mg with \ndivalproex sodium prolonged release tablets (two 500 mg tablets once daily) resulted in an increase of \napproximately 50% in the Cmax and AUC of paliperidone, likely as a result of increased oral \nabsorption. Since no effect on the systemic clearance was observed, a clinically significant interaction \nwould not be expected between divalproex sodium prolonged release tablets and Paliperidone \nJanssen-Cilag International intramuscular injection. This interaction has not been studied with \nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International.\n\nConcomitant use of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International with risperidone or with oral \npaliperidone\n\nSince paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone, caution should be exercised when \nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is co-administered with risperidone or with oral paliperidone \nfor extended periods of time. Safety data involving concomitant use of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational with other antipsychotics is limited.\n\nConcomitant use of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International with psychostimulants\n\nThe combined use of psychostimulants (e.g., methylphenidate) with paliperidone can lead to \nextrapyramidal symptoms upon change of either or both treatments (see section 4.4).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of paliperidone during pregnancy. Intramuscularly injected \npaliperidone palmitate and orally administered paliperidone were not teratogenic in animal studies, but \nother types of reproductive toxicity were seen (see section 5.3). Neonates exposed to paliperidone \nduring the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or \nwithdrawal symptoms that may vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been \nreports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding \ndisorder. Consequently, newborns should be monitored carefully. Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nPaliperidone is excreted in the breast milk to such an extent that effects on the breast-fed infant are \nlikely if therapeutic doses are administered to breast-feeding women. Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational should not be used while breast-feeding.\n\nFertility\n\nThere were no relevant effects observed in the non-clinical studies.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPaliperidone can have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to \npotential nervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred (see \nsection 4.8). Therefore, patients should be advised not to drive or operate machines until their \nindividual susceptibility to Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is known.\n\n\n\n31\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe adverse drug reactions (ADRs) most frequently reported in clinical trials were insomnia, \nheadache, anxiety, upper respiratory tract infection, injection site reaction, parkinsonism, weight \nincreased, akathisia, agitation, sedation/somnolence, nausea, constipation, dizziness, musculoskeletal \npain, tachycardia, tremor, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, fatigue, and dystonia. Of these, \nakathisia and sedation/somnolence appeared to be dose-related.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe following are all ADRs that were reported with paliperidone by frequency category estimated \nfrom paliperidone palmitate clinical trials.

reactions is qualified as \u201cnot known\u201d because they were not observed in paliperidone \npalmitate clinical trials. They were either derived from spontaneous post-marketing reports and frequency cannot be \ndetermined, or they were derived from risperidone (any formulation) or oral paliperidone clinical trials data and/or \npost-marketing reports.\n\nb Refer to \u2018Hyperprolactinaemia\u2019 below.\nc Refer to \u2018Extrapyramidal symptoms\u2019 below.\nd In placebo-controlled trials, diabetes mellitus was reported in 0.32% in Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International-treated \n\nsubjects compared to a rate of 0.39% in placebo group. Overall incidence from all clinical trials was 0.65% in all paliperidone \npalmitate -treated subjects\n\ne Insomnia includes: initial insomnia, middle insomnia; Convulsion includes: grand mal convulsion; Oedema includes:\ngeneralised oedema, oedema peripheral, pitting oedema. Menstrual disorder includes: menstruation delayed, menstruation \nirregular, oligomenorrhoea\n\nUndesirable effects noted with risperidone formulations\n\nPaliperidone is the active metabolite of risperidone, therefore, the adverse reaction profiles of these \ncompounds (including both the oral and injectable formulations) are relevant to one another.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nAnaphylactic reaction\nRarely, cases of anaphylactic reaction after injection with Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International\nhave been reported during post-marketing experience in patients who have previously tolerated oral \nrisperidone or oral paliperidone (see section 4.4).\n\nInjection site reactions\nThe most commonly reported injection site related adverse reaction was pain. The majority of these \nreactions were reported to be of mild to moderate severity. Subject evaluations of injection site pain \nbased on a visual analogue scale tended to lessen in frequency and intensity over time in all Phase 2 \nand 3 studies with Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International. Injections into the deltoid were perceived \nas slightly more painful than corresponding gluteal injections. Other injection site reactions were \nmostly mild in intensity and included induration (common), pruritus (uncommon) and nodules (rare).\n\nExtrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)\nEPS included a pooled analysis of the following terms: parkinsonism (includes salivary \nhypersecretion, musculoskeletal stiffness, parkinsonism, drooling, cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, \nhypokinesia, masked facies, muscle tightness, akinesia, nuchal rigidity, muscle rigidity, parkinsonian \ngait, glabellar reflex abnormal, and parkinsonian rest tremor), akathisia (includes akathisia, \nrestlessness, hyperkinesia, and restless leg syndrome), dyskinesia (dyskinesia, muscle twitching, \nchoreoathetosis, athetosis, and myoclonus), dystonia (includes dystonia, hypertonia, torticollis, muscle \ncontractions involuntary, muscle contracture, blepharospasm, oculogyration, tongue paralysis, facial \nspasm, laryngospasm, myotonia, opisthotonus, oropharyngeal spasm, pleurothotonus, tongue spasm, \nand trismus), and tremor. It should be noted that a broader spectrum of symptoms are included that do\nnot necessarily have an extrapyramidal origin.\n\n\n\n34\n\nWeight gain\nIn the 13-week study involving the 150 mg initiation dosing, the proportion of subjects with an \nabnormal weight increase \u2265 7% showed a dose-related trend, with a 5% incidence rate in the placebo\ngroup compared with rates of 6%, 8% and 13% in the Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International 25 mg, \n100 mg, and 150 mg groups, respectively.\n\nDuring the 33-week open-label transition/maintenance period of the long-term recurrence prevention \ntrial, 12% of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International-treated subjects met this criterion (weight gain \nof \u2265 7% from double-blind phase to endpoint); the mean (SD) weight change from open-label baseline \nwas + 0.7 (4.79) kg.\n\nHyperprolactinaemia\nIn clinical trials, median increases in serum prolactin were observed in subjects of both genders who \nreceived Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International. Adverse reactions that may suggest increase in \nprolactin levels (e.g., amenorrhoea, galactorrhoea, menstrual disturbances, gynaecomastia) were \nreported overall in < 1% of subjects.\n\nClass effects\n\nQT prolongation, ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), sudden \nunexplained death, cardiac arrest, and Torsade de pointes may occur with antipsychotics.\n\nCases of venous thromboembolism, including cases of pulmonary embolism and cases of deep vein \nthrombosis, have been reported with antipsychotic medicinal products (frequency unknown).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medical product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\n\nIn general, expected signs and symptoms are those resulting from an exaggeration of paliperidone\u2019s \nknown pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness and sedation, tachycardia and hypotension, QT \nprolongation, and extrapyramidal symptoms. Torsade de pointes and ventricular fibrillation have been \nreported in a patient in the setting of overdose with oral paliperidone. In the case of acute overdose, \nthe possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered.\n\nManagement\n\nConsideration should be given to the prolonged release nature of the medicinal product and the long \nelimination half-life of paliperidone when assessing treatment needs and recovery. There is no specific \nantidote to paliperidone. General supportive measures should be employed. Establish and maintain a \nclear airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.\n\nCardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous \nelectrocardiographic monitoring for possible arrhythmias. Hypotension and circulatory collapse should \nbe treated with appropriate measures such as intravenous fluid and/or sympathomimetic agents. In \ncase of severe extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic agents should be administered. Close \nsupervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n35\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, other antipsychotics. ATC code: N05AX13\n\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International contains a racemic mixture of (+)- and (-)-paliperidone.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nPaliperidone is a selective blocking agent of monoamine effects, whose pharmacological properties \nare different from that of traditional neuroleptics. Paliperidone binds strongly to serotonergic 5-HT2-\nand dopaminergic D2-receptors. Paliperidone also blocks alpha 1-adrenergic receptors and slightly \nless, H1-histaminergic and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. The pharmacological activity of the (+)- and \n(-)-paliperidone enantiomers are qualitatively and quantitatively similar.\n\nPaliperidone is not bound to cholinergic receptors. Even though paliperidone is a strong \nD2-antagonist, which is believed to relieve the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, it causes less \ncatalepsy and decreases motor functions less than traditional neuroleptics. Dominating central \nserotonin antagonism may reduce the tendency of paliperidone to cause extrapyramidal side effects.\n\nClinical efficacy\n\nAcute treatment of schizophrenia\nThe efficacy of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International in the acute treatment of schizophrenia was \nestablished in four short-term (one 9-week and three 13-week) double-blind, randomised, \nplacebo-controlled, fixed-dose studies of acutely relapsed adult inpatients who met DSM-IV criteria \nfor schizophrenia. The fixed doses of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International in these studies were \ngiven on days 1, 8, and 36 in the 9-week study, and additionally on day 64 of the 13-week studies. No \nadditional oral antipsychotic supplementation was needed during the acute treatment of schizophrenia\nwith Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International. The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as a \ndecrease in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores as shown in the table below. \nThe PANSS is a validated multi-item inventory composed of five factors to evaluate positive \nsymptoms, negative symptoms, disorganised thoughts, uncontrolled hostility/excitement and \nanxiety/depression. Functioning was evaluated using the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale.\nThe PSP is a validated clinician rated scale that measures personal and social functioning in four \ndomains: socially useful activities (work and study), personal and social relationships, self-care and \ndisturbing and aggressive behaviours.\n\nIn a 13-week study (n = 636) comparing three fixed doses of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International\n(initial deltoid injection of 150 mg followed by 3 gluteal or deltoid doses of either 25 mg/4 weeks, \n100 mg/4 weeks or 150 mg/4 weeks) to placebo, all three doses of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational were superior to placebo in improving the PANSS total score. In this study, both the \n100 mg/4 weeks and 150 mg /4 weeks, but not the 25 mg/4 weeks, treatment groups demonstrated \nstatistical superiority to placebo for the PSP score. These results support efficacy across the entire \nduration of treatment and improvement in PANSS and was observed as early as day 4 with significant \nseparation from placebo in the 25 mg and 150 mg Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International groups by \nday 8.\n\nThe results of the other studies yielded statistically significant results in favour of Paliperidone \nJanssen-Cilag International, except for the 50 mg dose in one study (see table below).\n\n\n\n36\n\nPositive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) Total Score - Change From Baseline to \nEnd Point- LOCF for Studies R092670-SCH-201, R092670-PSY-3003, R092670-PSY-3004 and \n\nR092670-PSY-3007: Primary Efficacy Analysis Set\nPlacebo 25 mg 50 mg 100 mg 150 mg\n\nR092670-PSY-3007*\nMean baseline (SD)\nMean change (SD)\nP-value (vs. Placebo)\n\nn = 160\n86.8 (10.31)\n-2.9 (19.26)\n\n--\n\nn = 155\n86.9 (11.99)\n-8.0 (19.90)\n\n0.034\n--\n\nn = 161\n86.2 (10.77)\n-11.6 (17.63)\n\n< 0.001\n\nn = 160\n88.4 (11.70)\n-13.2 (18.48)\n\n< 0.001\n\nR092670-PSY-3003\nMean baseline (SD)\nMean change (SD)\nP-value (vs. Placebo)\n\nn = 132\n92.4 (12.55)\n-4.1 (21.01)\n\n--\n--\n\nn = 93\n89.9 (10.78)\n-7.9 (18.71)\n\n0.193\n\nn = 94\n90.1 (11.66)\n-11.0 (19.06)\n\n0.019\n\nn = 30\n92.2 (11.72)\n-5.5 (19.78)\n\n--\n\nR092670-PSY-3004\nMean baseline (SD)\nMean change (SD)\nP-value (vs. Placebo)\n\nn = 125\n90.7 (12.22)\n-7.0 (20.07)\n\n--\n\nn = 129\n90.7 (12.25)\n-13.6 (21.45)\n\n0.015\n\nn = 128\n91.2 (12.02)\n-13.2 (20.14)\n\n0.017\n\nn = 131\n90.8 (11.70)\n-16.1 (20.36)\n\n< 0.001\n--\n\nR092670-SCH-201\nMean baseline (SD)\nMean change (SD)\nP-value (vs. Placebo)\n\nn = 66\n87.8 (13.90)\n6.2 (18.25)\n\n--\n--\n\nn = 63\n88.0 (12.39)\n-5.2 (21.52)\n\n0.001\n\nn = 68\n85.2 (11.09)\n-7.8 (19.40)\n\n< 0.0001\n--\n\n* For Study R092670-PSY-3007 an initiation dose of 150 mg was given to all subjects in the Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational treatment groups on day 1 followed by the assigned dose afterwards.\n\nNote: Negative change in score indicates improvement.\n\nMaintaining symptom control and delaying relapse of schizophrenia\nThe efficacy of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International in maintaining symptomatic control and \ndelaying relapse of schizophrenia was established in a longer-term double-blind, placebo-controlled, \nflexible-dose study involving 849 non-elderly adult subjects who met DSM-IV criteria for \nschizophrenia. This study included a 33-week open-label acute treatment and stabilisation phase, a \nrandomised, double-blind placebo-controlled phase to observe for relapse, and a 52-week open-label \nextension period. In this study, doses of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International included 25, 50, 75, \nand 100 mg administered monthly; the 75 mg dose was allowed only in the 52-week open-label \nextension. Subjects initially received flexible doses (25-100 mg) of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational during a 9-week transition period, followed by a 24-week maintenance period, where \nsubjects were required to have a PANSS score of \u2264 75. Dosing adjustments were only allowed in the \nfirst 12 weeks of the maintenance period. A total of 410 stabilised patients were randomised to either \nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International (median duration 171 days [range 1 day to 407 days]) or to \nplacebo (median duration 105 days [range 8 days to 441 days]) until they experienced a relapse of \nschizophrenia symptoms in the variable length double-blind phase. The trial was stopped early for \nefficacy reasons as a significantly longer time to relapse (p < 0.0001, Figure 1) was seen in patients \ntreated with Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International compared to placebo (hazard ratio = 4.32; 95% \nCI: 2.4-7.7).\n\n\n\n37\n\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier Plot of Time to Relapse \u2013 Interim Analysis (Intent-to-Treat Interim\nAnalysis Set)\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International in all subsets of the paediatric population in schizophrenia. \nSee section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption and distribution\n\nPaliperidone palmitate is the palmitate ester prodrug of paliperidone. Due to its extremely low water \nsolubility, paliperidone palmitate dissolves slowly after intramuscular injection before being \nhydrolysed to paliperidone and absorbed into the systemic circulation. Following a single \nintramuscular dose, the plasma concentrations of paliperidone gradually rise to reach maximum \nplasma concentrations at a median Tmax of 13 days. The release of the active substance starts as early \nas day 1 and lasts for at least 4 months.\n\nFollowing intramuscular injection of single doses (25-150 mg) in the deltoid muscle, on average, a \n28% higher Cmax was observed compared with injection in the gluteal muscle. The two initial deltoid \nintramuscular injections of 150 mg on day 1 and 100 mg on day 8 help attain therapeutic \nconcentrations rapidly. The release profile and dosing regimen of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational results in sustained therapeutic concentrations. The total exposure of paliperidone \nfollowing Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International administration was dose-proportional over a \n25-150 mg dose range, and less than dose-proportional for Cmax for doses exceeding 50 mg. The mean \nsteady-state peak:trough ratio for a Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International dose of 100 mg was 1.8 \nfollowing gluteal administration and 2.2 following deltoid administration. The median apparent \nhalf-life of paliperidone following Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International administration over the \ndose range of 25-150 mg ranged from 25-49 days.\n\n\n\n38\n\nThe absolute bioavailability of paliperidone palmitate following Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag\nInternational administration is 100%.\n\nFollowing administration of paliperidone palmitate the (+) and (-) enantiomers of paliperidone \ninterconvert, reaching an AUC (+) to (-) ratio of approximately 1.6-1.8.\n\nThe plasma protein binding of racemic paliperidone is 74%.\n\nBiotransformation and elimination\n\nOne week following administration of a single oral dose of 1 mg immediate-release 14C-paliperidone, \n59% of the dose was excreted unchanged into urine, indicating that paliperidone is not extensively \nmetabolised in the liver. Approximately 80% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine \nand 11% in the faeces. Four metabolic pathways have been identified in vivo, none of which accounted \nfor more than 6.5% of the dose: dealkylation, hydroxylation, dehydrogenation, and benzisoxazole \nscission. Although in vitro studies suggested a role for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the metabolism of \npaliperidone, there is no evidence in vivo that these isozymes play a significant role in the metabolism \nof paliperidone. Population pharmacokinetics analyses indicated no discernible difference on the \napparent clearance of paliperidone after administration of oral paliperidone between extensive \nmetabolisers and poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 substrates. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes \nshowed that paliperidone does not substantially inhibit the metabolism of medicinal products \nmetabolised by cytochrome P450 isozymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8/9/10, CYP2D6, \nCYP2E1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5.\n\nIn vitro studies have shown that paliperidone is a P-gp substrate and a weak inhibitor of P-gp at high \nconcentrations. No in vivo data are available and the clinical relevance is unknown.\n\nLong acting paliperidone palmitate injection versus oral prolonged release paliperidone\n\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is designed to deliver paliperidone over a monthly period \nwhile prolonged release oral paliperidone is administered on a daily basis. The initiation regimen for \nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International (150 mg/100 mg in the deltoid muscle on day 1/day 8) was \ndesigned to rapidly attain steady-state paliperidone concentrations when initiating therapy without the \nuse of oral supplementation.\n\nIn general, overall initiation plasma levels with Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International were within \nthe exposure range observed with 6-12 mg prolonged release oral paliperidone. The use of the \nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International initiation regimen allowed patients to stay in this exposure \nwindow of 6-12 mg prolonged release oral paliperidone even on trough pre-dose days (day 8 and \nday 36). Because of the difference in median pharmacokinetic profiles between the two medicinal \nproducts, caution should be exercised when making a direct comparison of their pharmacokinetic \nproperties.\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nPaliperidone is not extensively metabolised in the liver. Although Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag\nInternational was not studied on patients with hepatic impairment, no dose adjustment is required in \npatients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. In a study with oral paliperidone in subjects with \nmoderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), the plasma concentrations of free paliperidone \nwere similar to those of healthy subjects. Paliperidone has not been studied in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nThe disposition of a single oral dose paliperidone 3 mg prolonged release tablet was studied in \nsubjects with varying degrees of renal function. Elimination of paliperidone decreased with decreasing \n\n\n\n39\n\nestimated creatinine clearance. Total clearance of paliperidone was reduced in subjects with impaired \nrenal function by 32% on average in mild (CrCl = 50 to < 80 mL/min), 64% in moderate (CrCl = 30 to \n< 50 mL/min), and 71% in severe (CrCl = 10 to < 30 mL/min) renal impairment, corresponding to an \naverage increase in exposure (AUCinf) of 1.5, 2.6, and 4.8 fold, respectively, compared to healthy \nsubjects. Based on a limited number of observations with Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International in \nsubjects with mild renal impairment and pharmacokinetic simulations, a reduced dose is recommended \n(see section 4.2).\n\nElderly\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetics analysis showed no evidence of age related pharmacokinetics \ndifferences.\n\nBody mass index (BMI)/body weight\n\nPharmacokinetic studies with paliperidone palmitate have shown somewhat lower (10-20%) plasma \nconcentrations of paliperidone in patients who are overweight or obese in comparison with normal \nweight patients (see section 4.2).\n\nRace\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetics analysis of data from studies with oral paliperidone revealed no evidence \nof race-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone following Paliperidone \nJanssen-Cilag International administration.\n\nGender\n\nNo clinically significant differences were observed between men and women.\n\nSmoking status\n\nBased on in vitro studies utilising human liver enzymes, paliperidone is not a substrate for CYP1A2; \nsmoking should, therefore, not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone. Effect of \nsmoking on the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone was not studied with Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag \nInternational. A population pharmacokinetic analysis based on data with oral paliperidone prolonged \nrelease tablets showed a slightly lower exposure to paliperidone in smokers compared with \nnon-smokers. The difference is unlikely to be of clinical relevance.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nRepeat-dose toxicity studies of intramuscularly injected paliperidone palmitate (the 1-month \nformulation) and orally administered paliperidone in rat and dog showed mainly pharmacological \neffects, such as sedation and prolactin-mediated effects on mammary glands and genitals. In animals \ntreated with paliperidone palmitate an inflammatory reaction was seen at the intramuscular injection \nsite. Occasionally abscess formation occurred.\n\nIn rat reproduction studies with oral risperidone, which is extensively converted to paliperidone in rats \nand humans, adverse effects were seen on the birth weight and survival of the offspring. No \nembryotoxicity or malformations were observed following intramuscular administration of \npaliperidone palmitate to pregnant rats up to the highest dose (160 mg/kg/day) corresponding to \n4.1 times the exposure level in humans at the maximum recommended dose of 150 mg. Other \ndopamine antagonists, when administered to pregnant animals, have caused negative effects on \nlearning and motor development in the offspring.\n\nPaliperidone palmitate and paliperidone were not genotoxic. In oral carcinogenicity studies of \nrisperidone in rats and mice, increases in pituitary gland adenomas (mouse), endocrine pancreas \nadenomas (rat), and mammary gland adenomas (both species) were seen. The carcinogenic potential \n\n\n\n40\n\nof intramuscularly injected paliperidone palmitate was assessed in rats. There was a statistically \nsignificant increase in mammary gland adenocarcinomas in female rats at 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg/month. \nMale rats showed a statistically significant increase in mammary gland adenomas and carcinomas at \n30 and 60 mg/kg/month which is 1.2 and 2.2 times the exposure level at the maximum recommended \nhuman 150 mg dose. These tumours can be related to prolonged dopamine D2 antagonism and \nhyperprolactinemia. The relevance of these tumour findings in rodents in terms of human risk is \nunknown.\n\n6.

What Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is and what it is used for\n\nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International contains the active substance paliperidone which belongs to \nthe class of antipsychotic medicines and is used as a maintenance treatment for the symptoms of \nschizophrenia in adult patients stabilised on paliperidone or risperidone.\n\nIf you have shown responsiveness to paliperidone or risperidone in the past and have mild to moderate \nsymptoms your doctor may start treatment with Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International without prior \nstabilisation with paliperidone or risperidone.\n\nSchizophrenia is a disease with \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d symptoms. Positive means an excess of \nsymptoms that are not normally present. For example, a person with schizophrenia may hear voices or\nsee things that are not there (called hallucinations), believe things that are not true (called delusions), \nor feel unusually suspicious of others. Negative means a lack of behaviours or feelings that are \nnormally present. For example, a person with schizophrenia may appear withdrawn and may not \nrespond at all emotionally or may have trouble speaking in a clear and logical way.

It should be inspected visually for foreign matter \nbefore administration. Do not use if the syringe is not visually free of foreign matter.\n\nThe pack contains a pre-filled syringe and 2 safety needles (a 1\u00bd-inch 22 gauge needle [38.1 mm x \n0.72 mm] and a 1-inch 23 gauge needle [25.4 mm x 0.64 mm]) for intramuscular injection. \nPaliperidone Janssen-Cilag International is also available in a Treatment initiation pack which contains \ntwo pre-filled syringes (150 mg + 100 mg) and 2 additional safety needles.\n\n1. Shake the syringe vigorously for a minimum of 10 seconds to ensure a homogeneous \nsuspension.\n\n2. Select the appropriate needle.\n\nThe first initiation dose of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International (150 mg) is to be \nadministered on Day 1 in the DELTOID muscle using the needle for DELTOID injection. The \nsecond initiation dose of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International (100 mg) is to also be \nadministered in the DELTOID muscle one week later (Day 8) using the needle for DELTOID \ninjection.\n\n\n\n80\n\nIf the patient is being switched from risperidone long acting injection to Paliperidone Janssen-\nCilag International, the first injection of Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International (ranging from \n25 mg to 150 mg) can be administered in either the DELTOID or GLUTEAL muscle using the \nappropriate needle for the injection site at the time of the next scheduled injection.\n\nThereafter, the monthly maintenance injections can be administered in either the DELTOID or \nGLUTEAL muscle using the appropriate needle for the injection site.\n\nFor DELTOID injection, if the patient weighs < 90 kg, use the 1-inch, 23 gauge needle \n(25.4 mm x 0.64 mm) (needle with blue coloured hub); if the patient weighs \u2265 90 kg, use the \n1\u00bd-inch, 22 gauge needle (38.1 mm x 0.72 mm) (needle with grey coloured hub).\n\nFor GLUTEAL injection, use the 1\u00bd-inch, 22 gauge needle (38.1 mm x 0.72 mm) (needle with \ngrey coloured hub).\n\n3. While holding the syringe upright, remove the rubber tip cap with a twisting motion.\n\n4. Peel the safety needle blister pouch half way open. Grasp the needle sheath using the plastic \npeel pouch. Attach the safety needle to the luer connection of the syringe with an easy \nclockwise twisting motion.\n\n5. Pull the needle sheath away from the needle with a straight pull. Do not twist the sheath as the \nneedle may be loosened from the syringe.\n\n\n\n81\n\n6. Bring the syringe with the attached needle in upright position to de-aerate. De-aerate the syringe \nby moving the plunger rod carefully forward.\n\n7. Inject the entire contents intramuscularly slowly, deep into the selected deltoid or gluteal muscle \nof the patient. Do not administer intravascularly or subcutaneously.\n\n8. After the injection is complete, use either thumb or finger of one hand (8a, 8b) or a flat surface \n(8c) to activate the needle protection system. The system is fully activated when a \u2018click\u2019 is \nheard. Discard the syringe with needle appropriately.\n\n\n\n82\n\n8a\n\n8b\n\n8c\n\nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

substance paliperidone which belongs to the class of antipsychotic medicines and is used as a maintenance treatment for the symptoms of schizophrenia in adult patients stabilised on paliperidone or risperidone. if you have shown responsiveness to paliperidone or risperidone in the past and have mild to moderate symptoms your doctor may start treatment with paliperidone janssen-cilag international without prior stabilisation with paliperidone or risperidone. schizophrenia is a disease with \"positive\" and \"negative\" symptoms. positive means an excess of symptoms that are not normally present. for example, a person with schizophrenia may hear voices or see things that are not there (called hallucinations), believe things that are not true (called delusions), or feel unusually suspicious of others. negative means a lack of behaviours or feelings that are normally present. for example, a person with schizophrenia may appear withdrawn and may not respond at all emotionally or may have trouble speaking in a clear and logical way. people with this disease may also feel depressed, anxious, guilty, or tense. paliperidone janssen-cilag international can help
