CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1  Therapeutic indications \n\n \nNeuropathic pain \n \nPregabalin Mylan is indicated for the treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic pain in adults. \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\n \n\nEpilepsy \n \nPregabalin Mylan is indicated as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial seizures with or without \nsecondary generalisation. \n \nGeneralised Anxiety Disorder \n \n\nPregabalin Mylan is indicated for the treatment of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults. \n\n \n4.2  Posology and method of administration \n \n\nPosology \n \nThe dose range is 150 to 600 mg per day given in either two or three divided doses.  \n \nNeuropathic pain \nPregabalin treatment can be started at a dose of 150 mg per day given as two or three divided doses.  \nBased on individual patient response and tolerability, the dose may be increased to 300 mg per day \nafter an interval of 3 to 7 days, and if needed, to a maximum dose of 600 mg per day after an \nadditional 7-day interval. \n \nEpilepsy \nPregabalin treatment can be started with a dose of 150 mg per day given as two or three divided \ndoses. Based on individual patient response and tolerability, the dose may be increased to 300 mg per \nday after 1 week. The maximum dose of 600 mg per day may be achieved after an additional week. \n \nGeneralised Anxiety Disorder \nThe dose range is 150 to 600 mg per day given as two or three divided doses. The need for treatment \nshould be reassessed regularly. \n \nPregabalin treatment can be started with a dose of 150 mg per day. Based on individual patient \nresponse and tolerability, the dose may be increased to 300 mg per day after 1 week. Following an \nadditional week the dose may be increased to 450 mg per day. The maximum dose of 600 mg per day \nmay be achieved after an additional week. \n \nDiscontinuation of pregabalin \nIn accordance with current clinical practice, if pregabalin has to be discontinued, it is recommended \nthis should be done gradually over a minimum of 1 week independent of the indication (see sections \n4.4 and 4.8). \n \nSpecial populations \n\n \nRenal impairment \nPregabalin is eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal excretion as unchanged \ndrug. As pregabalin clearance is directly proportional to creatinine clearance (see section 5.2), dose \nreduction in patients with compromised renal function must be individualised according to creatinine \nclearance (CLcr), as indicated in Table 1 determined using the following formula: \n \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\n \nPregabalin is removed effectively from plasma by haemodialysis (50% of drug in 4 hours). For \npatients receiving haemodialysis, the pregabalin daily dose should be adjusted based on renal \nfunction. In addition to the daily dose, a supplementary dose should be given immediately following \nevery 4 hour haemodialysis treatment (see Table 1). \n \nTable 1. Pregabalin dose adjustment based on renal function \n \n\nCreatinine \nclearance (CLcr) \n(ml/min) \n \n\nTotal pregabalin daily dose *  Dose regimen \n\n Starting dose \n(mg/day) \n \n\nMaximum dose \n(mg/day) \n \n\n \n\n≥ 60 150 600 BID or TID \n≥30 - <60 75 300 BID or TID \n\n \n\n≥15 - <30 25-50 150 Once Daily or BID \n< 15 25 75 Once Daily \n\n    \nSupplementary dosage following haemodialysis (mg) \n\n 25 100 Single dose+ \n \nTID = Three divided doses \nBID = Two divided doses \n* Total daily dose (mg/day) should be divided as indicated by dose regimen to provide mg/dose \n+ Supplementary dose is a single additional dose \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Pregabalin Mylan in children below the age of 12 years and in adolescents \n(12-17 years of age) have not been established. Currently available data are described in section 4.8, \n5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nElderly \nElderly patients may require a dose reduction of pregabalin due to a decreased renal function (see \npatients with renal impairment). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nPregabalin Mylan may be taken with or without food. \nPregabalin Mylan is for oral use only. \n \n4.3  Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \n4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nDiabetic patients \n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nIn accordance with current clinical practice, some diabetic patients who gain weight on pregabalin \ntreatment may need to adjust hypoglycaemic medicinal products. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nThere have been reports in the post-marketing experience of hypersensitivity reactions, including \ncases of angioedema. Pregabalin should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, \nsuch as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. \n \nDizziness, somnolence, loss of consciousness, confusion and mental impairment \n \nPregabalin treatment has been associated with dizziness and somnolence, which could increase the \noccurrence of accidental injury (fall) in the elderly population. There have also been post-marketing \nreports of loss of consciousness, confusion and mental impairment. Therefore, patients should be \nadvised to exercise caution until they are familiar with the potential effects of the medicinal product.  \n \nVision-related effects \n \nIn controlled trials, a higher proportion of patients treated with pregabalin reported blurred vision than \ndid patients treated with placebo which resolved in a majority of cases with continued dosing. In the  \nclinical studies where ophthalmologic testing was conducted, the incidence of visual acuity reduction  \nand visual field changes was greater in pregabalin-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients; the \nincidence of fundoscopic changes was greater in placebo-treated patients (see section 5.1). \n \nIn the post-marketing experience, visual adverse reactions have also been reported, including loss of \nvision, visual blurring or other changes of visual acuity, many of which were transient. \nDiscontinuation of pregabalin may result in resolution or improvement of these visual symptoms.  \n \nRenal failure \n \nCases of renal failure have been reported and in some cases discontinuation of pregabalin did show \nreversibility of this adverse reaction. \n \nWithdrawal of concomitant anti-epileptic medicinal products \n \nThere are insufficient data for the withdrawal of concomitant anti-epileptic medicinal products, once \nseizure control with pregabalin in the add-on situation has been reached, in order to reach \nmonotherapy on pregabalin. \n \nWithdrawal symptoms \n \nAfter discontinuation of short-term and long-term treatment with pregabalin, withdrawal symptoms \nhave been observed in some patients. The following events have been mentioned: insomnia, \nheadache, nausea, anxiety, diarrhoea, flu syndrome, nervousness, depression, pain, convulsion, \nhyperhidrosis and dizziness, suggestive of physical dependence. The patient should be informed about \nthis at the start of the treatment. \n \nConvulsions, including status epilepticus and grand mal convulsions, may occur during pregabalin use  \nor shortly after discontinuing pregabalin. \n \nConcerning discontinuation of long-term treatment of pregabalin, data suggest that the incidence and \nseverity of withdrawal symptoms may be dose-related. \n \nCongestive heart failure \n \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nThere have been post-marketing reports of congestive heart failure in some patients receiving \npregabalin. These reactions are mostly seen in elderly cardiovascular compromised patients during \npregabalin treatment for a neuropathic indication. Pregabalin should be used with caution in these \npatients. Discontinuation of pregabalin may resolve the reaction. \n \nTreatment of central neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury \n \nIn the treatment of central neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury the incidence of adverse \nreactions in general, central nervous system adverse reactions and especially somnolence was \nincreased. This may be attributed to an additive effect due to concomitant medicinal products (e.g. \nanti-spasticity agents) needed for this condition. This should be considered when prescribing \npregabalin in this condition. \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic agents in \nseveral indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo controlled studies of anti-epileptic drugs \nhas also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. The mechanism of this risk \nis not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk for pregabalin. \n \nTherefore patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate \ntreatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek \nmedical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. \n \nReduced lower gastrointestinal tract function \n \nThere are post-marketing reports of events related to reduced lower gastrointestinal tract function (e.g. \nintestinal obstruction, paralytic ileus, constipation) when pregabalin was co-administered with \nmedications that have the potential to produce constipation, such as opioid analgesics. When \npregabalin and opioids will be used in combination, measures to prevent constipation may be \nconsidered (especially in female patients and elderly). \n \nConcomitant use with opioids \n \nCaution is advised when prescribing pregabalin concomitantly with opioids due to risk of CNS \ndepression (see section 4.5). In a case-control study of opioid users, those patients who took \npregabalin concomitantly with an opioid had an increased risk for opioid-related death compared to \nopioid use alone (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.68 [95% CI, 1.19 – 2.36]). This increased risk was \nobserved at low doses of pregabalin (≤ 300 mg, aOR 1.52 [95% CI, 1.04 – 2.22]) and there was a \ntrend for a greater risk at high doses of pregabalin (> 300 mg, aOR 2.51 [95% CI 1.24 – 5.06]). \n \nMisuse, abuse potential or dependence \n \nCases of misuse, abuse and dependence have been reported. Caution should be exercised in patients \nwith a history of substance abuse and the patient should be monitored for symptoms of pregabalin \nmisuse, abuse or dependence (development of tolerance, dose escalation, drug-seeking behaviour \nhave been reported). \n \nEncephalopathy \n \nCases of encephalopathy have been reported, mostly in patients with underlying conditions that may \nprecipitate encephalopathy. \n \nSodium content \n \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule. That is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’ \n \n4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \nSince pregabalin is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine, undergoes negligible metabolism \nin humans (<2% of a dose recovered in urine as metabolites), does not inhibit drug metabolism in \nvitro, and is not bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely to produce, or be subject to,  pharmacokinetic \ninteractions. \n \nIn vivo studies and population pharmacokinetic analysis \n \nAccordingly, in in vivo studies no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed \nbetween pregabalin and phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, lamotrigine, gabapentin, lorazepam, \noxycodone or ethanol. Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that oral antidiabetics, diuretics, \ninsulin, phenobarbital, tiagabine and topiramate had no clinically significant effect on pregabalin \nclearance. \n \nOral contraceptives, norethisterone and/or ethinyl oestradiol \n \nCo-administration of pregabalin with the oral contraceptives norethisterone and/or ethinyl oestradiol \ndoes not influence the steady-state pharmacokinetics of either substance. \n \nCentral nervous system influencing medical products \n \nPregabalin may potentiate the effects of ethanol and lorazepam.  \n \nIn the postmarketing experience, there are reports of respiratory failure, coma and deaths in patients \ntaking pregabalin and opioids and/or other central nervous system (CNS) depressant medicinal \nproducts. Pregabalin appears to be additive in the impairment of cognitive and gross motor function \ncaused by oxycodone. \n \nInteractions and the elderly \n \nNo specific pharmacodynamic interaction studies were conducted in elderly volunteers. Interaction \nstudies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n \nAs the potential risk for humans is unknown, effective contraception must be used in women of child \nbearing potential. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of pregabalin in pregnant women.  \n \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is \nunknown.  \n \nPregabalin Mylan should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary (if the benefit to the \nmother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus). \n \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nBreast-feeding \n \nPregabalin is excreted into human milk (see section 5.2). The effect of pregabalin on newborns/infants \nis unknown. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue \npregabalin therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no clinical data on the effects of pregabalin on female fertility. \n \nIn a clinical trial to assess the effect of pregabalin on sperm motility, healthy male subjects were \nexposed to pregabalin at a dose of 600 mg/day. After 3 months of treatment, there were no effects on \nsperm motility. \n \nA fertility study in female rats has shown adverse reproductive effects. Fertility studies in male rats \nhave shown adverse reproductive and developmental effects. The clinical relevance of these findings \nis unknown (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \nPregabalin Mylan may have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nPregabalin Mylan may cause dizziness and somnolence and therefore may influence the ability to \ndrive or use machines. Patients are advised not to drive, operate complex machinery or engage in \nother potentially hazardous activities until it is known whether this medicinal product affects their \nability to perform these activities. \n \n4.8  Undesirable effects \n\n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe pregabalin clinical programme involved over 8900 patients exposed to pregabalin, of whom over \n5600 were in double-blind placebo controlled trials. The most commonly reported adverse reactions \nwere dizziness and somnolence. Adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in intensity. In all \ncontrolled studies, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 12% for patients receiving \npregabalin and 5% for patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse reactions resulting in \ndiscontinuation from pregabalin treatment groups were dizziness and somnolence. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn table 2 below all adverse reactions, which occurred at an incidence greater than placebo and in \nmore than one patient, are listed by class and frequency (very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to \n<1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable \neffects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe adverse reactions listed may also be associated with the underlying disease and/or concomitant \nmedicinal products. \n \nIn the treatment of central neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury the incidence of adverse \nreactions in general, CNS adverse reactions and especially somnolence was increased (see section \n4.4). \n \nAdditional reactions reported from post-marketing experience are included in italics in the list below. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nTable 2.

The following reactions have been mentioned: insomnia, \nheadache, nausea, anxiety, diarrhoea, flu syndrome, convulsions, nervousness, depression, pain, \nhyperhidrosis and dizziness, suggestive of physical dependence. The patient should be informed about \nthis at the start of the treatment. \n \nConcerning discontinuation of long-term treatment of pregabalin, data suggest that the incidence and \nseverity of withdrawal symptoms may be dose-related. \n \nPaediatric population \n\nThe pregabalin safety profile observed in four paediatric studies in patients with partial seizures with \n\nor without secondary generalization (12-week efficacy and safety study in patients 4 to 16years of age \n\n, n=295; 14-day efficacy and safety study in patients 1month to younger than 4years of age, n=175;  \n\npharmacokinetic and tolerability study, n=65; and 1 year open label follow on safety study, n=54) was \n\nsimilar to that observed in the adult studies of patients with epilepsy. The most common adverse \n\nevents observed in the 12-week study with pregabalin treatment were somnolence, pyrexia, upper \n\nrespiratory tract infection, increased appetite, weight increased, and nasopharyngitis. The most \n\ncommon adverse events observed in the 14-day study with pregabalin treatment were somnolence, \n\nupper respiratory tract infection, and pyrexia (see sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n4.9  Overdose \n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\n \nIn the post-marketing experience, the most commonly reported adverse reactions observed when \npregabalin was taken in overdose included somnolence, confusional state, agitation, and restlessness.  \nSeizures were also reported. \n \nIn rare occasions, cases of coma have been reported. \n \nManagement \n\n \nTreatment of pregabalin overdose should include general supportive measures and may include \nhaemodialysis if necessary (see section 4.2 Table 1). \n \n \n5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-epileptics, other anti-epileptics, ATC code: N03AX16. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n14 \n \n\nThe active substance, pregabalin, is a gamma-aminobutyric acid analogue [(S)-3-(aminomethyl)-5- \nmethylhexanoic acid]. \n \nMechanism of action \n\n \nPregabalin binds to an auxiliary subunit (α2- δ protein) of voltage-gated calcium channels in the \ncentral nervous system. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \nNeuropathic pain \nEfficacy has been shown in trials in diabetic neuropathy, post herpetic neuralgia and spinal cord \ninjury. Efficacy has not been studied in other models of neuropathic pain. \nPregabalin has been studied in 10 controlled clinical trials of up to 13 weeks with twice a day dosing \n(BID) and up to 8 weeks with three times a day (TID) dosing. Overall, the safety and efficacy profiles \nfor BID and TID dosing regimens were similar. \n \nIn clinical trials up to 12 weeks for both peripheral and central neuropathic pain, a reduction in pain \nwas seen by week 1 and was maintained throughout the treatment period. \n \nIn controlled clinical trials in peripheral neuropathic pain 35% of the pregabalin treated patients and \n18% of the patients on placebo had a 50% improvement in pain score. For patients not experiencing \nsomnolence, such an improvement was observed in 33% of patients treated with pregabalin and 18% \nof patients on placebo. For patients who experienced somnolence the responder rates were 48% on \npregabalin and 16% on placebo. \n \nIn the controlled clinical trial in central neuropathic pain 22% of the pregabalin treated patients and \n\n7% of the patients on placebo had a 50% improvement in pain score. \n\n \n\nEpilepsy \n\nAdjunctive Treatment \nPregabalin has been studied in 3 controlled clinical trials of 12 week duration with either twice a day \ndosing (BID) or three times a day (TID) dosing. Overall, the safety and efficacy profiles for BID and \nTID dosing regimens were similar. \n \nA reduction in seizure frequency was observed by Week 1. \n \nPaediatric population \n\nThe efficacy and safety of pregabalin as adjunctive treatment for epilepsy in paediatric patients below \n\nthe age of 12 and adolescents has not been established. The adverse events observed in a \n\npharmacokinetic and tolerability study that enrolled patients from 3 months to 16 years of age (n=65) \n\nwith partial onset seizures were similar to those observed in adults. Results of a 12-week placebo-\n\ncontrolled study of 295 paediatric patients aged 4 to  16 years and a 14-day placebo-controlled study \n\nof 175 paediatric patients aged 1 month to younger than 4 years of age performed to evaluate the \n\nefficacy and safety of pregabalin as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial onset seizures and a \n\n1 year open label safety study in 54 paediatric patients from 3 months to 16 years of age with epilepsy \n\nindicate that the adverse events of pyrexia and upper respiratory infections were observed more \n\nfrequently than in adult studies of patients with epilepsy (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nIn the 12-week placebo-controlled study (4 to 16 years of age), paediatric patients were assigned to \npregabalin 2.5 mg/kg/day (maximum, 150 mg/day), pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day (maximum, \n600 mg/day), or placebo. The percentage of subjects with at least a 50% reduction in partial onset \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nseizures as compared to baseline was 40.6% of subjects treated with pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day \n(p=0.0068 versus placebo), 29.1% of subjects treated with pregabalin 2.5 mg/kg/day (p=0.2600 versus \nplacebo) and 22.6% of those receiving placebo. \n \n\nIn the 14-day placebo-controlled study, paediatric patients (1 month to younger than 4 years of age) \nwere assigned to pregabalin 7 mg/kg/day, pregabalin 14 mg/kg/day, or placebo. Median 24-hour \nseizure frequencies at baseline and at the final visit were 4.7 and 3.8 for pregabalin 7 mg/kg/day, 5.4 \nand 1.4 for pregabalin 14 mg/kg/day, and 2.9 and 2.3 for placebo, respectively. Pregabalin 14 \nmg/kg/day significantly reduced the log-transformed partial onset seizure frequency versus placebo \n(p=0.0223); pregabalin 7 mg/kg/day did not show improvement relative to placebo. \n \nMonotherapy (newly diagnosed patients) \n\nPregabalin has been studied in 1 controlled clinical trial of 56 week duration with BID dosing. \nPregabalin did not achieve non-inferiority to lamotrigine based on the 6-month seizure freedom \nendpoint. Pregabalin and lamotrigine were similarly safe and well tolerated. \n \nGeneralised Anxiety Disorder \n\nPregabalin has been studied in 6 controlled trials of 4-6 week duration, an elderly study of 8 week \nduration and a long-term relapse prevention study with a double blind relapse prevention phase of 6 \nmonths duration. \n \nRelief of the symptoms of GAD as reflected by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) was \nobserved by Week 1. \n \nIn controlled clinical trials (4-8 week duration) 52% of the pregabalin treated patients and 38% of the \npatients on placebo had at least a 50% improvement in HAM-A total score from baseline to endpoint. \n \nIn controlled trials, a higher proportion of patients treated with pregabalin reported blurred vision than \ndid patients treated with placebo which resolved in a majority of cases with continued dosing. \n \nOphthalmologic testing (including visual acuity testing, formal visual field testing and dilated \nfunduscopic examination) was conducted in over 3600 patients within controlled clinical trials. In \nthese patients, visual acuity was reduced in 6.5% of patients treated with pregabalin, and 4.8% of \nplacebo-treated patients. Visual field changes were detected in 12.4% of pregabalin-treated, and \n11.7% of placebo-treated patients. Funduscopic changes were observed in 1.7% of pregabalin-treated \nand 2.1% of placebo-treated patients. \n \n5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nPregabalin steady-state pharmacokinetics are similar in healthy volunteers, patients with epilepsy \nreceiving anti-epileptic drugs and patients with chronic pain. \n \nAbsorption \n\n \nPregabalin is rapidly absorbed when administered in the fasted state, with peak plasma concentrations \noccurring within 1 hour following both single and multiple dose administration. Pregabalin oral \nbioavailability is estimated to be ≥ 90% and is independent of dose. Following repeated \nadministration, steady state is achieved within 24 to 48 hours. The rate of pregabalin absorption is \ndecreased when given with food resulting in a decrease in Cmax by approximately 25-30% and a delay \nin tmax to approximately 2.5 hours. However, administration of pregabalin with food has no clinically \nsignificant effect on the extent of pregabalin absorption. \n \nDistribution \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\nIn preclinical studies, pregabalin has been shown to cross the blood brain barrier in mice, rats, and \nmonkeys. Pregabalin has been shown to cross the placenta in rats and is present in the milk of \nlactating rats. In humans, the apparent volume of distribution of pregabalin following oral \nadministration is approximately 0.56 l/kg. Pregabalin is not bound to plasma proteins.  \n \nBiotransformation \n\n \nPregabalin undergoes negligible metabolism in humans. Following a dose of radiolabelled pregabalin, \napproximately 98% of the radioactivity recovered in the urine was unchanged pregabalin. The N-\nmethylated derivative of pregabalin, the major metabolite of pregabalin found in urine, accounted for \n0.9% of the dose. In preclinical studies, there was no indication of racemisation of pregabalin S-\nenantiomer to the R-enantiomer. \n \nElimination \n\n \nPregabalin is eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal excretion as unchanged \ndrug. Pregabalin mean elimination half-life is 6.3 hours. Pregabalin plasma clearance and renal \nclearance are directly proportional to creatinine clearance (see section 5.2 Renal impairment). \n \nDose adjustment in patients with reduced renal function or undergoing haemodialysis is necessary \n(see section 4.2 Table 1). \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \nPregabalin pharmacokinetics are linear over the recommended daily dose range. Inter-subject \npharmacokinetic variability for pregabalin is low (<20%). Multiple dose pharmacokinetics are \npredictable from single-dose data. Therefore, there is no need for routine monitoring of plasma \nconcentrations of pregabalin. \n \nGender \n\n \nClinical trials indicate that gender does not have a clinically significant influence on the plasma \nconcentrations of pregabalin. \n \nRenal impairment \n\n \nPregabalin clearance is directly proportional to creatinine clearance. In addition, pregabalin is \neffectively removed from plasma by haemodialysis (following a 4 hour haemodialysis treatment \nplasma pregabalin concentrations are reduced by approximately 50%). Because renal elimination is \nthe major elimination pathway, dose reduction in patients with renal impairment and dose \nsupplementation following haemodialysis is necessary (see section 4.2 Table 1).  \n \nHepatic impairment \n\n \nNo specific pharmacokinetic studies were carried out in patients with impaired liver function. Since \npregabalin does not undergo significant metabolism and is excreted predominantly as unchanged drug \nin the urine, impaired liver function would not be expected to significantly alter pregabalin plasma \nconcentrations. \n \nPaediatric population \n\n \nPregabalin pharmacokinetics were evaluated in paediatric patients with epilepsy (age groups: 1 to \n23 months, 2 to 6 years, 7 to 11 years and 12 to 16 years) at dose levels of 2.5, 5, 10 and \n15 mg/kg/day in a pharmacokinetic and tolerability study. \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\n \nAfter oral administration of pregabalin in paediatric patients in the fasted state, in general, time to \nreach peak plasma concentration was similar across the entire age group and occurred 0.5  hours to \n2 hours postdose. \n \nPregabalin Cmax and AUC parameters increased in a linear manner with increasing dose within each \nage group. The AUC was lower by 30% in paediatric patients below a weight of 30 kg due to an \nincreased body weight adjusted clearance of 43% for these patients in comparison to patients \nweighing ≥30 kg. \n \nPregabalin terminal half-life averaged about 3 to 4 hours in paediatric patients up to 6 years of age, \nand 4 to 6 hours in those 7 years of age and older. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis showed that creatinine clearance was a significant covariate of \npregabalin oral clearance, body weight was a significant covariate of pregabalin apparent oral volume \nof distribution, and these relationships were similar in paediatric and adult patients.  \n \nPregabalin pharmacokinetics in patients younger than 3 months old have not been studied (see \nsections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nElderly \n\n \nPregabalin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age. This decrease in pregabalin oral clearance \nis consistent with decreases in creatinine clearance associated with increasing age. Reduction of \npregabalin dose may be required in patients who have age related compromised renal function (see \nsection 4.2 Table 1). \n \nBreast-feeding mothers \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of 150 mg pregabalin given every 12 hours (300 mg daily dose) was evaluated \nin 10 lactating women who were at least 12 weeks postpartum. Lactation had little to no influence on \npregabalin pharmacokinetics. Pregabalin was excreted into breast milk with average steady-state \nconcentrations approximately 76% of those in maternal plasma. The estimated infant dose from breast \nmilk (assuming mean milk consumption of 150 ml/kg/day) of women receiving 300 mg/day or the \nmaximum dose of 600 mg/day would be 0.31 or 0.62 mg/kg/day, respectively. These estimated doses \nare approximately 7% of the total daily maternal dose on a mg/kg basis. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nIn conventional safety pharmacology studies in animals, pregabalin was well-tolerated at clinically \nrelevant doses. In repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys CNS effects were observed, \nincluding hypoactivity, hyperactivity and ataxia. An increased incidence of retinal atrophy commonly \nobserved in aged albino rats was seen after long term exposure to pregabalin at exposures ≥ 5 times \nthe mean human exposure at the maximum recommended clinical dose. \n \nPregabalin was not teratogenic in mice, rats or rabbits. Foetal toxicity in rats and rabbits occurred only \nat exposures sufficiently above human exposure. In prenatal/postnatal toxicity studies, pregabalin \ninduced offspring developmental toxicity in rats at exposures >2 times the maximum recommended \nhuman exposure. \n \nAdverse effects on fertility in male and female rats were only observed at exposures sufficiently in \nexcess of therapeutic exposure. Adverse effects on male reproductive organs and sperm parameters \nwere reversible and occurred only at exposures sufficiently in excess of therapeutic exposure or were \nassociated with spontaneous degenerative processes in male reproductive organs in the rat. Therefore \nthe effects were considered of little or no clinical relevance. \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\n \nPregabalin is not genotoxic based on results of a battery of in vitro and in vivo tests. \n \nTwo-year carcinogenicity studies with pregabalin were conducted in rats and mice. No tumours were \nobserved in rats at exposures up to 24 times the mean human exposure at the maximum recommended \nclinical dose of 600 mg/day. In mice, no increased incidence of tumours was found at exposures \nsimilar to the mean human exposure, but an increased incidence of haemangiosarcoma was observed \nat higher exposures. The non-genotoxic mechanism of pregabalin-induced tumour formation in mice \ninvolves platelet changes and associated endothelial cell proliferation. These platelet changes were not \npresent in rats or in humans based on short term and limited long term clinical data. There is no \nevidence to suggest an associated risk to humans. \n \nIn juvenile rats the types of toxicity do not differ qualitatively from those observed in adult rats. \nHowever, juvenile rats are more sensitive. At therapeutic exposures, there was evidence of CNS \nclinical signs of hyperactivity and bruxism and some changes in growth (transient body weight gain \nsuppression). Effects on the oestrus cycle were observed at 5-fold the human therapeutic exposure. \nReduced acoustic startle response was observed in juvenile rats 1-2 weeks after exposure at >2 times \nthe human therapeutic exposure. Nine weeks after exposure, this effect was no longer observable.  \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Pregabalin Mylan is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nPregabalin Mylan contains the active substance pregabalin which belongs to a group of medicines \nused to treat epilepsy, neuropathic pain and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults. \n \n\nPeripheral and central neuropathic pain: Pregabalin Mylan is used to treat long lasting pain caused \nby damage to the nerves. A variety of diseases can cause peripheral neuropathic pain, such as diabetes \nor shingles. Pain sensations may be described as hot, burning, throbbing, shooting, stabbing, sharp, \ncramping, aching, tingling, numbness, pins and needles. Peripheral and central neuropathic pain may \nalso be associated with mood changes, sleep disturbance, fatigue (tiredness), and can have an impact \non physical and social functioning and overall quality of life. \n \nEpilepsy: Pregabalin Mylan is used to treat a certain form of epilepsy (partial seizures with or without \nsecondary generalisation) in adults. Your doctor will prescribe Pregabalin Mylan for you to help treat \nyour epilepsy when your current treatment is not controlling your condition. You should take \nPregabalin Mylan in addition to your current treatment. Pregabalin Mylan is not intended to be used \nalone, but should always be used in combination with other anti-epileptic treatment. \n \n\n\n\n67 \n \n\nGeneralised Anxiety Disorder: Pregabalin Mylan is used to treat Generalised Anxiety Disorder \n(GAD). The symptoms of GAD are prolonged excessive anxiety and worry that are difficult to \ncontrol. GAD can also cause restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued (tired), \nhaving difficulty concentrating or mind going blank, feeling irritable, having muscle tension or sleep \ndisturbance. This is different to the stresses and strains of everyday life. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Pregabalin Mylan  \n\n \n\nDo not take Pregabalin Mylan: \nIf you are allergic to pregabalin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Pregabalin Mylan. \n \n\n• Some patients taking Pregabalin Mylan have reported symptoms suggesting an allergic \nreaction. These symptoms include swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat, as well as \ndiffuse skin rash. Should you experience any of these reactions, you should contact your \nphysician immediately. \n \n\n• Pregabalin Mylan has been associated with dizziness and somnolence, which could increase \nthe occurrence of accidental injury (fall) in elderly patients. Therefore, you should be careful \nuntil you are used to any effect the medicine might have. \n\n \n\n• Pregabalin Mylan may cause blurring or loss of vision, or other changes in eyesight, many of \nwhich are temporary. You should immediately tell your doctor if you experience any changes \nin your vision. \n\n \n\n• Some patients with diabetes who gain weight while taking pregabalin may need an alteration \nin their diabetic medicines. \n\n \n\n• Certain side effects may be more common, such as sleepiness, because patients with spinal \ncord injury may be taking other medicines to treat, for example, pain or spasticity, that have \nsimilar side effects to Pregabalin and the severity of these effects may be increased when \ntaken together. \n\n \n\n• There have been reports of heart failure in some patients when taking Pregabalin Mylan; these \npatients were mostly elderly with cardiovascular conditions. Before taking this medicine \nyou should tell your doctor if you have a history of heart disease. \n \n\n• There have been reports of kidney failure in some patients when taking Pregabalin Mylan. If \nwhile taking Pregabalin Mylan you notice decreased urination, you should tell your doctor as \nstopping the medicine may improve this. \n \n\n• A small number of people being treated with anti-epileptics such as Pregabalin Mylan have \nhad thoughts of harming or killing themselves. If at any time you have these thoughts, \nimmediately contact your doctor. \n\n \n\n• When Pregabalin Mylan is taken with other medicines that may cause constipation (such as \nsome types of pain medicines) it is possible that gastrointestinal problems may occur (e.g., \nconstipation, blocked or paralysed bowel). Tell your doctor if you experience constipation, \nespecially if you are prone to this problem. \n\n \n\n\n\n68 \n \n\n• Before taking this medicine you should tell your doctor if you have a history of alcoholism or \nany drug abuse or dependence. Do not take more medicine than prescribed. \n \n\n• There have been reports of convulsions when taking Pregabalin Mylan or shortly after \nstopping Pregabalin Mylan. If you experience a convulsion, contact your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\n• There have been reports of reduction in brain function (encephalopathy) in some patients \ntaking Pregabalin Mylan when they have other conditions. Tell your doctor if  you have a \nhistory of any serious medical conditions, including liver or kidney disease. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n\nThe safety and efficacy in children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) has not been established \nand therefore, pregabalin should not be used in this age group. \n \n\nOther medicines and Pregabalin Mylan  \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregabalin Mylan and certain other medicines may influence each other (interaction). When taken \nwith certain other medicines, which have sedative effects (including opioids), Pregabalin Mylan may \npotentiate these effects and could lead to respiratory failure, coma and death. The degree of dizziness, \nsleepiness and decreased concentration may be increased if Pregabalin Mylan is taken together with \nmedicinal products containing: \n\n• Oxycodone – (used as a pain-killer) \n\n• Lorazepam – (used for treating anxiety) \n\n• Alcohol \n \nPregabalin Mylan may be taken with oral contraceptives. \n \nPregabalin Mylan with food, drink and alcohol \n\nPregabalin Mylan capsules may be taken with or without food. \nIt is advised not to drink alcohol while taking Pregabalin Mylan. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nPregabalin Mylan should not be taken during pregnancy or when breast-feeding, unless you are told \notherwise by your doctor. Effective contraception must be used by women of child-bearing potential. \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nPregabalin Mylan may produce dizziness, sleepiness and decreased concentration. You should not \ndrive, operate complex machinery or engage in other potentially hazardous activities until you know \nwhether this medicine affects your ability to perform these activities. \n \nSodium content \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule. That is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’ \n \n3. How to take Pregabalin Mylan  \n\n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nYour doctor will determine what dose is appropriate for you. \n\n\n\n69 \n \n\n \nPregabalin Mylan is for oral use only. \n \nPeripheral and central neuropathic pain, epilepsy or Generalised Anxiety Disorder: \n\n• Take the number of capsules as instructed by your doctor. \n\n• The dose, which has been adjusted for you and your condition, will generally be between \n150 mg and 600 mg each day. \n\n• Your doctor will tell you to take Pregabalin Mylan either twice or three times a day. For twice \na day take Pregabalin Mylan once in the morning and once in the evening, at about the same \ntime each day. For three times a day take Pregabalin Mylan once in the morning, once in the \nafternoon and once in the evening, at about the same time each day. \n\n \nIf you have the impression that the effect of Pregabalin Mylan is too strong or too weak, talk to your \ndoctor or pharmacist. \n \nIf you are an older patient (over 65 years of age), you should take Pregabalin Mylan normally except \nif you have problems with your kidneys. \nYour doctor may prescribe a different dosing schedule and/or dose if you have problems with your \nkidneys. \n \nSwallow the capsule whole with water. \nContinue taking Pregabalin Mylan until your doctor tells you to stop. \n \nIf you take more Pregabalin Mylan than you should \n\nCall your doctor or go to the nearest hospital emergency unit immediately. Take your box or bottle of \nPregabalin Mylan capsules with you. You may feel sleepy, confused, agitated, or restless as a result of \ntaking more Pregabalin Mylan than you should. Fits have also been reported. \n \nIf you forget to take Pregabalin Mylan  \nIt is important to take your Pregabalin Mylan capsules regularly at the same time each day. If you \nforget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it is time for your next dose. In that case, \njust carry on with the next dose as normal. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.  \n \nIf you stop taking Pregabalin Mylan  \nDo not stop taking Pregabalin Mylan unless your doctor tells you to.
