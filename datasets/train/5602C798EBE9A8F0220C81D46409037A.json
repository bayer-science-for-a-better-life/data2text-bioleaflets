PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSuspension for injection.\nWhite liquid suspension.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTrumenba is indicated for active immunisation of individuals 10 years and older to prevent invasive \nmeningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B.\n\nSee section 5.1 for information on the immune response against specific serogroup B strains.\n\nThe use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nPrimary series\n2 doses: (0.5 ml each) administered at a 6 month interval (see section 5.1).\n\n3 doses: 2 doses (0.5 ml each) administered at least 1 month apart, followed by a third dose at least\n4 months after the second dose (see section 5.1).\n\n\n\n3\n\nBooster dose\nA booster dose should be considered following either dosing regimen for individuals at continued risk \nof invasive meningococcal disease (see section 5.1).\n\nOther paediatric populations\nSafety and efficacy of Trumenba in children younger than 10 years of age have not been established.\nCurrently available data for children 1 to 9 years of age are described in sections 4.8 and 5.1; however,\nno recommendation on a posology can be made as data are limited.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nFor intramuscular injection only. The preferred site for injection is the deltoid muscle of the upper \narm.\n\nFor instructions on the handling of the vaccine before administration, see section 6.6.\n\nThere are no data available on the interchangeability of Trumenba with other meningococcal group B \nvaccines to complete the vaccination series.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nAppropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an \nanaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.\n\nAs with other injectable vaccines, syncope (fainting) can occur in association with administration of \nTrumenba. Procedures should be in place to avoid injury from fainting.\n\nVaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe febrile illness. \nHowever, the presence of a minor infection, such as cold, should not result in the deferral of \nvaccination.\n\nDo not inject intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously.\n\nTrumenba should not be given to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder that \nwould contraindicate intramuscular injection, unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs the risk of \nadministration.\n\nPersons with familial complement deficiencies (for example, C5 or C3 deficiencies) and persons \nreceiving treatments that inhibit terminal complement activation (for example, eculizumab) are at \nincreased risk for invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B, even if they develop \nantibodies following vaccination with Trumenba.\n\nAs with any vaccine, vaccination with Trumenba may not protect all vaccine recipients. \n\nLimitations of clinical trials\nThere are no data on the use of Trumenba in immunocompromised individuals. Immunocompromised \nindividuals, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may have a diminished \nimmune response to Trumenba.\n\n\n\n4\n\nThere are limited data on the use of Trumenba in individuals 40 to 65 years of age and there are no \ndata on the use of Trumenba in individuals older than 65 years of age.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nTrumenba can be given concomitantly with any of the following vaccines: Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced \nDiphtheria Toxoid, Acellular Pertussis, and Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine (TdaP-IPV), Quadrivalent \nHuman Papillomavirus vaccine (HPV4), Meningococcal Serogroups A, C, W, Y conjugate vaccine \n(MenACWY) and Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid, and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine \nAdsorbed (Tdap).\n\nWhen given concomitantly with other vaccines Trumenba must be administered at a separate injection\nsite.\n\nTrumenba should not be mixed with other vaccines in the same syringe.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no data from the use of Trumenba in pregnant women. The potential risk for pregnant \nwomen is unknown. Nevertheless, vaccination should not be withheld when there is a clear risk of \nexposure to meningococcal infection.\n\nReproduction studies performed in female rabbits have revealed no evidence of impaired female \nfertility or harm to the foetus due to Trumenba. \n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether Trumenba is excreted in human milk. Trumenba should only be used during \nbreast-feeding when the possible advantages outweigh the potential risks.\n\nFertility\n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility in females (see \nsection 5.3).\n\nTrumenba has not been evaluated for impairment of fertility in males.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nTrumenba has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of \nthe effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe safety profile presented is based on analysis of over 15,500 subjects (1 year of age and older) who \nhave been vaccinated with at least 1 dose of Trumenba in completed clinical studies. \n\nIn over 15,000 individuals \u2265 10 years of age studied, the most common adverse reactions were\nheadache, diarrhoea, nausea, muscle pain, joint pain, fatigue, chills, and injection site pain, swelling \nand redness.\n\n\n\n5\n\nAdverse reactions following booster vaccination in 301 subjects 15 to 23 years of age were similar to \nadverse reactions during the primary Trumenba vaccination series approximately 4 years earlier.\n\nList of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions reported in clinical studies of subjects 10 years of age and older are listed in \ndecreasing order of frequency and seriousness.\n\nVery common (\u2265 1/10)\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10)\nUncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100)\nRare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000)\nVery rare (< 1/10,000) \nNot known (cannot be estimated from available data)\n\nImmune system disorder\nNot known: Allergic reactions*\n\nNervous system disorders\nVery Common: Headache\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\nVery Common: Diarrhoea; nausea\nCommon: Vomiting\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\nVery Common: Muscle pain (myalgia); joint pain (arthralgia)\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nVery Common: Chills; fatigue; redness (erythema), swelling (induration) and pain at injection site\nCommon: Fever \u2265 38 \u00b0C (Pyrexia)\n\n* The following is considered an adverse reaction for Trumenba and was reported in the \npostmarketing experience. Because this reaction was derived from spontaneous reports, the frequency \ncould not be determined and is thus considered as not known.\n\nIn a study of 220 toddlers 1 to < 2 years of age, the following adverse reactions occurred at a \nfrequency of very common (\u2265 1/10): drowsiness, irritability (fussiness), loss of or decreased appetite, \nfever, and injection site pain, swelling and redness.\n\nIn a study of 294 children 2 to 9 years of age, the following adverse reactions occurred at a frequency \nof very common (\u2265 1/10): headache, diarrhoea, vomiting, muscle pain, joint pain, fever, fatigue, and\ninjection site pain, swelling and redness.\n\nIn clinical studies, fever (\u2265 38\u00b0C) occurred more frequently as subject age decreased. Of subjects 1 to \n< 2 years of age, 37.3% reported fever; of subjects 2 to 9 years of age, 24.5% reported fever; of \nsubjects 10 to 18 years of age, 9.8% reported fever; and of subjects 18 to 25 years of age, 4.4% \nreported fever. Fever followed a predictable pattern after vaccination: onset occurred within 2 to \n4 days, lasted 1 day, and was mild to moderate in severity. Fever rate and severity tended to decrease \nwith subsequent Trumenba vaccinations.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nExperience of overdose is limited. In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible \nsymptomatic treatment is recommended.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines; ATC code: J07AH09\n\nMechanism of action\n\nTrumenba is a vaccine composed of 2 recombinant lipidated factor H binding protein (fHbp) variants. \nfHbp is found on the surface of meningococcal bacteria and is essential for bacteria to avoid host \nimmune defenses. fHbp variants segregate into 2 immunologically distinct subfamilies, A and B, and \nover 96% of meningococcal serogroup B isolates in Europe express fHbp variants from either \nsubfamily on the bacterial surface.\n\nImmunisation with Trumenba, which contains one fHbp variant each from subfamily A and B, is \nintended to stimulate the production of bactericidal antibodies that recognize fHbp expressed by \nmeningococci. The Meningococcal Antigen Surface Expression (MEASURE) assay was developed to \nrelate the level of fHbp surface expression to killing of meningococcal serogroup B strains in serum \nbactericidal assays with human complement (hSBAs). A survey of over 2,150 different invasive \nmeningococcal serogroup B isolates collected from 2000-2014 in 7 European countries, the US and \nCanada demonstrated that over 91% of all meningococcal serogroup B isolates expressed sufficient \nlevels of fHbp to be susceptible to bactericidal killing by vaccine-induced antibodies.\n\nClinical efficacy \n\nThe efficacy of Trumenba has not been evaluated through clinical trials. Vaccine efficacy has been \ninferred by demonstrating the induction of serum bactericidal antibody responses to 4 meningococcal \nserogroup B test strains (see the Immunogenicity section). The 4 test strains express fHbp variants \nrepresenting the 2 subfamilies (A and B) and, when taken together, are representative of\nmeningococcal serogroup B strains causing invasive disease. \n\nImmunogenicity \n\nProtection against invasive meningococcal disease is mediated by serum bactericidal antibodies to \nbacterial surface antigens. Bactericidal antibodies act in concert with human complement to kill \nmeningococci. This process is measured in vitro with hSBA for meningococcal serogroup B. An \nhSBA titre of greater than or equal 1:4 is assumed to be protective against meningococcal disease. In \nthe immunogenicity analysis for Trumenba, a response was defined as an hSBA titre of at least 1:8 or \n1:16 depending on the hSBA strain. A 4-fold increase in hSBA titre for each of the 4 primary \nmeningococcal serogroup B test strains was defined as follows: (1) For subjects with a baseline hSBA \ntitre < 1:4, a 4-fold response was defined as an hSBA titre \u2265 1:16. (2) For subjects with a baseline \nhSBA titre \u2265 1:4, a 4-fold response was defined as an hSBA titre \u2265 4 times the lower limit of \nquantitation or \u2265 4 times the baseline titre, whichever was higher. A composite response was defined \nas a response for all 4 hSBA strains combined.\n\nImmunogenicity in individuals 10 years of age and older\n\nThe immunogenicity of Trumenba following 2 or 3 vaccinations was evaluated in individuals 11 to \n18 years of age in Europe (Study B1971012) and following 3 vaccinations in individuals 10 to \n25 years of age globally (Studies B1971009 and B1971016). \n\n\n\n7\n\nIn Study B1971012, Trumenba was administered according to the following schedules: Group 1 (0, 1, \nand 6 months); Group 2 (0, 2, and 6 months); Group 3 (0 and 6 months); Group 4 (0 and 2 months); \nGroup 5 (0 and 4 months). Of the 1,713 subjects randomised, 427 were in Group 1, 430 were in \nGroup 2, 427 were in Group 3, 286 were in Group 4, and 143 were in Group 5. All subjects received \n4 study injections, either 2 or 3 doses of Trumenba and 1 or 2 doses of saline. The hSBA responses \nobserved after the second or third dose for Groups 1, 2, and 3 are presented in Tables 1 and 2.\n\nFor the second and third doses, serum was obtained approximately 1 month after the second or third \nvaccination dose.\n\nTable 1: Immune Responses Among Individuals 11 to 18 Years of Age Administered \nTrumenba After Various 2- and 3-Dose Schedules (Study B1971012)\n\nGroup 1 Group 2 Group 3\n(0, 1, and 6 Months) (0, 2, and 6 Months) (0 and 6 Months)\nN %\n\n(95% CI)\nN %\n\n(95% CI)\nN %\n\n(95% CI)\nhSBA Strain (fHbp\nVariant)\n                        Dose\n\nPMB80 \n(A22)\n\n% hSBA \u2265 1:16 \n\nDose 2 351\n73.5\n\n(68.6, 78.0)\n344\n\n88.1\n(84.2, 91.3)\n\n369\n93.2\n\n(90.2, 95.6)\n\nDose 3 360\n91.4\n\n(88.0, 94.1)\n357\n\n95.0\n(92.1, 97.0)\n\n-- --\n\n\u2265 4-Fold rise in hSBA titre (%)\n\nDose 2 343\n55.7\n\n(50.3, 61.0)\n336\n\n73.8\n(68.8, 78.4)\n\n362\n80.7\n\n(76.2, 84.6)\n\nDose 3 351\n78.1\n\n(73.4, 82.3)\n349\n\n84.0\n(79.7, 87.6)\n\n-- --\n\nPMB2001 \n(A56)\n\n% hSBA \u2265 1:8\n\nDose 2 353\n96.6\n\n(94.1, 98.2)\n339\n\n97.9\n(95.8, 99.2)\n\n370\n98.4\n\n(96.5, 99.4)\n\nDose 3 362\n99.4\n\n(98.0, 99.9)\n359\n\n98.9\n(97.2, 99.7)\n\n-- --\n\n\u2265 4-Fold rise in hSBA titre (%)\n\nDose 2 338\n86.1\n\n(81.9, 89.6)\n327\n\n90.5 \n(86.8, 93.5)\n\n354\n90.4\n\n(86.8, 93.3)\n\nDose 3 347\n93.4\n\n(90.2, 95.8)\n347\n\n94.2\n(91.2, 96.4)\n\n-- --\n\nPMB2948 \n(B24)\n\n% hSBA \u2265 1:8\n\nDose 2 344\n62.2\n\n(56.9, 67.4)\n337\n\n70.3\n(65.1, 75.2)\n\n359\n81.1\n\n(76.6, 85.0)\n\nDose 3 354\n89.0\n\n(85.2, 92.0)\n354\n\n88.4\n(84.6, 91.6)\n\n-- --\n\n\u2265 4-Fold rise in hSBA titre (%)\n\nDose 2 341\n47.2\n\n(41.8, 52.7)\n333\n\n54.1\n(48.5, 59.5)\n\n357\n65.5\n\n(60.4, 70.5)\n\nDose 3 351\n74.6\n\n(69.8, 79.1)\n350\n\n75.4\n(70.6, 79.8)\n\n-- --\n\nPMB2707 \n(B44)\n\n% hSBA \u2265 1:8\n\nDose 2 341\n54.0\n\n(48.5, 59.3)\n331\n\n61.9\n(56.5, 67.2)\n\n356\n77.5\n\n(72.8, 81.8)\n\nDose 3 356\n88.5\n\n(84.7, 91.6)\n352\n\n86.1\n(82.0, 89.5)\n\n-- --\n\n\u2265 4-Fold rise in hSBA titre (%)\n\n\n\n8\n\nTable 1: Immune Responses Among Individuals 11 to 18 Years of Age Administered \nTrumenba After Various 2- and 3-Dose Schedules (Study B1971012)\n\nGroup 1 Group 2 Group 3\n(0, 1, and 6 Months) (0, 2, and 6 Months) (0 and 6 Months)\nN %\n\n(95% CI)\nN %\n\n(95% CI)\nN %\n\n(95% CI)\n\nDose 2 339\n43.4\n\n(38.0, 48.8)\n328\n\n55.2\n(49.6, 60.6)\n\n355\n66.8\n\n(61.6, 71.6)\n\nDose 3 354\n82.2\n\n(77.8, 86.0)\n349\n\n81.7\n(77.2, 85.6)\n\n-- --\n\nComposite response (A response for all 4 hSBA strains combined)\nBefore \nDose 1\n\n339\n3.5\n\n(1.8, 6.1)\n333\n\n2.4\n(1.0, 4.7)\n\n345\n3.2\n\n(1.6, 5.6)\n\nDose 2 308\n45.1\n\n(39.5, 50.9)\n311\n\n54.3\n(48.6, 60.0)\n\n343\n73.5\n\n(68.5, 78.1)\n\nDose 3 337\n83.1\n\n(78.6, 86.9)\n345\n\n81.7\n(77.3, 85.7)\n\n-- --\n\nAbbreviations: hSBA=serum bactericidal assay using human complement; fHbp=factor H binding \nprotein.\nNote: The lower limit of quantitation is an hSBA titre=1:16 for PMB80 (A22) and 1:8 for \nPMB2001 (A56), PMB2948 (B24), and PMB2707 (B44).\n\nTable 2: Immune Responses Among Individuals 11 to 18 Years of Age Administered \nTrumenba After Various 2- and 3-Dose Schedules (Study B1971012)\n\nGroup 1 Group 2 Group 3\n(0, 1, and 6 Months) (0, 2, and 6 Months) (0 and 6 Months)\n\nN\nGMT\n\n(95% CI)\nN\n\nGMT\n(95% CI)\n\nN\nGMT\n\n(95% CI)\nhSBA Strain \n(fHbp Variant)\n                    Dose\n\nPMB80 \n(A22) \n\nhSBA GMT\n\nDose 2 351\n29.0\n\n(26.0, 32.5)\n344\n\n35.6\n(32.2, 39.4)\n\n369\n50.6\n\n(45.9, 55.8)\n\nDose 3 360\n58.4 \n\n(52.4, 64.9)\n357\n\n58.3 \n(53.2, 63.9)\n\n--\n\nPMB2001 \n(A56)\n\nhSBA GMT\n\nDose 2 353\n77.3\n\n(68.5, 87.1)\n339\n\n94.6\n(84.6, 105.7)\n\n370\n125.6\n\n(112.6, 140.2)\n\nDose 3 362\n152.9\n\n(137.2, 170.5)\n359\n\n155.6\n(140.4, 172.4)\n\n-- --\n\nPMB2948 \n(B24)\n\nhSBA GMT\n\nDose 2 344\n13.8\n\n(12.2, 15.6)\n337\n\n14.9\n(13.2, 16.7)\n\n359\n20.6\n\n(18.4, 23.2)\n\nDose 3 354\n29.1\n\n(25.9, 32.7)\n354\n\n25.6\n(23.0, 28.5)\n\n-- --\n\nPMB2707 \n(B44)\n\nhSBA GMT\n\nDose 2 341\n13.1\n\n(11.3, 15.1)\n331\n\n15.5\n(13.5, 17.9)\n\n356\n22.5\n\n(19.6, 25.7)\n\nDose 3 356\n40.3\n\n(35.2, 46.1)\n352\n\n35.0\n(30.6, 39.9)\n\n-- --\n\nAbbreviations: GMT=geometric mean titre; hSBA=serum bactericidal assay using human complement;\nfHbp=factor H binding protein.\n\nStudy B1971009 was a Phase 3, randomised, active-controlled, observer-blinded, multicentre trial in \nwhich subjects 10 to 18 years of age received 1 of 3 lots (Groups 1, 2, and 3) of Trumenba or the \n\n\n\n9\n\nactive control hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine/saline.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you or your child receives this vaccine because it contains \nimportant information for you or your child\n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This vaccine has been prescribed for you or your child only.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Trumenba is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you or your child receives Trumenba\n3. How Trumenba is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Trumenba \n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Trumenba is and what it is used for\n\nTrumenba is a vaccine to prevent invasive meningococcal disease, caused by Neisseria meningitidis \nserogroup B, for use in people 10 years and older. This is a type of bacteria that can cause serious and \nsometimes life threatening infections such as meningitis (inflammation of the covering of the brain \nand spinal cord) and sepsis (blood poisoning).\n\nThe vaccine contains 2 important components from the surface of the bacteria. \n\nThe vaccine works by helping the body to make antibodies (the body\u2019s natural defences) which protect \nyou or your child against this disease. \n\n2. What you need to know before you or your child receives Trumenba\n\nTrumenba should not be given\n- if you or your child are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before vaccination with Trumenba.
