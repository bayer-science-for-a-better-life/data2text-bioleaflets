NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nYellox 0.9 mg/ml eye drops solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 ml of solution contains 0.9 mg bromfenac (as sodium sesquihydrate).  \nOne drop contains approximately 33 micrograms bromfenac. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect:  \nEach ml of solution contains 50 micrograms of benzalkonium chloride. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nEye drops, solution. \nClear yellow solution. \npH: 8.1-8.5; osmolality: 270-330 mOsmol/kg \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nYellox is indicated in adults for the treatment of postoperative ocular inflammation following cataract \nextraction . \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nUse in adults, including the elderly \nThe dose is one drop of Yellox in the affected eye(s) twice daily, beginning the next day after cataract \nsurgery and continuing through the first 2 weeks of the postoperative period.  \n \nThe treatment should not exceed 2 weeks as safety data beyond this is not available. \n \nHepatic and renal impairment \nYellox has not been studied in patients with hepatic disease or renal impairment. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of bromfenac in paediatric patients has not been established. No data are \navailable. \n \nMethod of administration \nFor ocular use. \n \nIf more than one topical ophtalmic medicinal product is being used, each one should be administered \nat least 5 minutes apart. \n \nTo prevent contamination of the dropper-tip and solution, care must be taken not to touch the eyelids, \nsurrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper-tip of the bottle \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity  to  bromfenac or  to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to other non-\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs). \nYellox is contraindicated in patients in whom attacks of asthma, urticaria or acute rhinitis are \nprecipitated by acetylsalicylic acid or by other medicinal products with prostaglandin synthetase \ninhibiting activity. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAll topical NSAIDs may slow or delay healing like topical corticosteroids. Concomitant use of \nNSAIDs and topical steroids may increase the potential for healing problems. \n \nCross-sensitivity \nThere is the potential for cross-sensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid, phenylacetic acid derivatives, and \nother NSAIDs. Therefore, treating individuals who have previously exhibited sensitivities to these \nmedicinal products has to be avoided (see section 4.3). \n \nSusceptible persons \nIn susceptible patients, continued use of topical NSAIDs, including bromfenac may result in epithelial \nbreakdown, corneal thinning, corneal erosion, corneal ulceration or corneal perforation. These events \nmay be sight threatening. Patients with evidence of corneal epithelial breakdown should immediately \ndiscontinue use of topical NSAIDs and should be closely monitored for corneal health. Consequently \nin at risk patients concomitant use of ophthalmic corticosteroids with NSAIDs may lead to a higher \nrisk of corneal adverse events. \n \nPostmarketing experience \nPostmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs suggests that patients with complicated ocular \nsurgeries, corneal denervation, corneal epithelial defects, diabetes mellitus and ocular surface diseases \ne.g. dry eye syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis or repeat ocular surgeries within a short period of time \nmay be at increased risk for corneal adverse reactions which may become sight threatening. Topical \nNSAIDs should be used with caution in these patients. \n \nThere have been reports that ophthalmic NSAIDs may cause increased bleeding of ocular tissues \n(including hyphaema) in conjunction with ocular surgery. Yellox should be used with caution in \npatients with known bleeding tendencies or who are receiving other medicinal products which may \nprolong bleeding time. \n \nIt has been observed in rare cases that upon withdrawal of Yellox, a flare-up of the inflammatory \nresponse, e.g. in the form of macular oedema, due to the cataract operation may occur. \n \nOcular infection \nAn acute ocular infection may be masked by the topical use of anti-inflammatory medicinal products. \n \nUse of contact lenses \nIn general, contact lens wear is not recommended during the postoperative period following cataract \nsurgery. Therefore, patients should be advised not to wear contact lenses during treatment with Yellox. \n \nExcipients \nSince Yellox contains benzalkonium chloride, close monitoring is required with frequent or prolonged \nuse.  \nBenzalkonium chloride is known to discolour soft contact lenses. Contact with soft contact lenses \nmust be avoided. \nBenzalkonium chloride has been reported to cause eye irritation, punctuate keratopathy and/or toxic \nulcerative keratopathy.  \nYellox contains sodium sulphite which may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic \nsymptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in susceptible patients. \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. No interactions with antibiotic eye drops used in \nconjunction with surgery have been reported.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of bromfenac in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Since the \nsystemic exposure in non-pregnant women is negligible after treatment with Yellox, the risk during \npregnancy could be considered low.  \n \nHowever, because of the known effects of prostaglandin biosynthesis-inhibiting medicinal products on \nthe foetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), the use of Yellox during third trimester \npregnancy should be avoided. The use of Yellox is in general not recommended during pregnancy \nunless the benefit outweighs the potential risk. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether bromfenac or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Animal studies have \nshown excretion of bromfenac in the milk of rats following very high oral doses (see section 5.3). No \neffects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the \nbreastfeeding woman to bromfenac is negligible. Yellox can be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \nNo effects of bromfenac on the fertility were observed in animal studies. In addition the systemic \nexposure to bromfenac is negligible; for this reason no pregnancy testing or contraceptive measures \nare required. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nYellox has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Transient blurring of vision may \noccur on instillation. If blurred vision occurs at instillation patients should be advised to refrain from \ndriving or using machines until vision is clear. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nBased on clinical data available, a total of 3.4% of patients experienced one or more adverse reactions. \nThe most common or most important reactions in the pooled studies were abnormal sensation in eye \n(0.5%), corneal erosion (mild or moderate) (0.4%), eye pruritus (0.4%), eye pain (0.3%) and eye \nredness (0.3%). Corneal adverse reactions were only observed in the Japanese population. Adverse \nreactions rarely led to withdrawal, with a total of 8 (0.8%) patients who prematurely discontinued \ntreatment in a study due to an adverse reaction. These comprised 3 (0.3%) patients with mild corneal \nerosion, 2 (0.2%) patients with eyelid oedema and 1 (0.1%) patient each with abnormal sensation in \neye, corneal oedema, or eye pruritus.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following adverse reactions were classified according to the following convention: Very common \n(≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); \nvery rare (<1/10,000).  Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \nThe table below describes adverse reactions by system organ class and frequency. \n \nMedDRA system organ Frequency Adverse reactions \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nclass \nEye disorders Uncommon  Visual acuity reduced \n\nHaemorrhagic retinopathy \nCorneal epithelium defect** \nCorneal erosion (mild or moderate) \nCorneal epithelium disorder \nCorneal oedema \nRetinal exudates \nEye pain \nEyelid bleeding \nVision blurred \nPhotophobia  \nEyelid oedema \nEye discharge \nEye pruritus \nEye irritation \nEye redness \nConjunctival hyperaemia \nAbnormal sensation in eye \nOcular discomfort \n\nRare Corneal perforation* \nCorneal ulcer* \nCorneal erosion, serious* \nScleromalacia* \nCorneal infiltrates* \nCorneal disorder * \nCorneal scar* \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nUncommon  Epistaxis \nCough \nNasal sinus drainage \n\nRare Asthma* \nGeneral disorders and \nadministrative site \nconditions \n\nUncommon  Face swelling \n\n*Serious reports from post-marketing experience of more than 20 million patients \n** Observed with four times daily dose  \n \nPatients with evidence of corneal epithelial breakdown should be instructed to immediately \ndiscontinue use of Yellox and should be monitored closely for corneal health (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo abnormal findings or adverse reactions of clinical concern were noted upon administration of two \ndrops 2mg/ml solution four times a day for the period of up to 28 days. Accidental administration of \nmore than one drop should not result in increased topical exposure as excessive volume would rinse \nout of the eye due to limited conjunctival sac capacity. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nThere is practically no risk of adverse effects due to accidental oral ingestion. Ingestion of the 5 ml \nbottle content corresponds to an oral dose of less than 5 mg bromfenac, which is 30 times lower than \ndaily dose of bromfenac oral formulation formerly used.  \nIf Yellox is accidentally ingested, fluids should be taken to dilute the medicinal product. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Ophtalmologicals, Antiinflammatory agents, non-steroids, ATC code: \nS01BC11. \n \nMechanism of action \nBromfenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that has anti-inflammatory activity \nwhich is thought to be due to its ability to block prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting primarily \ncyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). Cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) is only inhibited to a small extent.  \nIn vitro, bromfenac inhibited the synthesis of prostaglandins in the rabbit iris ciliary body. The IC50-\nvalues were lower for Bromfenac (1.1 μM) than for indometacin (4.2 μM) and pranoprofen (11.9 μM) \nBromfenac at concentrations of 0.02%, 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2% inhibited almost all signs of ocular \ninflammation in an experimental uveitis model in rabbits. \n \nClinical efficacy \nTwo Phase II multicentre, randomised, double-masked, parallel group studies were conducted in \nJapan, and two Phase III multicentre, randomised (2:1), double-masked, parallel group, placebo-\ncontrolled studies were conducted in the US to assess the clinical safety and efficacy of Yellox dosed \ntwice daily in the treatment of post-operative inflammation in patients undergoing cataract surgery. In \nthese studies, study substance was administered approximately 24 hours after cataract surgery and \ncontinued for up to 14 days. Treatment effect was evaluated up to 29 days. \nA significantly greater proportion of patients in the Yellox group 64.0% vs. 43.3% in the placebo \ngroup (p<0.0001) experienced complete clearance of ocular inflammation at study day 15. There was \nsignificantly less anterior chamber cells and flare within the first 2 weeks post-surgery (85.1% of \npatients with flare score of ≤1) vs. placebo (52%). The difference in the rate of inflammation clearance \nshowed as early as day 3. \nIn a large, well-controlled study that was conducted in Japan, Yellox was shown to be as effective as \npranoprofen ophthalmic solution. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nYellox in all subsets of the paediatric population in postoperative ocular inflammation (see section 4.2 \nfor information on paediatric use) \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nBromfenac efficiently permeates the cornea of cataract patients: A single dose resulted in a mean peak \naqueous humour concentrations of 79±68 ng/ml at 150-180 minutes after dosing. Concentrations were \nmaintained for 12 hours in aqueous humour with measurable levels up to 24 hours in major ocular \ntissues including the retina. Following twice daily dosing with bromfenac eye drops plasma \nconcentrations were not quantifiable. \n \nDistribution \nBromfenac shows high binding to plasma proteins. In vitro, the 99.8% were bound to proteins in \nhuman plasma. \nNo biological relevant melanin binding was observed in vitro. \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nStudies in rabbits using radio-labelled bromfenac have demonstrated that highest concentrations after \ntopical administration are observed in the cornea followed by the conjunctiva and the aqueous \nhumour. Only low concentrations were observed in the lens and vitreous. \n \nBiotransformation \nIn vitro studies indicate that bromfenac is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9, which is absent in both \niris-ciliary body and retina/choroid and the level of this enzyme in the cornea is less than 1% \ncompared to the corresponding hepatic level. \nIn orally treated humans unchanged parent compound is the major component in plasma. Several \nconjugated and unconjugated metabolites have been identified with the cyclic amide being the major \nurinary metabolite. \n \nElimination \nAfter ocular administration the half-life of bromfenac in aqueous humour is 1.4 h indicating rapid \nelimination. \nAfter oral administration of 14C-bromfenac to healthy volunteers, urinary excretion was found to be \nthe major route of radioactive excretions, accounting for approximately 82% while faecal excretion \nrepresented approximately 13% of the dose. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety, \npharmacology, ‘repeated-dose’ toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. However, \n0.9 mg/kg/day in rats at oral doses (900 times the recommended ophthalmic dose) caused embryo-\nfoetal lethality, increased neonatal mortality, and reduced postnatal growth. Pregnant rabbits treated \norally with 7.5 mg/kg/day (7500 times the recommended ophthalmic dose) caused increased post-\nimplantation loss (see section 4.6). \n \nAnimal studies have shown excretion of bromfenac in breast milk when applied orally at doses of \n2.35 mg/kg which is 2350 times the recommended ophthalmic dose. However, following ocular \nadministration plasma levels were not detectable (see section 5.2). \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1.What Yellox is and what it is used for  \n \nYellox contains bromfenac and belongs to a group of medicines called non-steroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It works by blocking certain substances involved in causing \ninflammation.  \nYellox is used to reduce eye inflammation following cataract surgery in adults. \n \n \n2.

Examples of NSAIDs are: acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, \ndiclofenac.  \n\n \nWarning and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist  before using this medicine \n- if you are using topical steroids (e.g. cortisone), as this may cause unwanted side effects.  \n- if you have bleeding problems (e.g. haemophilia) or have had them in the past, or you are taking \n\nother medicines which may prolong bleeding time (e.g. warfarin, clopidogrel, acetylsalicylic \nacid). \n\n- if you have eye problems (e.g. dry eye syndrome, corneal problems). \n- if you have diabetes. \n- if you have rheumatoid arthritis. \n- if you had repeated eye surgery within a short period of time. \n \nWearing contact lenses is not recommended after cataract surgery. Therefore, do not wear contact \nlenses whilst using Yellox. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\nChildren and adolescents \nYellox should not be used in children and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and Yellox  \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  \n \nPregnancy , breastfeeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask  \nyour doctor for advice  before you use Yellox. \nYellox should not be used during the last three months of pregnancy.
