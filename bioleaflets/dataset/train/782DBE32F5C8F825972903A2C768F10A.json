This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \n\nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nRistempa 6 mg solution for injection. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach pre-filled syringe contains 6 mg of pegfilgrastim* in 0.6 ml solution for injection.  The \n\nconcentration is 10 mg/ml based on protein only**. \n\n \n\n*Produced in Escherichia coli cells by recombinant DNA technology followed by conjugation with \n\npolyethylene glycol (PEG). \n\n** The concentration is 20 mg/ml if the PEG moiety is included. \n\n \n\nThe potency of this product should not be compared to the potency of another pegylated or non-\n\npegylated protein of the same therapeutic class. For more information, see section 5.1 \n\n \n\nExcipient(s) with known effect:  \n\nEach pre-filled syringe contains 30 mg sorbitol (E420) \n\nEach pre-filled syringe contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nSolution for injection.  \n\n \n\nClear, colourless solution for injection.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nReduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients \n\ntreated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia \n\nand myelodysplastic syndromes). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nRistempa therapy should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in oncology and/or \n\nhaematology. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nOne 6 mg dose (a single pre-filled syringe) of Ristempa is recommended for each chemotherapy cycle, \n\ngiven at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy.   \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nRistempa is injected subcutaneously. The injections should be given into the thigh, abdomen or upper \n\narm. For instructions on handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Ristempa in children has not yet been established. Currently available data \n\nare described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made  \n \n\nPatients with renal impairment \n\n \n\nNo dose change is recommended in patients with renal impairment, including those with end stage \n\nrenal disease. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nLimited clinical data suggest a comparable effect on time to recovery of severe neutropenia for \n\npegfilgrastim to filgrastim in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (see section 5.1).  \n\nHowever, the long-term effects of Ristempa have not been established in acute myeloid leukaemia; \n\ntherefore, it should be used with caution in this patient population. \n\n \n\nGranulocyte-colony stimulating factor can promote growth of myeloid cells in vitro and similar effects \n\nmay be seen on some non-myeloid cells in vitro.  \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Ristempa have not been investigated in patients with myelodysplastic \n\nsyndrome, chronic myelogenous leukaemia, and in patients with secondary Acute Myeloid Leukaemia \n\n(AML); therefore, it should not be used in such patients. Particular care should be taken to distinguish \n\nthe diagnosis of blast transformation of chronic myeloid leukaemia from acute myeloid leukaemia.    \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Ristempa administration in de novo AML patients aged \uf03c 55 years with \n\ncytogenetics t(15;17) have not been established. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Ristempa have not been investigated in patients receiving high dose \n\nchemotherapy. This medicinal product should not be used to increase the dose of cytotoxic \n\nchemotherapy beyond established dosage regimens. \n\n \n\nPulmonary adverse events \n\n \n\nUncommon (\u22651/1,000 to < 1/100) pulmonary adverse reactions, in particular interstitial pneumonia, \n\nhave been reported after G-CSF administration. Patients with a recent history of pulmonary infiltrates \n\nor pneumonia may be at higher risk (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nThe onset of pulmonary signs such as cough, fever, and dyspnoea in association with radiological \n\nsigns of pulmonary infiltrates, and deterioration in pulmonary function along with increased neutrophil \n\ncount may be preliminary signs of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). In such \n\ncircumstances Ristempa should be discontinued at the discretion of the physician and the appropriate \n\ntreatment given (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n \n\nGlomerulonephritis \n\n \n\nGlomerulonephritis has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim and pegfilgrastim. Generally, \n\nevents of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose reduction or withdrawal of filgrastim and \n\npegfilgrastim. Urinalysis monitoring is recommended. \n\n \nCapillary leak syndrome  \n\n \n\nCapillary leak syndrome has been reported after granulocyte-colony stimulating factor administration \n\nand is characterised by hypotension, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema and hemoconcentration. Patients \n\nwho develop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard \n\nsymptomatic treatment, which may include a need for intensive care (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nSplenomegaly and splenic rupture  \n\n \n\nUncommon but generally asymptomatic cases of splenomegaly and uncommon cases of splenic \n\nrupture, including some fatal cases, have been reported following administration of pegfilgrastim (see \n\nsection 4.8). Therefore, spleen size should be carefully monitored (e.g. clinical examination, \n\nultrasound). A diagnosis of splenic rupture should be considered in patients reporting left upper \n\nabdominal pain or shoulder tip pain. \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia and anaemia \n\n \n\nTreatment with Ristempa alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia because full dose \n\nmyelosuppressive chemotherapy is maintained on the prescribed schedule. Regular monitoring of \n\nplatelet count and haematocrit is recommended. Special care should be taken when administering \n\nsingle or combination chemotherapeutic agents which are known to cause severe thrombocytopenia. \n\n \n\nSickle cell anaemia  \n\n \n\nSickle cell crises have been associated with the use of pegfilgrastim in patients with sickle cell trait or \n\nsickle cell disease (see section 4.8).  Therefore, physicians should use caution when prescribing \n\nRistempa in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease, should monitor appropriate clinical \n\nparameters and laboratory status and be attentive to the possible association of this medicine with \n\nsplenic enlargement and vaso-occlusive crisis. \n\n \n\nLeukocytosis  \n\n \n\nWhite blood cell (WBC) counts of 100 x 109/l or greater have been observed in less than 1% of \n\npatients receiving Ristempa.  No adverse events directly attributable to this degree of leukocytosis \n\nhave been reported.  Such elevation in white blood cells is transient, typically seen 24 to 48 hours after \n\nadministration and is consistent with the pharmacodynamic effects of this medicine.  Consistent with \n\nthe clinical effects and the potential for leukocytosis, a WBC count should be performed at regular \n\nintervals during therapy. If leukocyte counts exceed 50 x 109/l after the expected nadir, this medicine \n\nshould be discontinued immediately. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reactions, occurring on initial or subsequent treatment have \n\nbeen reported in patients treated with Ristempa. Permanently discontinue Ristempa in patients with \n\nclinically significant hypersensitivity. Do not administer Ristempa to patients with a history of \n\nhypersensitivity to pegfilgrastim or filgrastim. If a serious allergic reaction occurs, appropriate therapy \nshould be administered, with close patient follow-up over several days.   \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n \n\nImmunogenicity  \n\n \n\nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Rates of generation of \n\nantibodies against pegfilgrastim is generally low.  Binding antibodies do occur as expected with all \n\nbiologics; however, they have not been associated with neutralising activity at present.  \n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Ristempa for the mobilisation of blood progenitor cells in patients or \n\nhealthy donors has not been adequately evaluated.  \n\n \n\nThe needle cap of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may \n\ncause allergic reactions. \n\n \n\nIncreased haematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been \n\nassociated with transient positive bone imaging findings. This should be considered when interpreting \n\nbone-imaging results. \n\n \n\nRistempa contains sorbitol.  Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not \n\ntake this medicine. \n\n \n\nRistempa contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per 6 mg dose, i.e. essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSFs), the trade \n\nname of the administered product should be clearly recorded in the patient file. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nDue to the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy\u201a Ristempa \n\nshould be administered at least 24 hours after administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy.  In clinical \n\ntrials, Ristempa has been safely administered 14 days before chemotherapy. Concomitant use of \n\nRistempa with any chemotherapy agent has not been evaluated in patients. In animal models \n\nconcomitant administration of Ristempa and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or other antimetabolites has been \n\nshown to potentiate myelosuppression. \n\n \n\nPossible interactions with other haematopoietic growth factors and cytokines have not been \n\nspecifically investigated in clinical trials.  \n\n \n\nThe potential for interaction with lithium, which also promotes the release of neutrophils, has not been \n\nspecifically investigated. There is no evidence that such an interaction would be harmful. \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Ristempa have not been evaluated in patients receiving chemotherapy \n\nassociated with delayed myelosuppression e.g., nitrosoureas. \n\n \n\nSpecific interaction or metabolism studies have not been performed, however, clinical trials have not \n\nindicated an interaction of Ristempa with any other medicinal products.  \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of pegfilgrastim in pregnant women.  Studies in \n\nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Ristempa is not recommended during \n\npregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n\n \n\nWomen who become pregnant during Ristempa treatment are encouraged to enrol in Amgen\u2019s \n\nPregnancy Surveillance Programme. Contact details are provided in section 6 of the Package leaflet. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nThere is insufficient information on the excretion of Ristempa / metabolites in human milk, a risk to \n\nthe newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \n\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Ristempa therapy taking into account the benefit of \n\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.   \n\n \n\nWomen who are breast-feeding during Ristempa treatment are encouraged to enrol in Amgen\u2019s \n\nLactation Surveillance programme. Contact details are provided in section 6 of the Package leaflet.  \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nPegfilgrastim did not affect reproductive performance or fertility in male or female rats at cumulative \n\nweekly doses approximately 6 to 9 times higher than the recommended human dose (based on body \n\nsurface area) (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nRistempa has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were bone pain (very common [\u2265 1/10]) and \n\nmusculoskeletal pain (common).  Bone pain was generally of mild to moderate severity, transient and \n\ncould be controlled in most patients with standard analgesics.  \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity-type reactions, including skin rash, urticaria, angioedema, dyspnoea, erythaema, \n\nflushing, and hypotension occurred on initial or subsequent treatment with Ristempa (uncommon \n\n[\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100]).  Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis can occur in patients \n\nreceiving Ristempa (uncommon) (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nCapillary Leak Syndrome, which can be life-threatening if treatment is delayed, has been reported as \n\nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100) in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy following \n\nadministration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors; see section 4.4 and section \u201cDescription of \n\nselected adverse reactions\u201d below. \n\n \n\nSplenomegaly, generally asymptomatic, is uncommon.   \n\n \n\nSplenic rupture including some fatal cases is uncommonly reported following administration of \n\npegfilgrastim (see section 4.4).   \n\n  \n\nUncommon pulmonary adverse reactions including interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, \n\npulmonary infiltrates and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported. Uncommonly, cases have resulted in \n\nrespiratory failure or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which may be fatal (see section \n\n4.4). \n\n \n\nIsolated cases of sickle cell crises have been reported in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell \n\ndisease (uncommon in sickle cell patients) (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe data in the table below describe adverse reactions reported from clinical trials and spontaneous \n\nreporting.

The frequency category was estimated from a statistical \n\ncalculation based upon 1576 patients receiving Ristempa in nine randomized clinical trials. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nUncommon cases of Sweet\u2019s syndrome have been reported, although in some cases underlying \n\nhaematological malignancies may play a role.   \n\n \n\nUncommon events of cutaneous vasculitis have been reported in patients treated with Ristempa. The \n\nmechanism of vasculitis in patients receiving Ristempa is unknown. \n\n \n\nInjection site reactions, including injection site erythaema (uncommon (\u2265 1/1000 to < 1/100)) as well \n\nas injection site pain (common events \u2265 1/100 to < 1/10) have occurred on initial or subsequent \n\ntreatment with Ristempa. \n\n \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10) cases of leukocytosis (White Blood Count [WBC] > 100 x 109/l) have \n\nbeen reported (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nReversible, mild to moderate elevations in uric acid and alkaline phosphatase, with no associated \n\nclinical effects, were uncommon; reversible, mild to moderate elevations in lactate dehydrogenase, \n\nwith no associated clinical effects, were uncommon in patients receiving Ristempa following cytotoxic \n\nchemotherapy.  \n\n \n\nNausea and headaches were very commonly observed in patients receiving chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nUncommon elevations in liver function tests (LFTs) for ALT (alanine aminotransferase) or AST \n\n(aspartate aminotransferase), have been observed in patients after receiving pegfilgrastim following \n\ncytotoxic chemotherapy. These elevations are transient and return to baseline. \n\n \n\nCommon cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported. \n\n \n\nCases of capillary leak syndrome have been reported in the post marketing setting with granulocyte \n\ncolony-stimulating factor use. These have generally occurred in patients with advanced malignant \n\ndiseases, sepsis, taking multiple chemotherapy medications or undergoing apheresis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe experience in children is limited. A higher frequency of serious adverse reactions in younger \n\nchildren aged 0-5 years (92%) has been observed compared to older children aged 6-11 and 12-21 \n\nyears respectively (80% and 67%) and adults. The most common adverse reaction reported was bone \n\npain (see section 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.

The adverse \n\nevents were similar to those in subjects receiving lower doses of pegfilgrastim. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, colony stimulating factor; ATC Code:  L03AA13 \n\n \n\nHuman granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a glycoprotein, which regulates the \n\nproduction and release of neutrophils from the bone marrow.  Pegfilgrastim is a covalent conjugate of \n\nrecombinant human G-CSF (r-metHuG-CSF) with a single 20 kd polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule.  \n\nPegfilgrastim is a sustained duration form of filgrastim due to decreased renal clearance.  \n\nPegfilgrastim and filgrastim have been shown to have identical modes of action, causing a marked \n\nincrease in peripheral blood neutrophil counts within 24 hours, with minor increases in monocytes \n\nand/or lymphocytes.  Similarly to filgrastim, neutrophils produced in response to pegfilgrastim show \n\nnormal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic function.  As \n\nwith other haematopoietic growth factors, G-CSF has shown in vitro stimulating properties on human \n\nendothelial cells.  G-CSF can promote growth of myeloid cells, including malignant cells, in vitro and \n\nsimilar effects may be seen on some non-myeloid cells in vitro. \n\n \n\nIn two randomised, double-blind, pivotal studies in patients with high risk stage II-IV breast cancer \n\nundergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin and docetaxel, use of \n\npegfilgrastim, as a single once per cycle dose, reduced the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of \n\nfebrile neutropenia similarly to that observed with daily administrations of filgrastim (a median of 11 \n\ndaily administrations). In the absence of growth factor support, this regimen has been reported to result \n\nin a mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia of 5 to7 days, and a 30-40% incidence of febrile \n\nneutropenia. In one study (n = 157), which used a 6mg fixed dose of pegfilgrastim the mean duration \n\nof grade 4 neutropenia for the pegfilgrastim group was 1.8 days compared with 1.6 days in the \n\nfilgrastim group (difference 0.23 days, 95% CI -0.15, 0.63). Over the entire study, the rate of febrile \n\nneutropenia was 13% of pegfilgrastim-treated patients compared with 20% of filgrastim-treated \n\npatients (difference 7%, 95% CI of -19%, 5%). In a second study (n = 310), which used a weight-\n\nadjusted dose (100 \u03bcg /kg), the mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia for the pegfilgrastim group was \n\n1.7 days, compared with 1.8 days in the filgrastim group (difference 0.03 days, 95% CI -0.36, 0.30). \n\nThe overall rate of febrile neutropenia was 9% of patients treated with pegfilgrastim and 18% of \n\npatients treated with filgrastim (difference 9%, 95% CI of -16.8%,-1.1%). \n\n \n\nIn a placebo-controlled, double blind study in patients with breast cancer the effect of pegfilgrastim on \n\nthe incidence of febrile neutropenia was evaluated following administration of a chemotherapy \n\nregimen associated with a febrile neutropenia rate of 10-20% (docetaxel 100 mg/m2  every 3 weeks for \n\n4 cycles). Nine hundred and twenty eight patients were randomised to receive either a single dose of \n\npegfilgrastim or placebo approximately 24 hours (Day 2) after chemotherapy in each cycle. The \n\nincidence of febrile neutropenia was lower for patients randomised to receive pegfilgrastim compared \n\nwith placebo (1% versus 17%, p < 0.001). The incidence of hospitalisations and IV anti-infective use \n\nassociated with a clinical diagnosis of febrile neutropenia was lower in the pegfilgrastim group \n\ncompared with placebo (1% versus 14%, p \uf03c 0.001; and 2% versus 10%, p \uf03c 0.001). \n\n \nA small (n = 83), Phase II, randomised, double-blind study in patients receiving chemotherapy for de \n\nnovo acute myeloid leukaemia compared pegfilgrastim (single dose of 6 mg) with filgrastim, \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n \n\nadministered during induction chemotherapy. Median time to recovery from severe neutropenia was \n\nestimated as 22 days in both treatment groups. Long term outcome was not studied (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nIn a phase II (n = 37) multicentre, randomised, open-label study of paediatric sarcoma patients \n\nreceiving 100 \u03bcg/kg pegfilgrastim following cycle 1 of vincristine, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide \n\n(VAdriaC/IE) chemotherapy, a longer duration of severe neutropenia (neutrophils < 0.5 x 109) was \n\nobserved in younger children aged 0-5 yrs (8.9 days) compared to older children aged 6-11 years and \n\n12-21 years (6 days and 3.7 days, respectively) and adults. Additionally a higher incidence of febrile \nneutropenia was observed in younger children aged 0-5 yrs (75%) compared to older children aged \n\n6-11 years and 12-21 years (70% and 33%, respectively) and adults (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAfter a single subcutaneous dose of pegfilgrastim, the peak serum concentration of pegfilgrastim \n\noccurs at 16 to 120 hours after dosing and serum concentrations of pegfilgrastim are maintained during \n\nthe period of neutropenia after myelosuppressive chemotherapy.  The elimination of pegfilgrastim is \n\nnon-linear with respect to dose; serum clearance of pegfilgrastim decreases with increasing dose.    \n\nPegfilgrastim appears to be mainly eliminated by neutrophil mediated clearance, which becomes \n\nsaturated at higher doses.  Consistent with a self-regulating clearance mechanism, the serum \n\nconcentration of pegfilgrastim declines rapidly at the onset of neutrophil recovery (see figure 1). \n\n \n\nFigure 1.

In an open label, single dose study (n = 31) \n\nvarious stages of renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease, had no impact on the \n\npharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim. \n\n \n\nElderly people \n\n \n\nLimited data indicate that the pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim in elderly subjects (> 65 years) is \n\nsimilar to that in adults.  \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim were studied in 37 paediatric patients with sarcoma, who \n\nreceived 100 \u03bcg/kg pegfilgrastim after the completion of VAdriaC/IE chemotherapy.  The youngest \n\nage group (0-5 years) had a higher mean exposure to pegfilgrastim (AUC) (\u00b1 Standard Deviation) \n\n(47.9 \u00b1 22.5 \u03bcg\u00b7hr/ml) than older children aged 6-11 years and 12-21 years (22.0 \u00b1 13.1 \u03bcg\u00b7hr/ml and \n\n29.3 \u00b1 23.2 \u03bcg\u00b7hr/ml, respectively) (see section 5.1). With the exception of the youngest age group \n\n(0-5 years), the mean AUC in paediatric subjects appeared similar to that for adult patients with \n\nhigh-risk stage II-IV breast cancer and receiving 100 \u03bcg/kg pegfilgrastim after the completion of \n\ndoxorubicin/docetaxel (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).  \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nPreclinical data from conventional studies of repeated dose toxicity revealed the expected \n\npharmacological effects including increases in leukocyte count, myeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow, \n\nextramedullary haematopoiesis and splenic enlargement.  \n\n \n\nThere were no adverse effects observed in offspring from pregnant rats given pegfilgrastim \n\nsubcutaneously, but in rabbits pegfilgrastim has been shown to cause embryo/foetal toxicity (embryo \n\nloss) at cumulative doses approximately 4 times the recommended human dose, which were not seen \n\nwhen pregnant rabbits were exposed to the recommended human dose. In rat studies, it was shown that \n\npegfilgrastim may cross the placenta. Studies in rats indicated that reproductive performance, fertility, \n\noestrous cycling, days between pairing and coitus, and intrauterine survival were unaffected by \n\npegfilgrastim given subcutaneously. The relevance of these findings for humans is not known.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What Ristempa is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nRistempa contains the active substance pegfilgrastim. Pegfilgrastim is a protein produced by \n\nbiotechnology in bacteria called E. coli.  It belongs to a group of proteins called cytokines, and is very \n\nsimilar to a natural protein (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) produced by your own body.  \n\n \n\nRistempa is used to reduce the duration of neutropenia (low white blood cell count) and the occurrence \n\nof febrile neutropenia (low white blood cell count with a fever) which can be caused by the use of \n\ncytotoxic chemotherapy (medicines that destroy rapidly growing cells).  White blood cells are \n\nimportant as they help your body fight infection.  These cells are very sensitive to the effects of \n\nchemotherapy which can cause the number of these cells in your body to decrease.  If white blood \n\ncells fall to a low level there may not be enough left in the body to fight bacteria and you may have an \n\nincreased risk of infection. \n\n \n\nYour doctor has given you Ristempa to encourage your bone marrow (part of the bone which makes \n\nblood cells) to produce more white blood cells that help your body fight infection.   \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Ristempa \n\n \n\nDo not use Ristempa \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to pegfilgrastim, filgrastim, E. coli derived proteins, or any of the other \ningredients of this medicine. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Ristempa: \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 if you experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty \nbreathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), redness and flushing, skin rash and areas of the \n\nskin that itch \n\n\uf0b7 have an allergy to latex.

It is important \n\nthat you do not try to give yourself the injection unless you have received training from your doctor, \n\nnurse, or pharmacist. If you have questions about how to inject, please ask your doctor, nurse, \n\npharmacist for assistance. \n\n \n\nHow do you, or the person injecting you, use Ristempa pre-filled syringe? \n\n \n\nYou will need to give yourself the injection into the tissue just under the skin.  This is known as a \n\nsubcutaneous injection. \n\n \n\nEquipment that you need \n\n \n\nTo give yourself a subcutaneous injection you will need:  \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 a pre-filled syringe of Ristempa; and \n\n\uf0b7 alcohol wipes or similar. \n \n\nWhat should I do before I give myself a subcutaneous injection of Ristempa? \n\n \n\n1. Remove from the refrigerator. \n \n\n2. Do not shake the pre-filled syringe. \n \n\n3. Do not remove the cap from the syringe until you are ready to inject. \n \n\n4. Check the expiry date on the pre-filled syringe label (EXP).  Do not use it if the date has passed \nthe last day of the month shown. \n\n \n\n5. Check the appearance of Ristempa.  It must be a clear and colourless liquid.  If there are \nparticles in it, you must not use it. \n\n \n\n6. For a more comfortable injection, let the pre-filled syringe stand for 30 minutes to reach room \ntemperature or hold the pre-filled syringe gently in your hand for a few minutes.  Do not warm \n\nRistempa in any other way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water). \n\n \n\n7. Wash your hands thoroughly. \n\n \n\n8. Find a comfortable, well-lit, clean surface and put all the equipment you need within reach. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n \n\n33 \n \n\nHow do I prepare my Ristempa injection? \n\n \n\nBefore you inject Ristempa you must do the following: \n\n \n\n1. Hold the syringe barrel and gently take the cap from the needle \nwithout twisting.  Pull straight as shown in pictures 1 and 2.  Do \n\nnot touch the needle or push the plunger. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2. You may notice a small air bubble in the pre-filled syringe. You do not have to remove the air \nbubble before injecting. Injecting the solution with the air bubble is harmless. \n\n \n\n3. You can now use the pre-filled syringe. \n\n \n\nWhere should I give my injection? \n\n \n\n \n\nThe most suitable places to inject yourself are: \n\n\uf0b7 the top of your thighs; and \n\n\uf0b7 the abdomen, except for the area around the navel. \nIf someone else is injecting you, they can also use the back of your arms. \n\n \n\nHow do I give my injection? \n\n \n\n1. Clean your skin by using an alcohol wipe. \n\n \n2. Pinch (without squeezing) the skin using your thumb and forefinger. Insert the needle into the \n\nskin. \n\n \n3. Push the plunger down with a slow constant pressure. Push the plunger all the way down as far \n\nas it will go to inject all the liquid. \n\n \n\n4. After injecting the liquid, remove the needle and let go of your skin. \n \n\n5. If you notice a spot of blood at the injection site dab with a cotton ball or tissues.  Do not rub the \ninjection site.  If needed, you may cover the injection site with a plaster. \n\n \n\n6. Do not use any Ristempa that is left in the syringe. \n\n \n\nRemember  \n\n \n\nOnly use each syringe for one injection.  If you have any problems, please ask your doctor or nurse for \n\nhelp and advice. \n\n \n\nDisposing of used syringes \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Do not put the cap back on used needles. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Keep used syringes out of the sight and reach of children. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n \n\n\uf0b7 The used syringe should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

What Ristempa is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nRistempa contains the active substance pegfilgrastim.  Pegfilgrastim is a protein produced by \n\nbiotechnology in bacteria called E. coli.  It belongs to a group of proteins called cytokines, and is very \n\nsimilar to a natural protein (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) produced by your own body.  \n\n \n\nRistempa is used to reduce the duration of neutropenia (low white blood cell count) and the occurrence \n\nof febrile neutropenia (low white blood cell count with a fever) which can be caused by the use of \n\ncytotoxic chemotherapy (medicines that destroy rapidly growing cells).  White blood cells are \n\nimportant as they help your body fight infection.  These cells are very sensitive to the effects of \n\nchemotherapy which can cause the number of these cells in your body to decrease.  If white blood \n\ncells fall to a low level there may not be enough left in the body to fight bacteria and you may have an \n\nincreased risk of infection. \n\n \n\nYour doctor has given you Ristempa to encourage your bone marrow (part of the bone which makes \n\nblood cells) to produce more white blood cells that help your body fight infection.   \n\n \n\n \n\n2.

use of cytotoxic chemotherapy (medicines that destroy rapidly growing cells). white blood cells are important as they help your body fight infection. these cells are very sensitive to the effects of chemotherapy which can cause the number of these cells in your body to decrease. if white blood cells fall to a low level there may not be enough left in the body to fight bacteria and you may have an increased risk of infection. your doctor has given you ristempa to encourage your bone marrow (part of the bone which makes blood cells) to produce more white blood cells that help your body fight infection.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "ristempa", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 2, "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 8, "Score": 0.39626339077949524, "Text":
