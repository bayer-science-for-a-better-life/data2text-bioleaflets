CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. \n\nSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia in patients with idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s \n\ndisease. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment \n\nof Alzheimer\u2019s dementia or dementia associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Diagnosis should be made \n\naccording to current guidelines. Therapy with rivastigmine should only be started if a caregiver is \n\navailable who will regularly monitor intake of the medicinal product by the patient. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nRivastigmine should be administered twice a day, with morning and evening meals. The capsules should \n\nbe swallowed whole. \n\n \n\nInitial dose \n\n1.5 mg twice a day. \n\n \n\nDose titration \n\nThe starting dose is 1.5 mg twice a day. If this dose is well tolerated after a minimum of two weeks of \n\ntreatment, the dose may be increased to 3 mg twice a day. Subsequent increases to 4.5 mg and then 6 mg \n\ntwice a day should also be based on good tolerability of the current dose and may be considered after a \n\nminimum of two weeks of treatment at that dose level. \n\n \n\nIf adverse reactions (e.g. nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or loss of appetite), weight decrease or \n\nworsening of extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g. tremor) in patients with dementia associated with \n\nParkinson\u2019s disease are observed during treatment, these may respond to omitting one or more doses. If \n\nadverse reactions persist, the daily dose should be temporarily reduced to the previous well-tolerated \n\ndose or the treatment may be discontinued. \n\n \n\nMaintenance dose \n\nThe effective dose is 3 to 6 mg twice a day; to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit patients should be \n\nmaintained on their highest well tolerated dose. The recommended maximum daily dose is 6 mg twice a \n\nday. \n\n \n\nMaintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit for the patient exists. \n\nTherefore, the clinical benefit of rivastigmine should be reassessed on a regular basis, especially for \n\npatients treated at doses less than 3 mg twice a day. If after 3 months of maintenance dose treatment the \n\npatient\u2019s rate of decline in dementia symptoms is not altered favourably, the treatment should be \n\ndiscontinued. Discontinuation should also be considered when evidence of a therapeutic effect is no \n\nlonger present. \n\n \n\nIndividual response to rivastigmine cannot be predicted. However, a greater treatment effect was seen in \n\nParkinson\u2019s disease patients with moderate dementia. Similarly a larger effect was observed in \n\nParkinson\u2019s disease patients with visual hallucinations (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nTreatment effect has not been studied in placebo-controlled trials beyond 6 months. \n\n \n\nRe-initiation of therapy \n\nIf treatment is interrupted for more than three days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily. \n\nDose titration should then be carried out as described above. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment. \n\nHowever, due to increased exposure in these populations dosing recommendations to titrate according to \n\nindividual tolerability should be closely followed as patients with clinically significant renal or hepatic \n\nimpairment might experience more dose-dependent adverse reactions. Patients with severe hepatic \n\nimpairment have not been studied, however, Prometax capsules may be used in this patient population \n\nprovided close monitoring is exercised (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of Prometax in the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s \n\ndisease. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance rivastigmine, to other carbamate derivatives or to any of the \n\nexcipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nPrevious history of application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis with rivastigmine \n\npatch (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nThe incidence and severity of adverse reactions generally increase with higher doses. If treatment is \n\ninterrupted for more than three days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily to reduce the \n\npossibility of adverse reactions (e.g. vomiting). \n\n \n\nSkin application site reactions may occur with rivastigmine patch and are usually mild or moderate in \n\nintensity. These reactions are not in themselves an indication of sensitisation. However, use of \n\nrivastigmine patch may lead to allergic contact dermatitis. \n\n \n\nAllergic contact dermatitis should be suspected if application site reactions spread beyond the patch \n\nsize, if there is evidence of a more intense local reaction (e.g. increasing erythema, oedema, papules, \n\nvesicles) and if symptoms do not significantly improve within 48 hours after patch removal. In these \n\ncases, treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nPatients who develop application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis to rivastigmine \n\npatch and who still require rivastigmine treatment should only be switched to oral rivastigmine after \n\nnegative allergy testing and under close medical supervision. It is possible that some patients \n\nsensitised to rivastigmine by exposure to rivastigmine patch may not be able to take rivastigmine in \n\nany form. \n\n \n\nThere have been rare post-marketing reports of patients experiencing allergic dermatitis \n\n(disseminated) when administered rivastigmine irrespective of the route of administration (oral, \n\ntransdermal). In these cases, treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nPatients and caregivers should be instructed accordingly. \n\n \n\nDose titration: Adverse reactions (e.g. hypertension and hallucinations in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s \n\ndementia and worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms, in particular tremor, in patients with dementia \n\nassociated with Parkinson\u2019s disease) have been observed shortly after dose increase. They may \n\nrespond to a dose reduction. In other cases, Prometax has been discontinued (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nGastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are dose-related, and may occur \n\nparticularly when initiating treatment and/or increasing the dose (see section 4.8). These adverse \n\nreactions occur more commonly in women. Patients who show signs or symptoms of dehydration \n\nresulting from prolonged vomiting or diarrhoea can be managed with intravenous fluids and dose \n\nreduction or discontinuation if recognised and treated promptly. Dehydration can be associated with \n\nserious outcomes. \n\n \n\nPatients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease may lose weight. Cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, \n\nhave been associated with weight loss in these patients. During therapy patient\u2019s weight should be \n\nmonitored. \n\n \n\nIn case of severe vomiting associated with rivastigmine treatment, appropriate dose adjustments as \n\nrecommended in section 4.2 must be made. Some cases of severe vomiting were associated with \n\noesophageal rupture (see section 4.8). Such events appeared to occur particularly after dose increments \n\nor high doses of rivastigmine. \n\n \n\nRivastigmine may cause bradycardia which constitutes a risk factor in the occurrence of torsade de \n\npointes, predominantly in patients with risk factors. Caution is advised in patients at higher risk of \n\ndeveloping torsade de pointes; for example, those with uncompensated heart failure, recent myocardial \n\ninfarction, bradyarrhythmias, a predisposition to hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia, or concomitant \n\nuse with medicinal products known to induce QT prolongation and/or torsade de pointes (see sections \n\n4.5 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nCare must be taken when using rivastigmine in patients with sick sinus syndrome or conduction defects \n\n(sino-atrial block, atrio-ventricular block) (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nRivastigmine may cause increased gastric acid secretions. Care should be exercised in treating patients \n\nwith active gastric or duodenal ulcers or patients predisposed to these conditions. \n\n \n\nCholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or \n\nobstructive pulmonary disease. \n\n \n\nCholinomimetics may induce or exacerbate urinary obstruction and seizures. Caution is recommended in \n\ntreating patients predisposed to such diseases. \n\n \n\nThe use of rivastigmine in patients with severe dementia of Alzheimer\u2019s disease or associated with \n\nParkinson\u2019s disease, other types of dementia or other types of memory impairment (e.g. age-related \n\ncognitive decline) has not been investigated and therefore use in these patient populations is not \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nLike other cholinomimetics, rivastigmine may exacerbate or induce extrapyramidal symptoms. \n\nWorsening (including bradykinesia, dyskinesia, gait abnormality) and an increased incidence or severity \n\nof tremor have been observed in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease (see section \n\n4.8). These events led to the discontinuation of rivastigmine in some cases (e.g. discontinuations due to \n\ntremor 1.7% on rivastigmine vs 0% on placebo). Clinical monitoring is recommended for these adverse \n\nreactions. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nPatients with clinically significant renal or hepatic impairment might experience more adverse reactions \n\n(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Dosing recommendations to titrate according to individual tolerability must be \n\nclosely followed. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. However, Prometax \n\nmay be used in this patient population and close monitoring is necessary. \n\n \n\nPatients with body weight below 50 kg may experience more adverse reactions and may be more likely \n\nto discontinue due to adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nAs a cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine may exaggerate the effects of succinylcholine-type muscle \n\nrelaxants during anaesthesia. Caution is recommended when selecting anaesthetic agents. Possible dose \n\nadjustments or temporarily stopping treatment can be considered if needed. \n\n \n\nIn view of its pharmacodynamic effects and possible additive effects, rivastigmine should not be given \n\nconcomitantly with other cholinomimetic substances. Rivastigmine might interfere with the activity of \n\nanticholinergic medicinal products (e.g oxybutynin, tolterodine). \n\n \n\nAdditive effects leading to bradycardia (which may result in syncope) have been reported with the \n\ncombined use of various beta-blockers (including atenolol) and rivastigmine. Cardiovascular beta- \n\nblockers are expected to be associated with the greatest risk, but reports have also been received in \n\npatients using other beta-blockers. Therefore, caution should be exercised when rivastigmine is \n\ncombined with beta-blockers and also other bradycardia agents (e.g.class III antiarrhythmic agents, \n\ncalcium channel antagonists, digitalis glycoside, pilocarpin). \n\n \n\nSince bradycardia constitutes a risk factor in the occurrence of torsades de pointes, the combination of \n\nrivastigmine with torsades de pointes-inducing medicinal products such as antipsychotics i.e. some \n\nphenothiazines (chlorpromazine, levomepromazine), benzamides (sulpiride, sultopride, amisulpride, \n\ntiapride, veralipride), pimozide, haloperidol, droperidol, cisapride, citalopram, diphemanil, \n\nerythromycin IV, halofantrin, mizolastin, methadone, pentamidine and moxifloxacine should be \n\nobserved with caution and clinical monitoring (ECG) may also be required. \n\n \n\nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam or \n\nfluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is not \n\naffected by administration of rivastigmine. No untoward effects on cardiac conduction were observed \n\nfollowing concomitant administration of digoxin and rivastigmine. \n\n \n\nAccording to its metabolism, metabolic interactions with other medicinal products appear unlikely, \n\nalthough rivastigmine may inhibit the butyrylcholinesterase mediated metabolism of other substances. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nIn pregnant animals, rivastigmine and/or metabolites crossed the placenta. It is not known if this occurs \n\nin humans. No clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. In peri/postnatal studies in rats, an \n\nincreased gestation time was observed. Rivastigmine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly \n\nnecessary. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIn animals, rivastigmine is excreted in milk. It is not known if rivastigmine is excreted into human milk. \n\nTherefore, women on rivastigmine should not breast-feed. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nNo adverse effects of rivastigmine were observed on fertility or reproductive performance in rats (see \n\nsection 5.3). Effects of rivastigmine on human fertility are not known. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease may cause gradual impairment of driving performance or compromise the ability to \n\nuse machinery. Furthermore, rivastigmine can induce dizziness and somnolence, mainly when initiating \n\ntreatment or increasing the dose. As a consequence, rivastigmine has minor or moderate influence on the \n\nability to drive and use machines. Therefore, the ability of patients with dementia on rivastigmine to \n\ncontinue driving or operating complex machines should be routinely evaluated by the treating physician. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions (ADRs) are gastrointestinal, including nausea (38%) and \n\nvomiting (23%), especially during titration. Female patients in clinical studies were found to be more \n\nsusceptible than male patients to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and weight loss. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions in Table 1 and Table 2 are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and \n\nfrequency category. Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common \n\n(\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); \n\nvery rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions, listed below in Table 1, have been accumulated in patients with

medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nSymptoms \n\n \n\nMost cases of accidental overdose have not been associated with any clinical signs or symptoms and \n\nalmost all of the patients concerned continued rivastigmine treatment 24 hours after the overdose. \n\n \n\nCholinergic toxicity has been reported with muscarinic symptoms that are observed with moderate \n\npoisonings such as miosis, flushing, digestive disorders including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and \n\ndiarrhoea, bradycardia, bronchospasm and increased bronchial secretions, hyperhidrosis, involuntary \n\nurination and/or defecation, lacrimation, hypotension and salivary hypersecretion. \n\n \n\nIn more severe cases nicotinic effects might develop such as muscular weakness, fasciculations, seizures \n\nand respiratory arrest with possible fatal outcome. \n\n \n\nAdditionally there have been post-marketing cases of dizziness, tremor, headache, somnolence, \n\nconfusional state, hypertension, hallucinations and malaise. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\n \n\nAs rivastigmine has a plasma half-life of about 1 hour and a duration of acetylcholinesterase inhibition of \n\nabout 9 hours, it is recommended that in cases of asymptomatic overdose no further dose of rivastigmine \n\nshould be administered for the next 24 hours. In overdose accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting, \n\nthe use of antiemetics should be considered. Symptomatic treatment for other adverse reactions should \n\nbe given as necessary. \n\n \n\nIn massive overdose, atropine can be used. An initial dose of 0.03 mg/kg intravenous atropine sulphate is \n\nrecommended, with subsequent doses based on clinical response. Use of scopolamine as an antidote is \n\nnot recommended. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: psychoanaleptics, anticholinesterases, ATC code: N06DA03 \n\n \n\nRivastigmine is an acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor of the carbamate type, thought to \n\nfacilitate cholinergic neurotransmission by slowing the degradation of acetylcholine released by \n\nfunctionally intact cholinergic neurones. Thus, rivastigmine may have an ameliorative effect on \n\ncholinergic-mediated cognitive deficits in dementia associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and \n\nParkinson\u2019s disease. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nRivastigmine interacts with its target enzymes by forming a covalently bound complex that \n\ntemporarily inactivates the enzymes. In healthy young men, an oral 3 mg dose decreases \n\nacetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in CSF by approximately 40% within the first 1.5 hours after \n\nadministration. Activity of the enzyme returns to baseline levels about 9 hours after the maximum \n\ninhibitory effect has been achieved. In patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, inhibition of AChE in CSF \n\nby rivastigmine was dose-dependent up to 6 mg given twice daily, the highest dose tested. Inhibition \n\nof butyrylcholinesterase activity in CSF of 14 Alzheimer patients treated by rivastigmine was similar \n\nto that of AChE. \n\n \n\nClinical studies in Alzheimer\u2019s dementia \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of rivastigmine has been established through the use of three independent, domain \n\nspecific, assessment tools which were assessed at periodic intervals during 6 month treatment periods. \n\nThese include the ADAS-Cog (Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Assessment Scale \u2013 Cognitive subscale, a \n\nperformance based measure of cognition), the CIBIC-Plus (Clinician\u2019s Interview Based Impression of \n\nChange-Plus, a comprehensive global assessment of the patient by the physician incorporating \n\ncaregiver input), and the PDS (Progressive Deterioration Scale, a caregiver-rated assessment of the \n\nactivities of daily living including personal hygiene, feeding, dressing, household chores such as \n\nshopping, retention of ability to orient oneself to surroundings as well as involvement in activities \n\nrelating to finances, etc.). \n\n \n\nThe patients studied had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score of 10\u201324. \n\n \n\nThe results for clinically relevant responders pooled from two flexible dose studies out of the three \n\npivotal 26-week multicentre studies in patients with mild-to-moderately severe Alzheimer\u2019s Dementia, \n\nare provided in Table 4 below. Clinically relevant improvement in these studies was defined a priori as \n\nat least 4-point improvement on the ADAS-Cog, improvement on the CIBIC-Plus, or at least a 10% \n\nimprovement on the PDS. \n\n \n\nIn addition, a post-hoc definition of response is provided in the same table. The secondary definition \n\nof response required a 4-point or greater improvement on the ADAS-Cog, no worsening on the \n\nCIBIC-Plus, and no worsening on the PDS. The mean actual daily dose for responders in the 6\u201312 mg \n\ngroup, corresponding to this definition, was 9.3 mg. It is important to note that the scales used in this \n\nindication vary and direct comparisons of results for different therapeutic agents are not valid. \n\n \n\nTable 4 \n\n \n\n Patients with Clinically Significant Response (%) \n\n Intent to Treat Last Observation Carried \n\nForward \n\nResponse Measure Rivastigmine \n\n6\u201312 mg \n\nN=473 \n\nPlacebo \n\n \n\nN=472 \n\nRivastigmine \n\n6\u201312 mg \n\nN=379 \n\nPlacebo \n\n \n\nN=444 \n\nADAS-Cog: improvement \n\nof at least 4 points \n\n21*** \n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n25*** \n\n \n\n12 \n\nCIBIC-Plus: improvement 29*** 18 32*** 19 \n\nPDS: improvement of at \n\nleast 10% \n\n26*** 17 30*** 18 \n\nAt least 4 points \n\nimprovement on ADAS-\n\nCog with no worsening on \n\nCIBIC-Plus and PDS \n\n10* \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n12** \n\n \n\n6 \n\n*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nClinical studies in dementia associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of rivastigmine in dementia associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease has been demonstrated in \n\na 24-week multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled core study and its 24-week open-label \n\nextension phase.

Peak plasma concentrations are reached in \n\napproximately 1 hour. As a consequence of rivastigmine\u2019s interaction with its target enzyme, the \n\nincrease in bioavailability is about 1.5-fold greater than that expected from the increase in dose. Absolute \n\nbioavailability after a 3 mg dose is about 36%\uf0b113%. Administration of rivastigmine with food delays \n\nabsorption (tmax) by 90 min and lowers Cmax and increases AUC by approximately 30%. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nProtein binding of rivastigmine is approximately 40%. It readily crosses the blood brain barrier and has \n\nan apparent volume of distribution in the range of 1.8\u20132.7 l/kg. \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nBiotransformation \n\nRivastigmine is rapidly and extensively metabolised (half-life in plasma approximately 1 hour), \n\nprimarily via cholinesterase-mediated hydrolysis to the decarbamylated metabolite. In vitro, this \n\nmetabolite shows minimal inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (<10%). \n\nBased on in vitro studies, no pharmacokinetic interaction is expected with medicinal products \n\nmetabolised by the following cytochromes isoemzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2E1, \n\nCYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, or CYP2B6. Based on evidence from animal studies the major \n\ncytochrome P450 isoenzymes are minimally involved in rivastigmine metabolism. Total plasma \n\nclearance of rivastigmine was approximately 130 l/h after a 0.2 mg intravenous dose and decreased to \n\n70 l/h after a 2.7 mg intravenous dose. \n\nElimination \n\nUnchanged rivastigmine is not found in the urine; renal excretion of the metabolites is the major route of \n\nelimination. Following administration of 14C-rivastigmine, renal elimination was rapid and essentially \n\ncomplete (>90%) within 24 hours. Less than 1% of the administered dose is excreted in the faeces. There \n\nis no accumulation of rivastigmine or the decarbamylated metabolite in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s \n\ndisease. \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that nicotine use increases the oral clearance of \n\nrivastigmine by 23% in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (n=75 smokers and 549 non-smokers) \n\nfollowing rivastigmine oral capsule doses of up to 12 mg/day. \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \n\nWhile bioavailability of rivastigmine is greater in elderly than in young healthy volunteers, studies in \n\nAlzheimer patients aged between 50 and 92 years showed no change in bioavailability with age. \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe Cmax of rivastigmine was approximately 60% higher and the AUC of rivastigmine was more than \n\ntwice as high in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment than in healthy subjects. \n\nRenal impairment \n\nCmax and AUC of rivastigmine were more than twice as high in subjects with moderate renal impairment \n\ncompared with healthy subjects; however there were no changes in Cmax and AUC of rivastigmine in \n\nsubjects with severe renal impairment. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nRepeated-dose toxicity studies in rats, mice and dogs revealed only effects associated with an \n\nexaggerated pharmacological action. No target organ toxicity was observed. No safety margins to human \n\nexposure were achieved in the animal studies due to the sensitivity of the animal models used. \n\nRivastigmine was not mutagenic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests, except in a \n\nchromosomal aberration test in human peripheral lymphocytes at a dose 104 times the maximum clinical \n\nexposure. The in vivo micronucleus test was negative. The major metabolite NAP226-90 also did not \n\nshow a genotoxic potential. \n\nNo evidence of carcinogenicity was found in studies in mice and rats at the maximum tolerated dose, \n\nalthough the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was lower than the human exposure. When \n\nnormalised to body surface area, the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was approximately \n\nequivalent to the maximum recommended human dose of 12 mg/day; however, when compared to the \n\nmaximum human dose, a multiple of approximately 6-fold was achieved in animals. \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nIn animals, rivastigmine crosses the placenta and is excreted into milk. Oral studies in pregnant rats and \n\nrabbits gave no indication of teratogenic potential on the part of rivastigmine. In oral studies with male \n\nand female rats, no adverse effects of rivastigmine were observed on fertility or reproductive \n\nperformance of either the parent generation or the offspring of the parents. \n\n \n\nA mild eye/mucosal irritation potential of rivastigmine was identified in a rabbit study. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nOral solution \n\n \n\nClear, yellow solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. \n\nSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia in patients with idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s \n\ndisease. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment \n\nof Alzheimer\u2019s dementia or dementia associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Diagnosis should be made \n\naccording to current guidelines. Therapy with rivastigmine should only be started if a caregiver is \n\navailable who will regularly monitor intake of the medicinal product by the patient. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nRivastigmine oral solution should be administered twice a day, with morning and evening meals. The \n\nprescribed amount of solution should be withdrawn from the container using the oral dosing syringe \n\nsupplied. Rivastigmine oral solution may be swallowed directly from the syringe. Rivastigmine oral \n\nsolution and rivastigmine capsules may be interchanged at equal doses. \n\n \n\nInitial dose \n\n1.5 mg twice a day. \n\n \n\nDose titration \n\nThe starting dose is 1.5 mg twice a day. If this dose is well tolerated after a minimum of two weeks of \n\ntreatment, the dose may be increased to 3 mg twice a day. Subsequent increases to 4.5 mg and then 6 mg \n\ntwice a day should also be based on good tolerability of the current dose and may be considered after a \n\nminimum of two weeks of treatment at that dose level. \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nIf adverse reactions (e.g. nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or loss of appetite), weight decrease or \n\nworsening of extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g. tremor) in patients with dementia associated with \n\nParkinson\u2019s disease are observed during treatment, these may respond to omitting one or more doses. If \n\nadverse reactions persist, the daily dose should be temporarily reduced to the previous well-tolerated \n\ndose or the treatment may be discontinued. \n\nMaintenance dose \n\nThe effective dose is 3 to 6 mg twice a day; to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit patients should be \n\nmaintained on their highest well tolerated dose. The recommended maximum daily dose is 6 mg twice a \n\nday. \n\nMaintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit for the patient exists. \n\nTherefore, the clinical benefit of rivastigmine should be reassessed on a regular basis, especially for \n\npatients treated at doses less than 3 mg twice a day. If after 3 months of maintenance dose treatment the \n\npatient\u2019s rate of decline in dementia symptoms is not altered favourably, the treatment should be \n\ndiscontinued. Discontinuation should also be considered when evidence of a therapeutic effect is no \n\nlonger present. \n\nIndividual response to rivastigmine cannot be predicted. However, a greater treatment effect was seen in \n\nParkinson\u2019s disease patients with moderate dementia. Similarly a larger effect was observed in \n\nParkinson\u2019s disease patients with visual hallucinations (see section 5.1). \n\nTreatment effect has not been studied in placebo-controlled trials beyond 6 months. \n\nRe-initiation of therapy \n\nIf treatment is interrupted for more than three days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily. \n\nDose titration should then be carried out as described above. \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment. \n\nHowever, due to increased exposure in these populations dosing recommendations to titrate according to \n\nindividual tolerability should be closely followed as patients with clinically significant renal or hepatic \n\nimpairment might experience more dose-dependent adverse reactions. Patients with severe hepatic \n\nimpairment have not been studied, however, Prometax oral solution may be used in this patient \n\npopulation provided close monitoring is exercised (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of Prometax in the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s \n\ndisease. \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance rivastigmine, to other carbamate derivatives or to any of the \n\nexcipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nPrevious history of application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis with rivastigmine \n\npatch (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nThe incidence and severity of adverse reactions generally increase with higher doses. If treatment is \n\ninterrupted for more than three days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily to reduce the \n\npossibility of adverse reactions (e.g. vomiting). \n\n \n\nSkin application site reactions may occur with rivastigmine patch and are usually mild or moderate in \n\nintensity. These reactions are not in themselves an indication of sensitisation. However, use of \n\nrivastigmine patch may lead to allergic contact dermatitis. \n\n \n\nAllergic contact dermatitis should be suspected if application site reactions spread beyond the patch \n\nsize, if there is evidence of a more intense local reaction (e.g. increasing erythema, oedema, papules, \n\nvesicles) and if symptoms do not significantly improve within 48 hours after patch removal. In these \n\ncases, treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nPatients who develop application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis to rivastigmine \n\npatch and who still require rivastigmine treatment should only be switched to oral rivastigmine after \n\nnegative allergy testing and under close medical supervision. It is possible that some patients \n\nsensitised to rivastigmine by exposure to rivastigmine patch may not be able to take rivastigmine in \n\nany form. \n\n \n\nThere have been rare post-marketing reports of patients experiencing allergic dermatitis \n\n(disseminated) when administered rivastigmine irrespective of the route of administration (oral, \n\ntransdermal). In these cases, treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nPatients and caregivers should be instructed accordingly. \n\n \n\nDose titration: Adverse reactions (e.g. hypertension and hallucinations in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s \n\ndementia and worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms, in particular tremor, in patients with dementia \n\nassociated with Parkinson\u2019s disease) have been observed shortly after dose increase. They may \n\nrespond to a dose reduction. In other cases, Prometax has been discontinued (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are dose-related, and may occur \n\nparticularly when initiating treatment and/or increasing the dose (see section 4.8). These adverse \n\nreactions occur more commonly in women. Patients who show signs or symptoms of dehydration \n\nresulting from prolonged vomiting or diarrhoea can be managed with intravenous fluids and dose \n\nreduction or discontinuation if recognised and treated promptly. Dehydration can be associated with \n\nserious outcomes. \n\n \n\nPatients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease may lose weight. Cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, \n\nhave been associated with weight loss in these patients. During therapy patient\u2019s weight should be \n\nmonitored. \n\n \n\nIn case of severe vomiting associated with rivastigmine treatment, appropriate dose adjustments as \n\nrecommended in section 4.2 must be made. Some cases of severe vomiting were associated with \n\noesophageal rupture (see section 4.8). Such events appeared to occur particularly after dose increments \n\nor high doses of rivastigmine. \n\n \n\nRivastigmine may cause bradycardia which constitutes a risk factor in the occurrence of torsade de \n\npointes, predominantly in patients with risk factors. Caution is advised in patients at higher risk of \n\ndeveloping torsade de pointes; for example, those with uncompensated heart failure, recent myocardial \n\ninfarction, bradyarrhythmias, a predisposition to hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia, or concomitant \n\nuse with medicinal products known to induce QT prolongation and/or torsade de pointes (see sections \n\n4.5 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nCare must be taken when using rivastigmine in patients with sick sinus syndrome or conduction defects \n\n(sino-atrial block, atrio-ventricular block) (see section 4.8). \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\nRivastigmine may cause increased gastric acid secretions. Care should be exercised in treating patients \n\nwith active gastric or duodenal ulcers or patients predisposed to these conditions. \n\n \n\nCholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or \n\nobstructive pulmonary disease. \n\n \n\nCholinomimetics may induce or exacerbate urinary obstruction and seizures. Caution is recommended in \n\ntreating patients predisposed to such diseases. \n\n \n\nThe use of rivastigmine in patients with severe dementia of Alzheimer\u2019s disease or associated with \n\nParkinson\u2019s disease, other types of dementia or other types of memory impairment (e.g. age-related \n\ncognitive decline) has not been investigated and therefore use in these patient populations is not \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nLike other cholinomimetics, rivastigmine may exacerbate or induce extrapyramidal symptoms. \n\nWorsening (including bradykinesia, dyskinesia, gait abnormality) and an increased incidence or severity \n\nof tremor have been observed in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease (see section \n\n4.8). These events led to the discontinuation of rivastigmine in some cases (e.g. discontinuations due to \n\ntremor 1.7% on rivastigmine vs 0% on placebo). Clinical monitoring is recommended for these adverse \n\nreactions. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nPatients with clinically significant renal or hepatic impairment might experience more adverse reactions \n\n(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Dosing recommendations to titrate according to individual tolerability must be \n\nclosely followed. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. However, Prometax \n\nmay be used in this patient population and close monitoring is necessary. \n\n \n\nPatients with body weight below 50 kg may experience more adverse reactions and may be more likely \n\nto discontinue due to adverse reactions. \n\n \n\nExcipients with known effects \n\n \n\nOne of the excipients in Prometx oral solution is sodium benzoate. Benzoic acid is a mild irritant to the \n\nskin, eyes and mucous membrane. \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, that is to say essentially \n\n'sodium-free'. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nAs a cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine may exaggerate the effects of succinylcholine-type muscle \n\nrelaxants during anaesthesia. Caution is recommended when selecting anaesthetic agents. Possible dose \n\nadjustments or temporarily stopping treatment can be considered if needed. \n\n \n\nIn view of its pharmacodynamic effects and possible additive effects, rivastigmine should not be given \n\nconcomitantly with other cholinomimetic substances. Rivastigmine might interfere with the activity of \n\nanticholinergic medicinal products (e.g oxybutynin, tolterodine). \n\n \n\nAdditive effects leading to bradycardia (which may result in syncope) have been reported with the \n\ncombined use of various beta-blockers (including atenolol) and rivastigmine. Cardiovascular beta- \n\nblockers are expected to be associated with the greatest risk, but reports have also been received in \n\npatients using other beta- blockers. Therefore, caution should be exercised when rivastigmine is \n\ncombined with beta-blockers and also other bradycardia agents (e.g.class III antiarrhythmic agents, \n\ncalcium channel antagonists, digitalis glycoside, pilocarpin). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\nSince bradycardia constitutes a risk factor in the occurrence of torsades de pointes, the combination of \n\nrivastigmine with torsades de pointes-inducing medicinal products such as antipsychotics i.e. some \n\nphenothiazines (chlorpromazine, levomepromazine), benzamides (sulpiride, sultopride, amisulpride, \n\ntiapride, veralipride), pimozide, haloperidol, droperidol, cisapride, citalopram, diphemanil, \n\nerythromycin IV, halofantrin, mizolastin, methadone, pentamidine and moxifloxacine should be \n\nobserved with caution and clinical monitoring (ECG) may also be required. \n\n \n\nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam or \n\nfluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is not \n\naffected by administration of rivastigmine. No untoward effects on cardiac conduction were observed \n\nfollowing concomitant administration of digoxin and rivastigmine. \n\n \n\nAccording to its metabolism, metabolic interactions with other medicinal products appear unlikely, \n\nalthough rivastigmine may inhibit the butyrylcholinesterase mediated metabolism of other substances. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nIn pregnant animals, rivastigmine and/or metabolites crossed the placenta. It is not known if this occurs \n\nin humans. No clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. In peri/postnatal studies in rats, an \n\nincreased gestation time was observed. Rivastigmine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly \n\nnecessary. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIn animals, rivastigmine is excreted in milk. It is not known if rivastigmine is excreted into human milk. \n\nTherefore, women on rivastigmine should not breast-feed. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nNo adverse effects of rivastigmine were observed on fertility or reproductive performance in rats (see \n\nsection 5.3). Effects of rivastigmine on human fertility are not known. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease may cause gradual impairment of driving performance or compromise the ability to \n\nuse machinery. Furthermore, rivastigmine can induce dizziness and somnolence, mainly when initiating \n\ntreatment or increasing the dose. As a consequence, rivastigmine has minor or moderate influence on the \n\nability to drive and use machines. Therefore, the ability of patients with dementia on rivastigmine to \n\ncontinue driving or operating complex machines should be routinely evaluated by the treating physician. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n22 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions (ADRs) are gastrointestinal, including nausea (38%) and \n\nvomiting (23%), especially during titration. Female patients in clinical studies were found to be more \n\nsusceptible than male patients to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and weight loss. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions in Table 1 and Table 2 are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and \n\nfrequency category.

It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\nSymptoms \n\nMost cases of accidental overdose have not been associated with any clinical signs or symptoms and \n\nalmost all of the patients concerned continued rivastigmine treatment 24 hours after the overdose. \n\nCholinergic toxicity has been reported with muscarinic symptoms that are observed with moderate \n\npoisonings such as miosis, flushing, digestive disorders including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and \n\ndiarrhoea, bradycardia, bronchospasm and increased bronchial secretions, hyperhidrosis, involuntary \n\nurination and/or defecation, lacrimation, hypotension and salivary hypersecretion. \n\nIn more severe cases nicotinic effects might develop such as muscular weakness, fasciculations, seizures \n\nand respiratory arrest with possible fatal outcome. \n\nAdditionaly there have been post-marketing cases of dizziness, tremor, headache, somnolence, \n\nconfusional state, hypertension, hallucinations and malaise. \n\nManagement \n\nAs rivastigmine has a plasma half-life of about 1 hour and a duration of acetylcholinesterase inhibition of \n\nabout 9 hours, it is recommended that in cases of asymptomatic overdose no further dose of rivastigmine \n\nshould be administered for the next 24 hours. In overdose accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting, \n\nthe use of antiemetics should be considered. Symptomatic treatment for other adverse reactions should \n\nbe given as necessary. \n\nIn massive overdose, atropine can be used. An initial dose of 0.03 mg/kg intravenous atropine sulphate is \n\nrecommended, with subsequent doses based on clinical response. Use of scopolamine as an antidote is \n\nnot recommended. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: psychoanaleptics, anticholinesterases, ATC code: N06DA03 \n\nRivastigmine is an acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor of the carbamate type, thought to \n\nfacilitate cholinergic neurotransmission by slowing the degradation of acetylcholine released by \n\nfunctionally intact cholinergic neurones. Thus, rivastigmine may have an ameliorative effect on \n\ncholinergic-mediated cognitive deficits in dementia associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and \n\nParkinson\u2019s disease. \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\nRivastigmine interacts with its target enzymes by forming a covalently bound complex that \n\ntemporarily inactivates the enzymes. In healthy young men, an oral 3 mg dose decreases \n\nacetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in CSF by approximately 40% within the first 1.5 hours after \n\nadministration. Activity of the enzyme returns to baseline levels about 9 hours after the maximum \n\ninhibitory effect has been achieved. In patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, inhibition of AChE in CSF \n\nby rivastigmine was dose-dependent up to 6 mg given twice daily, the highest dose tested. Inhibition \n\nof butyrylcholinesterase activity in CSF of 14 Alzheimer patients treated by rivastigmine was similar \n\nto that of AChE. \n\n \n\nClinical studies in Alzheimer\u2019s dementia \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of rivastigmine has been established through the use of three independent, domain \n\nspecific, assessment tools which were assessed at periodic intervals during 6 month treatment periods. \n\nThese include the ADAS-Cog (Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Assessment Scale \u2013 Cognitive subscale, a \n\nperformance based measure of cognition), the CIBIC-Plus (Clinician\u2019s Interview Based Impression of \n\nChange-Plus, a comprehensive global assessment of the patient by the physician incorporating \n\ncaregiver input), and the PDS (Progressive Deterioration Scale, a caregiver-rated assessment of the \n\nactivities of daily living including personal hygiene, feeding, dressing, household chores such as \n\nshopping, retention of ability to orient oneself to surroundings as well as involvement in activities \n\nrelating to finances, etc.). \n\n \n\nThe patients studied had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score of 10\u201324. \n\n \n\nThe results for clinically relevant responders pooled from two flexible dose studies out of the three \n\npivotal 26-week multicentre studies in patients with mild-to-moderately severe Alzheimer\u2019s Dementia, \n\nare provided in Table 4 below. Clinically relevant improvement in these studies was defined a priori as \n\nat least 4-point improvement on the ADAS-Cog, improvement on the CIBIC-Plus, or at least a 10% \n\nimprovement on the PDS. \n\n \n\nIn addition, a post-hoc definition of response is provided in the same table. The secondary definition \n\nof response required a 4-point or greater improvement on the ADAS-Cog, no worsening on the \n\nCIBIC-Plus, and no worsening on the PDS. The mean actual daily dose for responders in the 6\u201312 mg \n\ngroup, corresponding to this definition, was 9.3 mg. It is important to note that the scales used in this \n\nindication vary and direct comparisons of results for different therapeutic agents are not valid. \n\n \n\nTable 4 \n\n \n\n Patients with Clinically Significant Response (%) \n\n Intent to Treat Last Observation Carried \n\nForward \n\nResponse Measure Rivastigmine \n\n6\u201312 mg \n\nN=473 \n\nPlacebo \n\n \n\nN=472 \n\nRivastigmine \n\n6\u201312 mg \n\nN=379 \n\nPlacebo \n\n \n\nN=444 \n\nADAS-Cog: improvement \n\nof at least 4 points \n\n21*** \n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n25*** \n\n \n\n12 \n\nCIBIC-Plus: improvement 29*** 18 32*** 19 \n\nPDS: improvement of at \n\nleast 10% \n\n26*** 17 30*** 18 \n\nAt least 4 points \n\nimprovement on ADAS-\n\nCog with no worsening on \n\nCIBIC-Plus and PDS \n\n10* \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n12** \n\n \n\n6 \n\n*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nClinical studies in dementia associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease \n\nThe efficacy of rivastigmine in dementia associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease has been demonstrated in \n\na 24-week multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled core study and its 24-week open-label \n\nextension phase. Patients involved in this study had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score \n\nof 10\u201324. Efficacy has been established by the use of two independent scales which were assessed at \n\nregular intervals during a 6-month treatment period as shown in Table 5 below: the ADAS-Cog, a \n\nmeasure of cognition, and the global measure ADCS-CGIC (Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Cooperative Study-\n\nClinician\u2019s Global Impression of Change). \n\nTable 5 \n\nDementia associated with \n\nParkinson\u2019s Disease \n\nADAS-Cog \n\nPrometax \n\nADAS-Cog \n\nPlacebo \n\nADCS-\n\nCGIC \n\nPrometax \n\nADCS-CGIC \n\nPlacebo \n\nITT + RDO population (n=329) (n=161) (n=329) (n=165) \n\nMean baseline \u00b1 SD \n\nMean change at 24 weeks \n\n\u00b1 SD \n\n23.8 \u00b1 10.2 \n\n2.1 \u00b1 8.2 \n\n24.3 \u00b1 10.5 \n\n-0.7 \u00b1 7.5\n\nn/a \n\n3.8 \u00b1 1.4 \n\nn/a \n\n4.3 \u00b1 1.5 \n\nAdjusted treatment \n\ndifference 2.881 n/a \n\np-value versus placebo <0.0011 0.0072 \n\nITT - LOCF population (n=287) (n=154) (n=289) (n=158) \n\nMean baseline \u00b1 SD \n\nMean change at 24 weeks \n\n\u00b1 SD \n\n24.0 \u00b1 10.3 \n\n2.5 \u00b1 8.4 \n\n24.5 \u00b1 10.6 \n\n-0.8 \u00b1 7.5\n\nn/a \n\n3.7 \u00b1 1.4 \n\nn/a \n\n4.3 \u00b1 1.5 \n\nAdjusted treatment \n\ndifference 3.541 n/a \n\np-value versus placebo <0.0011 <0.0012 \n\n1 Based on ANCOVA with treatment and country as factors and baseline ADAS-Cog as a covariate.

Peak plasma concentrations are reached in \n\napproximately 1 hour. As a consequence of rivastigmine\u2019s interaction with its target enzyme, the \n\nincrease in bioavailability is about 1.5-fold greater than that expected from the increase in dose. Absolute \n\nbioavailability after a 3 mg dose is about 36% \uf0b1 13%. Administration of rivastigmine oral solution with \n\nfood delays absorption (tmax) by 74 min and lowers Cmax by 43% and increases AUC by approximately \n\n9%. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nProtein binding of rivastigmine is approximately 40%. It readily crosses the blood brain barrier and has \n\nan apparent volume of distribution in the range of 1.8\u20132.7 l/kg. \n\n\n\n29 \n\nBiotransformation \n\nRivastigmine is rapidly and extensively metabolised (half-life in plasma approximately 1 hour), \n\nprimarily via cholinesterase-mediated hydrolysis to the decarbamylated metabolite. In vitro, this \n\nmetabolite shows minimal inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (<10%). \n\nBased on in vitro studies, no pharmacokinetic interaction is expected with medicinal products \n\nmetabolised by the following cytochromes isoemzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2E1, \n\nCYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, or CYP2B6. Based on evidence from animal studies the major \n\ncytochrome P450 isoenzymes are minimally involved in rivastigmine metabolism. Total plasma \n\nclearance of rivastigmine was approximately 130 l/h after a 0.2 mg intravenous dose and decreased to \n\n70 l/h after a 2.7 mg intravenous dose. \n\nElimination \n\nUnchanged rivastigmine is not found in the urine; renal excretion of the metabolites is the major route of \n\nelimination. Following administration of 14C-rivastigmine, renal elimination was rapid and essentially \n\ncomplete (>90%) within 24 hours. Less than 1% of the administered dose is excreted in the faeces. There \n\nis no accumulation of rivastigmine or the decarbamylated metabolite in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s \n\ndisease. \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that nicotine use increases the oral clearance of \n\nrivastigmine by 23% in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (n=75 smokers and 549 non-smokers) \n\nfollowing rivastigmine oral capsule doses of up to 12 mg/day. \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \n\nWhile bioavailability of rivastigmine is greater in elderly than in young healthy volunteers, studies in \n\nAlzheimer patients aged between 50 and 92 years showed no change in bioavailability with age. \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe Cmax of rivastigmine was approximately 60% higher and the AUC of rivastigmine was more than \n\ntwice as high in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment than in healthy subjects. \n\nRenal impairment \n\nCmax and AUC of rivastigmine were more than twice as high in subjects with moderate renal impairment \n\ncompared with healthy subjects; however there were no changes in Cmax and AUC of rivastigmine in \n\nsubjects with severe renal impairment. \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nRepeated-dose toxicity studies in rats, mice and dogs revealed only effects associated with an \n\nexaggerated pharmacological action. No target organ toxicity was observed. No safety margins to human \n\nexposure were achieved in the animal studies due to the sensitivity of the animal models used. \n\nRivastigmine was not mutagenic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests, except in a \n\nchromosomal aberration test in human peripheral lymphocytes at a dose 104 times the maximum clinical \n\nexposure. The in vivo micronucleus test was negative. The major metabolite NAP226-90 also did not \n\nshow a genotoxic potential. \n\nNo evidence of carcinogenicity was found in studies in mice and rats at the maximum tolerated dose, \n\nalthough the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was lower than the human exposure. When \n\nnormalised to body surface area, the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was approximately \n\nequivalent to the maximum recommended human dose of 12 mg/day; however, when compared to the \n\nmaximum human dose, a multiple of approximately 6-fold was achieved in animals. \n\n\n\n30 \n\nIn animals, rivastigmine crosses the placenta and is excreted into milk. Oral studies in pregnant rats and \n\nrabbits gave no indication of teratogenic potential on the part of rivastigmine. In oral studies with male \n\nand female rats, no adverse effects of rivastigmine were observed on fertility or reproductive \n\nperformance of either the parent generation or the offspring of the parents. \n\nA mild eye/mucosal irritation potential of rivastigmine was identified in a rabbit study. \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. \n\n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment \n\nof Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. Diagnosis should be made according to current guidelines. Similar to any \n\ntreatment initiated in patients with dementia, therapy with rivastigmine should only be started if a \n\ncaregiver is available to regularly administer and monitor the treatment. \n\nPosology \n\nTransdermal patches Rivastigmine in vivo release \n\nrates per 24 h \n\nPrometax 4.6 mg/24 h 4.6 mg \n\nPrometax 9.5 mg/24 h 9.5 mg \n\nPrometax 13.3 mg/24 h 13.3 mg \n\nInitial dose \n\nTreatment is started with 4.6 mg/24 h. \n\nMaintenance dose \n\nAfter a minimum of four weeks of treatment and if well tolerated according to the treating physician, the \n\ndose of 4.6 mg/24 h should be increased to 9.5 mg/24 h, the daily recommended effective dose, which \n\nshould be continued for as long as the patient continues to demonstrate therapeutic benefit. \n\nDose escalation \n\n9.5 mg/24 h is the recommended daily effective dose which should be continued for as long as the \n\npatient continues to demonstrate therapeutic benefit. If well tolerated and only after a minimum of six \n\nmonths of treatment at 9.5 mg/24 h, the treating physician may consider increasing the dose to \n\n13.3 mg/24 h in patients who have demonstrated a meaningful cognitive deterioration (e.g. decrease in \n\nthe MMSE) and/or functional decline (based on physician judgement) while on the recommended daily \n\neffective dose of 9.5 mg/24 h (see section 5.1). \n\nThe clinical benefit of rivastigmine should be reassessed on a regular basis. Discontinuation should also \n\nbe considered when evidence of a therapeutic effect at the optimal dose is no longer present. \n\nTreatment should be temporarily interrupted if gastrointestinal adverse reactions are observed until \n\nthese adverse reactions resolve. Transdermal patch treatment can be resumed at the same dose if \n\ntreatment is not interrupted for more than three days. Otherwise treatment should be re-initiated with \n\n4.6 mg/24 h. \n\nSwitching from capsules or oral solution to transdermal patches \n\nBased on comparable exposure between oral and transdermal rivastigmine (see section 5.2), patients \n\ntreated with Prometax capsules or oral solution can be switched to Prometax transdermal patches as \n\nfollows: \n\n\uf0b7 A patient on a dose of 3 mg/day oral rivastigmine can be switched to 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal\n\npatches.\n\n\uf0b7 A patient on a dose of 6 mg/day oral rivastigmine can be switched to 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal\n\npatches.\n\n\uf0b7 A patient on a stable and well tolerated dose of 9 mg/day oral rivastigmine can be switched to\n\n9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patches. If the oral dose of 9 mg/day has not been stable and well\n\ntolerated, a switch to 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal patches is recommended.\n\n\uf0b7 A patient on a dose of 12 mg/day oral rivastigmine can be switched to 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal\n\npatches.\n\nAfter switching to 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal patches, provided these are well tolerated after a minimum of \n\nfour weeks of treatment, the dose of 4.6 mg/24 h should be increased to 9.5 mg/24 h, which is the \n\nrecommended effective dose. \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\nIt is recommended to apply the first transdermal patch on the day following the last oral dose. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Paediatric population: There is no relevant use of Prometax in the paediatric population in the \n\ntreatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \n\n\uf0b7 Patients with body weight below 50 kg: Particular caution should be exercised in titrating \n\npatients with body weight below 50 kg above the recommended effective dose of 9.5 mg/24 h \n\n(see section 4.4). They may experience more adverse reactions and may be more likely to \n\ndiscontinue due to adverse reactions. \n\n\uf0b7 Hepatic impairment: Due to increased exposure in mild to moderate hepatic impairment as \n\nobserved with the oral formulation, dosing recommendations to titrate according to individual \n\ntolerability should be closely followed. Patients with clinically significant hepatic impairment \n\nmay experience more dose-dependent adverse reactions. Patients with severe hepatic impairment \n\nhave not been studied. Particular caution should be exercised in titrating these patients (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n\uf0b7 Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nTransdermal patches should be applied once a day to clean, dry, hairless, intact healthy skin on the upper \n\nor lower back, upper arm or chest, in a place which will not be rubbed by tight clothing. It is not \n\nrecommended to apply the transdermal patch to the thigh or to the abdomen due to decreased \n\nbioavailability of rivastigmine observed when the transdermal patch is applied to these areas of the body. \n\n \n\nThe transdermal patch should not be applied to skin that is red, irritated or cut. Reapplication to the exact \n\nsame skin location within 14 days should be avoided to minimise the potential risk of skin irritation. \n\n \n\nPatients and caregivers should be instructed on important administration instructions: \n\n\uf0b7 The previous day\u2019s patch must be removed before applying a new one every day (see section 4.9). \n\n\uf0b7 The patch should be replaced by a new one after 24 hours. Only one patch should be worn at a \n\ntime (see section 4.9). \n\n\uf0b7 The patch should be pressed down firmly for at least 30 seconds using the palm of the hand until \n\nthe edges stick well. \n\n\uf0b7 If the patch falls off, a new one should be applied for the rest of the day, then it should be replaced \n\nat the same time as usual the next day. \n\n\uf0b7 The patch can be used in everyday situations, including bathing and during hot weather. \n\n\uf0b7 The patch should not be exposed to any external heat sources (e.g. excessive sunlight, saunas, \n\nsolarium) for long periods of time. \n\n\uf0b7 The patch should not be cut into pieces. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance rivastigmine, to other carbamate derivatives or to any of the \n\nexcipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nPrevious history of application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis with rivastigmine \n\npatch (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nThe incidence and severity of adverse reactions generally increase with increasing doses, particularly \n\nat dose changes. If treatment is interrupted for more than three days, it should be re-initiated with \n\n4.6 mg/24 h. \n\n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nMisuse of the medicinal product and dosing errors resulting in overdose \n\nMisuse of the medicinal product and dosing errors with Prometax transdermal patch have resulted in \n\nserious adverse reactions; some cases have required hospitalisation, and rarely led to death (see section \n\n4.9). Most cases of misuse of the medicinal product and dosing errors have involved not removing the \n\nold patch when putting on a new one and the use of multiple patches at the same time. Patients and \n\ntheir caregivers must be instructed on important administration instructions for Prometax transdermal \n\npatch (see section 4.2). \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nGastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are dose-related, and may occur \n\nwhen initiating treatment and/or increasing the dose (see section 4.8). These adverse reactions occur \n\nmore commonly in women. Patients who show signs or symptoms of dehydration resulting from \n\nprolonged vomiting or diarrhoea can be managed with intravenous fluids and dose reduction or \n\ndiscontinuation if recognised and treated promptly. Dehydration can be associated with serious \n\noutcomes. \n\nWeight loss \n\nPatients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease may lose weight whilst taking cholinesterase inhibitors, including \n\nrivastigmine. The patient\u2019s weight should be monitored during therapy with Prometax transdermal \n\npatches. \n\nBradycardia \n\nRivastigmine may cause bradycardia which constitutes a risk factor in the occurrence of torsade de \n\npointes, predominantly in patients with risk factors. Caution is advised in patients at higher risk of \n\ndeveloping torsade de pointes; for example, those with uncompensated heart failure, recent myocardial \n\ninfarction, bradyarrhythmias, a predisposition to hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia, or concomitant \n\nuse with medicinal products known to induce QT prolongation and/or torsade de pointes (see sections \n\n4.5 and 4.8). \n\nOther adverse reactions \n\nCare must be taken when prescribing Prometax transdermal patches: \n\n\uf0b7 to patients with sick sinus syndrome or conduction defects (sino-atrial block, atrio-ventricular\n\nblock) (see section 4.8);\n\n\uf0b7 to patients with active gastric or duodenal ulcers or patients predisposed to these conditions\n\nbecause rivastigmine may cause increased gastric secretions (see section 4.8);\n\n\uf0b7 to patients predisposed to urinary obstruction and seizures because cholinomimetics may induce\n\nor exacerbate these diseases;\n\n\uf0b7 to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nSkin application site reactions \n\nSkin application site reactions may occur with rivastigmine patch and are usually mild or moderate in \n\nintensity. Patients and caregivers should be instructed accordingly. \n\nThese reactions are not in themselves an indication of sensitisation. However, use of rivastigmine \n\npatch may lead to allergic contact dermatitis. \n\nAllergic contact dermatitis should be suspected if application site reactions spread beyond the patch \n\nsize, if there is evidence of a more intense local reaction (e.g. increasing erythema, oedema, papules, \n\nvesicles) and if symptoms do not significantly improve within 48 hours after patch removal. In these \n\ncases, treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3). \n\n\n\n36 \n\nPatients who develop application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis to rivastigmine \n\npatch and who still require rivastigmine treatment should only be switched to oral rivastigmine after \n\nnegative allergy testing and under close medical supervision. It is possible that some patients \n\nsensitised to rivastigmine by exposure to rivastigmine patch may not be able to take rivastigmine in \n\nany form. \n\nThere have been rare post-marketing reports of patients experiencing allergic dermatitis \n\n(disseminated) when administered rivastigmine irrespective of the route of administration (oral, \n\ntransdermal). In these cases, treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3). \n\nOther warnings and precautions \n\nRivastigmine may exacerbate or induce extrapyramidal symptoms. \n\nContact with the eyes should be avoided after handling Prometax transdermal patches (see section 5.3). \n\nHands should be washed with soap and water after removing the patch. In case of contact with eyes or if \n\nthe eyes become red after handling the patch, rinse immediately with plenty of water and seek medical \n\nadvice if symptoms do not resolve. \n\nSpecial populations \n\n\uf0b7 Patients with body weight below 50 kg may experience more adverse reactions and may be\n\nmore likely to discontinue due to adverse reactions (see section 4.2). Carefully titrate and\n\nmonitor these patients for adverse reactions (e.g. excessive nausea or vomiting) and consider\n\nreducing the maintenance dose to the 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal patch if such adverse reactions\n\ndevelop.\n\n\uf0b7 Hepatic impairment: Patients with clinically significant hepatic impairment may experience\n\nmore adverse reactions. Dosing recommendations to titrate according to individual tolerability\n\nmust be closely followed. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied.\n\nParticular caution must be exercised in titrating these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo specific interaction studies have been performed with Prometax transdermal patches. \n\nAs a cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine may exaggerate the effects of succinylcholine-type muscle \n\nrelaxants during anaesthesia. Caution is recommended when selecting anaesthetic agents. Possible dose \n\nadjustments or temporarily stopping treatment can be considered if needed. \n\nIn view of its pharmacodynamic effects and possible additive effects, rivastigmine should not be given \n\nconcomitantly with other cholinomimetic substances. Rivastigmine might interfere with the activity of \n\nanticholinergic medicinal products (e.g. oxybutynin, tolterodine). \n\nAdditive effects leading to bradycardia (which may result in syncope) have been reported with the \n\ncombined use of various beta-blockers (including atenolol) and rivastigmine. Cardiovascular beta-\n\nblockers are expected to be associated with the greatest risk, but reports have also been received in \n\npatients using other beta-blockers. Therefore, caution should be exercised when rivastigmine is \n\ncombined with beta-blockers and also other bradycardia agents (e.g.class III antiarrhythmic agents, \n\ncalcium channel antagonists, digitalis glycoside, pilocarpin). \n\nSince bradycardia constitutes a risk factor in the occurrence of torsades de pointes, the combination of \n\nrivastigmine with torsades de pointes-inducing medicinal products such as antipsychotics i.e. some \n\nphenothiazines (chlorpromazine, levomepromazine), benzamides (sulpiride, sultopride, amisulpride, \n\ntiapride, veralipride), pimozide, haloperidol, droperidol, cisapride, citalopram, diphemanil, \n\nerythromycin IV, halofantrin, mizolastin, methadone, pentamidine and moxifloxacine should be \n\nobserved with caution and clinical monitoring (ECG) may also be required. \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between oral rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, \n\ndiazepam or fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. The increase in prothrombin time induced by \n\nwarfarin is not affected by administration of oral rivastigmine. No untoward effects on cardiac \n\nconduction were observed following concomitant administration of digoxin and oral rivastigmine. \n\n \n\nConcomitant administration of rivastigmine with commonly prescribed medicinal products, such as \n\nantacids, antiemetics, antidiabetics, centrally acting antihypertensives, calcium channel blockers, \n\ninotropic agents, antianginals, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, oestrogens, analgesics, \n\nbenzodiazepines and antihistamines, was not associated with an alteration in the kinetics of rivastigmine \n\nor an increased risk of clinically relevant untoward effects. \n\n \n\nAccording to its metabolism, metabolic interactions with other medicinal products appear unlikely, \n\nalthough rivastigmine may inhibit the butyrylcholinesterase mediated metabolism of other substances. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nIn pregnant animals, rivastigmine and /or metabolites crossed the placenta. It is not known if this occurs \n\nin humans. No clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. In peri/postnatal studies in rats, an \n\nincreased gestation time was observed. Rivastigmine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly \n\nnecessary. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIn animals, rivastigmine is excreted in milk. It is not known if rivastigmine is excreted into human milk. \n\nTherefore, women on rivastigmine should not breast-feed. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nNo adverse effects of rivastigmine were observed on fertility or reproductive performance in rats (see \n\nsection 5.3). Effects of rivastigmine on human fertility are not known. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease may cause gradual impairment of driving performance or compromise the ability to \n\nuse machines. Furthermore, rivastigmine may induce syncope or delirium. As a consequence, \n\nrivastigmine has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Therefore, in \n\npatients with dementia treated with rivastigmine, the ability to continue driving or operating complex \n\nmachines should be routinely evaluated by the treating physician. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nApplication site skin reactions (usually mild to moderate application site erythema), are the most \n\nfrequent adverse reactions observed with the use of Prometax transdermal patch. The next most \n\ncommon adverse reactions are gastrointestinal in nature including nausea and vomiting. \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions in Table 1 are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency \n\ncategory. Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); \n\ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n\n(<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nTable 1 displays the adverse reactions reported in 1,670 patients with Alzheimer\u2019s dementia treated in \n\nrandomised, double-blind, placebo and active-controlled clinical studies with Prometax transdermal \n\npatches for a duration of 24-48 weeks and from post-marketing data. \n\n \n\nTable 1 \n\n \n\nInfections and infestations \n\n Common Urinary tract infection \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n Common Anorexia, decreased appetite \n\n Uncommon Dehydration \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n Common Anxiety, depression, delirium, agitation \n\n Uncommon Aggression \n\n Not known Hallucinations, restlessness, nightmares \n\nNervous system disorders \n Common Headache, syncope, dizziness \n\n Uncommon Psychomotor hyperactivity \n\n Very rare Extrapyramidal symptoms \n\n Not known Worsening of Parkinson\u2019s disease, seizure, tremor, somnolence \n\nCardiac disorders \n Uncommon Bradycardia \n\n Not known Atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, sick sinus \n\nsyndrome \n\nVascular disorders \n Not known Hypertension \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n Common Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain \n\n Uncommon Gastric ulcer \n\n Not known Pancreatitis \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n Not known Hepatitis, elevated liver function tests \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n Common Rash \n\n Not known Pruritus, erythema, urticaria, vesicles, allergic dermatitis \n\n(disseminated) \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n Common Urinary incontinence \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n Common Application site skin reactions (e.g. application site erythema*, \n\napplication site pruritus*, application site oedema*, application site \n\ndermatitis, application site irritation), asthenic conditions (e.g. fatigue, \n\nasthenia), pyrexia, weight decreased \n\n Rare Fall \n\n*In a 24-week controlled study in Japanese patients, application site erythema, application site oedema \n\nand application site pruritus were reported as \u201cvery common\u201d. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nWhen doses higher than 13.3 mg/24 h were used in the above-mentioned placebo-controlled study, \n\ninsomnia and cardiac failure were observed more frequently than with 13.3 mg/24 h or placebo, \n\nsuggesting a dose effect relationship. However, these events did not occur at a higher frequency with \n\nPrometax 13.3 mg/24 h transdermal patches than with placebo. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\nThe following adverse reactions have only been observed with Prometax capsules and oral solution and \n\nnot in clinical studies with Prometax transdermal patches: malaise, confusion, sweating increased \n\n(common); duodenal ulcers, angina pectoris (rare); gastrointestinal haemorrhage (very rare); and some \n\ncases of severe vomiting were associated with oesophageal rupture (not known). \n\n \n\nSkin irritation \n\nIn double-blind controlled clinical trials, application site reactions were mostly mild to moderate in \n\nseverity. The incidence of application site skin reactions leading to discontinuation was \u22642.3% in patients \n\ntreated with Prometax transdermal patches. The incidence of application site skin reactions leading to \n\ndiscontinuation was higher in the Asian population with 4.9% and 8.4% in the Chinese and Japanese \n\npopulation respectively. \n\n \n\nIn two 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, skin reactions were measured at each \n\nvisit using a skin irritation rating scale. When observed in patients treated with Prometax transdermal \n\npatches, skin irritation was mostly slight or mild in severity. It was rated as severe in \u22642.2% of patients \n\nin these studies and in \u22643.7% of patients treated with Prometax transdermal patches in a Japanese study. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nSymptoms \n\n \n\nMost cases of accidental overdose of oral rivastigmine have not been associated with any clinical signs \n\nor symptoms and almost all of the patients concerned continued rivastigmine treatment 24 hours after the \n\noverdose. \n\n \n\nCholinergic toxicity has been reported with muscarinic symptoms that are observed with moderate \n\npoisonings such as miosis, flushing, digestive disorders including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and \n\ndiarrhoea, bradycardia, bronchospasm and increased bronchial secretions, hyperhidrosis, involuntary \n\nurination and/or defecation, lacrimation, hypotension and salivary hypersecretion. \n\n \n\nIn more severe cases nicotinic effects might develop such as muscular weakness, fasciculations, seizures \n\nand respiratory arrest with possible fatal outcome. \n\n \n\nAdditionaly there have been post-marketing cases of dizziness, tremor, headache, somnolence, \n\nconfusional state, hypertension, hallucinations and malaise. Overdose with Prometax transdermal patch \n\nresulting from misuse/dosing errors (application of multiple patches at a time) has been reported in the \n\npost-marketing setting and rarely in clinical trials. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\n \n\nAs rivastigmine has a plasma half-life of about 3.4 hours and a duration of acetylcholinesterase \n\ninhibition of about 9 hours, it is recommended that in cases of asymptomatic overdose all Prometax \n\ntransdermal patches should be removed immediately and no further transdermal patch should be applied \n\nfor the next 24 hours. In overdose accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting, the use of antiemetics \n\nshould be considered. Symptomatic treatment for other adverse reactions should be given as necessary. \n\n \n\nIn massive overdose, atropine can be used. An initial dose of 0.03 mg/kg intravenous atropine sulphate is \n\nrecommended, with subsequent doses based on clinical response. Use of scopolamine as an antidote is \n\nnot recommended. \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: psychoanaleptics, anticholinesterases, ATC code: N06DA03 \n\nRivastigmine is an acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor of the carbamate type, thought to \n\nfacilitate cholinergic neurotransmission by slowing the degradation of acetylcholine released by \n\nfunctionally intact cholinergic neurones. Thus, rivastigmine may have an ameliorative effect on \n\ncholinergic-mediated cognitive deficits in dementia associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \n\nRivastigmine interacts with its target enzymes by forming a covalently bound complex that \n\ntemporarily inactivates the enzymes. In healthy young men, an oral 3 mg dose decreases \n\nacetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in CSF by approximately 40% within the first 1.5 hours after \n\nadministration. Activity of the enzyme returns to baseline levels about 9 hours after the maximum \n\ninhibitory effect has been achieved. In patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, inhibition of AChE in CSF \n\nby oral rivastigmine was dose-dependent up to 6 mg given twice daily, the highest dose tested. \n\nInhibition of butyrylcholinesterase activity in CSF of 14 Alzheimer patients treated by oral \n\nrivastigmine was similar to the inhibition of AChE activity. \n\nClinical studies in Alzheimer\u2019s dementia \n\nThe efficacy of Prometax transdermal patches in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s dementia has been \n\ndemonstrated in a 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled core study and its open-label extension \n\nphase and in a 48-week double-blind comparator study. \n\n24-week placebo-controlled study\n\nPatients involved in the placebo-controlled study had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) \n\nscore of 10\u201320. Efficacy was established by the use of independent, domain-specific assessment tools \n\nwhich were applied at regular intervals during the 24-week treatment period. These include the \n\nADAS-Cog (Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Assessment Scale \u2013 Cognitive subscale, a performance-based \n\nmeasure of cognition) and the ADCS-CGIC (Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Cooperative Study \u2013 Clinician\u2019s \n\nGlobal Impression of Change, a comprehensive global assessment of the patient by the physician \n\nincorporating caregiver input), and the ADCS-ADL (Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Cooperative Study \u2013 \n\nActivities of Daily Living, a caregiver-rated assessment of the activities of daily living including \n\npersonal hygiene, feeding, dressing, household chores such as shopping, retention of ability to orient \n\noneself to surroundings as well as involvement in activities related to finances).

The study was designed to compare the efficacy of the 13.3 mg/24 h transdermal patch against \n\nthe 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patch during a 48-week double-blind treatment phase in Alzheimer\u2019s \n\ndisease patients who demonstrated functional and cognitive decline after an initial 24-48 week open-\n\nlabel treatment phase while on a maintenance dose of 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patch. Functional \n\ndecline was assessed by the investigator and cognitive decline was defined as a decrease in the MMSE \n\nscore of >2 points from the previous visit or a decrease of >3 points from baseline. Efficacy was \n\nestablished by the use of ADAS-Cog (Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Assessment Scale \u2013 Cognitive subscale, a \n\nperformance-based measure of cognition) and the ADCS-IADL (Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Cooperative \n\nStudy \u2013 Instrumental Activities of Daily Living) assessing instrumental activities which include \n\nmaintaining finances, meal preparation, shopping, ability to orient oneself to surroundings, ability to \n\nbe left unattended.

After the first dose, detectable \n\nplasma concentrations are observed after a lag time of 0.5-1 hour. Cmax is reached after 10-16 hours. \n\nAfter the peak, plasma concentrations slowly decrease over the remainder of the 24-hour period of \n\napplication. With multiple dosing (such as at steady state), after the previous transdermal patch is \n\nreplaced with a new one, plasma concentrations initially decrease slowly for about 40 minutes on \n\naverage, until absorption from the newly applied transdermal patch becomes faster than elimination, \n\nand plasma levels begin to rise again to reach a new peak at approximately 8 hours. At steady state, \n\ntrough levels are approximately 50% of peak levels, in contrast to oral administration, with which \n\nconcentrations fall off to virtually zero between doses. Although less pronounced than with the oral \n\nformulation, exposure to rivastigmine (Cmax and AUC) increased over-proportionally by a factor of 2.6 \n\nand 4.9 when escalating from 4.6 mg/24 h to 9.5 mg/24 h and to 13.3 mg/24 h, respectively. The \n\nfluctuation index (FI), a measure of the relative difference between peak and trough concentrations \n\n((Cmax-Cmin)/Cavg), was 0.58 for Prometax 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal patches, 0.77 for Prometax \n\n9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patches and 0.72 for Prometax 13.3 mg/24 h transdermal patches, thus \n\ndemonstrating a much smaller fluctuation between trough and peak concentrations than for the oral \n\nformulation (FI = 3.96 (6 mg/day) and 4.15 (12 mg/day)). \n\nThe dose of rivastigmine released from the transdermal patch over 24 hours (mg/24 h) cannot be \n\ndirectly equated to the amount (mg) of rivastigmine contained in a capsule with respect to plasma \n\nconcentration produced over 24 hours. \n\nThe single-dose inter-subject variability in rivastigmine pharmacokinetic parameters (normalised to \n\ndose/kg bodyweight) was 43% (Cmax) and 49% (AUC0-24h) after transdermal administration versus \n\n74% and 103%, respectively, after the oral form. The inter-patient variability in a steady-state study in \n\nAlzheimer\u2019s dementia was at most 45% (Cmax) and 43% (AUC0-24h) after use of the transdermal patch, \n\nand 71% and 73%, respectively, after administration of the oral form. \n\nA relationship between active substance exposure at steady state (rivastigmine and metabolite \n\nNAP226-90) and bodyweight was observed in Alzheimer\u2019s dementia patients. Compared to a patient \n\nwith a body weight of 65 kg, the rivastigmine steady-state concentrations in a patient with a body \n\nweight of 35 kg would be approximately doubled, while for a patient with a body weight of 100 kg the \n\nconcentrations would be approximately halved. The effect of bodyweight on active substance \n\nexposure suggests special attention to patients with very low body weight during up-titration (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\nExposure (AUC\u221e) to rivastigmine (and metabolite NAP266-90) was highest when the transdermal \n\npatch was applied to the upper back, chest, or upper arm and approximately 20\u201330% lower when \n\napplied to the abdomen or thigh. \n\nThere was no relevant accumulation of rivastigmine or the metabolite NAP226-90 in plasma in patients \n\nwith Alzheimer\u2019s disease, except that plasma levels were higher on the second day of transdermal patch \n\ntherapy than on the first. \n\nDistribution \n\nRivastigmine is weakly bound to plasma proteins (approximately 40%). It readily crosses the blood-brain \n\nbarrier and has an apparent volume of distribution in the range of 1.8-2.7 l/kg. \n\n\n\n44 \n\nBiotransformation \n\nRivastigmine is rapidly and extensively metabolised with an apparent elimination half-life in plasma of \n\napproximately 3.4 hours after removal of the transdermal patch. Elimination was absorption rate limited \n\n(flip-flop kinetics), which explains the longer t\u00bd after transdermal patch (3.4 h) versus oral or intravenous \n\nadministrations (1.4 to 1.7 h). Metabolism is primarily via cholinesterase-mediated hydrolysis to the \n\nmetabolite NAP226-90. In vitro, this metabolite shows minimal inhibition of acetylcholinesterase \n\n(<10%). \n\nBased on in vitro studies, no pharmacokinetic interaction is expected with medicinal products \n\nmetabolised by the following cytochrome isoenzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2E1, \n\nCYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, or CYP2B6. Based on evidence from animal studies, the major \n\ncytochrome P450 isoenzymes are minimally involved in rivastigmine metabolism. Total plasma \n\nclearance of rivastigmine was approximately 130 litres/h after a 0.2 mg intravenous dose and decreased \n\nto 70 litres/h after a 2.7 mg intravenous dose, which is consistent with the non-linear, over-proportional \n\npharmacokinetics of rivastigmine due to saturation of its elimination. \n\nThe metabolite-to-parent AUC\u221e ratio was around 0.7 after transdermal patch administration versus 3.5 \n\nafter oral administration, indicating that much less metabolism occurred after dermal compared to oral \n\ntreatment. Less NAP226-90 is formed following application of the transdermal patch, presumably \n\nbecause of the lack of presystemic (hepatic first pass) metabolism, in contrast to oral administration. \n\nElimination \n\nUnchanged rivastigmine is found in trace amounts in the urine; renal excretion of the metabolites is the \n\nmajor route of elimination after transdermal patch administration. Following administration of oral 14C-\n\nrivastigmine, renal elimination was rapid and essentially complete (>90%) within 24 hours. Less than \n\n1% of the administered dose is excreted in the faeces. \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that nicotine use increases the oral clearance of \n\nrivastigmine by 23% in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (n=75 smokers and 549 non-smokers) \n\nfollowing rivastigmine oral capsule doses for up to 12 mg/day. \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \n\nAge had no impact on the exposure to rivastigmine in Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients treated with \n\nPrometax transdermal patches. \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo study was conducted with Prometax transdermal patches in subjects with hepatic impairment. After \n\noral administration, the Cmax of rivastigmine was approximately 60% higher and the AUC of rivastigmine \n\nwas more than twice as high in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment than in healthy \n\nsubjects. \n\nFollowing a single 3 mg or 6 mg oral dose, the mean oral clearance of rivastigmine was approximately \n\n46-63% lower in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (n=10, Child-Pugh score 5-12, \n\nbiopsy proven) than in healthy subjects (n=10). \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo study was conducted with Prometax transdermal patches in subjects with renal impairment. Based on \n\npopulation analysis, creatinine clearance did not show any clear effect on steady state concentrations of \n\nrivastigmine or its metabolite. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nOral and topical repeated-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and minipigs revealed only \n\neffects associated with an exaggerated pharmacological action. No target organ toxicity was observed. \n\nOral and topical dosing in animal studies was limited due to the sensitivity of the animal models used. \n\n \n\nRivastigmine was not mutagenic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests, except in a \n\nchromosomal aberration test in human peripheral lymphocytes at a dose exceeding 104 times the \n\nforeseen clinical exposure. The in vivo micronucleus test was negative. The major metabolite NAP226-\n\n90 also did not show a genotoxic potential. \n\n \n\nNo evidence of carcinogenicity was found in oral and topical studies in mice and in an oral study in \n\nrats at the maximum tolerated dose. The exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was \n\napproximately equivalent to human exposure with highest doses of rivastigmine capsules and \n\ntransdermal patches. \n\n \n\nIn animals, rivastigmine crosses the placenta and is excreted into milk. Oral studies in pregnant rats and \n\nrabbits gave no indication of teratogenic potential on the part of rivastigmine. In oral studies with male \n\nand female rats, no adverse effects of rivastigmine were observed on fertility or reproductive \n\nperformance of either the parent generation or the offspring of the parents. Specific dermal studies in \n\npregnant animals have not been conducted. \n\n \n\nRivastigmine transdermal patches were not phototoxic and considered to be a non-sensitiser. In some \n\nother dermal toxicity studies, a mild irritant effect on the skin of laboratory animals, including controls, \n\nwas observed. This may indicate a potential for Prometax transdermal patches to induce mild erythema \n\nin patients. \n\n \n\nA mild eye/mucosal irritation potential of rivastigmine was identified in a rabbit study. Therefore, the \n\npatient/caregiver should avoid contact with the eyes after handling of the patch (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Prometax is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Prometax \n\n3. How to take Prometax \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Prometax \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Prometax is and what it is used for \n \n\nThe active substance of Prometax is rivastigmine. \n\n \n\nRivastigmine belongs to a class of substances called cholinesterase inhibitors. In patients with \n\nAlzheimer\u2019s dementia or dementia due to Parkinson\u2019s disease, certain nerve cells die in the brain, \n\nresulting in low levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (a substance that allows nerve cells to \n\ncommunicate with each other). Rivastigmine works by blocking the enzymes that break down \n\nacetylcholine: acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. By blocking these enzymes, Prometax \n\nallows levels of acetylcholine to be increased in the brain, helping to reduce the symptoms of \n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease. \n\n \n\nPrometax is used for the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer\u2019s \n\ndementia, a progressive brain disorder that gradually affects memory, intellectual ability and \n\nbehaviour. The capsules and oral solution can also be used for the treatment of dementia in adult \n\npatients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Prometax \n\n \n\nDo not take Prometax \n- if you are allergic to rivastigmine (the active substance in Prometax) or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n- if you have a skin reaction spreading beyond the patch size, if there is a more intense local \n\nreaction (such as blisters, increasing skin inflammation, swelling) and if it does not improve \n\nwithin 48 hours after removal of the transdermal patch. \n\nIf this applies to you, tell your doctor and do not take Prometax. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n98 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Prometax: \n\n- if you have, or have ever had, irregular or slow heartbeat. \n\n- if you have, or have ever had, an active stomach ulcer. \n\n- if you have, or have ever had, difficulties in passing urine. \n\n- if you have, or have ever had, seizures. \n\n- if you have, or have ever had, asthma or severe respiratory disease. \n\n- if you have, or have ever had impaired kidney function. \n\n- if you have, or have ever had, impaired liver function. \n\n- if you suffer from trembling. \n\n- if you have a low body weight. \n\n- if you have gastrointestinal reactions such as feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and \n\ndiarrhoea. You may become dehydrated (losing too much fluid) if vomiting or diarrhoea are \n\nprolonged. \n\nIf any of these apply to you, your doctor may need to monitor you more closely while you are on this \n\nmedicine. \n\n \n\nIf you have not taken Prometax for more than three days, do not take the next dose until you have \n\ntalked to your doctor. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThere is no relevant use of Prometax in the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Prometax \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nPrometax should not be given at the same time as other medicines with similar effects to Prometax. \n\nPrometax might interfere with anticholinergic medicines (medicines used to relieve stomach cramps or \n\nspasms, to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease or to prevent travel sickness). \n\n \n\nPrometax should not be given at the same time as metoclopramide (a medicine used to relieve or \n\nprevent nausea and vomiting). Taking the two medicines together could cause problems such as stiff \n\nlimbs and trembling hands. \n\n \n\nIf you have to undergo surgery whilst taking Prometax, tell your doctor before you are given any \n\nanaesthetics, because Prometax may exaggerate the effects of some muscle relaxants during \n\nanaesthesia. \n\n \n\nCaution when Prometax is taken together with beta-blockers (medicines such as atenolol used to treat \n\nhypertension, angina and other heart conditions). Taking the two medicines together could cause \n\nproblems such as slowing of the heartbeat (bradycardia) leading to fainting or loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant, the benefits of using Prometax must be assessed against the possible effects on \n\nyour unborn child. Prometax should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n\n \n\nYou should not breast-feed during treatment with Prometax. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nYour doctor will tell you whether your illness allows you to drive vehicles and use machines safely. \n\nPrometax may cause dizziness and somnolence, mainly at the start of treatment or when increasing the \n\ndose. If you feel dizzy or sleepy, do not drive, use machines or perform any tasks that require your \n\nattention. \n\n\n\n \n\n99 \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Prometax \n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or \n\nnurse if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nHow to start treatment \n\nYour doctor will tell you what dose of Prometax to take. \n\n\uf0b7 Treatment usually starts with a low dose. \n\n\uf0b7 Your doctor will slowly increase your dose depending on how you respond to treatment. \n\n\uf0b7 The highest dose that should be taken is 6.0 mg twice a day. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will regularly check if the medicine is working for you. Your doctor will also monitor \n\nyour weight whilst you are taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nIf you have not taken Prometax for more than three days, do not take the next dose until you have \n\ntalked to your doctor. \n\n \n\nTaking this medicine \n\n\uf0b7 Tell your caregiver that you are taking Prometax. \n\n\uf0b7 To benefit from your medicine, take it every day. \n\n\uf0b7 Take Prometax twice a day, in the morning and evening, with food. \n\n\uf0b7 Swallow the capsules whole with a drink. \n\n\uf0b7 Do not open or crush the capsules. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Prometax than you should \nIf you accidentally take more Prometax than you should, inform your doctor. You may require \n\nmedical attention. Some people who have accidentally taken too much Prometax have experienced \n\nfeeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), diarrhoea, high blood pressure and hallucinations. Slow \n\nheartbeat and fainting may also occur. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Prometax \nIf you find you have forgotten to take your dose of Prometax, wait and take the next dose at the usual \n\ntime. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Prometax is and what it is used for \n \n\nThe active substance of Prometax is rivastigmine. \n\n \n\nRivastigmine belongs to a class of substances called cholinesterase inhibitors. In patients with \n\nAlzheimer\u2019s dementia or dementia due to Parkinson\u2019s disease, certain nerve cells die in the brain, \n\nresulting in low levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (a substance that allows nerve cells to \n\ncommunicate with each other). Rivastigmine works by blocking the enzymes that break down \n\nacetylcholine: acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. By blocking these enzymes, Prometax \n\nallows levels of acetylcholine to be increased in the brain, helping to reduce the symptoms of \n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease. \n\n \n\nPrometax is used for the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer\u2019s \n\ndementia, a progressive brain disorder that gradually affects memory, intellectual ability and \n\nbehaviour. The capsules and oral solution can also be used for the treatment of dementia in adult \n\npatients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Prometax \n\n \n\nDo not take Prometax \n- if you are allergic to rivastigmine (the active substance in Prometax) or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n- if you have a skin reaction spreading beyond the patch size, if there is a more intense local \n\nreaction (such as blisters, increasing skin inflammation, swelling) and if it does not improve \n\nwithin 48 hours after removal of the transdermal patch. \n\nIf this applies to you, tell your doctor and do not take Prometax. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n105 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Prometax: \n\n- if you have, or have ever had, irregular or slow heartbeat. \n\n- if you have, or have ever had, an active stomach ulcer. \n\n- if you have, or have ever had, difficulties in passing urine. \n\n- if you have, or have ever had, seizures. \n\n- if you have, or have ever had, asthma or severe respiratory disease. \n\n- if you have, or have ever had impaired kidney function. \n\n- if you have, or have ever had, impaired liver function. \n\n- if you suffer from trembling. \n\n- if you have a low body weight. \n\n- if you have gastrointestinal reactions such as feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and \n\ndiarrhoea. You may become dehydrated (losing too much fluid) if vomiting or diarrhoea are \n\nprolonged. \n\nIf any of these apply to you, your doctor may need to monitor you more closely while you are on this \n\nmedicine. \n\n \n\nIf you have not taken Prometax for more than three days, do not take the next dose until you have \n\ntalked to your doctor. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThere is no relevant use of Prometax in the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Prometax \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nPrometax should not be given at the same time as other medicines with similar effects to Prometax. \n\nPrometax might interfere with anticholinergic medicines (medicines used to relieve stomach cramps or \n\nspasms, to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease or to prevent travel sickness). \n\n \n\nPrometax should not be given at the same time as metoclopramide (a medicine used to relieve or \n\nprevent nausea and vomiting). Taking the two medicines together could cause problems such as such \n\nas stiff limbs and trembling hands. \n\n \n\nIf you have to undergo surgery whilst taking Prometax, tell your doctor before you are given any \n\nanaesthetics, because Prometax may exaggerate the effects of some muscle relaxants during \n\nanaesthesia. \n\n \n\nCaution when Prometax is taken together with beta-blockers (medicines such as atenolol used to treat \n\nhypertension, angina, and other heart conditions). Taking the two medicines together could cause \n\nproblems such as slowing of the heartbeat (bradycardia) leading to fainting or loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant, the benefits of using Prometax must be assessed against the possible effects on \n\nyour unborn child. Prometax should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n\n \n\nYou should not breast-feed during treatment with Prometax. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nYour doctor will tell you whether your illness allows you to drive vehicles and use machines safely. \n\nPrometax may cause dizziness and somnolence, mainly at the start of treatment or when increasing the \n\ndose. If you feel dizzy or sleepy, do not drive, use machines or perform any tasks that require your \n\nattention. \n\n\n\n \n\n106 \n\n \n\nPrometax contains sodium benzoate and sodium \n\nOne of the inactive ingredients in Prometax oral solution is sodium benzoate. Benzoic acid is a mild \n\nirritant to the skin, eyes and mucous membranes. This medicine contains 3 mg of sodium benzoate in \n\neach 3 ml of oral solution. \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, that is to say essentially 'sodium-\n\nfree'. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Prometax \n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or \n\nnurse if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nHow to start treatment \n\nYour doctor will tell you what dose of Prometax to take. \n\n\uf0b7 Treatment usually starts with a low dose. \n\n\uf0b7 Your doctor will slowly increase your dose depending on how you respond to the treatment. \n\n\uf0b7 The highest dose that should be taken is 6.0 mg twice a day. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will regularly check if the medicine is working for you. Your doctor will also monitor \n\nyour weight whilst you are taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nIf you have not taken Prometax for more than three days, do not take the next dose until you have \n\ntalked to your doctor. \n\n \n\nTaking this medicine \n\n\uf0b7 Tell your caregiver that you are taking Prometax. \n\n\uf0b7 To benefit from your medicine, take it every day. \n\n\uf0b7 Take Prometax twice a day, in the morning and evening, with food. \n\n \n\nHow to use this medicine \n\n \n\n \n\n1. Preparing the bottle and syringe \n\n\uf0b7 Take the syringe out of its protective case. \n\n\uf0b7 Push down and turn the child resistant cap to open \n\nbottle. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. Attaching the syringe to the bottle \n\n\uf0b7 Push the nozzle of the syringe into the hole in the \n\nwhite stopper. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n107 \n\n \n\n3. Filling the syringe \n\n\uf0b7 Pull the plunger upwards until it reaches the right \n\nmark for the dose that your doctor has prescribed. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Removing bubbles \n\n\uf0b7 Push down and pull up the plunger a few times to \n\nget rid of any large bubbles. \n\n\uf0b7 A few tiny bubbles are not important and will not \n\naffect your dose in any way. \n\n\uf0b7 Check the dose is still correct. \n\n\uf0b7 Then, remove the syringe from the bottle. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. Taking your medicine \n\n\uf0b7 Swallow your medicine straight from the syringe. \n\n\uf0b7 You can also mix your medicine with water in a \n\nsmall glass. Stir and drink all of the mixture. \n\n \n\n \n\n6. After using the syringe \n\n\uf0b7 Wipe the outside of the syringe with a clean \n\ntissue. \n\n\uf0b7 Then, put the syringe back in its protective case. \n\n\uf0b7 Put the child resistant cap back on the bottle to \n\nclose it. \n\n \n\n \n\nIf you take more Prometax than you should \nIf you accidentally take more Prometax than you should, inform your doctor. You may require \n\nmedical attention. Some people who have accidentally taken too much Prometax have experienced \n\nfeeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), diarrhoea, high blood pressure and hallucinations. Slow \n\nheartbeat and fainting may also occur. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Prometax \nIf you find you have forgotten to take your dose of Prometax, wait and take the next dose at the usual \n\ntime. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n108 \n\n4.

What Prometax is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nThe active substance of Prometax is rivastigmine. \n\n \n\nRivastigmine belongs to a class of substances called cholinesterase inhibitors. In patients with \n\nAlzheimer\u2019s dementia, certain nerve cells die in the brain, resulting in low levels of the \n\nneurotransmitter acetylcholine (a substance that allows nerve cells to communicate with each other). \n\nRivastigmine works by blocking the enzymes that break down acetylcholine: acetylcholinesterase and \n\nbutyrylcholinesterase. By blocking these enzymes, Prometax allows levels of acetylcholine to be \n\nincreased in the brain, helping to reduce the symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \n\n \n\nPrometax is used for the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer\u2019s \n\ndementia, a progressive brain disorder that gradually affects memory, intellectual ability and \n\nbehaviour. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Prometax \n\n \n\nDo not use Prometax \n- if you are allergic to rivastigmine (the active substance in Prometax) or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n- if you have ever had an allergic reaction to a similar type of medicine (carbamate derivatives). \n\n- if you have a skin reaction spreading beyond the patch size, if there is a more intense local \n\nreaction (such as blisters, increasing skin inflammation, swelling) and if it does not improve \n\nwithin 48 hours after removal of the transdermal patch. \n\nIf this applies to you, tell your doctor and do not apply Prometax transdermal patches. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n114 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before using Prometax: \n\n- if you have, or have ever had, an irregular or slow heartbeat. \n\n- if you have, or have ever had, an active stomach ulcer. \n\n- if you have, or have ever had, difficulties in passing urine. \n\n- if you have, or have ever had, seizures. \n\n- if you have, or have ever had, asthma or a severe respiratory disease. \n\n- if you suffer from trembling. \n\n- if you have a low body weight. \n\n- if you have gastrointestinal reactions such as feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and \n\ndiarrhoea. You may become dehydrated (losing too much fluid) if vomiting or diarrhoea are \n\nprolonged. \n\n- if you have impaired liver function. \n\nIf any of these apply to you, your doctor may need to monitor you more closely while you are on this \n\nmedicine. \n\n \n\nIf you have not applied a patch for more than three days, do not apply the next one before you have \n\ntalked to your doctor. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThere is no relevant use of Prometax in the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Prometax \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nPrometax might interfere with anticholinergic medicines some of which are medicines used to relieve \n\nstomach cramps or spasms (e.g. dicyclomine), to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease (e.g. amantadine) or to \n\nprevent motion sickness (e.g. diphenhydramine, scopolamine, or meclizine). \n\n \n\nPrometax Patch should not be given at the same time as metoclopramide (a medicine used to relieve or \n\nprevent nausea and vomiting). Taking the two medicines together could cause problems such as stiff \n\nlimbs and trembling hands. \n\n \n\nIf you have to undergo surgery whilst using Prometax transdermal patches, tell your doctor that you \n\nare using them because they may exaggerate the effects of some muscle relaxants during anaesthesia. \n\n \n\nCaution when Prometax Patch is given together with beta-blockers (medicines such as atenolol used to \n\ntreat hypertension, angina, and other heart conditions). Taking the two medicines together could cause \n\nproblems such as slowing of the heartbeat (bradycardia) leading to fainting or loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant, the benefits of using Prometax must be assessed against the possible effects on \n\nyour unborn child. Prometax should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n\n \n\nYou should not breast-feed during treatment with Prometax transdermal patches. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nYour doctor will tell you whether your illness allows you to drive vehicles and use machines safely. \n\nPrometax transdermal patches may cause fainting or severe confusion. If you feel faint or confused do \n\nnot drive, use machines or perform any other tasks that require your attention. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n115 \n\n3. How to use Prometax \n\n \n\nAlways use Prometax transdermal patches exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your \n\ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nIMPORTANT: \n\n\uf0b7 Take off the previous patch before putting ONE new patch on. \n\n\uf0b7 Only one patch per day. \n\n\uf0b7 Do not cut the patch into pieces. \n\n\uf0b7 Press the patch firmly in place for at least 30 seconds using the palm of the hand. \n\n \n\nHow to start treatment \n\nYour doctor will tell you which Prometax transdermal patch is most suitable for you. \n\n\uf0b7 Treatment usually starts with Prometax 4.6 mg/24 h. \n\n\uf0b7 The recommended usual daily dose is Prometax 9.5 mg/24 h. If well tolerated, the treating \n\nphysician may consider increasing the dose to 13.3 mg/24 h. \n\n\uf0b7 Only wear one Prometax patch at a time and replace the patch with a new one after 24 hours. \n\nDuring the course of the treatment your doctor may adjust the dose to suit your individual needs. \n\n \n\nIf you have not applied a patch for more than three days, do not apply the next one before you have \n\ntalked to your doctor. Transdermal patch treatment can be resumed at the same dose if treatment is not \n\ninterrupted for more than three days. Otherwise your doctor will restart your treatment on Prometax \n\n4.6 mg/24 h. \n\n \n\nPrometax can be used with food, drink and alcohol. \n\n \n\nWhere to apply your Prometax transdermal patch \n\n\uf0b7 Before you apply a patch, make sure that your skin is clean, dry and hairless, free of any \n\npowder, oil, moisturiser or lotion that could keep the patch from sticking to your skin properly, \n\nfree of cuts, rashes and/or irritations. \n\n\uf0b7 Carefully remove any existing patch before putting on a new one. Having multiple patches \n\non your body could expose you to an excessive amount of this medicine which could be \n\npotentially dangerous. \n\n\uf0b7 Apply ONE patch per day to ONLY ONE of the possible locations shown in the following \n\ndiagrams: \n\n- left upper arm or right upper arm \n\n- left upper chest or right upper chest (avoid breast) \n\n- left upper back or right upper back \n\n- left lower back or right lower back \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n116 \n\nEvery 24 hours take off the previous patch before putting \n\nONE new patch on to ONLY ONE of the following possible \n\nlocations. \n\n \n \n\nWhen changing the patch, you must remove the previous day\u2019s patch before you apply the new one to \n\na different location of skin each time (for example on the right side of your body one day, then on the \n\nleft side the next day, and on your upper body one day, then on your lower body the next day). Do not \n\napply a new patch to the same skin area twice within 14 days. \n\n \n\nHow to apply your Prometax transdermal patch \n\nPrometax patches are thin, opaque, plastic patches that stick to the skin. Each patch is sealed in a \n\nsachet that protects it until you are ready to put it on. Do not open the sachet or remove a patch until \n\njust before you apply it. \n\n \n\nCarefully remove the existing patch before putting on a new one. \n\n \n\n \n\nFor patients starting treatment for the first time and for patients \n\nrestarting Prometax after treatment interruption, please begin with \n\nthe second picture. \n\n \n \n\n- Each patch is sealed in its own protective sachet. \n\nYou should only open the sachet when you are ready to \n\napply the patch. \n\nCut the sachet along the dotted line with scissors and \n\nremove the patch from the sachet. \n\n \n \n\n- A protective liner covers the sticky side of the patch. \n\nPeel off one side of the protective liner and do not touch the \n\nsticky part of the patch with the fingers. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n117 \n\n- Put the sticky side of the patch on the upper or lower back, \n\nupper arm or chest and then peel off the second side of the \n\nprotective liner. \n\n \n \n\n- Then press the patch firmly in place for at least 30 seconds \n\nusing the palm of the hand to make sure that the edges stick \n\nwell. \n\n \n\nIf it helps you, you may write, for example, the day of the \n\nweek, on the patch with a thin ball point pen. \n \n\n \n\nThe patch should be worn continuously until it is time to replace it with a new one. You may wish to \n\nexperiment with different locations when applying a new patch, to find ones that are most comfortable \n\nfor you and where clothing will not rub on the patch. \n\n \n\nHow to remove your Prometax transdermal patch \n\nGently pull at one edge of the patch to remove it slowly from the skin. In case the adhesive residue is \n\nleft over on your skin, gently soak the area with warm water and mild soap or use baby oil to remove \n\nit. Alcohol or other dissolving liquids (nail polish remover or other solvents) should not be used. \n\n \n\nYou should wash your hands with soap and water after removing the patch. In case of contact with \n\neyes or if the eyes become red after handling the patch, rinse immediately with plenty of water and \n\nseek medical advice if symptoms do not resolve. \n\n \n\nCan you wear your Prometax transdermal patch when you are bathing, swimming, or in the \n\nsun? \n\n\uf0b7 Bathing, swimming or showering should not affect the patch. Make sure the patch does not \n\nloosen during these activities. \n\n\uf0b7 Do not expose the patch to any external heat sources (e.g. excessive sunlight, saunas, solarium) \n\nfor long periods of time. \n\n \n\nWhat to do if a patch falls off \n\nIf a patch falls off, apply a new one for the rest of the day, then replace it at the same time as usual the \n\nnext day. \n\n \n\nWhen and for how long to apply your Prometax transdermal patch \n\n\uf0b7 To benefit from treatment, you must apply a new patch every day, preferably at the same time \n\nof day. \n\n\uf0b7 Only wear one Prometax patch at a time and replace the patch with a new one after 24 hours. \n\n \n\nIf you use more Prometax than you should \n\nIf you accidentally apply more than one patch, remove all the patches from your skin, then inform \n\nyour doctor that you have accidentally applied more than one patch. You may require medical \n\nattention. Some people who have accidentally taken too much Prometax have experienced feeling sick \n\n(nausea), being sick (vomiting), diarrhoea, high blood pressure and hallucinations. Slow heartbeat and \n\nfainting may also occur. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Prometax \n\nIf you find you have forgotten to apply a patch, apply one immediately. You may apply the next patch \n\nat the usual time the next day. Do not apply two patches to make up for the one that you missed. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n118 \n\nIf you stop using Prometax \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you stop using the patch. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, Prometax transdermal patches can cause side effects, although not everybody gets \n\nthem. \n\n \n\nYou may have side effects more often when you start your medicine or when your dose is increased. \n\nUsually, the side effects will slowly go away as your body gets used to the medicine. \n\n \n\nTake off your patch and tell your doctor straight away, if you notice any of the following side \n\neffects which could become serious: \n\n \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n\uf0b7 Loss of appetite \n\n\uf0b7 Feeling dizzy \n\n\uf0b7 Feeling agitated or sleepy \n\n\uf0b7 Urinary incontinence (inability to retain adequate urine) \n\n \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n\uf0b7 Problems with your heartbeat such as slow heartbeat \n\n\uf0b7 Seeing things that are not really there (hallucinations) \n\n\uf0b7 Stomach ulcer \n\n\uf0b7 Dehydration (losing too much fluid) \n\n\uf0b7 Hyperactivity (high level of activity, restlessness) \n\n\uf0b7 Aggression \n\n \n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \n\n\uf0b7 Falling \n\n \n\nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) \n\n\uf0b7 Stiff arms or legs \n\n\uf0b7 Trembling hands \n\n \n\nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n\uf0b7 Allergic reaction where the patch was used, such as blisters or inflamed skin \n\n\uf0b7 The signs of Parkinson\u2019s disease get worse \u2013 such as tremor, stiffness and shuffling \n\n\uf0b7 Inflammation of the pancreas \u2013 signs include serious upper stomach pain, often with feeling sick \n\n(nausea) or being sick (vomiting) \n\n\uf0b7 Fast or uneven heartbeat \n\n\uf0b7 High blood pressure \n\n\uf0b7 Fits (seizures) \n\n\uf0b7 Liver disorders (yellow skin, yellowing of the whites of the eyes, abnormal darkening of the \n\nurine or unexplained nausea, vomiting, tiredness and loss of appetite) \n\n\uf0b7 Changes in tests which show how well the liver is working \n\n\uf0b7 Feeling restless \n\n\uf0b7 Nightmares \n\nTake off your patch and tell your doctor straight away, if you notice any of the side effects above. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n119 \n\nOther side effects seen with Prometax capsules or oral solution and which may occur with the \n\npatch: \n\n \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n\uf0b7 Too much saliva \n\n\uf0b7 Loss of appetite \n\n\uf0b7 Feeling restless \n\n\uf0b7 Generally feeling unwell \n\n\uf0b7 Trembling or feeling confused \n\n\uf0b7 Increased sweating \n\n \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n\uf0b7 Uneven heart rate (e.g. fast heart rate) \n\n\uf0b7 Difficulty sleeping \n\n\uf0b7 Accidental falls \n\n \n\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \n\n\uf0b7 Fits (seizures) \n\n\uf0b7 Ulcer in the intestine \n\n\uf0b7 Chest pain \u2013 this may be caused by heart spasm \n\n \n\nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) \n\n\uf0b7 High blood pressure \n\n\uf0b7 Inflammation of the pancreas \u2013 the signs include serious upper stomach pain, often with feeling \n\nsick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting) \n\n\uf0b7 Bleeding in the gut \u2013 shows as blood in stools or when being sick \n\n\uf0b7 Seeing things that are not there (hallucinations) \n\n\uf0b7 Some people who have been violently sick have had tearing of the tube that connects your \n\nmouth with your stomach (oesophagus) \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

substances called cholinesterase inhibitors. in patients with alzheimer's dementia or dementia due to parkinson's disease, certain nerve cells die in the brain, resulting in low levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (a substance that allows nerve cells to communicate with each other). rivastigmine works by blocking the enzymes that break down acetylcholine: acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. by blocking these enzymes, prometax allows levels of acetylcholine to be increased in the brain, helping to reduce the symptoms of alzheimer's disease and dementia associated with parkinson's disease. prometax is used for the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderately severe alzheimer's dementia, a progressive brain disorder that gradually affects memory, intellectual ability and behaviour. the capsules and oral solution can also be used for the treatment of dementia in adult patients with parkinson's disease.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text":

if this applies to you, tell your doctor and do not take prometax. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before taking prometax: - if you have, or have ever had, irregular or slow heartbeat. - if you have, or have ever had, an active stomach ulcer. - if you have, or have ever had, difficulties in passing urine. - if you have, or have ever had, seizures. - if you have, or have ever had,

similar effects to prometax. prometax might interfere with anticholinergic medicines (medicines used to relieve stomach cramps or spasms, to treat parkinson's disease or to prevent travel sickness). prometax should not be given at the same time as metoclopramide (a medicine used to relieve or prevent nausea and vomiting). taking the two medicines together could cause problems such as stiff limbs and trembling hands. if you have to undergo surgery whilst taking prometax, tell your doctor before you are given any anaesthetics, because prometax may exaggerate the effects of some muscle relaxants during anaesthesia. caution when prometax is taken together with beta-blockers (medicines such as atenolol used to treat hypertension, angina and other heart conditions). taking the two medicines
