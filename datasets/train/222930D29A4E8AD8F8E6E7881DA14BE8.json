NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nSycrest 5 mg sublingual tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach sublingual tablet contains 5 mg asenapine (as maleate).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSublingual tablet\nRound, white to off-white, sublingual tablets debossed with \u201c5\u201d on one side.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nSycrest is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes associated with bipolar I \ndisorder in adults.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended starting dose of Sycrest as monotherapy is 5 mg twice daily. One dose should be \ntaken in the morning and one dose should be taken in the evening. The dose can be increased to 10 mg \ntwice daily based on individual clinical response and tolerability. See section 5.1. For combination \ntherapy a starting dose of 5 mg twice daily is recommended. Depending on the clinical response and \ntolerability in the individual patient, the dose can be increased to 10 mg twice daily.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nSycrest should be used with care in the elderly. Limited data on efficacy in patients 65 years of age \nand older are available. Available pharmacokinetic data are described in section 5.2.\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment. There is no experience with \nasenapine in patients with severe renal impairment who have a creatinine clearance less than \n15 mL/min.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment. The possibility of elevated \nasenapine plasma levels cannot be excluded in some patients with moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh B) and caution is advised. In subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), a \n7-fold increase in asenapine exposure was observed. Thus, Sycrest is not recommended in patients \nwith severe hepatic impairment. \n\nPaediatric population\nA pharmacokinetic study and a short term efficacy and safety study were performed in a paediatric \npopulation (ages 10-17 years) with manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. Long \n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nterm safety in this population was explored in a 50-week, open-label, uncontrolled extension study. \nCurrently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThe tablet should not be removed from the blister until ready to take it. Dry hands should be used \nwhen touching the tablet. The tablet should not be pushed through the tablet pack. The tablet pack \nshould not be cut or torn. The coloured tab should be peeled back and the tablet should be removed \ngently. The tablet should not be crushed.\n\nTo ensure optimal absorption, the Sycrest sublingual tablet should be placed under the tongue and \nallowed to dissolve completely. The tablet will dissolve in saliva within seconds. Sycrest sublingual \ntablets should not be chewed or swallowed. Eating and drinking should be avoided for 10 minutes \nafter administration.\nWhen used in combination with other medicinal products, Sycrest should be taken last.\n\nTreatment with Sycrest is not advised in patients who are unable to comply with this method of \nadministration, as the bioavailability of asenapine when swallowed is low (< 2 % with an oral tablet \nformulation).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic substances are at an \nincreased risk of death.\n\nSycrest is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis and is not \nrecommended for use in this particular group of patients.\n\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), characterised by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic \ninstability, altered consciousness and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase levels, has been reported \nto occur with antipsychotics, including asenapine. Additional clinical signs may include \nmyoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure. \n\nIf a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS Sycrest must be discontinued.\n\nSeizures\nIn clinical trials, cases of seizure were occasionally reported during treatment with asenapine. \nTherefore, Sycrest should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or \nhave conditions associated with seizures.\n\nSuicide\nThe possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in psychotic illnesses and bipolar disorder and close \nsupervision of high-risk patients should accompany treatment. \n\nOrthostatic hypotension\nAsenapine may induce orthostatic hypotension and syncope, especially early in treatment, probably \nreflecting its \u03b11-adrenergic antagonist properties. Elderly patients are particularly at risk for \nexperiencing orthostatic hypotension (see section 4.8). In clinical trials, cases of syncope were \noccasionally reported during treatment with Sycrest. Sycrest should be used with caution in elderly \n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\npatients and in patients with known cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, myocardial infarction \nor ischemia, conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions that predispose the \npatient to hypotension (e.g., dehydration and hypovolemia).\n\nTardive dyskinesia\nMedicinal products with dopamine receptor antagonistic properties have been associated with the \ninduction of tardive dyskinesia characterised by rhythmical, involuntary movements, predominantly \nof the tongue and/or face. In clinical trials, cases of tardive dyskinesia were occasionally reported \nduring treatment with asenapine. The onset of extrapyramidal symptoms is a risk factor for tardive \ndyskinesia. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on Sycrest, discontinuation \nof treatment should be considered.\n\nHyperprolactinaemia\nIncreases in prolactin levels were observed in some patients with Sycrest. In clinical trials, there were \nfew adverse reactions related to abnormal prolactin levels reported.\n\nQT interval\nClinically relevant QT prolongation does not appear to be associated with asenapine. Caution should \nbe exercised when Sycrest is prescribed in patients with known cardiovascular disease or family \nhistory of QT prolongation, and in concomitant use with other medicinal products thought to prolong \nthe QT interval.\n\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus\nHyperglycaemia or exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes has occasionally been reported during \ntreatment with asenapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and \nglucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes \nmellitus in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and the increasing incidence of diabetes \nmellitus in the general population. Appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable in diabetic patients \nand in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus.\n\nDysphagia\nEsophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic treatment. Cases of \ndysphagia were occasionally reported in patients treated with Sycrest.\n\nBody temperature regulation\nDisruption of the body\u2019s ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic \nmedicinal products. From the clinical trials, it is concluded that clinically relevant body temperature \ndysregulation does not appear to be associated with asenapine. Appropriate care is advised when \nprescribing Sycrest for patients who will be experiencing conditions that may contribute to an \nelevation in core body temperature, e.g. exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving\nconcomitant medicinal products with anticholinergic activity or being subject to dehydration.\n\nPatients with severe hepatic impairment\nAsenapine exposure is increased 7-fold in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). \nTherefore, Sycrest is not recommended in such patients.\n\nParkinson\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies\nPhysicians should weigh the risks versus the benefits when prescribing Sycrest to patients with \nParkinson\u2019s disease or dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) since both groups may be at increased risk \nof neuroleptic malignant syndrome as well as having an increased sensitivity to antipsychotics. \nManifestation of this increased sensitivity can include confusion, obtundation, postural instability \nwith frequent falls, in addition to extrapyramidal symptoms.\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nFalls\nAsenapine may cause adverse effects such as somnolence, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness and \nextrapyramidal symptoms, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. \nPatients at risk for fall should be evaluated prior to prescribing asenapine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nGiven the primary effects of asenapine on the central nervous system (CNS) (see section 4.8), caution \nshould be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicinal products. \nPatients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking Sycrest. \n\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect Sycrest\nAsenapine is cleared primarily through direct glucuronidation by UGT1A4 and oxidative metabolism \nby cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (predominantly CYP1A2). The potential effects of inhibitors and an \ninducer of several of these enzyme pathways on asenapine pharmacokinetics were studied, \nspecifically fluvoxamine (CYP1A2 inhibitor), paroxetine (CYP2D6 inhibitor), imipramine \n(CYP1A2/2C19/3A4 inhibitor), cimetidine (CYP3A4/2D6/1A2 inhibitor), carbamazepine \n(CYP3A4/1A2 inducer) and valproate (UGT inhibitor). Except for fluvoxamine, none of the \ninteracting medicinal products resulted in clinically relevant alterations in asenapine \npharmacokinetics. \n\nDuring combined administration with a single dose of asenapine 5 mg, fluvoxamine 25 mg twice daily \nresulted in a 29 % increase in asenapine AUC. The full therapeutic dose of fluvoxamine would be \nexpected to produce a greater increase in asenapine plasma concentrations. Therefore, \nco-administration of asenapine and fluvoxamine should be approached with caution.\n\nPotential for Sycrest to affect other medicinal products\nBecause of its \u03b11-adrenergic antagonism with potential for inducing orthostatic hypotension (see \nsection 4.4), Sycrest may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents.\n\nAsenapine may antagonise the effect of levodopa and dopamine agonists. If this combination is \ndeemed necessary, the lowest effective dose of each treatment should be prescribed. \n\nIn vitro studies indicate that asenapine weakly inhibits CYP2D6. Clinical drug interaction studies \ninvestigating the effects of CYP2D6 inhibition by asenapine showed the following results:\n\n\uf02d Following co-administration of dextromethorphan and asenapine in healthy subjects, the ratio \nof dextrorphan/dextromethorphan (DX/DM) as a marker of CYP2D6 activity was measured. \nIndicative of CYP2D6 inhibition, treatment with asenapine 5 mg twice daily resulted in a \nfractional decrease in DX/DM ratio to 0.43. In the same study, treatment with paroxetine 20 mg \ndaily decreased the DX/DM ratio to 0.032.\n\n\uf02d In a separate study, co-administration of a single 75 mg dose of imipramine with a single 5 mg \ndose of asenapine did not affect the plasma concentrations of the metabolite desipramine (a \nCYP2D6 substrate). \n\n\uf02d Co-administration of a single 20 mg dose of paroxetine (a CYP2D6 substrate and inhibitor) \nduring treatment with 5 mg asenapine twice daily in 15 healthy male subjects resulted in an \nalmost 2-fold increase in paroxetine exposure. \n\nIn vivo asenapine appears to be at most a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. However, asenapine may \nenhance the inhibitory effects of paroxetine on its own metabolism.\n\nTherefore, Sycrest should be co-administered cautiously with medicinal products that are both \nsubstrates and inhibitors for CYP2D6.\n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no adequate data from the use of Sycrest in pregnant women. Asenapine was not teratogenic \nin animal studies. Maternal and embryo toxic effects were found in animal studies (see section 5.3). \n\nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including Sycrest) during the third trimester of pregnancy \nare at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that may vary \nin severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder in newborn infants. \nConsequently, newborn infants should be monitored carefully. \n\nSycrest should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires \ntreatment with asenapine and only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\nAsenapine was excreted in milk of rats during lactation. It is not known whether asenapine or its \nmetabolites are excreted in human milk. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with \nSycrest.\n\nFertility\nNo impairment of fertility has been observed in nonclinical studies (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nAsenapine may cause somnolence and sedation. Therefore, patients should be cautioned about driving \nand using machines until they are reasonably certain that Sycrest therapy does not affect them \nadversely.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of safety profile\nThe most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with the use of asenapine in \nclinical trials were somnolence and anxiety. Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. \nOther serious ADRs are discussed in more detail in section 4.4.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe incidences of the ADRs associated with asenapine therapy are tabulated below. The table is based \non adverse reactions reported during clinical trials and/or post-marketing use.\nAll ADRs are listed by system organ class and frequency; very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\uf0b3 1/100 to \n< 1/10), uncommon (\uf0b3 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\uf0b3 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, ADRs are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness.\n\nSystem organ \nclass\n\nVery \ncommon\n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Not known\n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \ndisorders\n\nNeutropenia\n\nImmune system \ndisorders\n\nAllergic \nreactions\n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders\n\nWeight \nincreased\nIncreased \nappetite\n\nHyperglycaemia\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\nSystem organ \nclass\n\nVery \ncommon\n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Not known\n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders\n\nAnxiety\n\nNervous system \ndisorders\n\nSomnolenc\ne\n\nDystonia\nAkathisia \nDyskinesia \nParkinsonism \nSedation \nDizziness \nDysgeusia\n\nSyncope\nSeizure \nExtrapyramidal \ndisorder\nDysarthria\nRestless legs \nsyndrome\n\nNeuroleptic \nmalignant \nsyndrome \n\nEye disorders Accommodation \ndisorder \n\nCardiac \ndisorders\n\nSinus \nbradycardia\nBundle branch \nblock\nElectrocardio-\ngram QT \nprolonged\nSinus \ntachycardia\n\nVascular \ndisorders\n\nOrthostatic \nhypotension \nHypotension\n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders\n\nPulmonary \nembolism\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nHypoaesthesia \noral\nNausea\nSalivary \nhypersecretion\n\nSwollen tongue\nDysphagia \nGlossodynia \nParaesthesia \noral\nOral mucosal \nlesions \n(ulcerations, \nblistering and \ninflammation)\n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders\n\nAlanine \naminotransferas\ne increased\n\nInjury, \npoisoning and \nprocedural \ncomplications\n\nFalls*\n\nMusculoskeleta\nl and \nconnective \ntissue disorders\n\nMuscle rigidity Rhabdomyolysis\n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nSystem organ \nclass\n\nVery \ncommon\n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Not known\n\nPregnancy, \npuerperium and \nperinatal \nconditions\n\nDrug\nwithdrawal \nsyndrome \nneonatal \n(see 4.6)\n\nReproductive \nsystem and \nbreast disorders \n\nSexual \ndysfunction \nAmenorrhoea\n\nGynaecomastia\nGalactorrhoea\n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions\n\nFatigue\n\n* See subsection \u201cFalls\u201d below\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nExtrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)\nIn clinical trials, the incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms in asenapine-treated patients was higher \nthan placebo (15.4 % vs 11.0 %).\n\nFrom the short-term (6 weeks) schizophrenia trials there appears to be a dose-response relationship \nfor akathisia in patients treated with asenapine, and for parkinsonism there was an increasing trend \nwith higher doses.\n\nBased on a small pharmacokinetic study, paediatric patients appeared to be more sensitive to dystonia \nwith initial dosing with asenapine when a gradual up-titration schedule was not followed (see \nsection 5.2). The incidence of dystonia in paediatric clinical trials using a gradual up-titration was\nsimilar to that seen in adult trials.\n\nWeight increase\nIn the combined short-term and long-term schizophrenia and bipolar mania trials in adults, the mean \nchange in body weight for asenapine was 0.8 kg. The proportion of subjects with clinically significant \nweight gain (\u2265 7 % weight gain from baseline at endpoint) in the short-term schizophrenia trials was \n5.3 % for asenapine compared to 2.3 % for placebo. The proportion of subjects with clinically \nsignificant weight gain (\u2265 7 % weight gain from baseline at endpoint) in the short-term, flexible-dose\nbipolar mania trials was 6.5 % for asenapine compared to 0.6 % for placebo.\n\nIn a 3-week, placebo-controlled, randomized, fixed-dose efficacy and safety trial in paediatric patients \n10 to 17 years of age with bipolar I disorder, the mean change from baseline to endpoint in weight for \nplacebo and asenapine 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg twice daily, was 0.48, 1.72, 1.62, and 1.44 kg, \nrespectively. The proportion of subjects with clinically significant weight gain (\u2265 7 % weight gain \nfrom baseline at Day 21) was 14.1 % for asenapine 2.5 mg twice daily, 8.9 % for asenapine 5 mg \ntwice daily, and 9.2 % for asenapine 10 mg twice daily, compared to 1.1 % for placebo. In the \nlong-term extension trial (50 weeks), a total of 34.8 % of subjects experienced clinically significant \nweight increase (i.e., \u2265 7 % increase in body weight at endpoint). Overall mean (SD) weight gain at \nstudy endpoint was 3.5 (5.76) kg.\n\nOrthostatic hypotension\nThe incidence of orthostatic hypotension in elderly subjects was 4.1 % compared to 0.3 % in the \ncombined phase 2/3 trial population.\n\nFalls\nFalls may occur as a result of one or more adverse events such as the following: Somnolence, \nOrthostatic hypotension, Dizziness, Extrapyramidal symptoms.\n\n \n\n\n\n9\n\nHepatic enzymes\nTransient, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases, alanine transferase (ALT), aspartate \ntransferase (AST) have been seen commonly, especially in early treatment.\n\nOther findings\nCerebrovascular events have been reported in patients treated with asenapine but there is no evidence \nof any excess incidence over what is expected in adults between 18 and 65 years of age.\n\nAsenapine has anaesthetic properties. Oral hypoaesthesia and oral paraesthesia may occur directly \nafter administration and usually resolves within 1 hour.\n\nThere have been post-marketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with \nasenapine, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, swollen tongue and swollen \nthroat (pharyngeal oedema).\n\nPaediatric population\nAsenapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nThe clinically relevant adverse experiences identified in the paediatric bipolar and schizophrenia trials \nwere similar to those observed in adult bipolar and schizophrenia trials.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5 % and at least twice the rate of placebo) reported in \npaediatric patients with bipolar I disorder were somnolence, sedation, dizziness, dysgeusia, \nhypoaesthesia oral, paraesthesia oral, nausea, increased appetite, fatigue, and weight increased (see \nWeight increase above).\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (proportion of patients \uf0b3 5 % and at least twice placebo) reported\nin paediatric patients with schizophrenia were somnolence, sedation, akathisia, dizziness, and \nhypoaesthesia oral. There was a statistically significant higher incidence of patients with \u2265 7 % \nweight gain (from baseline to endpoint) compared to placebo (3.1 %) for Sycrest 2.5 mg twice daily \n(9.5 %) and Sycrest 5 mg twice daily (13.1 %).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nFew cases of overdose were reported in the asenapine program. Reported estimated doses were \nbetween 15 and 400 mg. In most cases it was not clear if asenapine had been taken sublingually. \nTreatment-related adverse reactions included agitation and confusion, akathisia, orofacial dystonia, \nsedation, and asymptomatic ECG findings (bradycardia, supraventricular complexes, intraventricular \nconduction delay). \n\nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with Sycrest. There is no specific \nantidote to Sycrest. The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered. \nCardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias and management of overdose \nshould concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway oxygenation and \nventilation, and management of symptoms. Hypotension and circulatory collapse should be treated \nwith appropriate measures, such as intravenous fluids and/or sympathomimetic agents (epinephrine \nand dopamine should not be used, since beta stimulations may worsen hypotension in the setting of \nSycrest-induced alpha blockade). In case of severe extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10\n\nmedicinal products should be administered. Close medical supervision and monitoring should \ncontinue until the patient recovers.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, antipsychotics, ATC code: N05AH05\n\nMechanism of action\nThe mechanism of action of asenapine is not fully understood. However, based on its receptor \npharmacology, it is proposed that the efficacy of asenapine is mediated through a combination of \nantagonist activity at D2 and 5-HT2A receptors. Actions at other receptors e.g., 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, \n5-HT2C, 5-HT6, 5-HT7, D3, and \u03b12-adrenergic receptors, may also contribute to the clinical effects \nof asenapine.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nAsenapine exhibits high affinity for serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT5, \n5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors, dopamine D2, D3, D4, and D1 receptors, \u03b11 and \u03b12-adrenergic \nreceptors, and histamine H1 receptors, and moderate affinity for H2 receptors. In in vitro assays \nasenapine acts as an antagonist at these receptors. Asenapine has no appreciable affinity for \nmuscarinic cholinergic receptors.\n\nClinical efficacy\n\nClinical efficacy in bipolar I disorder\nThe efficacy of asenapine in the treatment of a DSM-IV manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder \nwith or without psychotic features was evaluated in two similarly designed 3-week, randomized, \ndouble-blind, flexible-dose, placebo- and active controlled (olanzapine) monotherapy trials involving \n488 and 489 patients, respectively. All patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \nDisorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria for bipolar I disorder, current episode manic \n(DSM-IV 296.4x), or mixed (DSM-IV 296.6x) and had a Young Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS) score\nof \u2265 20 at screening and baseline. Patients with rapid cycling were excluded from these studies. \nAsenapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in the reduction of manic symptoms over \n3 weeks. Point estimates [95 % CI] for the change from baseline to endpoint in YMRS using LOCF \nanalysis in the two studies were as follows: \n-11.5 [-13.0, -10.0] for asenapine vs -7.8 [-10.0, -5.6] for placebo and \n-10.8 [-12.3, -9.3] for asenapine vs -5.5 [-7.5, -3.5] for placebo. \nA statistically significant difference between asenapine and placebo was seen as early as day 2. \n\nPatients from the two pivotal 3 week trials were studied for a further 9 weeks an extension trial. \nMaintenance of effect during the episode after 12 weeks of randomised treatment was demonstrated in \nthis trial. \n\nIn one double-blind, fixed-dose, parallel-group, 3-week placebo controlled trial in subjects with \nbipolar I disorder experiencing an acute manic or mixed episode involving 367 patients of which 126 \nreceived placebo, 122 received asenapine 5 mg twice daily (BID), and 119 received asenapine 10 mg \nBID, the primary efficacy hypothesis was met. Both asenapine doses (5 mg BID and 10 mg BID) were \nsuperior to placebo and showed statistically significant improvement in change from baseline in \nY-MRS total score at Day 21 compared with placebo. Based upon a LOCF analysis including all \npatients treated, the difference in least squares (LS) mean change from baseline to Day 21 in the \nY-MRS total score between asenapine 5 mg BID and placebo was -3.1 points (95 % CI [-5.7, -0.5]; \np-value = 0.0183). The difference in LS mean change from baseline to Day 21 in the Y-MRS total \nscore between asenapine 10 mg BID and placebo was -3.0 points (95 % CI [-5.6, -0.4]; \np-value = 0.0244). A statistically significant difference between asenapine and placebo was seen as \n\n \n\n\n\n11\n\nearly as day 2. In this short-term, fixed-dose controlled trial there was no evidence of added benefit \nwith a 10 mg twice daily dose compared to 5 mg twice daily.\n\nIn a 12-week, placebo-controlled trial involving 326 patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar \nI disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or \nvalproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of asenapine as\nadjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy to lithium or valproate monotherapy at week 3 (point \nestimates [95 % CI] for the change from baseline to endpoint in YMRS using LOCF analysis were \n-10.3 [-11.9, -8.8] for asenapine and -7.9 [-9.4, -6.4] for placebo) and at week 12 (-12.7 [-14.5, -10.9] \nfor asenapine and -9.3 [-11.8, -7.6] for placebo) in the reduction of manic symptoms.\n\nPaediatric population\nAsenapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years (see\nsection 4.2). \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Sycrest was evaluated in 403 paediatric patients with bipolar I disorder \nwho participated in a single, 3-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, of whom 302 patients \nreceived Sycrest at fixed doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 10 mg twice daily. Study results showed \nstatistically significant superiority for all three Sycrest doses in improving the Young Mania Rating \nScale (YMRS) total score as measured by the change from baseline to Day 21, as compared with \nplacebo. Long term efficacy could not be established in a 50-week, uncontrolled, open-label extension \ntrial. The clinically relevant adverse reactions identified in the paediatric trials were generally similar \nto those observed in the adult trials. However, adverse effects of treatment on weight gain and on \nplasma lipid profile appeared to be greater than effects observed in the adult trials.\n\nEfficacy of Sycrest was not demonstrated in an 8-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, \nrandomized, fixed-dose trial in 306 adolescent patients aged 12-17 years with schizophrenia at doses \nof 2.5 and 5 mg twice daily.\n\nPaediatric studies with Sycrest were performed using flavoured sublingual tablets. The European \nMedicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Sycrest in one or \nmore subsets of the paediatric population in bipolar I disorder (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing sublingual administration, asenapine is rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations \noccurring within 0.5 to 1.5 hours. The absolute bioavailability of sublingual asenapine at 5 mg is \n35 %. The absolute bioavailability of asenapine when swallowed is low (< 2 % with an oral tablet \nformulation). The intake of water several (2 or 5) minutes after asenapine administration resulted in \ndecreased (19 % and 10 %, respectively) asenapine exposure. Therefore, eating and drinking should \nbe avoided for 10 minutes after administration (see section 4.2).\n\nDistribution\nAsenapine is rapidly distributed and has a large volume of distribution (approximately 20-25 L/kg), \nindicating extensive extravascular distribution. Asenapine is highly bound (95 %) to plasma proteins, \nincluding albumin and \u03b11-acid glycoprotein.\n\nBiotransformation\nAsenapine is extensively metabolized. Direct glucuronidation (mediated by UGT1A4) and \ncytochrome P450 (primarily CYP1A2, with contributions of 2D6 and 3A4) mediated oxidation and \ndemethylation are the primary metabolic pathways for asenapine. In an in vivo study in humans with \nradio-labelled asenapine, the predominant drug-related entity in plasma was asenapine \nN+-glucuronide; others included N-desmethylasenapine, N-desmethylasenapine N-carbamoyl \n\n \n\n\n\n12\n\nglucuronide, and unchanged asenapine in smaller amounts. Sycrest activity is primarily due to the \nparent compound.\n\nAsenapine is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Asenapine does not cause induction of CYP1A2 or \nCYP3A4 activities in cultured human hepatocytes. Co-administration of asenapine with known \ninhibitors, inducers or substrates of these metabolic pathways has been studied in a number of \ndrug-drug interaction studies (see section 4.5).\n\nElimination\nAsenapine is a high clearance compound, with a clearance after intravenous administration of 52 L/h. \nIn a mass balance study, the majority of the radioactive dose was recovered in urine (about 50 %) and \nfaeces (about 40 %), with only a small amount excreted in faeces (5-16 %) as unchanged compound. \nFollowing an initial more rapid distribution phase, the terminal half-life of asenapine is approximately \n24 h.\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\nIncreasing the dose from 5 to 10 mg twice daily (a two-fold increase) results in less than linear \n(1.7 times) increases in both the extent of exposure and maximum concentration. The less than \nproportional increase of Cmax and AUC with dose may be attributed to limitations in the absorption \ncapacity from the oral mucosa following sublingual administration.\nDuring twice-daily dosing, steady-state is attained within 3 days. Overall, steady-state asenapine \npharmacokinetics are similar to single-dose pharmacokinetics.\n\nPharmacokinetics in special populations\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of asenapine were similar among subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) or \nmoderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment and subjects with normal hepatic function. In subjects \nwith severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), a 7-fold increase in asenapine exposure was observed \n(see section 4.2). \n\nRenal impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of asenapine following a single dose of 5 mg asenapine were similar among \nsubjects with varying degrees of renal impairment and subjects with normal renal function. \nThere is no experience with asenapine in severe renal impairment patients with a creatinine clearance \nless than 15 mL/min.\n\nElderly\nIn elderly patients (between 65 and 85 years of age), exposure to asenapine is approximately 30 % \nhigher than in younger adults.\n\nPaediatric population (children and adolescents)\nIn a PK study using unflavoured sublingual tablets, at the 5 mg twice daily dose level, asenapine \npharmacokinetics in adolescent patients (12 to 17 years of age, inclusive) are similar to those \nobserved in adults. In adolescents, the 10 mg twice daily dose did not result in increased exposure \ncompared to 5 mg twice daily.\n\nIn a second PK study using flavoured sublingual tablets, the 10 mg twice daily dose in a paediatric \npopulation (10 to 17 years of age, inclusive) resulted in an approximate dose-proportional increase in \nasenapine exposure compared to 5 mg twice daily.\n\nGender\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that there is no evidence of gender-related \ndifferences in the pharmacokinetics of asenapine.\n\n \n\n\n\n13\n\nRace\nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no clinical relevant effects of race on the pharmacokinetics \nof asenapine were found.\n\nSmoking status\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that smoking, which induces CYP1A2, has no effect \non the clearance of asenapine. In a dedicated study, concomitant smoking during administration of a \nsingle 5 mg sublingual dose had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of asenapine.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology. Repeat-dose toxicity studies in rat and dog showed mainly dose-limiting \npharmacological effects, such as sedation. Furthermore, prolactin-mediated effects on mammary \nglands and oestrus cycle disturbances were observed. In dogs high oral doses resulted in \nhepatotoxicity that was not observed after chronic intravenous administration. Asenapine has some \naffinity to melanin-containing tissues. However, when tested in vitro it was devoid of phototoxicity. \nIn addition, histopathological examination of the eyes from dogs treated chronically with asenapine \ndid not reveal any signs of ocular toxicity, demonstrating the absence of a phototoxic hazard. \nAsenapine was not genotoxic in a battery of tests. In subcutaneous carcinogenicity studies in rats and \nmice, no increases in tumour incidences were observed. Effects in non-clinical studies were observed \nonly at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little \nrelevance to clinical use.\n\nAsenapine did not impair fertility in rats and was not teratogenic in rat and rabbit. Embryotoxicity \nwas found in reproduction toxicology studies using rats and rabbits. Asenapine caused mild maternal \ntoxicity and slight retardation of foetal skeletal development. Following oral administration to \npregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis, asenapine adversely affected body weight at the \nhigh dose of 15 mg.kg-1 twice daily. At this dose foetal body weight decreased. When asenapine was \nadministered intravenously to pregnant rabbits, no signs of embryotoxicity were observed. In rats, \nembryofoetal toxicity (increased post-implantation loss, decreased foetal weights, and delayed \nossification) was observed following oral or intravenous administration during organogenesis or \nthroughout gestation. Increased neonatal mortality was observed among the offspring of female rats \ntreated during gestation and lactation. From a cross-fostering study it was concluded that asenapine \ninduced peri- and postnatal losses are caused by impairment of the pups rather than altered nursing \nbehaviour of the dams.\n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nSycrest 10 mg sublingual tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach sublingual tablet contains 10 mg asenapine (as maleate).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSublingual tablet\nRound, white to off-white, sublingual tablets debossed with \u201d10\u201d on one side.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nSycrest is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes associated with bipolar I \ndisorder in adults.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended starting dose of Sycrest as monotherapy is 5 mg twice daily. One dose should be \ntaken in the morning and one dose should be taken in the evening. The dose can be increased to 10 mg \ntwice daily based on individual clinical response and tolerability. See section 5.1. For combination \ntherapy a starting dose of 5 mg twice daily is recommended. Depending on the clinical response and \ntolerability in the individual patient, the dose can be increased to 10 mg twice daily.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\nSycrest should be used with care in the elderly. Limited data on efficacy in patients 65 years of age \nand older are available. Available pharmacokinetic data are described in section 5.2.\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment. There is no experience with \nasenapine in patients with severe renal impairment who have a creatinine clearance less than \n15 mL/min.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment. The possibility of elevated \nasenapine plasma levels cannot be excluded in some patients with moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh B) and caution is advised. In subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), a \n7-fold increase in asenapine exposure was observed. Thus, Sycrest is not recommended in patients \nwith severe hepatic impairment. \n\nPaediatric population\nA pharmacokinetic study and a short term efficacy and safety study were performed in a paediatric \npopulation (ages 10-17 years) with manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. Long \n\n \n\n\n\n16\n\nterm safety in this population was explored in a 50-week, open-label, uncontrolled extension study. \nCurrently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThe tablet should not be removed from the blister until ready to take it. Dry hands should be used \nwhen touching the tablet. The tablet should not be pushed through the tablet pack. The tablet pack \nshould not be cut or torn. The coloured tab should be peeled back and the tablet should be removed \ngently. The tablet should not be crushed.\n\nTo ensure optimal absorption, the Sycrest sublingual tablet should be placed under the tongue and \nallowed to dissolve completely. The tablet will dissolve in saliva within seconds. Sycrest sublingual \ntablets should not be chewed or swallowed. Eating and drinking should be avoided for 10 minutes \nafter administration.\n\nWhen used in combination with other medicinal products, Sycrest should be taken last.\n\nTreatment with Sycrest is not advised in patients who are unable to comply with this method of \nadministration, as the bioavailability of asenapine when swallowed is low (< 2 % with an oral tablet \nformulation).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic substances are at an \nincreased risk of death.\n\nSycrest is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis and is not \nrecommended for use in this particular group of patients.\n\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), characterised by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic \ninstability, altered consciousness and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase levels, has been reported \nto occur with antipsychotics, including asenapine. Additional clinical signs may include \nmyoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure. \n\nIf a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS Sycrest must be discontinued.\n\nSeizures\nIn clinical trials, cases of seizure were occasionally reported during treatment with asenapine. \nTherefore, Sycrest should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or \nhave conditions associated with seizures.\n\nSuicide\nThe possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in psychotic illnesses and bipolar disorder and close \nsupervision of high-risk patients should accompany treatment. \n\nOrthostatic hypotension\nAsenapine may induce orthostatic hypotension and syncope, especially early in treatment, probably \nreflecting its \u03b11-adrenergic antagonist properties. Elderly patients are particularly at risk for \nexperiencing orthostatic hypotension (see section 4.8). In clinical trials, cases of syncope were \n\n \n\n\n\n17\n\noccasionally reported during treatment with Sycrest. Sycrest should be used with caution in elderly \npatients and in patients with known cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, myocardial infarction \nor ischemia, conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions that predispose the \npatient to hypotension (e.g., dehydration and hypovolemia).\n\nTardive dyskinesia\nMedicinal products with dopamine receptor antagonistic properties have been associated with the \ninduction of tardive dyskinesia characterised by rhythmical, involuntary movements, predominantly \nof the tongue and/or face. In clinical trials, cases of tardive dyskinesia were occasionally reported \nduring treatment with asenapine. The onset of extrapyramidal symptoms is a risk factor for tardive \ndyskinesia. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on Sycrest, discontinuation \nof treatment should be considered.\n\nHyperprolactinaemia\nIncreases in prolactin levels were observed in some patients with Sycrest. In clinical trials, there were \nfew adverse reactions related to abnormal prolactin levels reported.\n\nQT interval\nClinically relevant QT prolongation does not appear to be associated with asenapine. Caution should \nbe exercised when Sycrest is prescribed in patients with known cardiovascular disease or family \nhistory of QT prolongation, and in concomitant use with other medicinal products thought to prolong \nthe QT interval.\n\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus\nHyperglycaemia or exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes has occasionally been reported during \ntreatment with asenapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and \nglucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes \nmellitus in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and the increasing incidence of diabetes \nmellitus in the general population. Appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable in diabetic patients \nand in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus.\n\nDysphagia\nEsophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic treatment. Cases of \ndysphagia were occasionally reported in patients treated with Sycrest.\n\nBody temperature regulation\nDisruption of the body\u2019s ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic \nmedicinal products. From the clinical trials, it is concluded that clinically relevant body temperature \ndysregulation does not appear to be associated with asenapine. Appropriate care is advised when \nprescribing Sycrest for patients who will be experiencing conditions that may contribute to an \nelevation in core body temperature, e.g. exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving \nconcomitant medicinal products with anticholinergic activity or being subject to dehydration.\n\nPatients with severe hepatic impairment\nAsenapine exposure is increased 7-fold in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). \nTherefore, Sycrest is not recommended in such patients.\n\nParkinson\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies\nPhysicians should weigh the risks versus the benefits when prescribing Sycrest to patients with \nParkinson\u2019s disease or dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) since both groups may be at increased risk \nof neuroleptic malignant syndrome as well as having an increased sensitivity to antipsychotics. \nManifestation of this increased sensitivity can include confusion, obtundation, postural instability \nwith frequent falls, in addition to extrapyramidal symptoms.\n\n \n\n\n\n18\n\nFalls\nAsenapine may cause adverse effects such as somnolence, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness and \nextrapyramidal symptoms, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. \nPatients at risk for fall should be evaluated prior to prescribing asenapine.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nGiven the primary effects of asenapine on the central nervous system (CNS) (see section 4.8), caution \nshould be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicinal products. \nPatients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking Sycrest. \n\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect Sycrest\nAsenapine is cleared primarily through direct glucuronidation by UGT1A4 and oxidative metabolism \nby cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (predominantly CYP1A2). The potential effects of inhibitors and an \ninducer of several of these enzyme pathways on asenapine pharmacokinetics were studied, \nspecifically fluvoxamine (CYP1A2 inhibitor), paroxetine (CYP2D6 inhibitor), imipramine \n(CYP1A2/2C19/3A4 inhibitor), cimetidine (CYP3A4/2D6/1A2 inhibitor), carbamazepine \n(CYP3A4/1A2 inducer) and valproate (UGT inhibitor). Except for fluvoxamine, none of the \ninteracting medicinal products resulted in clinically relevant alterations in asenapine \npharmacokinetics. \n\nDuring combined administration with a single dose of asenapine 5 mg, fluvoxamine 25 mg twice daily \nresulted in a 29 % increase in asenapine AUC. The full therapeutic dose of fluvoxamine would be \nexpected to produce a greater increase in asenapine plasma concentrations. Therefore, \nco-administration of asenapine and fluvoxamine should be approached with caution.\n\nPotential for Sycrest to affect other medicinal products\nBecause of its \u03b11-adrenergic antagonism with potential for inducing orthostatic hypotension (see \nsection 4.4), Sycrest may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents.\n\nAsenapine may antagonise the effect of levodopa and dopamine agonists. If this combination is \ndeemed necessary, the lowest effective dose of each treatment should be prescribed. \n\nIn vitro studies indicate that asenapine weakly inhibits CYP2D6. Clinical drug interaction studies \ninvestigating the effects of CYP2D6 inhibition by asenapine showed the following results:\n\n\uf02d Following co-administration of dextromethorphan and asenapine in healthy subjects, the ratio \nof dextrorphan/dextromethorphan (DX/DM) as a marker of CYP2D6 activity was measured. \nIndicative of CYP2D6 inhibition, treatment with asenapine 5 mg twice daily resulted in a \nfractional decrease in DX/DM ratio to 0.43. In the same study, treatment with paroxetine 20 mg \ndaily decreased the DX/DM ratio to 0.032.\n\n\uf02d In a separate study, co-administration of a single 75 mg dose of imipramine with a single 5 mg \ndose of asenapine did not affect the plasma concentrations of the metabolite desipramine (a \nCYP2D6 substrate). \n\n\uf02d Co-administration of a single 20 mg dose of paroxetine (a CYP2D6 substrate and inhibitor) \nduring treatment with 5 mg asenapine twice daily in 15 healthy male subjects resulted in an \nalmost 2-fold increase in paroxetine exposure. \n\nIn vivo asenapine appears to be at most a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. However, asenapine may \nenhance the inhibitory effects of paroxetine on its own metabolism.\n\nTherefore, Sycrest should be co-administered cautiously with medicinal products that are both \nsubstrates and inhibitors for CYP2D6.\n\n \n\n\n\n19\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no adequate data from the use of Sycrest in pregnant women. Asenapine was not teratogenic \nin animal studies. Maternal and embryo toxic effects were found in animal studies (see section 5.3). \n\nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including Sycrest) during the third trimester of pregnancy \nare at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that may vary \nin severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder in newborn infants. \nConsequently, newborn infants should be monitored carefully. \n\nSycrest should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires \ntreatment with asenapine and only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\nAsenapine was excreted in milk of rats during lactation. It is not known whether asenapine or its \nmetabolites are excreted in human milk. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with \nSycrest.\n\nFertility\nNo impairment of fertility has been observed in nonclinical studies (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nAsenapine may cause somnolence and sedation. Therefore, patients should be cautioned about driving \nand using machines until they are reasonably certain that Sycrest therapy does not affect them\nadversely.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of safety profile\nThe most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with the use of asenapine in \nclinical trials were somnolence and anxiety. Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. \nOther serious ADRs are discussed in more detail in section 4.4.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe incidences of the ADRs associated with asenapine therapy are tabulated below. The table is based \non adverse reactions reported during clinical trials and/or post-marketing use. \n\nAll ADRs are listed by system organ class and frequency; very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\uf0b3 1/100 to \n< 1/10), uncommon (\uf0b3 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\uf0b3 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data).

The incidence of dystonia in paediatric clinical trials using a gradual up-titration was \nsimilar to that seen in adult trials.\n\nWeight increase\nIn the combined short-term and long-term schizophrenia and bipolar mania trials in adults, the mean \nchange in body weight for asenapine was 0.8 kg. The proportion of subjects with clinically significant \nweight gain (\u2265 7 % weight gain from baseline at endpoint) in the short-term schizophrenia trials was \n5.3 % for asenapine compared to 2.3 % for placebo. The proportion of subjects with clinically \nsignificant weight gain (\u2265 7 % weight gain from baseline at endpoint) in the short-term, flexible-dose\nbipolar mania trials was 6.5 % for asenapine compared to 0.6 % for placebo.\n\nIn a 3-week, placebo-controlled, randomized, fixed-dose efficacy and safety trial in paediatric patients \n10 to 17 years of age with bipolar I disorder, the mean change from baseline to endpoint in weight for \nplacebo and asenapine 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg twice daily, was 0.48, 1.72, 1.62, and 1.44 kg, \nrespectively. The proportion of subjects with clinically significant weight gain (\u2265 7 % weight gain \nfrom baseline at Day 21) was 14.1 % for asenapine 2.5 mg twice daily, 8.9 % for asenapine 5 mg \ntwice daily, and 9.2 % for asenapine 10 mg twice daily, compared to 1.1 % for placebo. In the \nlong-term extension trial (50 weeks), a total of 34.8 % of subjects experienced clinically significant \nweight increase (i.e., \u2265 7 % increase in body weight at endpoint). Overall mean (SD) weight gain at \nstudy endpoint was 3.5 (5.76) kg.\n\nOrthostatic hypotension\nThe incidence of orthostatic hypotension in elderly subjects was 4.1 % compared to 0.3 % in the \ncombined phase 2/3 trial population.\n\nFalls\nFalls may occur as a result of one or more adverse events such as the following: Somnolence, \nOrthostatic hypotension, Dizziness, Extrapyramidal symptoms.\n\n \n\n\n\n22\n\nHepatic enzymes\nTransient, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases, alanine transferase (ALT), aspartate \ntransferase (AST) have been seen commonly, especially in early treatment.\n\nOther findings\nCerebrovascular events have been reported in patients treated with asenapine but there is no evidence \nof any excess incidence over what is expected in adults between 18 and 65 years of age.\n\nAsenapine has anaesthetic properties. Oral hypoaesthesia and oral paraesthesia may occur directly \nafter administration and usually resolves within 1 hour.\n\nThere have been post-marketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with \nasenapine, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, swollen tongue and swollen \nthroat (pharyngeal oedema). \n\nPaediatric population\nAsenapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nThe clinically relevant adverse experiences identified in the paediatric bipolar and schizophrenia trials \nwere similar to those observed in adult bipolar and schizophrenia trials.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (\u2265 5 % and at least twice the rate of placebo) reported in \npaediatric patients with bipolar I disorder were somnolence, sedation, dizziness, dysgeusia, \nhypoaesthesia oral, paraesthesia oral, nausea, increased appetite, fatigue, and weight increased (see \nWeight increase above).\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (proportion of patients \uf0b3 5 % and at least twice placebo) reported\nin paediatric patients with schizophrenia were somnolence, sedation, akathisia, dizziness, and \nhypoaesthesia oral. There was a statistically significant higher incidence of patients with \u2265 7 % \nweight gain (from baseline to endpoint) compared to placebo (3.1 %) for Sycrest 2.5 mg twice daily \n(9.5 %) and Sycrest 5 mg twice daily (13.1 %).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nFew cases of overdose were reported in the asenapine program. Reported estimated doses were \nbetween 15 and 400 mg. In most cases it was not clear if asenapine had been taken sublingually. \nTreatment-related adverse reactions included agitation and confusion, akathisia, orofacial dystonia, \nsedation, and asymptomatic ECG findings (bradycardia, supraventricular complexes, intraventricular \nconduction delay). \n\nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with Sycrest. There is no specific \nantidote to Sycrest. The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered. \nCardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias and management of overdose \nshould concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway oxygenation and \nventilation, and management of symptoms. Hypotension and circulatory collapse should be treated \nwith appropriate measures, such as intravenous fluids and/or sympathomimetic agents (epinephrine \nand dopamine should not be used, since beta stimulations may worsen hypotension in the setting of \nSycrest-induced alpha blockade). In case of severe extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n23\n\nmedicinal products should be administered. Close medical supervision and monitoring should \ncontinue until the patient recovers.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, antipsychotics, ATC code: N05AH05\n\nMechanism of action\nThe mechanism of action of asenapine is not fully understood. However, based on its receptor \npharmacology, it is proposed that the efficacy of asenapine is mediated through a combination of \nantagonist activity at D2 and 5-HT2A receptors. Actions at other receptors e.g., 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, \n5-HT2C, 5-HT6, 5-HT7, D3, and \u03b12-adrenergic receptors, may also contribute to the clinical effects \nof asenapine.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nAsenapine exhibits high affinity for serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT5, \n5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors, dopamine D2, D3, D4, and D1 receptors), \u03b11 and \u03b12-adrenergic \nreceptors, and histamine H1 receptors, and moderate affinity for H2 receptors. In in vitro assays \nasenapine acts as an antagonist at these receptors. Asenapine has no appreciable affinity for \nmuscarinic cholinergic receptors.\n\nClinical efficacy\n\nClinical efficacy in bipolar I disorder\nThe efficacy of asenapine in the treatment of a DSM-IV manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder \nwith or without psychotic features was evaluated in two similarly designed 3-week, randomized, \ndouble-blind, flexible-dose, placebo- and active controlled (olanzapine) monotherapy trials involving \n488 and 489 patients, respectively. All patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \nDisorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria for bipolar I disorder, current episode manic \n(DSM-IV 296.4x), or mixed (DSM-IV 296.6x) and had a Young Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS) score \nof \u2265 20 at screening and baseline. Patients with rapid cycling were excluded from these studies. \nAsenapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in the reduction of manic symptoms over \n3 weeks. Point estimates [95 % CI] for the change from baseline to endpoint in YMRS using LOCF \nanalysis in the two studies were as follows: \n-11.5 [-13.0, -10.0] for asenapine vs -7.8 [-10.0, -5.6] for placebo and \n-10.8 [-12.3, -9.3] for asenapine vs -5.5 [-7.5, -3.5] for placebo. \nA statistically significant difference between asenapine and placebo was seen as early as day 2. \n\nPatients from the two pivotal 3 week trials were studied for a further 9 weeks an extension trial. \nMaintenance of effect during the episode after 12 weeks of randomised treatment was demonstrated in \nthis trial. \n\nIn one double-blind, fixed-dose, parallel-group, 3-week placebo controlled trial in subjects with \nbipolar I disorder experiencing an acute manic or mixed episode involving 367 patients of which 126 \nreceived placebo, 122 received asenapine 5 mg twice daily (BID), and 119 received asenapine 10 mg \nBID, the primary efficacy hypothesis was met. Both asenapine doses (5 mg BID and 10 mg BID) were \nsuperior to placebo and showed statistically significant improvement in change from baseline in \nY-MRS total score at Day 21 compared with placebo. Based upon a LOCF analysis including all \npatients treated, the difference in least squares (LS) mean change from baseline to Day 21 in the \nY-MRS total score between asenapine 5 mg BID and placebo was -3.1 points (95 % CI [-5.7, -0.5]; \np-value = 0.0183). The difference in LS mean change from baseline to Day 21 in the Y-MRS total \nscore between asenapine 10 mg BID and placebo was -3.0 points (95 % CI [-5.6, -0.4]; \np-value = 0.0244). A statistically significant difference between asenapine and placebo was seen as \n\n \n\n\n\n24\n\nearly as day 2. In this short-term, fixed-dose controlled trial there was no evidence of added benefit \nwith a 10 mg twice daily dose compared to 5 mg twice daily.\n\nIn a 12-week, placebo-controlled trial involving 326 patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar \nI disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or \nvalproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of asenapine as\nadjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy to lithium or valproate monotherapy at week 3 (point \nestimates [95 % CI] for the change from baseline to endpoint in YMRS using LOCF analysis were \n-10.3 [-11.9, -8.8] for asenapine and -7.9 [-9.4, -6.4] for placebo) and at week 12 (-12.7 [-14.5, -10.9] \nfor asenapine and -9.3 [-11.8, -7.6] for placebo) in the reduction of manic symptoms.\n\nPaediatric population\nAsenapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years (see\nsection 4.2). \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Sycrest was evaluated in 403 paediatric patients with bipolar I disorder \nwho participated in a single, 3-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, of whom 302 patients \nreceived Sycrest at fixed doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 10 mg twice daily. Study results showed \nstatistically significant superiority for all three Sycrest doses in improving the Young Mania Rating \nScale (YMRS) total score as measured by the change from baseline to Day 21, as compared with \nplacebo. Long term efficacy could not be established in a 50-week, uncontrolled, open-label extension \ntrial. The clinically relevant adverse reactions identified in the paediatric trials were generally similar \nto those observed in the adult trials. However, adverse effects of treatment on weight gain and on \nplasma lipid profile appeared to be greater than effects observed in the adult trials.\n\nEfficacy of Sycrest was not demonstrated in an 8-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, \nrandomized, fixed-dose trial in 306 adolescent patients aged 12-17 years with schizophrenia at doses \nof 2.5 and 5 mg twice daily.\n\nPaediatric studies with Sycrest were performed using flavoured sublingual tablets. The European \nMedicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Sycrest in one or \nmore subsets of the paediatric population in bipolar I disorder (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing sublingual administration, asenapine is rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations \noccurring within 0.5 to 1.5 hours. The absolute bioavailability of sublingual asenapine at 5 mg is \n35 %. The absolute bioavailability of asenapine when swallowed is low (< 2 % with an oral tablet \nformulation). The intake of water several (2 or 5) minutes after asenapine administration resulted in \ndecreased (19 % and 10 %, respectively) asenapine exposure. Therefore, eating and drinking should \nbe avoided for 10 minutes after administration (see section 4.2).\n\nDistribution\nAsenapine is rapidly distributed and has a large volume of distribution (approximately 20-25 L/kg), \nindicating extensive extravascular distribution. Asenapine is highly bound (95 %) to plasma proteins, \nincluding albumin and \u03b11-acid glycoprotein.\n\nBiotransformation\nAsenapine is extensively metabolized. Direct glucuronidation (mediated by UGT1A4) and \ncytochrome P450 (primarily CYP1A2, with contributions of 2D6 and 3A4) mediated oxidation and \ndemethylation are the primary metabolic pathways for asenapine. In an in vivo study in humans with \nradio-labelled asenapine, the predominant drug-related entity in plasma was asenapine \nN+-glucuronide; others included N-desmethylasenapine, N-desmethylasenapine N-carbamoyl \n\n \n\n\n\n25\n\nglucuronide, and unchanged asenapine in smaller amounts. Sycrest activity is primarily due to the \nparent compound.\n\nAsenapine is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Asenapine does not cause induction of CYP1A2 or \nCYP3A4 activities in cultured human hepatocytes. Co-administration of asenapine with known \ninhibitors, inducers or substrates of these metabolic pathways has been studied in a number of drug-\ndrug interaction studies (see section 4.5).\n\nElimination\nAsenapine is a high clearance compound, with a clearance after intravenous administration of 52 L/h. \nIn a mass balance study, the majority of the radioactive dose was recovered in urine (about 50 %) and \nfaeces (about 40 %), with only a small amount excreted in faeces (5-16 %) as unchanged compound. \nFollowing an initial more rapid distribution phase, the terminal half-life of asenapine is approximately \n24 h.\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\nIncreasing the dose from 5 to 10 mg twice daily (a two-fold increase) results in less than linear \n(1.7 times) increases in both the extent of exposure and maximum concentration. The less than \nproportional increase of Cmax and AUC with dose may be attributed to limitations in the absorption \ncapacity from the oral mucosa following sublingual administration.\n\nDuring twice-daily dosing, steady-state is attained within 3 days. Overall, steady-state asenapine \npharmacokinetics are similar to single-dose pharmacokinetics.\n\nPharmacokinetics in special populations\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of asenapine were similar among subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) or \nmoderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment and subjects with normal hepatic function. In subjects \nwith severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), a 7-fold increase in asenapine exposure was observed \n(see section 4.2). \n\nRenal impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of asenapine following a single dose of 5 mg asenapine were similar among \nsubjects with varying degrees of renal impairment and subjects with normal renal function. \nThere is no experience with asenapine in severe renal impairment patients with a creatinine clearance \nless than 15 mL/min.\n\nElderly\nIn elderly patients (between 65 and 85 years of age), exposure to asenapine is approximately 30 % \nhigher than in younger adults.\n\nPaediatric population (children and adolescents)\nIn a PK study using unflavoured sublingual tablets, at the 5 mg twice daily dose level, asenapine \npharmacokinetics in adolescent patients (12 to 17 years of age, inclusive) are similar to those \nobserved in adults. In adolescents, the 10 mg twice daily dose did not result in increased exposure \ncompared to 5 mg twice daily.\n\nIn a second PK study using flavoured sublingual tablets, the 10 mg twice daily dose in a paediatric \npopulation (10 to 17 years of age, inclusive) resulted in an approximate dose-proportional increase in \nasenapine exposure compared to 5 mg twice daily.\n\nGender\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that there is no evidence of gender-related \ndifferences in the pharmacokinetics of asenapine.\n\n \n\n\n\n26\n\nRace\nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no clinical relevant effects of race on the pharmacokinetics \nof asenapine were found.\n\nSmoking status\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that smoking, which induces CYP1A2, has no effect \non the clearance of asenapine. In a dedicated study, concomitant smoking during administration of a \nsingle 5 mg sublingual dose had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of asenapine.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology. Repeat-dose toxicity studies in rat and dog showed mainly dose-limiting \npharmacological effects, such as sedation. Furthermore, prolactin-mediated effects on mammary \nglands and oestrus cycle disturbances were observed. In dogs high oral doses resulted in \nhepatotoxicity that was not observed after chronic intravenous administration. Asenapine has some \naffinity to melanin-containing tissues. However, when tested in vitro it was devoid of phototoxicity. \nIn addition, histopathological examination of the eyes from dogs treated chronically with asenapine \ndid not reveal any signs of ocular toxicity, demonstrating the absence of a phototoxic hazard. \nAsenapine was not genotoxic in a battery of tests. In subcutaneous carcinogenicity studies in rats and \nmice, no increases in tumour incidences were observed. Effects in non-clinical studies were observed \nonly at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little \nrelevance to clinical use.\n\nAsenapine did not impair fertility in rats and was not teratogenic in rat and rabbit. Embryotoxicity \nwas found in reproduction toxicology studies using rats and rabbits. Asenapine caused mild maternal \ntoxicity and slight retardation of foetal skeletal development. Following oral administration to \npregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis, asenapine adversely affected body weight at the \nhigh dose of 15 mg.kg-1 twice daily. At this dose foetal body weight decreased. When asenapine was \nadministered intravenously to pregnant rabbits, no signs of embryotoxicity were observed. In rats, \nembryofoetal toxicity (increased post-implantation loss, decreased foetal weights, and delayed \nossification) was observed following oral or intravenous administration during organogenesis or \nthroughout gestation. Increased neonatal mortality was observed among the offspring of female rats \ntreated during gestation and lactation. From a cross-fostering study it was concluded that asenapine \ninduced peri- and postnatal losses are caused by impairment of the pups rather than altered nursing \nbehaviour of the dams.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

What you need to know before you take Sycrest\n3. How to take Sycrest\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Sycrest\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Sycrest is and what it is used for\n\nSycrest contains the active substance asenapine. This medicine belongs to a group of medicines called \nantipsychotics. Sycrest is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes associated with bipolar I \ndisorder in adults. Antipsychotic medicines affect the chemicals that allow communication between \nnerve cells (neurotransmitters). Illnesses that affect the brain, such as bipolar I disorder, may be due to \ncertain chemicals in the brain, such as dopamine and serotonin, being out of balance and these \nimbalances may cause some of the symptoms you may be experiencing. Exactly how this medicine \nworks is unknown, however, it is believed to adjust the balance of these chemicals.\n\nManic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder is a condition with symptoms such as feeling \n\u201chigh\u201d, having excessive amounts of energy, needing much less sleep than usual, talking very quickly \nwith racing ideas and sometimes severe irritability.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Sycrest\n\nDo not take Sycrest\nIf you are allergic to asenapine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Sycrest.\n\nSycrest has not been studied in elderly patients with dementia. However, elderly patients with \ndementia, who are treated with other similar types of medicine, may have an increased risk of stroke \nor death. Sycrest is not approved for the treatment of elderly patients with dementia and is not \nrecommended for use in this particular group of patients. \n\nSycrest may cause low blood pressure. In the early stages of treatment, some people may faint, \nespecially when getting up from a lying or sitting position. This will usually pass on its own but if it \ndoes not, tell your doctor. Your dose may need to be adjusted.\n\n \n\n\n\n40\n\nAsenapine may cause sleepiness, sudden drops in blood pressure when you stand up, dizziness and \nchanges in your ability to move and balance, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or \nother injuries. Patients at risk for fall should be evaluated prior to prescribing asenapine.\n\nTell your doctor immediately if you experience\n\uf02d involuntary rhythmic movements of the tongue, mouth and face. Withdrawal of Sycrest may be \n\nneeded.\n\uf02d fever, severe muscle stiffness, sweating or a lowered level of consciousness (a disorder called \n\n\u201cneuroleptic malignant syndrome\u201d). Immediate medical treatment may be needed.\n\nCheck with your doctor or pharmacist before taking Sycrest:\n\n\uf02d if you have ever been diagnosed with a condition whose symptoms include high body \ntemperature and muscle stiffness (also known as neuroleptic malignant syndrome).\n\n\uf02d if you have ever experienced abnormal movements of the tongue or face (tardive dyskinesia).\nYou should be aware that both of these conditions may be caused by this type of medicine.\n\n\uf02d if you have a heart disease or a treatment for heart disease that makes you prone to low blood \npressure\n\n\uf02d if you are diabetic or prone to diabetes\n\uf02d if you have Parkinson\u2019s disease or dementia\n\uf02d if you have epilepsy (seizures)\n\uf02d if you experience any difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia)\n\uf02d if you have severe liver problems. If you do, you should not take Sycrest\n\uf02d if you have difficulty controlling core body temperature\n\uf02d if you have thoughts of suicide\n\uf02d if you have abnormally high levels of prolactin in the blood (hyperprolactinaemia)\n\nBe sure to tell your doctor if you meet any of these conditions as he/she may want to adjust your dose \nor monitor you for a while. Also contact your doctor immediately if any of these conditions develops \nor worsens while using Sycrest.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nSycrest is not recommended for use in patients below the age of 18 years.\n\nOther medicines and Sycrest\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Some medicines may reduce or increase the effect of Sycrest.\n\nIf you are taking other medicines, Sycrest should be taken last.\n\nYou should tell your doctor if you are taking antidepressant medicines (specifically fluvoxamine, \nparoxetine or fluoxetine), as it may be necessary to change your Sycrest or antidepressant medicine \ndose.\n\nYou should tell your doctor if you are taking medicines for Parkinson\u2019s disease (such as levodopa), as \nthis medicine may make them less effective.\n\nSince Sycrest works primarily in the brain, interference from other medicines (or alcohol) that work in \nthe brain could occur due to an additive effect on brain function.\n\nSince Sycrest can lower blood pressure, care should be taken when Sycrest is taken with other \nmedicines that lower blood pressure.\n\n \n\n\n\n41\n\nSycrest with food, drink and alcohol\nDo not eat or drink for 10 minutes after taking this medicine.\nYou should avoid drinking alcohol when taking this medicine.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.\n\nDo not take Sycrest while you are pregnant, unless your doctor tells you so. If you are taking this \nmedicine and you become pregnant or you plan to get pregnant, ask your doctor as soon as possible \nwhether you may continue taking Sycrest.\n\nThe following symptoms may occur in newborn babies, of mothers that have used Sycrest in the last \ntrimester (last three months of their pregnancy): shaking, muscle stiffness and/or weakness, \nsleepiness, agitation, breathing problems, and difficulty in feeding. If your baby develops any of these \nsymptoms you may need to contact your doctor.\n\nDo not breast-feed when taking Sycrest.\n\nDriving and using machines\nSycrest may cause sleepiness or sedation. Therefore, make sure your concentration and alertness are \nnot affected before you drive or operate machinery.\n\n3.

out of balance and these imbalances may cause some of the symptoms you may be experiencing. exactly how this medicine works is unknown, however, it is believed to adjust the balance of these chemicals. manic episodes associated with bipolar i disorder is a condition with symptoms such as feeling \"high\", having excessive amounts of energy, needing much less sleep than usual, talking very

"Section_Content": "do not take sycrest if you are allergic to asenapine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking sycrest. sycrest has not been studied in elderly patients with dementia. however, elderly patients with dementia, who are treated with other similar types of medicine, may have an increased risk of stroke or death. sycrest is not approved for the treatment of elderly patients with dementia and is not recommended for use in this particular group of patients. sycrest may cause low blood pressure. in the early stages of treatment, some people may faint, especially when getting up from a lying or sitting position. this will usually pass on its own but if it does not, tell your doctor. your dose may need to be adjusted. asenapine may cause sleepiness, sudden drops in blood pressure when you stand up, dizziness and changes in your ability to move and balance, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. patients at risk for fall should be evaluated prior to prescribing asenapine. tell your doctor immediately if you experience involuntary rhythmic movements of the tongue, mouth and face. withdrawal of sycrest may be needed. fever, severe muscle stiffness, sweating or a lowered level of consciousness (a disorder called \"neuroleptic malignant syndrome\"). immediate medical treatment may be needed. check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking sycrest: if you have ever been diagnosed with a condition whose symptoms include high body temperature and muscle stiffness (also known as neuroleptic malignant syndrome). if you have ever experienced abnormal movements of the tongue or face (tardive dyskinesia). you should be aware that both of these conditions may be caused by this type of medicine. if you have a heart disease or a treatment for heart disease that makes you prone to low blood pressure if you are diabetic or prone to diabetes if you have parkinson's disease or dementia if you have epilepsy (seizures) if you experience any difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia) if you have severe liver problems. if you do, you should not take sycrest if you have difficulty controlling core body temperature if you have thoughts of suicide if you have abnormally high levels of prolactin in the blood (hyperprolactinaemia) be sure to tell your doctor if you meet any of these conditions as he/she may want to adjust your dose or monitor you for a while. also contact your doctor immediately if any of these conditions develops or worsens while using sycrest. children and adolescents sycrest is not recommended for use in patients below the age of 18 years. other medicines and sycrest tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. some medicines may reduce or increase the effect of sycrest. if you are taking other medicines, sycrest should be taken last. you should tell your doctor if you are taking antidepressant medicines (specifically fluvoxamine, paroxetine or fluoxetine), as it may be necessary to change your sycrest or antidepressant medicine dose. you should tell your doctor if you are taking medicines for parkinson's disease (such as levodopa), as this medicine may make them less effective. since sycrest works primarily in the brain, interference from other medicines (or alcohol) that work in the brain could occur due to an additive effect on brain function. since sycrest can lower blood pressure, care should be taken when sycrest is taken with other medicines that lower blood pressure. sycrest with food, drink and alcohol do not eat or drink for 10 minutes after taking this medicine. you should avoid drinking alcohol when taking this medicine. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. do not take sycrest while you are pregnant, unless your doctor tells you so. if you are taking this medicine and you become pregnant or you plan to get pregnant, ask your doctor as soon as possible whether you may continue taking sycrest. the following symptoms may occur in newborn babies, of mothers that have used sycrest in the last trimester (last three months of their pregnancy): shaking, muscle stiffness and/or weakness, sleepiness, agitation, breathing problems, and difficulty in feeding. if your baby develops any of these symptoms you may need to contact your doctor. do not breast-feed when taking sycrest. driving and using machines sycrest may cause sleepiness or sedation. therefore, make sure your concentration and
