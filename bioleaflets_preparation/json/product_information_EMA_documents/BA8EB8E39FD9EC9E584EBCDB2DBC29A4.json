The total injection volume for each treatment session should be up \nto a maximum of 4 mL. \n \nTable 2. Selection of Imlygic injection volume based on lesion size \n \nLesion size  \n(longest dimension) Imlygic injection volume \n\n> 5 cm  up to 4 mL \n\n> 2.5 cm to 5 cm  up to 2 mL  \n\n> 1.5 cm to 2.5 cm  up to 1 mL  \n\n> 0.5 cm to 1.5 cm  up to 0.5 mL  \n\n≤ 0.5 cm  up to 0.1 mL  \n \nPatients may experience increase in size of existing lesion(s) or the appearance of a new lesion prior to \nachieving a response. As long as there are injectable lesion(s) remaining, Imlygic should be continued \nfor at least 6 months unless the physician considers that the patient is not benefitting from Imlygic \ntreatment or that other treatment is required. \n \nImlygic treatment may be reinitiated if new lesions appear following a complete response and the \nphysician considers that the patient will benefit from treatment. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Imlygic in paediatric patients has not been established. No data are \navailable. \n \nElderly population \n \nNo adjustment of the dose is required in patients ≥ 65 years old (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nHepatic and renal impairment \n \nNo clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic or renal impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of talimogene laherparepvec. However, no adjustment in dosage is necessary for \npatients with hepatic or renal impairment. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nImlygic is to be administered by intralesional injection into cutaneous, subcutaneous, and/or nodal \nlesions that are visible, palpable or detectable by ultrasound guidance. \n \nIf healthcare professionals are accidentally exposed to Imlygic, see sections 4.4 and 6.6. \n \nHealthcare professionals who are immunocompromised or pregnant should not administer Imlygic and \nshould not come into direct contact with the Imlygic injection site(s) or body fluids of treated patients \n(see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nFollow the instructions below to prepare and administer Imlygic to patients: \n \nPre-injection \n Thaw Imlygic vial(s) at room temperature. Thawed Imlygic may be stored prior to \n\nadministration (see section 6.3). \n Draw the desired amount of Imlygic from the vial into a syringe using aseptic technique. A 22- \n\nto 26-gauge needle is recommended. \n The injection site may be treated with a topical anaesthetic agent. Injectable anaesthetic may be \n\ninjected around the periphery of the lesion but should not be injected directly into the lesion. \n Clean the lesion and surrounding areas with an alcohol swab and let dry. \n \nInjection \n Inject Imlygic intralesionally into cutaneous, subcutaneous, and/or nodal lesions that are visible, \n\npalpable or detectable by ultrasound guidance. \n Determine injection volume for each lesion using table 2 above. \n Using a single insertion point, inject Imlygic along multiple tracks as far as the radial reach of \n\nthe needle allows within the lesion to achieve even and complete dispersion. Multiple insertion \npoints may be used if a lesion is larger than the radial reach of the needle. \n\n \nCutaneous lesions Subcutaneous lesions Nodal lesions \n\n \n  \n\nFigure 1. \nInjection administration for \ncutaneous lesions \n\nFigure 2. \nInjection administration for \nsubcutaneous lesions \n\nFigure 3. \nInjection administration for \nnodal lesions  \n\n \n Disperse Imlygic evenly and completely within the lesion by pulling the needle back without \n\nexiting the lesion. Redirect the needle as many times as necessary while injecting the remainder \nof the dose of Imlygic. Continue until the full dose is evenly and completely dispersed. \n\n When removing the needle, withdraw it from the lesion slowly to avoid leakage or splash back \nof Imlygic at the insertion point. \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n Repeat these steps for other lesions that need to be injected. Use a new needle anytime the \nneedle is completely removed from a lesion and each time a different lesion is injected. \n\n \nPost-injection \n Apply pressure to the injection site with a sterile gauze for at least 30 seconds. \n Swab the injection site and surrounding area with alcohol, and cover the injected lesion with an \n\nabsorbent pad and dry occlusive dressing. \n \nDisposal \nDispose of all materials that have come in contact with Imlygic (e.g. vial, syringe, needle, any cotton \nor gauze) in accordance with local institutional procedures (see section 6.6). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to talimogene laherparepvec or any of its excipients. \n Patients who are severely immunocompromised (e.g. patients with severe congenital or acquired \n\ncellular and/or humoral immune deficiency) (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPreviously treated patients \n \nEfficacy data for Imlygic in the current second or later line treatment settings are limited. \n \nImmunocompromised patients \n \nImlygic has not been studied in immunocompromised patients. Based on animal data, patients who are \nseverely immunocompromised may be at an increased risk of disseminated herpetic infection and \nshould not be treated with Imlygic (see sections 4.3 and 5.3). Disseminated herpetic infection may also \noccur in immunocompromised patients (such as those with HIV/AIDS, leukaemia, lymphoma, \ncommon variable immunodeficiency, or who require chronic high-dose steroids or other \nimmunosuppressive agents). The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered before \nadministering Imlygic to these patients. \n \nAccidental exposure to Imlygic \n \nAccidental exposure may lead to transmission of Imlygic and herpetic infection. Healthcare \nprofessionals and close contacts (e.g. household members, caregivers, sex partners or persons sharing \nthe same bed) should avoid direct contact with injected lesions or body fluids of treated patients during \nthe entirety of the treatment period and up to 30 days after the last treatment administration (see \nsection 6.6). Accidental needle stick and splash-back have been reported in healthcare professionals \nduring preparation and administration of Imlygic. \n \nClose contacts who are pregnant or immunocompromised should not change the patient’s dressing or \nclean their injection site. Pregnant women, neonates, and immunocompromised individuals should not \nbe exposed to potentially contaminated materials. \n \nHealthcare professionals should ensure that patients are able to comply with the requirement to cover \ninjection sites with occlusive dressings (see section 6.6). Patients should also be advised to avoid \ntouching or scratching injection sites as this could lead to inadvertent transfer of Imlygic to other areas \nof their body or to their close contacts. \n \nAlthough it is not known if Imlygic could be transmitted through sexual contact, it is known that wild-\ntype HSV-1 can be transmitted through sexual contact. Patients should be advised to use a latex \ncondom during sexual contact to prevent possible transmission of Imlygic. Women of childbearing \npotential should be advised to use an effective method of contraception to prevent pregnancy during \ntreatment with Imlygic (see section 4.6). \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \nCaregivers should be advised to wear protective gloves when assisting patients in applying or \nchanging occlusive dressings and to observe safety precautions for disposal of used dressings and \ncleaning materials (see sections 4.2 and 6.6). \n \nIn the event of an accidental exposure to Imlygic, exposed individuals should be advised to clean the \naffected area thoroughly with soap and water and/or a disinfectant. If signs or symptoms of herpetic \ninfection develop, they should contact their healthcare professional. Talimogene laherparepvec is \nsensitive to acyclovir. In case suspected herpetic lesions occur, patients, close contacts or healthcare \nproviders have the option of follow-up testing by the Marketing Authorisation Holder for further \ncharacterisation of the infection. \n \nHerpetic infection in Imlygic-treated patients \n \nIn clinical studies, herpetic infections (including cold sores and herpes keratitis) have been reported in \npatients treated with Imlygic. Symptoms of a local or systemic infection possibly related to Imlygic \nare anticipated to be similar to symptoms caused by wild-type HSV-1 infections. \n \nIndividuals with wild-type HSV-1 infection are known to be at a lifelong risk for symptomatic \nherpetic infection due to reactivation of latent wild-type HSV-1. Symptomatic herpetic infection due \nto possible reactivation of Imlygic should be considered. \n \nPatients who develop herpetic infections should be advised to follow standard hygienic practices to \nprevent viral transmission. \n \nTalimogene laherparepvec is sensitive to acyclovir. The risks and benefits of Imlygic treatment should \nbe considered before administering acyclovir or other anti-viral agents indicated for management of \nherpetic infection. These agents may interfere with the effectiveness of Imlygic if administered \nsystemically or topically directly to the injection site. \n \nCellulitis at the injection site \n \nNecrosis or ulceration of tumour tissue may occur following Imlygic treatment. Cellulitis and systemic \nbacterial infection have been reported. Careful wound care and infection precautions are \nrecommended, particularly if tissue necrosis results in open wounds. \n \nImpaired healing at the injection site \n \nIn clinical studies, impaired healing at the injection site has been reported. Imlygic may increase the \nrisk of impaired healing in patients with underlying risk factors (e.g. previous radiation at the injection \nsite, or lesions in poorly vascularised areas). \n \nThe risks and benefits of Imlygic should be considered before continuing treatment if persistent \ninfection or delayed healing develops. \n \nImmune-mediated events \n \nIn clinical studies, immune-mediated events including as glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, pneumonitis, \nworsening psoriasis, and vitiligo have been reported in patients treated with Imlygic. \n \nThe risks and benefits of Imlygic should be considered before initiating treatment in patients who have \nunderlying autoimmune disease or before continuing treatment in patients who develop immune-\nmediated events. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nPlasmacytoma at injection site \n \nPlasmacytoma has been reported in proximity to the injection site after administration of Imlygic. The \nrisks and benefits of Imlygic should be considered in patients with multiple myeloma or in whom \nplasmacytoma develops during treatment. \n \nObstructive airway disorder \n \nObstructive airway disorder has been reported following Imlygic treatment. Caution should be used \nwhen injecting lesions close to major airways. \n \nHSV-1 seronegative patients \n \nPatients who were HSV-1 seronegative at baseline were reported to have a greater incidence of \npyrexia, chills, and influenza-like illness compared with those who were HSV-1 seropositive at \nbaseline, especially within the period of the first 6 treatments (see section 4.8). \n \nAll patients \n \nThis medicinal product contains 80 mg sorbitol (E420) per 4 mL dose. The additive effect of \nconcomitantly administered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and dietary intake of sorbitol (or \nfructose) should be taken into account. \n \nThis medicinal product contains approximately 30 mg sodium per 4 mL dose, equivalent to 1.5% of \nthe WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \nTraceability of Imlygic \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been conducted with Imlygic. Acyclovir and other anti-viral agents may \ninterfere with the effectiveness of Imlygic if administered systemically or topically directly to the \ninjection site. Consider the risks and benefits of Imlygic treatment before administering acyclovir or \nother anti-viral agents indicated for management of herpetic infection. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use an effective method of contraception to \nprevent pregnancy during treatment with Imlygic. \n \nAll patients should be advised to use a latex condom during sexual contact to prevent possible \ntransmission of Imlygic (see section 4.4). \n \nPregnancy \n \nAdequate and well controlled studies with talimogene laherparepvec have not been conducted in \npregnant women. \n \nIf a pregnant woman has an infection with wild type HSV-1 (primary or reactivation), there is \npotential for the virus to cross the placental barrier, and also a risk of transmission during birth due to \nviral shedding. Infections with wild-type HSV-1 have been associated with serious adverse effects, \nincluding multi-organ failure and death, if a foetus or neonate contracts the wild type herpes infection. \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nWhile there are no clinical data to date on talimogene laherparepvec infections in pregnant women, \nthere could be a risk to the foetus or neonate if talimogene laherparepvec were to act in the same \nmanner. No effects on embryo-foetal development have been observed in animal studies (see \nsection 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of talimogene laherparepvec \nduring pregnancy. \n \nTransplacental metastases of malignant melanoma can occur. Because talimogene laherparepvec is \ndesigned to enter and replicate in the tumour tissue, there could be a risk of foetal exposure to \ntalimogene laherparepvec from tumour tissue that has crossed the placenta. \n \nIf Imlygic is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking Imlygic, the \npatient should be apprised of the potential hazards to the foetus and/or neonate. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether talimogene laherparepvec is transferred into human milk. A decision must be \nmade whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Imlygic therapy taking into \naccount the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nNo clinical studies have been performed to evaluate the effects of talimogene laherparepvec on \nfertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTalimogene laherparepvec may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nBecause of potential adverse reactions such as dizziness and confusional state (see section 4.8), \npatients should be advised to use caution when driving or operating machinery until they are certain \nthat talimogene laherparepvec does not adversely affect them. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nThe safety of Imlygic was evaluated in the pivotal study where 292 patients received at least 1 dose of \nImlygic (see section 5.1). The median duration of exposure to Imlygic was 23 weeks (5.3 months). \nTwenty six (26) patients were exposed to Imlygic for at least one year. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 25%) in Imlygic-treated patients were fatigue \n(50.3%), chills (48.6%), pyrexia (42.8%), nausea (35.6%), influenza-like illness (30.5%), and injection \nsite pain (27.7%). Overall, ninety eight per cent (98%) of these adverse reactions reported were mild \nor moderate in severity. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse reaction was cellulitis (2.1%) \n(see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on clinical trials in patients with melanoma treated with \nImlygic compared to GM-CSF and post-marketing experience. Incidence of adverse reactions are \npresented by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), \ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) and uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100). Within each frequency grouping, \nadverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nTable 3.

However, none lead to permanent discontinuation of Imlygic \ntreatment. Careful wound care and infection precautions are recommended, particularly if tissue \nnecrosis results in open wounds. \n \nInfluenza-like symptoms \n \n90% of patients treated with Imlygic experienced influenza-like symptoms. Pyrexia, chills, and \ninfluenza like illness, which can occur any time during Imlygic treatment, generally resolved within \n72 hours. These events were reported more frequently within the period of the first 6 treatments, \nparticularly in patients who were HSV-1 negative at baseline. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no clinical experience with overdose with Imlygic. Doses up to 4 mL at a concentration of \n108 PFU/mL every 2 weeks have been administered in clinical trials with no evidence of dose limiting \ntoxicity. The maximum dose of Imlygic that can be safely administered has not been determined. In \nthe event of a suspected overdose or inadvertent intravenous administration, the patient should be \ntreated symptomatically, e.g. with acyclovir or other anti-viral agents (see section 4.4) and supportive \nmeasures instituted as required. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents, ATC code: L01XX51. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTalimogene laherparepvec is an oncolytic immunotherapy that is derived from HSV-1. Talimogene \nlaherparepvec has been modified to replicate within tumours and to produce the immune stimulatory \nprotein human GM-CSF. Talimogene laherparepvec causes the death of tumour cells and the release \nof tumour-derived antigens. It is thought that together with GM-CSF, it will promote a systemic anti-\n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\ntumour immune response and an effector T-cell response. Mice that had complete regression of their \nprimary tumours following treatment were resistant to subsequent tumour rechallenge. \n \nThe modifications to talimogene laherparepvec from HSV-1 include deletion of ICP34.5 and ICP47. \nWhereas anti-viral immune responses defend normal cells following infection by talimogene \nlaherparepvec, tumours have been shown to be susceptible to injury and cell death from ICP34.5-\ndeficient HSV-1 viruses, including talimogene laherparepvec. Deletion of ICP47 prevents down-\nregulation of antigen presentation molecules and increases the expression of HSV US11 gene, thereby \nenhancing viral replication in tumour cells. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nStudy 005/05 \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Imlygic monotherapy compared with subcutaneously administered \nGM-CSF were evaluated in a phase 3, multinational, open-label, and randomised clinical study of \npatients with stage IIIB, IIIC, and IV melanoma that was not considered to be surgically resectable. \nPrevious systemic treatment for melanoma was allowed but not required. Patients with active brain \nmetastases, bone metastases, extensive visceral disease, primary ocular or mucosal melanoma, \nevidence of immunosuppression, or receiving treatment with a systemic anti-herpetic agent were \nexcluded from the study. \n \nPatients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Imlygic or GM-CSF (N = 436; 295 Imlygic, \n141 GM-CSF). Imlygic was administered by intralesional injection at an initial concentration of \n106 (1 million) PFU/mL on day 1, followed by a concentration of 108 (100 million) PFU/mL on day 21 \nand every 2 weeks thereafter at a dose of up to 4 mL. GM-CSF was administered subcutaneously at \n125 µg/m2 delivered daily for 14 days followed by a 14-day rest period in repeating intervals. \n \nTo allow for delayed immune-mediated anti-tumour effects to occur, patients were treated for a \nminimum of 6 months or until there were no longer any injectable lesions. During this period, \ntreatment was to continue despite an increase in size in existing lesion(s) and/or development of new \nlesion(s) unless the patient developed intolerable toxicity or the investigator believed that it was in the \nbest interest of the patient to stop treatment or to be given other therapy for melanoma. After 6 months \nof treatment, patients were to continue treatment until clinically relevant disease progression (i.e. \ndisease progression associated with a decline in performance status and/or alternative therapy was \nrequired in the opinion of the investigator). Patients experiencing a response at 12 months of treatment \ncould continue treatment for up to an additional 6 months. The mean (SD) treatment duration for the \nintent-to-treat (ITT) population was 15.76 weeks (15.79) in the GM-CSF arm and 26.83 weeks (18.39) \nin the Imlygic arm. The primary endpoint was durable response rate (DRR) [defined as the percent of \npatients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) maintained continuously for a minimum \nof 6 months] per blinded central review. The secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), \noverall response rate (ORR) [PR+CR], time to response, duration of response, and time to treatment \nfailure (time from randomisation until the first episode of clinically relevant disease progression where \nthere is no response achieved after the progression event, or until death). \n \nThe mean age was 63 (range: 22 to 94) years; 26.5% were over 65 years old and 23.3% were over \n74 years old. The majority of patients, 98%, were caucasian. Male patients comprised 57% of study \npopulation and 70% of patients were baseline ECOG 0 performance status. Of the enrolled patients, \n22% had stage IV M1c disease and 53% of patients had received prior therapy for melanoma such as \nchemotherapy and cytokine-based immunotherapy in addition to surgery, adjuvant therapy or \nradiation. Overall, 58% of all patients enrolled into the study were seropositive for wild-type HSV-1 at \nbaseline and 32.6% were seronegative; the HSV-1 serostatus of the remaining 9.4% was unknown. \n \nThe difference in DRR between Imlygic and GM-CSF in the ITT population was statistically \nsignificant (see table 4) in favour of Imlygic. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nTable 4.

As talimogene laherparepvec is injected and \nreplicates intratumourally, bioavailability and systemic concentration of talimogene laherparepvec are \nnot predictive of drug substance activity and therefore have not been evaluated. \n \nMetabolism/elimination \n \nTalimogene laherparepvec is cleared through general host-defence mechanisms (e.g. autophagy, \nadaptive immune responses). Talimogene laherparepvec is degraded by typical endogenous protein \n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 \n \n\n100% \n\n80% \n\n60% \n\n40% \n\n20% \n\n0% \n \n\nKa\npla\n\nn-\nMe\n\nier\n P\n\ner\nce\n\nnt \nAl\n\nive\n \n\nNumber of Subjects at Risk: \n\n1: GM-CSF (N = 86) Median (95% CI) 21.5 (17.4, 29.6) months \n2: Talimogene Laherparepvec (N = 163) Median (95% CI) 41.1 (30.6, NE) months \n\n86 78 65 55 43 35 30 22 17 10 2 0  \n163 157 146 129 113 104 93 73 51 23 10 1 0 \n\n \n\n1: \n2: \n\n \n\nStudy Month \n\nGRH0149v1\n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\nand DNA catabolic pathways. As with other wild-type HSV-1 infections, a latent pool of talimogene \nlaherparepvec DNA may persist in neuronal cell bodies innervating the injection sites; therefore, the \noccurrence of latent infection with talimogene laherparepvec cannot be excluded. \n \nBiodistribution (within the body) and viral shedding (excretion/secretion) \n \nTalimogene laherparepvec DNA was quantified with a highly sensitive and specific quantitative \nPolymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) assay which may not correlate with viral infectivity risk. \nTalimogene laherparepvec was also quantified in selected patient samples in clinical studies using \nviral infectivity assays at the injection sites and in some cases of potential herpetic lesions. \n \nClinical biodistribution, elimination, and shedding \n \nThe biodistribution and shedding of intralesionally administered talimogene laherparepvec were \ninvestigated in a clinical study that measured talimogene laherparepvec DNA in blood, urine, injection \nsite, exterior of the occlusive dressings, oral mucosa, anogenital area, and suspected herpetic lesions. \nSixty patients with melanoma received Imlygic intralesional injection at a dose and schedule same as \nclinical study 005/05 (see section 5.1). Occlusive dressings samples were collected during treatment. \nBlood and urine samples were collected during treatment and for up to 30 days after the end of \ntreatment. Injection site, oral mucosa, and anogenital area samples were collected during treatment and \nfor up to 60 days after the end of treatment. Suspected herpetic lesion samples were collected any time \na patient experienced lesions of suspected herpetic origin. If the qPCR testing for talimogene \nlaherparepvec DNA was positive, then a TCID50 assay was performed to measure viral infectivity. In \nthe 60 patients treated, data indicate that talimogene laherparepvec DNA was present in all sites during \nthe study (see table 6). \n \nTable 6.

Among patients \nwith detectable talimogene laherparepvec DNA in the blood, urine, oral mucosa, and anogenital area, \nno samples had detectable talimogene laherparepvec DNA 30 days after the end of treatment. For \npatients with detectable DNA in injected lesions, no samples had detectable talimogene laherparepvec \nDNA 60 days after end of treatment. \n \nOverall 3 of 19 patients with lesions of suspected herpetic origin had talimogene laherparepvec DNA \npresent at any time during the study. Viral activity was measured in samples that were positive for \ntalimogene laherparepvec DNA from the injection site, occlusive dressings, oral mucosa, anogenital \narea, and suspected herpetic lesions. No viral activity was detected in samples of the occlusive \ndressings, oral mucosa, anogenital area, and suspected herpetic lesions. Infectious talimogene \nlaherparepvec virus was detected at the site of injection in 7 (11%) patients at multiple time points in \nthe study; no samples were positive for viral infectivity after cycle 2 or after the end of treatment. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nNo pharmacokinetic studies using talimogene laherparepvec have been conducted in special \npopulations. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAt doses up to 4 x 108 PFU/kg or 107 PFU/dose (60-fold over the highest proposed clinical dose), \nsingle or repeated doses of talimogene laherparepvec administered by SC, IV, or intratumoural \ninjection were well tolerated in immunocompetent mice, rats, and dogs. No neuropathology or adverse \nneurological effects were observed. In an in vivo study of intracerebral injection, talimogene \nlaherparepvec was 10,000-fold less neurovirulent as compared to the wild-type HSV-1 dose that \nresults in death 50% of the time in mice. \n \nTalimogene laherparepvec was injected into various xenograft tumours at doses up to 2 x 108 PFU/kg \n(30-fold over the highest proposed clinical dose) in immunodeficient mice (nude and SCID). Lethal \nsystemic viral infection was observed in up to 20% of nude mice (primarily deficient in T lymphocyte \nfunction) and 100% of SCID mice (devoid of both T and B lymphocytes). \n \nAcross studies, fatal disseminated viral infection was observed in 14% of nude mice following \ntreatment with talimogene laherparepvec at doses that are 10 to 100-fold higher than those that result \nin 100% lethality with wild-type HSV-1. \n \nMutagenicity \n \nThe genotoxic potential of talimogene laherparepvec has not been evaluated in long-term animal or \nhuman studies. Because wild-type HSV-1 does not integrate into the host genome, the risk of \ninsertional mutagenesis with talimogene laherparepvec is negligible. \n \nCarcinogenicity \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of talimogene laherparepvec has not been evaluated in long-term animal or \nhuman studies. However, available data for talimogene laherparepvec and wild-type HSV-1 do not \nindicate a carcinogenic risk in humans. \n \nReproductive and development toxicity \n \nThere were no impacts to male or female reproductive tissues following treatment of adult mice at \ndoses up to 4 x 108 PFU/kg (60-fold higher, on a PFU/kg basis, compared to the maximum clinical \ndose). No effects on embryo-foetal development were observed when talimogene laherparepvec was \nadministered during organogenesis to pregnant mice at doses up to 4 x 108 (400 million) PFU/kg \n(60-fold higher, on a PFU/kg basis, compared to the maximum clinical dose). Negligible amounts \n(< 0.001% of maternal blood levels) of talimogene laherparepvec DNA were found in foetal blood. \n \n \n6.

What you need to know before and during Imlygic treatment \n3. How Imlygic is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How Imlygic is stored \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Imlygic is and what it is used for \n \nImlygic is used to treat adult patients with a type of skin cancer called melanoma that has spread in the \nskin or to the lymph nodes, when surgery is not an option. \n \nThe active ingredient of Imlygic is talimogene laherparepvec. This is a weakened form of herpes \nsimplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), which is commonly called the cold sore virus. To get Imlygic from \nHSV-1, the virus has been changed so that it multiplies more effectively in tumours than in normal \ncells. This leads to destruction of infected tumour cells. Imlygic also works by helping your immune \nsystem to recognise and destroy tumours throughout your body. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before and during Imlygic treatment \n \nYou will not be given Imlygic: \n- if you are allergic to talimogene laherparepvec or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n- if your healthcare professional has told you that you have a severely weakened immune system. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your healthcare professional before being given Imlygic. \n \nPatients with weakened immune systems \n \nLife-threatening herpes infection may occur in patients with weakened immune systems. Tell your \nhealthcare professional if you have or have ever had a weakened immune system, if you have \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\nHIV/AIDS, blood or bone marrow cancer, or if you are taking steroids or other medicines that \nsuppress your immune system. \n \nAccidental spread of Imlygic to yourself and others \n \nImlygic can be spread to other parts of your body or to other people through direct contact with your \nbody fluids or injection sites. \n \nYou should do the following to avoid spreading Imlygic to other areas of your body or to your close \ncontacts (close contacts include household members, caregivers, sex partners, or someone you share a \nbed with): \n Avoid direct contact between your injection sites or body fluids (e.g. blood and urine) and close \n\ncontacts (e.g. use latex condoms when engaging in sexual activity, avoid kissing close contacts \nif either of you has an open mouth sore) while you are being treated with Imlygic and up to \n30 days after your last dose. \n\n Avoid touching or scratching the injection sites. \n Keep injection sites covered with airtight and watertight dressings at all times. Apply the \n\ndressing as instructed by your healthcare professional. If the dressing comes loose or falls off, \nreplace it immediately with a clean dressing. \n\n Place all used dressings and cleaning materials in a sealed plastic bag and throw them away in \nyour household waste. \n\n \nYou should tell your close contacts to: \n Avoid direct contact with your body fluids or injection sites. \n Wear gloves while changing your dressing. \n \nIf your close contacts are accidentally exposed to Imlygic, they should clean the affected area on their \nbody with soap and water and/or a disinfectant. If they develop signs or symptoms of herpes infection, \nyou should ask them to contact their healthcare professional. If herpetic lesions (blisters or sores) are \nsuspected, patients or close contacts have the option of follow-up testing by the Marketing \nAuthorisation Holder for further characterisation of the infection. Please discuss with your Healthcare \nProfessional. \n \nClose contacts who are pregnant or who have a weakened immune system, and newborns \n \nEnsure that your close contacts who are pregnant or who have a weakened immune system do not \ntouch injection sites, used dressings and cleaning materials. Keep used dressings and cleaning \nmaterials away from newborns. \n \nHerpes infection \n \nCold sores or a more serious herpes infection may occur during or after treatment with Imlygic. Signs \nand symptoms related to treatment with Imlygic may be the same as for herpes infections, and include \npain, burning or tingling in a blister around the mouth or genitals, or on the fingers or ears, eye pain, \nlight sensitivity, discharge from the eyes, or blurry vision, weakness in arms or legs, extreme \ndrowsiness (feeling sleepy), and mental confusion. If you have these signs, you should follow standard \nhygiene practices to prevent viral transmission to others. If herpetic lesions (blisters or sores) are \nsuspected, patients or close contacts have the option of follow-up testing by the Marketing \nAuthorisation Holder for further characterisation of the infection. Please discuss with your Healthcare \nProfessional \n \nInfection and delayed healing at Imlygic injection site \n \nImlygic may cause infection at the injection site. Signs and symptoms of infection include pain, \nredness, warmth, swelling, discharge or a sore (ulcer), fever, and chills. The injection site may take \nlonger to heal than normal. You should tell your healthcare professional if you notice any of these \nsymptoms. \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n \nAutoimmune reactions \n \nImlygic may cause autoimmune reactions (an over-reaction of the body’s immune system). Some \npeople taking Imlygic have developed inflammation in the kidneys (glomerulonephritis), narrowing or \nblockage of blood vessels (vasculitis), swelling of the lungs (pneumonitis), worsening skin scaling \n(psoriasis), and areas of skin without any colour (vitiligo). Inform your healthcare professional if you \nhave a history of autoimmune disease. \n \nPlasmacytoma \n \nImlygic may cause cancerous white blood cells to collect at or near the injection site (plasmacytoma). \nInform your healthcare professional if you have a history of blood cancer including multiple myeloma. \n \nDifficulty breathing \n \nIf you have a tumour in your neck, your healthcare professional may warn you that you might \nexperience compression of your airways during treatment with Imlygic. \n \nPatients with no prior herpes infection \n \nIf you have never had herpes infection in the past, you may be more likely to get fever, chills, and flu-\nlike illnesses within the period of the first 6 treatments with Imlygic. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nImlygic is not recommended for children and adolescents since the effects of Imlygic in people \nyounger than 18 years old are not known. \n \nOther medicines and Imlygic \n \nTell your healthcare professional if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines, such as acyclovir, to treat or prevent herpes infections. Acyclovir and \nother anti-viral treatments may decrease the effects of Imlygic. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nAsk your healthcare professional for advice if you: \n think you may be pregnant \n or are planning to have a baby. \nYour healthcare professional will determine if Imlygic is right for you. \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, ask your healthcare professional for advice before being given \nthis medicine. Imlygic may harm your unborn baby. \n \nWomen who are able to become pregnant should use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy \nduring treatment with Imlygic. Talk to your healthcare professional about suitable methods of \ncontraception. \n \nIt is not known whether Imlygic is excreted in breast milk. It is important to tell your healthcare \nprofessional if you are breast-feeding or plan to do so. They will then help you decide whether to stop \nbreast-feeding, or whether to stop taking Imlygic, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to \nthe baby and the benefit of Imlygic to you. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\nDriving and using machines \n \nWhen you are being treated with Imlygic you may experience symptoms such as dizziness or \nconfusion. This may impair your ability to drive or operate machinery. Use caution when driving or \noperating machinery until you are certain that Imlygic does not adversely affect you. \n \nImlygic contains sodium and sorbitol \n \nThis medicine contains approximately 30 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each \n4 mL dose.

How Imlygic is given \n \nImlygic is given in a healthcare facility under the supervision of a healthcare professional. The initial \nrecommended dose is up to 4 mL of Imlygic at a concentration of 106 (1 million) PFU/mL. Subsequent \ndoses will be up to 4 mL of Imlygic at a concentration of 108 (100 million) PFU/mL. \n \nYour healthcare professional will inject Imlygic directly into your tumour(s) with a needle and \nsyringe. Your second injection will be given 3 weeks after the first injection. After that, you will \nreceive injections every 2 weeks for as long as you have the tumour(s). \n \nYour healthcare professional will decide which tumour(s) to inject and may not inject every tumour. \nYour existing tumour(s) may increase in size and new tumour(s) could appear while you are being \ntreated with Imlygic. \n \nYou can expect to be treated with Imlygic for at least 6 months or longer. \n \nIf you miss a dose of Imlygic \n \nIt is important for you to keep all your appointments to receive Imlygic. If you miss an appointment, \nask your healthcare professional when to schedule your next dose. \n \n \n4.
