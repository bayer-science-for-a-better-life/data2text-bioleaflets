PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet) \n  \nSunosi 75 mg film-coated tablets \n \nYellow to dark yellow oblong tablet, 7.6 mm x 4.4 mm, with \u201c75\u201d debossed on one side and a score \nline on the opposite side. \nThe tablet can be divided into equal doses.  \n \nSunosi 150 mg film-coated tablets \n \nYellow oblong tablet, 9.5 mm x 5.6 mm, with \u201c150\u201d debossed on one side.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSunosi is indicated to improve wakefulness and reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in adult patients \nwith narcolepsy (with or without cataplexy). \n \nSunosi is indicated to improve wakefulness and reduce excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in adult \npatients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) whose EDS has not been satisfactorily treated by \nprimary OSA therapy, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated by a healthcare professional experienced in the treatment of \nnarcolepsy or OSA.  \n \nSunosi is not a therapy for the underlying airway obstruction in patients with OSA. Primary OSA \ntherapy should be maintained in these patients. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nBlood pressure and heart rate should be assessed before initiating treatment with solriamfetol and \nshould be monitored periodically during treatment, especially after increasing the dose. Pre-existing \nhypertension should be controlled before initiating treatment with solriamfetol and caution should be \nexercised in treating patients at higher risk of MACE, particularly patients with pre-existing \nhypertension, patients with known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease and elderly patients.  \n \nThe need for continued treatment with solriamfetol should be periodically assessed. If a patient \nexperiences increases in blood pressure or heart rate that cannot be managed with dose reduction of \nsolriamfetol or other appropriate medical intervention, discontinuation of solriamfetol should be \nconsidered.  Caution should be exercised when using other medicinal products that increase blood \npressure and heart rate (see section 4.5). \n \nPosology \n \nNarcolepsy \nThe recommended starting dose is 75 mg once daily, upon awakening. If clinically indicated in \npatients with more severe levels of sleepiness, a starting dose of 150 mg may be considered. \nDepending on clinical response, the dose can be titrated to a higher level by doubling the dose at \nintervals of at least 3 days, with a recommended maximum daily dose of 150 mg once daily.  \n \nOSA \nThe recommended starting dose is 37.5 mg once daily, upon awakening. Depending on clinical \nresponse, the dose can be titrated to a higher level by doubling the dose at intervals of at least 3 \ndays, with a recommended maximum daily dose of 150 mg once daily. \n \nSunosi can be taken with or without food. \n \nTaking Sunosi less than 9 hours before bedtime should be avoided as it may affect night time sleep. \n \nLong-term use \nThe need for continued treatment and the appropriate dose should be periodically assessed during \nextended treatment in patients prescribed solriamfetol. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (> 65 years) \nLimited data are available in elderly patients. Consideration should be given to the use of lower doses \nand close monitoring in this population (see section 4.4).  Solriamfetol is predominantly eliminated \nby the kidney and since elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, dosing may \nneed to be adjusted based on creatinine clearance in these patients.  \n \nRenal impairment \nMild renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 60-89 mL/min): No dose adjustment is required. \n \nModerate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30-59 mL/min): The recommended starting dose \nis 37.5 mg once daily. Dose may be increased to a maximum of 75 mg once daily after 5 days. \n \nSevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 15-29 mL/min): The recommended dose is 37.5 mg \nonce daily.  \n \nEnd stage renal disease (creatinine clearance <15 mL/min): Solriamfetol is not recommended for \nuse in patients with end stage renal disease. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Sunosi in children and adolescents (<18 years old) have not yet been \n\n\n\n4 \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nSunosi is for oral use. \n \nAdministration of a 37.5 mg dose can be achieved by halving a 75 mg tablet using the score line. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\u2022 Myocardial infarction within the past year, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled \n\nhypertension, serious cardiac arrhythmias and other serious heart problems. \n\u2022 Concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) or within 14 days after MAOI \n\ntreatment has been discontinued (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPsychiatric symptoms \n \nSolriamfetol has not been evaluated in patients with a history of or concurrent psychosis or bipolar \ndisorders. Caution should be exercised when treating these patients due to psychiatric adverse \nreactions that could exacerbate symptoms (e.g. manic episodes) of pre-existing psychiatric disorders. \n \nPatients treated with solriamfetol should be carefully monitored for adverse reactions such as \nanxiety, insomnia and irritability. These adverse reactions were commonly observed during \ntreatment initiation but tended to resolve with continued treatment. If these symptoms persist or \nworsen, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered. \n \nBlood pressure and heart rate \n \nAnalyses of data from clinical trials showed that treatment with solriamfetol increases systolic blood \npressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate in a dose dependent fashion.  \n \nEpidemiological data show that chronic elevations in blood pressure increase the risk of major \nadverse cardiovascular event (MACE), including stroke, heart attack and cardiovascular death. The \nmagnitude of the increase in absolute risk is dependent on the increase in blood pressure and the \nunderlying risk of MACE in the population being treated. Many patients with narcolepsy and OSA \nhave multiple risk factors for MACE, including hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and high \nbody mass index (BMI).  \n \nUse in patients with unstable cardiovascular disease, serious heart arrhythmias and other serious \nheart problems is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  \n \nPatients with moderate or severe renal impairment may be at a higher risk of increases in blood \npressure and heart rate because of the prolonged half-life of solriamfetol.  \n \nAbuse \n \nSunosi was assessed in a human abuse potential study and demonstrated low abuse potential. Results \nfrom this clinical study demonstrated that solriamfetol produced Drug Liking scores higher than \nplacebo, but generally similar or lower than phentermine (a weak stimulant). Caution should be \nexercised when treating patients with a history of stimulant (e.g. methylphenidate, amphetamine) or \nalcohol abuse, and these patients should be monitored for signs of misuse or abuse of solriamfetol. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nAngle closure glaucoma \n \nMydriasis may occur in patients taking solriamfetol. Caution is advised in patients with increased \nocular pressure or at risk of angle closure glaucoma. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential or their partners \n \nWomen of childbearing potential or their male partners must use effective method of contraception \nwhile taking solriamfetol (see section 4.6). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed (see section 5.2). \n \nSolriamfetol must not be administered concomitantly with MAOIs or within 14 days after MAOI \ntreatment has been discontinued because it may increase the risk of a hypertensive reaction (see \nsection 4.3). \n  \nConcomitant use of medicinal products that increase blood pressure and heart rate should be used \nwith caution (see section 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products that increase levels of dopamine or that bind directly to dopamine receptors \nmight result in pharmacodynamic interactions with solriamfetol. Concomitant use of such medicinal \nproducts should be used with caution.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of solriamfetol in pregnant women. Animal \nstudies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Sunosi is not recommended during \npregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether solriamfetol is excreted into human milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of solriamfetol in milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must \nbe made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Sunosi therapy taking \ninto account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the women. \n \nFertility \n \nThe effects of solriamfetol in humans are unknown. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect \nharmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nMinor influence on the ability to drive is expected in patients receiving stable solriamfetol doses. \nDizziness and disturbance in attention may occur following administration of solriamfetol (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nPatients with abnormal levels of sleepiness who take solriamfetol should be advised that their level of \nwakefulness may not return to normal. Patients with excessive daytime sleepiness, including those \ntaking solriamfetol should be frequently reassessed for their degree of sleepiness and, if appropriate, \nadvised to avoid driving or any other potentially dangerous activity, especially at the start of the \ntreatment or when the dose is changed. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were headache (11.1%), nausea (6.6%) and decreased \nappetite (6.8%).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following MedDRA frequency convention: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare ( \u2265 \n1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). \n \nSystem Organ Class Adverse reactions Frequency \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Decreased appetite Common \nPsychiatric disorders Anxiety Common \n\nInsomnia Common \nIrritability Common \nBruxism Common \nAgitation Uncommon \nRestlessness Uncommon \n\nNervous system disorders Headache Very common \nDizziness Common \nDisturbance in attention Uncommon \nTremor Uncommon \n\nCardiac disorders Palpitations Common \nTachycardia Uncommon \n\nVascular Disorders Hypertension Uncommon \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Cough Common \n\nDyspnoea Uncommon \nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea Common \n\nDiarrhoea Common \nDry mouth Common \nAbdominal pain Common \nConstipation Common \nVomiting Common \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Hyperhidrosis Common \nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nFeeling jittery Common \nChest discomfort Common \nChest pain Uncommon \nThirst Uncommon \n\nInvestigations Heart rate increased Uncommon \nBlood pressure increased Common \nWeight decreased Uncommon \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nTreatment initiation \nThe majority of the most frequently reported adverse reactions occurred within the first 2 weeks of \ninitiating treatment and resolved for the majority of patients with a median duration of less than 2 \nweeks. \n \nDose-dependent adverse reactions \nIn the 12-week clinical trials that compared doses of 37.5 mg, 75 mg and 150 mg/day of solriamfetol \nto placebo, the following adverse reactions were dose-related: headache, nausea, decreased appetite, \n\n\n\n7 \n\nanxiety, diarrhoea and dry mouth. The dose relationships were generally similar in OSA and \nnarcolepsy patients. Certain events such as anxiety, insomnia, irritability, and agitation were \ncommonly observed during treatment initiation but tended to resolve with continued treatment. If \nthese symptoms persist or worsen, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nDiscontinuation of treatment \nIn the 12-week placebo-controlled clinical trials, 11 of the 396 patients (3%) who received \nsolriamfetol discontinued due to an adverse reaction compared to 1 of the 226 patients (<1%) who \nreceived placebo. The adverse reactions leading to discontinuation that occurred in more than one \nsolriamfetol-treated patients and at a higher rate than placebo were anxiety, palpitations and \nrestlessness, all of which occurred with a frequency less than 1%. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere have been no reports of overdose of solriamfetol in the clinical studies. \n \nIn healthy volunteers, there was one adverse reaction of mild tardive dyskinesia and one adverse \nreaction of moderate akathisia that occurred at a supratherapeutic dose of 900 mg; symptoms \nresolved after treatment discontinuation. \n \nThere is no specific antidote. In the case of inadvertent overdose, symptomatic and supportive \nmedical care should be provided and patients should be carefully monitored, as appropriate. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: psychoanaleptics, centrally acting sympathomimetics, ATC code: \nN06BA14  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe mechanism(s) of solriamfetol to improve wakefulness in patients with excessive daytime \nsleepiness associated with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea has not been fully characterised. \nHowever, its efficacy could be mediated through its activity as a dopamine and norepinephrine \nreuptake inhibitor (DNRI). \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn vitro data \nIn radioligand-binding experiments with cells expressing cloned human receptors/transporters, \nsolriamfetol showed affinity for the dopamine (replicate Ki=6.3 and 14.2 \u00b5M) and norepinephrine \ntransporter (replicate Ki= 3.7 and >10 \u00b5M) but no appreciable affinity to the serotonin transporter. \nSolriamfetol inhibited the reuptake of dopamine (replicate IC50=2.9 and 6.4 \u00b5M) and norepinephrine \n(IC50= 4.4 \u00b5M) but not of serotonin by these cells. \n \nIn vivo animal data \nIn parenteral doses resulting in clear wake-promoting effects in rats, solriamfetol increased individual \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\ndopamine levels in the striatum and norepinephrine levels in the prefrontal cortex, and did not show \nappreciable binding to the rat dopamine and norepinephrine transporter in an autoradiography \nexperiment. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nNarcolepsy \nStudy 1, a 12-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, evaluated \nthe efficacy of solriamfetol in adult patients with narcolepsy (with or without cataplexy). \n \nFor entry into this study patients had to have excessive daytime sleepiness (an Epworth Sleepiness \nScale [ESS] score greater than or equal to 10), and trouble maintaining wakefulness (mean sleep \nlatency less than 25 minutes) as documented by the mean of the first 4 trials of the 40-minute \nMaintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) at baseline. \n \nThe measures of efficacy were change from baseline to Week 12 on: ability to stay awake as \nmeasured by mean sleep latency on the MWT, excessive daytime sleepiness as measured by the ESS, \nand improvement in overall clinical condition as assessed by the Patient Global Impression of \nChange (PGIc) scale. The ESS is an 8-item patient-reported measure of likelihood of falling asleep in \nusual daily life activities. The PGIc is a 7-point scale ranging from \u201cvery much improved\u201d to \u201cvery \nmuch worse\u201d which assesses the patient\u2019s report of change in their clinical condition. \n \nPatients with narcolepsy were characterised by impaired wakefulness and excessive daytime \nsleepiness, as indicated by baseline MWT mean sleep latency and ESS scores, respectively (Table 1). \nMost patients had prior use of psychostimulants. Cataplexy was present in approximately half of \npatients overall; demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between patients with \ncataplexy and those without cataplexy. \n \nIn this study, patients with narcolepsy were randomised to receive solriamfetol 75 mg, 150 mg, or 300 \nmg (two times the maximum recommended daily dose), or placebo once daily. At Week 12, patients \nrandomised to the 150 mg dose showed statistically significant improvements on the MWT and ESS \n(co-primary endpoints), as well as on the PGIc (key secondary endpoint), compared with placebo. \nPatients randomised to receive 75 mg showed statistically significant improvement on the ESS, but \nnot on the MWT or PGIc (Table 1). These effects were dose-dependent, observed at Week 1 and \nmaintained over the study duration (Figure 1). In general, at the same doses, a smaller magnitude of \neffect was observed in patients with more severe baseline levels of sleepiness relative to those who \nwere less severe. At Week 12, patients who were randomised to receive 150 mg of solriamfetol \ndemonstrated sustained improvements in wakefulness throughout the day that were statistically \nsignificant compared to placebo for each of the 5 MWT trials, spanning approximately 9 hours after \ndosing. Dose-dependent improvements in the ability to conduct daily activities were observed, as \nmeasured by the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire Short Version (FOSQ-10). Dosages \nabove 150 mg daily do not confer increased effectiveness sufficient to outweigh dose-related \nadverse reactions. \n \nNight-time sleep as measured with polysomnography was not affected by the use of solriamfetol. \n \nTable 1.

The co-primary and key secondary \nendpoints in this study were identical to Study 1. Study 3 was a 6-week, randomised-withdrawal, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy of solriamfetol in adult patients with OSA. \nThe measures of efficacy in the randomised withdrawal period were change from the beginning to \nthe end of the randomised-withdrawal period on the MWT, the ESS, and worsening in overall \nclinical condition as assessed by the PGIc. \n \nFor entry into both studies, patients had to have excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS score \u226510) and \ntrouble maintaining wakefulness (mean sleep latency <30 minutes as documented by the mean of the \nfirst 4 trials of the MWT) at baseline. Patients were eligible if they: 1) were currently using a \nprimary OSA therapy (at any level of adherence); 2) had previously used a primary therapy for at \nleast one month with at least one documented adjustment to the therapy; or 3) had undergone a \n\n\n\n10 \n\nsurgical intervention in an attempt to treat the underlying obstruction. Patients were encouraged to \nstay on their current primary OSA therapy at the same level of use throughout the study. Patients \nwere excluded only on the basis of their primary therapy use if they had refused to try a primary \ntherapy such as CPAP, an oral appliance, or a surgical intervention to treat their underlying \nobstruction. \n \nIn Study 2, patients with OSA were characterised by impaired wakefulness and excessive daytime \nsleepiness (EDS), as indicated by baseline MWT mean sleep latency and ESS scores, respectively \n(Table 2). Approximately 71% of patients were adherent (e.g. \u22654 hours per night on \u226570% of \nnights); demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between patients regardless of \nadherence to primary OSA therapy. At baseline, primary OSA therapy was used by approximately \n73% of patients; of these patients, 92% of patients were using positive airway pressure (PAP). \n \nPatients were randomised to receive solriamfetol 37.5 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg (two times the \nmaximum recommended daily dose), or placebo once daily. At Week 12, patients randomised to the \n75 mg and150 mg dose arms showed statistically significant improvements on the MWT and ESS \n(co-primary endpoints), as well as on the PGIc (key secondary endpoint), compared with placebo \n(Table 2). Patients randomised to 37.5 mg solriamfetol showed statistically significant improvements \nbased on the MWT and ESS. These effects were observed at Week 1, maintained over the study \nduration and were dose-dependent (Figure 2). At Week 12, patients who were randomised to receive \n75 mg and 150 mg  of Sunosi demonstrated sustained improvements in wakefulness throughout the \nday that were statistically significant compared to placebo for each of the 5 MWT trials, spanning \napproximately 9 hours after dosing.  Dose- dependent improvements in the ability to conduct daily \nactivities were observed, as measured by the FOSQ-10. Dosages above 150 mg daily do not confer \nincreased effectiveness sufficient to outweigh dose-related adverse reactions. \n \nNight-time sleep as measured with polysomnography was not affected by the use of solriamfetol in \nStudy 2. No clinically meaningful changes in patient use of primary OSA therapy were observed \nacross the 12-week study period in any treatment group. Adherence/non-adherence to primary OSA \ntherapy did not suggest evidence of differential efficacy. \n \nIn Study 3, baseline demographics and disease characteristics were similar to the study population in \nStudy 2. The dose was initiated at 75 mg once daily and could be titrated up one dose level in \nintervals no shorter than every 3 days, according to efficacy and tolerability, to 150 mg or 300 mg. \nPatients could also titrate down to 75 mg or 150 mg. Patients treated with solriamfetol remained \nimproved, whereas placebo-treated patients worsened (LS mean difference of 11.2 minutes on MWT \nand -4.6 on ESS; both p<0.0001) during the randomised-withdrawal period after 4 weeks of open-\nlabel treatment. Fewer patients treated with solriamfetol reported worsening on the PGIc (percentage \ndifference of 30%; p=0.0005). \n \nTable 2.

On the ESS, a negative change from baseline represents \nimprovement in excessive daytime sleepiness. *The percentage of patients improved on the PGIc includes those who reported very \nmuch, much and minimal improvements. \n \n\nFigure 2: Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints in Patients with OSA in Study 2 \n \n\n \n \n \n \nLong-term efficacy in narcolepsy and OSA \nStudy 4 was a long-term safety and maintenance of efficacy study for up to a year of treatment with \nsolriamfetol, including a 2-week randomised-withdrawal, placebo-controlled period after at least 6 \nmonths of treatment with solriamfetol, in adult patients with narcolepsy or OSA who had \ncompleted a prior trial. \n \nThe measures of efficacy in the randomised withdrawal period were change from the beginning to \nthe end of the randomised-withdrawal period on the ESS and worsening in overall clinical \ncondition as assessed by the PGIc. Dose initiation and titration was identical to Study 3.  \n \nPatients treated with solriamfetol remained improved, whereas placebo-treated patients worsened \n(LS mean difference of -3.7 on ESS; p<0.0001) during the randomised-withdrawal period after at \n\n\n\n12 \n\nleast 6 months of open-label treatment. Fewer patients treated with solriamfetol reported worsening \non the PGIc (percentage difference of -36.2%; p<0.0001). These results demonstrate long-term \nmaintenance of efficacy with continued solriamfetol treatment, and a reversal of treatment benefit \nupon discontinuation of that treatment. \n \nFor patients who were using a primary OSA therapy at the beginning of the study, primary OSA \ntherapy use did not change over the course of the long-term study. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nSunosi in one or more subsets of the paediatric population from 6 to less than 18 years of age in \nsymptomatic treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy (see section 4.2 for information \non paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe oral bioavailability of solriamfetol is approximately 95% with peak plasma concentrations \noccurring at a median Tmax of 2 hours (range 1.25 to 3 hours) under fasted conditions. \n \nIngestion of solriamfetol with a high-fat meal resulted in minimal changes in Cmax and AUC; \nhowever, a delay of approximately 1 hour was observed in Tmax. The results show that solriamfetol \ncan be taken without regard to food. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe apparent volume of distribution of solriamfetol is approximately 198.7 L, indicating extensive \ntissue distribution beyond the vascular compartment. Plasma protein binding ranged from 13.3% to \n19.4% over the solriamfetol concentration range of 0.059 to 10.1 \u00b5g/mL in human plasma. The mean \nblood-to-plasma concentration ratio ranged from 1.16 to 1.29, suggesting a small extent of binding of \nsolriamfetol to blood cells. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nSolriamfetol is minimally metabolised in humans. \n \nInteractions \nWith the exception of weak inhibition of CYP2D6 (IC50 of 360 \u00b5M), solriamfetol is not a substrate \nor inhibitor of any of the major CYP enzymes and does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 3A4 or UGT1A1 \nenzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. Solriamfetol does not appear to be a substrate or \ninhibitor of membrane transporters P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1 or OAT3. \nSolriamfetol is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine and is a low-affinity substrate of multiple \nrenal cationic active substance transporters, without strong affinity for any individual transporter \ntested (OCT2, MATE1, OCTN1 and OCTN2). Solriamfetol is not an inhibitor of renal transporters \nOCT1, MATE2-K, OCTN1 or OCTN2 but is a weak inhibitor of OCT2 (IC50 of 146 \u00b5M) and \nMATE1 (IC50 of 211 \u00b5M). Taken together, these results show that clinically relevant PK drug \ninteractions are unlikely to occur in patients taking solriamfetol. \n \nElimination \n \nThe apparent mean elimination half-life of solriamfetol is 7.1 hours, and the apparent total clearance \nis approximately 19.5 L/h. Renal clearance for solriamfetol is approximately 18.2 L/h. \n \nIn a human mass-balance study, approximately 95% of the dose was recovered in urine as unchanged \nsolriamfetol and 1% or less of the dose was recovered as the minor inactive metabolite N-acetyl \n\n\n\n13 \n\nsolriamfetol. Renal clearance represented the majority of apparent total clearance and exceeded \ncreatinine clearance by approximately 3-fold, indicating that active tubular secretion of the parent \ndrug is likely the major elimination pathway. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nSolriamfetol exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the clinical dose range. Steady state is reached in \n3 days, and once-daily administration of 150 mg is expected to result in minimal solriamfetol \naccumulation (1.06 times single-dose exposure). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nCompared to subjects with normal renal function (eGFR\u226590 mL/min/1.73 m2), AUC of solriamfetol \nwas higher by approximately 1.5-, 2.3-, and 4.4-fold, and t1/2 increased approximately 1.2-, 1.9-, and \n3.9- fold in patients with mild (eGFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (eGFR \n30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2), or severe (eGFR<30 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment, respectively. In \ngeneral, mean Cmax and median Tmax values were not affected by renal impairment.  \n \nCompared to subjects with normal renal function (eGFR\u226590 mL/min/1.73 m2), AUC of solriamfetol  \nwas higher by approximately 6.2- and 4.6-fold, respectively, in patients with ESRD without \nhemodialysis and in patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis, and t1/2 increased at least 13-\nfold. Solriamfetol is not recommended for use in patients with ESRD. In patients with ESRD, an \naverage of 21% of solriamfetol was removed by hemodialysis. \n \nAge, gender, race \nPopulation PK analysis indicated that the intrinsic covariates of age, gender, and race do not have \nclinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of solriamfetol. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of genotoxicity, \nand male and female fertility.  \n \nRepeated dose toxicity studies with daily oral application were conducted in mice (duration 3 months, \nNOAEL 17 mg/kg/day), rats (duration 6 months with a 3-month recovery period, NOAEL not \nestablished, LOAEL 29 mg/kg/day) and dogs (duration 12 months with a 3-month recovery period, \nNOAEL not established, LOAEL 8 mg/kg/day). AUC-based safety factors for solriamfetol derived \nfrom these studies (based on comparison with clinical AUC at the maximum recommended human \ndose of 150 mg/day) were <1 for mice (based on NOAEL) and <2 for rats and dogs (based on \nLOAEL), mainly due to exaggerated pharmacological effects of solriamfetol on CNS activity. \n \nLong-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in mice, treated with oral solriamfetol doses \nof 20, 65 and 200 mg/kg/day for up to 104 weeks, and in rats, treated with oral solriamfetol doses of \n35, 80 and 200 mg/kg/day for up to 101 weeks. Solriamfetol did not increase the incidence of \nneoplastic findings in these lifetime carcinogenicity assays. AUC-based safety margins at the high \ndose to the maximal recommended human dose (MRHD, 150 mg/day) were about 7.8 in mice and \nabout 20.7 in rats. In the light of negative genotoxicity and no increase of tumour incidence in both \ncarcinogenicity studies, it can be concluded that solriamfetol does not pose a carcinogenic risk to \nhumans. Compared to controls, survival rate was decreased in solriamfetol-treated (male) mice, \nmaximal at a dose of 65 mg/kg/day (AUC-based safety margin to MRHD about 2.9), but not in \nsolriamfetol-treated rats. \n \nEmbryofoetal development \n \nPossible effects on embryofoetal development were investigated in pregnant rats and rabbits. \nEmbryofoetal toxicity (increased postimplantation loss in rats, increased incidence of skeletal \n\n\n\n14 \n\nalterations that included sternebrae malalignment in rats and rabbits, hindlimb rotation and bent \nbones in rats, and decreased foetal weights in both species) and situs inversus in rats was only \nevident in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weights). Whether embryotoxicity was a \nconsequence of maternal toxicity or a direct effect of solriamfetol cannot be determined. In a \ndistribution study in pregnant rats 14C-solriamfetol was detected in foetal membrane (around twice \nas high as in blood), placenta and whole foetus (nearly similar to blood concentration) and thus a \ndirect toxic effect on the foetus cannot be excluded. In rats the exposure margins at the maternal and \ndevelopmental NOAEL are below the human exposure (0.6 \u2013 0.7 based on AUC) at the MRHD, \nwhile in rabbits the exposure margins at the maternal and developmental NOAEL is < 6 (based on \nmg/m2 body surface area). \n \nPrenatal and postnatal Development \n \nIn rats exposure levels (AUC) above 0.6 \u2013 0.7 times the human exposure (AUC) at the MRHD during \npregnancy and lactation resulted in maternal toxicity and adverse effects on growth and development \nin the offspring. At exposure levels (AUC) 8 to 12 times the human exposure (AUC) at the MRHD \nno long-term effects on learning and memory were observed, but mating and pregnancy indices of \nthe offspring were decreased. \n \n \n6.

Sunosi helps you to stay awake and to feel \nless sleepy. \n \nIt is used \n\n\u2022 in adults with narcolepsy, a condition that causes you to suddenly and unexpectedly feel very \nsleepy at any time. Some patients with narcolepsy also have symptoms of cataplexy (when \nmuscles become weak in response to emotions such as anger, fear, laughter or surprise, \nsometimes leading to collapse). \n \n\n\u2022 to improve wakefulness and reduce excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in adult patients \nwith obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) whose EDS has not been satisfactorily treated by \nprimary OSA therapy, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).  \n\n \n \n2.
