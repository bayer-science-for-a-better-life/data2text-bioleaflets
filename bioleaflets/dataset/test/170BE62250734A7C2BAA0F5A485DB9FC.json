Daklinza is given for 24 weeks, in combination with \n24-48 weeks of peginterferon alfa and ribavirin: \n\n- If HCV RNA is undetectable at both treatment weeks 4 and 12, all 3 components of the regimen \nshould be continued for a total duration of 24 weeks. \n\n- If undetectable HCV RNA is achieved, but not at both treatment weeks 4 and 12, Daklinza should be \ndiscontinued at 24 weeks and peginterferon alfa and ribavirin continued for a total duration of \n48 weeks. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nRibavirin Dosing Guidelines \nThe dose of ribavirin, when combined with Daklinza, is weight-based (1,000 or 1,200 mg in patients \n<75 kg or \u226575 kg, respectively). Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of ribavirin. \n \nFor patients with Child-Pugh A, B, or C cirrhosis or recurrence of HCV infection after liver \ntransplantation, the recommended initial dose of ribavirin is 600 mg daily with food. If the starting \ndose is well-tolerated, the dose can be titrated up to a maximum of 1,000-1,200 mg daily (breakpoint \n75 kg). If the starting dose is not well-tolerated, the dose should be reduced as clinically indicated, \nbased on haemoglobin and creatinine clearance measurements (see Table 2). \n \n\nTable 2: Ribavirin dosing guidelines for coadministration with Daklinza regimen for \npatients with cirrhosis or post-transplant \n\nLaboratory Value/Clinical Criteria Ribavirin Dosing Guideline \n\nHaemoglobin  \n\n >12 g/dL 600 mg daily \n\n > 10 to \u226412 g/dL 400 mg daily \n\n > 8.5 to \u226410 g/dL 200 mg daily \n\n \uf0a38.5 g/dL Discontinue ribavirin \n\nCreatinine Clearance  \n\n >50 mL/min Follow guidelines above for haemoglobin \n\n >30 to \u226450 mL/min 200 mg every other day \n\n \u226430 mL/min or haemodialysis Discontinue ribavirin \n\n \nDose modification, interruption and discontinuation \nDose modification of Daklinza to manage adverse reactions is not recommended. If treatment \ninterruption of components in the regimen is necessary because of adverse reactions, Daklinza must \nnot be given as monotherapy. \nThere are no virologic treatment stopping rules that apply to the combination of Daklinza with \nsofosbuvir. \n \nTreatment discontinuation in patients with inadequate on-treatment virologic response during \ntreatment with Daklinza, peginterferon alfa and ribavirin \nIt is unlikely that patients with inadequate on-treatment virologic response will achieve a sustained \nvirologic response (SVR); therefore discontinuation of treatment is recommended in these patients. \nThe HCV RNA thresholds that trigger discontinuation of treatment (i.e. treatment stopping rules) are \npresented in Table 3. \n \nTable 3: Treatment stopping rules in patients receiving Daklinza in combination with \n\npeginterferon alfa and ribavirin with inadequate on-treatment virologic response \n\nHCV RNA Action \n\nTreatment week 4: >1000 IU/ml Discontinue Daklinza, peginterferon alfa and ribavirin \n\nTreatment week 12: \u226525 IU/ml Discontinue Daklinza, peginterferon alfa and ribavirin \n\nTreatment week 24: \u226525 IU/ml Discontinue peginterferon alfa and ribavirin (treatment with \nDaklinza is complete at week 24) \n\n \nDose recommendation for concomitant medicines \nStrong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nThe dose of Daklinza should be reduced to 30 mg once daily when coadministered with strong \ninhibitors of CYP3A4. \n \nModerate inducers of CYP3A4 \nThe dose of Daklinza should be increased to 90 mg once daily when coadministered with moderate \ninducers of CYP3A4. See section 4.5. \n \nMissed doses \nPatients should be instructed that, if they miss a dose of Daklinza, the dose should be taken as soon as \npossible if remembered within 20 hours of the scheduled dose time. However, if the missed dose is \nremembered more than 20 hours after the scheduled dose, the dose should be skipped and the next \ndose taken at the appropriate time. \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment of Daklinza is required for patients aged \u226565 years (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Daklinza is required for patients with any degree of renal impairment (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Daklinza is required for patients with mild (Child-Pugh A, score 5-6), moderate \n(Child-Pugh B, score 7-9) or severe (Child-Pugh C, score \u226510) hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 \nand 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Daklinza in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \nDaklinza is to be taken orally with or without meals. Patients should be instructed to swallow the \ntablet whole. The film-coated tablet should not be chewed or crushed due the unpleasant taste of the \nactive substance. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nCoadministration with medicinal products that strongly induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and \nP-glycoprotein transporter (P-gp) and thus may lead to lower exposure and loss of efficacy of \nDaklinza. These active substances include but are not limited to phenytoin, carbamazepine, \noxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, systemic dexamethasone, and the \nherbal product St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDaklinza must not be administered as monotherapy. Daklinza must be administered in combination \nwith other medicinal products for the treatment of chronic HCV infection (see sections 4.1 and 4.2). \n \nSevere bradycardia and heart block \nCases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when Daklinza is used in \ncombination with sofosbuvir and concomitant amiodarone with or without other drugs that lower heart \nrate. The mechanism is not established. \nThe concomitant use of amiodarone was limited through the clinical development of sofosbuvir plus \ndirect-acting antivirals (DAAs). Cases are potentially life threatening, therefore amiodarone should \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nonly be used in patients on Daklinza and sofosbuvir when other alternative antiarrhythmic treatments \nare not tolerated or are contraindicated. \n \nShould concomitant use of amiodarone be considered necessary it is recommended that patients are \nclosely monitored when initiating Daklinza in combination with sofosbuvir. Patients who are \nidentified as being at high risk of bradyarrhythmia should be continuously monitored for 48 hours in \nan appropriate clinical setting. \n \nDue to the long half-life of amiodarone, appropriate monitoring should also be carried out for patients \nwho have discontinued amiodarone within the past few months and are to be initiated on Daklinza in \ncombination with sofosbuvir. \n \nAll patients receiving Daklinza and sofosbuvir in combination with amiodarone with or without other \ndrugs that lower heart rate should also be warned of the symptoms of bradycardia and heart block and \nshould be advised to seek medical advice urgently should they experience them. \n \nGenotype-specific activity \nConcerning recommended regimens with different HCV genotypes, see section 4.2. Concerning \ngenotype-specific virological and clinical activity, see section 5.1. \nData to support the treatment of genotype 2 infection with Daklinza and sofosbuvir are limited. \n \nData from study ALLY-3 (AI444218) support a 12-week treatment duration of Daklinza + sofosbuvir \nfor treatment-na\u00efve and -experienced patients with genotype 3 infection without cirrhosis. Lower rates \nof SVR were observed for patients with cirrhosis (see section 5.1). Data from compassionate use \nprogrammes which included patients with genotype 3 infection and cirrhosis, support the use of \nDaklinza + sofosbuvir for 24 weeks in these patients. The relevance of adding ribavirin to that regimen \nis unclear (see section 5.1). \nThe clinical data to support the use of Daklinza and sofosbuvir in patients infected with HCV \ngenotypes 4 and 6 are limited. There are no clinical data in patients with genotype 5 (see section 5.1). \n \nPatients with Child-Pugh C liver disease \nThe safety and efficacy of Daklinza in the treatment of HCV infection in patients with Child-Pugh C \nliver disease have been established in the clinical study ALLY-1 (AI444215, Daklinza + sofosbuvir + \nribavirin for 12 weeks); however, SVR rates were lower than in patients with Child-Pugh A and B. \nTherefore, a conservative treatment regimen of Daklinza + sofosbuvir +/- ribavirin for 24 weeks is \nproposed for patients with Child-Pugh C (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). Ribavirin may be added based on \nclinical assessment of an individual patient. \n \nHCV/HBV (hepatitis B virus) co-infection \nCases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after \ntreatment with direct-acting antiviral agents. HBV screening should be performed in all patients before \ninitiation of treatment. HBV/HCV co-infected patients are at risk of HBV reactivation, and should \ntherefore be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines. \n \nRetreatment with daclatasvir \nThe efficacy of Daklinza as part of a retreatment regimen in patients with prior exposure to a NS5A \ninhibitor has not been established. \n \nPregnancy and contraception requirements \nDaklinza should not be used during pregnancy or in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. Use of highly effective contraception should be continued for 5 weeks after completion \nof Daklinza therapy (see section 4.6). \nWhen Daklinza is used in combination with ribavirin, the contraindications and warnings for that \nmedicinal product are applicable. Significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal effects have been \ndemonstrated in all animal species exposed to ribavirin; therefore, extreme care must be taken to avoid \npregnancy in female patients and in female partners of male patients (see the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for ribavirin).  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nInteractions with medicinal products \nCoadministration of Daklinza can alter the concentration of other medicinal products and other \nmedicinal products may alter the concentration of daclatasvir. Refer to section 4.3 for a listing of \nmedicinal products that are contraindicated for use with Daklinza due to potential loss of therapeutic \neffect. Refer to section 4.5 for established and other potentially significant drug-drug interactions. \n \nUse in diabetic patients \nDiabetics may experience improved glucose control, potentially resulting in symptomatic \nhypoglycaemia, after initiating HCV DAA treatment. Glucose levels of diabetic patients initiating \nDAA therapy should be closely monitored, particularly within the first 3 months, and their diabetic \nmedication modified when necessary. The physician in charge of the diabetic care of the patient \nshould be informed when DAA therapy is initiated. \n \nPaediatric population \nDaklinza is not recommended for use in children and adolescents aged below 18 years because the \nsafety and efficacy have not been established in this population. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients in Daklinza \nDaklinza contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \nPatients on controlled sodium diet \nDaklinza contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per maximum dose of 90 mg, that is to say \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nContraindications of concomitant use (see section 4.3) \nDaklinza is contraindicated in combination with medicinal products that strongly induce CYP3A4 and \nP-gp, e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, \nsystemic dexamethasone, and the herbal product St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum), and thus \nmay lead to lower exposure and loss of efficacy of Daklinza. \n \nPotential for interaction with other medicinal products  \nDaclatasvir is a substrate of CYP3A4, P-gp and organic cation transporter (OCT) 1. Strong or \nmoderate inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp may decrease the plasma levels and therapeutic effect of \ndaclatasvir. Coadministration with strong inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp is contraindicated while dose \nadjustment of Daklinza is recommended when coadministered with moderate inducers of CYP3A4 \nand P-gp (see Table 4). Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may increase the plasma levels of daclatasvir. \nDose adjustment of Daklinza is recommended when coadministered with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 \n(see Table 4). Coadministration of medicines that inhibit P-gp or OCT1 activity is likely to have a \nlimited effect on daclatasvir exposure. \n \nDaclatasvir is an inhibitor of P-gp, organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, OCT1 and \nbreast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Administration of Daklinza may increase systemic exposure \nto medicinal products that are substrates of P-gp, OATP 1B1, OCT1 or BCRP, which could increase \nor prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. Caution should be used if the medicinal \nproduct has a narrow therapeutic range (see Table 4). \n \nDaclatasvir is a very weak inducer of CYP3A4 and caused a 13% decrease in midazolam exposure. \nHowever, as this is a limited effect, dose adjustment of concomitantly administered CYP3A4 \nsubstrates is not necessary. \n \nRefer to the respective Summary of Product Characteristics for drug interaction information for other \nmedicinal products in the regimen. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\nPatients treated with vitamin K antagonists \nAs liver function may change during treatment with Daklinza, a close monitoring of International \nNormalized Ratio (INR) values is recommended.  \n \nTabulated summary of interactions \nTable 4 provides information from drug interaction studies with daclatasvir including clinical \nrecommendations for established or potentially significant drug interactions. Clinically relevant \nincrease in concentration is indicated as \u201c\u2191\u201d, clinically relevant decrease as \u201c\u2193\u201d, no clinically relevant \nchange as \u201c\u2194\u201d.

\nThere are no data from the use of daclatasvir in pregnant women.  \nStudies of daclatasvir in animals have shown embryotoxic and teratogenic effects (see section 5.3). \nThe potential risk for humans is unknown. \nDaklinza should not be used during pregnancy or in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception (see section 4.4). Use of highly effective contraception should be continued for 5 weeks \nafter completion of Daklinza therapy (see section 4.5). \n \nSince Daklinza is used in combination with other agents, the contraindications and warnings for those \nmedicinal products are applicable.  \nFor detailed recommendations regarding pregnancy and contraception, refer to the Summary of \nProduct Characteristics for ribavirin and peginterferon alfa. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether daclatasvir is excreted in human milk. Available pharmacokinetic and \ntoxicological data in animals have shown excretion of daclatasvir and metabolites in milk (see \nsection 5.3). A risk to the newborn/infant cannot be excluded. Mothers should be instructed not to \nbreastfeed if they are taking Daklinza. \n \nFertility \nNo human data on the effect of daclatasvir on fertility are available. \nIn rats, no effect on mating or fertility was seen (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nDizziness has been reported during treatment with Daklinza in combination with sofosbuvir, and \ndizziness, disturbance in attention, blurred vision and reduced visual acuity have been reported during \ntreatment with Daklinza in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe overall safety profile of daclatasvir is based on data from 2215 patients with chronic HCV \ninfection who received Daklinza once daily either in combination with sofosbuvir with or without \nribavirin (n=679, pooled data) or in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin (n=1536, pooled \ndata) from a total of 14 clinical studies. \n \nDaklinza in combination with sofosbuvir \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were fatigue, headache, and nausea. Grade 3 adverse \nreactions were reported in less than 1% of patients, and no patients had a Grade 4 adverse reaction. \nFour patients discontinued the Daklinza regimen for adverse events, only one of which was considered \nrelated to study therapy. \n \nDaklinza in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were fatigue, headache, pruritus, anaemia, influenza-\nlike illness, nausea, insomnia, neutropenia, asthenia, rash, decreased appetite, dry skin, alopecia, \npyrexia, myalgia, irritability, cough, diarrhoea, dyspnoea and arthralgia. The most frequently reported \nadverse reactions of at least Grade 3 severity (frequency of 1% or greater) were neutropenia, anaemia, \nlymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. The safety profile of daclatasvir in combination with \npeginterferon alfa and ribavirin was similar to that seen with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin alone, \nincluding among patients with cirrhosis. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions are listed in Table 5 by regimen, system organ class and frequency: very common \n(\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n18 \n\nand very rare (<1/10,000).

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is limited experience of accidental overdose of daclatasvir in clinical studies. In phase 1 clinical \nstudies, healthy subjects who received up to 100 mg once daily for up to 14 days or single doses up to \n200 mg had no unexpected adverse reactions. \n \nThere is no known antidote for overdose of daclatasvir. Treatment of overdose with daclatasvir should \nconsist of general supportive measures, including monitoring of vital signs, and observation of the \npatient\u2019s clinical status. Because daclatasvir is highly protein bound (99%) and has a molecular weight \n>500, dialysis is unlikely to significantly reduce plasma concentrations of daclatasvir. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Direct-acting antiviral, ATC code: J05AP07 \n \nMechanism of action \nDaclatasvir is an inhibitor of nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A), a multifunctional protein that is an \nessential component of the HCV replication complex. Daclatasvir inhibits both viral RNA replication \nand virion assembly.  \n \nAntiviral activity in cell culture \nDaclatasvir is an inhibitor of HCV genotypes 1a and 1b replication in cell-based replicon assays with \neffective concentration (50% reduction, EC50) values of 0.003-0.050 and 0.001-0.009 nM, \nrespectively, depending on the assay method. The daclatasvir EC50 values in the replicon system were \n0.003-1.25 nM for genotypes 3a, 4a, 5a and 6a, and 0.034-19 nM for genotype 2a as well as 0.020 nM \nfor infectious genotype 2a (JFH-1) virus. \nDaclatasvir showed additive to synergistic interactions with interferon alfa, HCV nonstructural \nprotein 3 (NS3) PIs, HCV nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B) non-nucleoside inhibitors, and HCV \nNS5B nucleoside analogues in combination studies using the cell-based HCV replicon system. No \nantagonism of antiviral activity was observed. \nNo clinically relevant antiviral activity was observed against a variety of RNA and DNA viruses, \nincluding HIV, confirming that daclatasvir, which inhibits a HCV-specific target, is highly selective \nfor HCV. \n \nResistance in cell culture \nSubstitutions conferring daclatasvir resistance in genotypes 1-4 were observed in the N-terminal 100 \namino acid region of NS5A in a cell-based replicon system. L31V and Y93H were frequently \nobserved resistance substitutions in genotype 1b, while M28T, L31V/M, Q30E/H/R, and Y93C/H/N \nwere frequently observed resistance substitutions in genotype 1a. These substitutions conferred low \nlevel resistance (EC50 <1 nM) for genotype 1b, and higher levels of resistance for genotype 1a (EC50 \nup to 350 nM). The most resistant variants with single amino acid substitution in genotype 2a and \ngenotype 3a were F28S (EC50 >300 nM) and Y93H (EC50 >1,000 nM), respectively. In genotype 4, \namino acid substitutions at 30 and 93 (EC50 < 16 nM) were frequently selected. \n \nCross-resistance \nHCV replicons expressing daclatasvir-associated resistance substitutions remained fully sensitive to \ninterferon alfa and other anti-HCV agents with different mechanisms of action, such as NS3 protease \nand NS5B polymerase (nucleoside and non-nucleoside) inhibitors. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n20 \n\n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nIn the majority of clinical studies of daclatasvir in combination with sofosbuvir or with peginterferon \nalfa and ribavirin, plasma HCV RNA values were measured using the COBAS TaqMan HCV test \n(version 2.0), for use with the High Pure System, with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of \n25 IU/ ml. HCV RNA values in the ALLY-3C (AI444379) study were measured using the Roche \nCOBAS\u00ae AmpliPrep/COBAS\u00ae TaqMan\u00ae HCV Test (version 2.0), with an LLOQ of 15 IU/mL. \nSVR was the primary endpoint to determine the HCV cure rate, which was defined as HCV RNA less \nthan LLOQ at 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12) for studies AI444040, ALLY-1 \n(AI444215), ALLY-2 (AI444216), ALLY-3 (AI444218), ALLY-3C (AI444379), AI444042 and \nAI444043 and as HCV RNA undetectable at 24 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR24) for study \nAI444010. \n \nDaclatasvir in combination with sofosbuvir \nThe efficacy and safety of daclatasvir 60 mg once daily in combination with sofosbuvir 400 mg once \ndaily in the treatment of patients with chronic HCV infection were evaluated in five open-label studies \n(AI444040, ALLY-1, ALLY-2, ALLY-3, and ALLY-3C). \n \nIn study AI444040, 211 adults with HCV genotype 1, 2, or 3 infection and without cirrhosis received \ndaclatasvir and sofosbuvir, with or without ribavirin. Among the 167 patients with HCV genotype 1 \ninfection, 126 were treatment-na\u00efve and 41 had failed prior therapy with a PI regimen (boceprevir or \ntelaprevir). All 44 patients with HCV genotype 2 (n=26) or 3 (n=18) infection were treatment-na\u00efve. \nTreatment duration was 12 weeks for 82 treatment-na\u00efve HCV genotype 1 patients, and 24 weeks for \nall other patients in the study. The 211 patients had a median age of 54 years (range: 20 to 70); 83% \nwere white; 12% were black/African-American; 2% were Asian; 20% were Hispanic or Latino. The \nmean score on the FibroTest (a validated non-invasive diagnostic assay) was 0.460 (range: 0.03 to \n0.89). Conversion of the FibroTest score to the corresponding METAVIR score suggests that 35% of \nall patients (49% of patients with prior PI failure, 30% of patients with genotype 2 or 3) had \u2265F3 liver \nfibrosis. Most patients (71%, including 98% of prior PI failures) had IL-28B rs12979860 non-CC \ngenotypes. \n \nSVR12 was achieved by 99% patients with HCV genotype 1, 96% of those with genotype 2 and 89% \nof those with genotype 3 (see Tables 6 and 7). Response was rapid (viral load at Week 4 showed that \nmore than 97% of patients responded to therapy), and was not influenced by HCV subtype (1a/1b), \nIL28B genotype, or use of ribavirin. Among treatment-na\u00efve patients with HCV RNA results at both \nfollow-up Weeks 12 and 24, concordance between SVR12 and SVR24 was 99.5% independent of \ntreatment duration.  \nTreatment-na\u00efve patients with HCV genotype 1 who received 12 weeks of treatment had a similar \nresponse as those treated for 24 weeks (Table 6). \n \nTable 6: Treatment outcomes, daclatasvir in combination with sofosbuvir, HCV genotype 1 in \n\nStudy AI444040 \n\n Treatment-na\u00efve Prior telaprevir or boceprevir failures \n\n daclatasvir \n+ sofosbuvir  \n\nN=70 \n\ndaclatasvir \n+ sofosbuvir \n+ ribavirin \n\nN=56 \n\nAll \n\nN=126 \n\ndaclatasvir \n+ sofosbuvir \n\nN=21 \n\ndaclatasvir \n+ sofosbuvir \n+ ribavirin \n\nN=20 \n\nAll  \n\nN=41 \n\nEnd of treatment \nHCV RNA \nundetectable \n\n70 (100%) 56 (100%) 126 (100%) 19 (91%) 19 (95%) 38 (93%) \n\nSVR12 (overall)* 70 (100%) 55 (98%)* 125 (99%)* 21 (100%) 20 (100%) 41 (100%) \n\n 12 weeks \ntreatment \nduration \n\n41/41 \n(100%) \n\n40/41 (98%) 81/82 (99%) -- -- -- \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n21 \n\nTable 6: Treatment outcomes, daclatasvir in combination with sofosbuvir, HCV genotype 1 in \nStudy AI444040 \n\n Treatment-na\u00efve Prior telaprevir or boceprevir failures \n\n daclatasvir \n+ sofosbuvir  \n\nN=70 \n\ndaclatasvir \n+ sofosbuvir \n+ ribavirin \n\nN=56 \n\nAll \n\nN=126 \n\ndaclatasvir \n+ sofosbuvir \n\nN=21 \n\ndaclatasvir \n+ sofosbuvir \n+ ribavirin \n\nN=20 \n\nAll  \n\nN=41 \n\n 24 weeks \ntreatment \nduration \n\n29/29 \n(100%) \n\n15/15 \n(100%) \n\n44/44 \n(100%) \n\n21 (100%) 20 (100%) 41 (100%) \n\n \u2265 F3 liver \nfibrosis \n\n-- -- \n41/41 \n\n(100%) \n-- -- \n\n20/20 \n(100%) \n\n* Patients who had missing data at follow-up Week 12 were considered responders if their next available \nHCV RNA value was <LLOQ.

All 3 HCV/HIV co-\ninfected patients achieved SVR12. \n \nTable 13: Treatment outcomes, daclatasvir in combination with sofosbuvir and ribavirin for \n\n24 weeks, HCV genotype 3 patients with cirrhosis in Study ALLY-3C \n\n \nTreatment-na\u00efve \n\nN=54 \n\nTreatment-\nexperienced \n\nN=24 \n\nTotal \n\nN=78 \n\nEnd of treatment \n\nHCV RNA undetectable \n54/54 (100.0%) 21/24 (87.5%) 75/78 (96.2%) \n\nResponder (SVR12) 50/54 (92.6%) 19/24 (79.2%) 69/78 (88.5%)* \n\nNon-responder (non-SVR12) 4/54 (7.4%) 5/24 (20.8%) 9/78 (11.5%) \n\n  Virologic failure    \n\nVirologic breakthrough 0 0 0 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n26 \n\nTable 13: Treatment outcomes, daclatasvir in combination with sofosbuvir and ribavirin for \n24 weeks, HCV genotype 3 patients with cirrhosis in Study ALLY-3C \n\n \nTreatment-na\u00efve \n\nN=54 \n\nTreatment-\nexperienced \n\nN=24 \n\nTotal \n\nN=78 \n\nDetectable HCV RNA \nat end of treatment \n\n0 2/24 (8.3%) 2/78 (2.6%) \n\nRelapse 0 2/21 (9.5%) 2/75 (2.7%) \n\n  Non-virologic failure    \n\nOther non-responder** 4/54 (7.4%) 0 4/78 (5.1%) \n\nNo HCV RNA on \ntreatment \n\n0 1/24 (4.2%) 1/78 (1.3%) \n\n*    One treatment-experienced patient achieved SVR12 per local HCV RNA results. \n**  Other non-responders included 4  patients with HCV  RNA < LLOQ target not detected (TND) at end of \n\ntreatment, but who were lost to follow-up at post-treatment Week 12 and subsequent time points, and \n1 patient who had no on-treatment HCV RNA results due to early discontinuation.  \n\n \nCompassionate Use \nPatients with HCV infection (across genotypes) at high risk of decompensation or death within \n12 months if left untreated were treated under compassionate use programmes. Patients with \ngenotype 3 infection were treated with daclatasvir + sofosbuvir +/- ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks, where \nthe longer treatment duration was associated with a lower risk for relapse (around 5%) in a preliminary \nanalysis. The relevance of including ribavirin as part of the 24-week regimen is unclear. In one cohort \nthe majority of patients were treated with daclatasvir + sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 12 weeks. The \nrelapse rate was around 15%, and similar  for patients with Child-Pugh A, B and C. The programmes \ndo not allow for a direct comparison of efficacy between the 12- and 24-week regimens. \n \nDaclatasvir in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin \nAI444042 and AI444010 were randomised, double-blind studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety \nof daclatasvir in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV) in the treatment of \nchronic HCV infection in treatment-na\u00efve adults with compensated liver disease (including cirrhosis). \nAI444042 enrolled patients with HCV genotype 4 infection and AI444010 enrolled patients with \neither genotype 1 or 4. AI444043 was an open-label, single-arm study of daclatasvir with \npegIFN/RBV in treatment-na\u00efve adults with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection who were co-infected \nwith HIV. \n \nAI444042: Patients received daclatasvir 60 mg once daily (n=82) or placebo (n=42) plus pegIFN/RBV \nfor 24 weeks. Patients in the daclatasvir treatment group who did not have HCV RNA undetectable at \nboth Weeks 4 and 12 and all placebo-treated patients continued pegIFN/RBV for another 24 weeks. \nTreated patients had a median age of 49 years (range: 20 to 71); 77% of patients were white; 19% \nwere black/African-American; 4% were Hispanic or Latino. Ten percent of patients had compensated \ncirrhosis, and 75% of patients had IL-28B rs12979860 non-CC genotypes. Treatment outcomes in \nstudy AI444042 are presented in Table 14. Response was rapid (at Week 4 91% of daclatasvir-treated \npatients had HCV RNA <LLOQ). SVR12 rates were higher for patients with the IL-28B CC genotype \nthan for those with non-CC genotypes and for patients with baseline HCV RNA less than \n800,000 IU/ml but consistently higher in the daclatasvir-treated patients than for placebo-treated \npatients in all subgroups. \n \nAI444010: Patients received daclatasvir 60 mg once daily (n=158) or placebo (n=78) plus \npegIFN/RBV through Week 12. Patients assigned to daclatasvir 60 mg once-daily treatment group \nwho had HCV RNA <LLOQ at Week 4 and undetectable at Week 10 were then randomised to receive \nanother 12 weeks of daclatasvir 60 mg + pegIFN/RBV or placebo + pegIFN/RBV for a total treatment \nduration of 24 weeks.

Patients achieving virologic response [HCV RNA undetectable at weeks 4 \nand 12] completed therapy after 24 weeks while those who did not achieve virologic response received \nan additional 24 weeks of treatment with pegIFN/RBV, to complete a total of 48 weeks of study \ntherapy. SVR12 was achieved by 74% of patients in this study (genotype 1a: 70%, genotype 1b: 79%). \n \nLong term efficacy data \nData are available from a completed follow-up study to assess durability of response for \napproximately 3 years after treatment with daclatasvir. Among 258 patients who achieved SVR12 with \ndaclatasvir and sofosbuvir (\u00b1 ribavirin) with a median duration of post-SVR12 follow-up of \n38 months, no relapses occurred (with relapses defined as confirmed or last available HCV RNA \u2265 \nLLOQ). Among 302 patients who achieved SVR12 with daclatasvir + pegIFN/RBV with a median \nduration of post-SVR12 follow-up of 44 months, 2% (n=6) of patients relapsed.  \n \nResistance in clinical studies \nFrequency of baseline NS5A resistance-associated variants (RAVs) \nBaseline NS5A RAVs were frequently observed in clinical studies of daclatasvir. In 9 phase 2/3 \nstudies with daclatasvir in combination with peginterferon alfa + ribavirin or in combination with \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n28 \n\nsofosbuvir +/- ribavirin, the following frequencies of such RAVs were seen at baseline: 7% in \ngenotype 1a infection (M28T, Q30, L31, and/or Y93), 11% in genotype 1b infection (L31 and/or \nY93H), 51% in genotype 2 infection (L31M), 8% in genotype 3 infection (Y93H) and 64% in \ngenotype 4 infection (L28 and/or L30). \n \nDaclatasvir in combination with sofosbuvir \nImpact of baseline NS5A RAVs on cure rates \nThe baseline NS5A RAVs described above had no major impact on cure rates in patients treated with \nsofosbuvir + daclatasvir +/- ribavirin, with the exception of the Y93H RAV in genotype 3 infection \n(seen in 16/192 [8%] of patients). The SVR12 rate in genotype-3 infected patients with this RAV is \nreduced (in practice as relapse after end of treatment response), especially in patients with cirrhosis. \nThe overall cure rate for genotype-3 infected patients who were treated for 12 weeks with sofosbuvir + \ndaclatasvir (without ribavirin) in the presence and absence of the Y93H RAV was 7/13 (54%) and \n134/145 (92%), respectively. There was no Y93H RAV present at baseline for genotype-3 infected \npatients treated for 12-weeks with sofosbuvir + daclatasvir + ribavirin, and thus SVR outcomes cannot \nbe assessed. \n \nEmerging resistance \nIn a pooled analysis of 629 patients who received daclatasvir and sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin \nin Phase 2 and 3 studies for 12 or 24 weeks, 34 patients qualified for resistance analysis due to \nvirologic failure or early study discontinuation and having HCV RNA greater than 1,000 IU/ml. \nObserved emergent NS5A resistance-associated variants are reported in Table 15. \n \nTable 15: Summary of noted newly emergent HCV NS5A substitutions on treatment or \n\nduring follow-up in treated non-SVR12 subjects infected with HCV genotypes 1 \nthrough 3 \n\nCategory/ Substitution, n (%) \nGenotype 1a Genotype 1b Genotype 2 Genotype 3 \n\nN=301 N=79 N=44 N=197 \nNon-responders (non-SVR12) 14* 1 2* 21** \n\nwith baseline and post-\nbaseline sequence \n\n12 1 1 20 \n\nwith emergent NS5A \nRAVs*** \n\n10 (83%) 1 (100%) 0 16 (80%) \n\nM28: T 2 (17%)  -- -- 0 \n\nQ30: H, K, R 9 (75%) -- -- -- \n\nL31: I, M, V  2 (17%) 0 0 1 (5%) \n\nP32-deletion 0 1 (100%) 0 0 \n\nH58: D, P 2 (17%) -- -- -- \n\nS62: L -- -- -- 2 (10%) \n\nY93: C, H, N  2 (17%) 0 0 11 (55%) \n* Patient(s) lost to follow-up \n** One patient considered a protocol failure (non-SVR) achieved SVR \n*** NS5A RAVs monitored at amino acid positions are 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 58, 62, 92, and 93 \n \nThe sofosbuvir resistance-associated substitution S282T emerged in only 1 non-SVR12 patient \ninfected with genotype 3. \nEmergent daclatasvir resistance-associated substitutions have been shown to persist for 3 years post-\ntreatment and beyond for patients treated with daclatasvir-based regimens. \n \nDaclatasvir in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin \nBaseline NS5A RAVs (at M28T, Q30, L31, and Y93 for genotype 1a; at L31 and Y93 for \ngenotype 1b) increase the risk for non-response in treatment-naive patients infected with genotype 1a \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n29 \n\nand genotype 1b infection. The impact of baseline NS5A RAVs on cure rates of genotype 4 infection \nis not apparent. \n \nIn case of non-response to therapy with daclatasvir + peginterferon alfa + ribavirin, NS5A RAVs \ngenerally emerged at failure (139/153 genotype 1a and 49/57 genotype 1b). The most frequently \ndetected NS5A RAVs included Q30E or Q30R in combination with L31M. The majority of \ngenotype 1a failures had emergent NS5A variants detected at Q30 (127/139 [91%]), and the majority \nof genotype 1b failures had emergent NS5A variants detected at L31 (37/49 [76%]) and/or Y93H \n(34/49 [69%]). In limited numbers of genotype 4-infected patients with non-response, substitutions \nL28M and L30H/S were detected at failure. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \ndaclatasvir in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C \n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of daclatasvir were evaluated in healthy adult subjects and in patients \nwith chronic HCV. Following multiple oral doses of daclatasvir 60 mg once daily in combination with \npeginterferon alfa and ribavirin in treatment-na\u00efve patients with genotype 1 chronic HCV, the \ngeometric mean (CV%) daclatasvir Cmax was 1534 (58) ng/ml, AUC0-24h was 14122 (70) ng\u2022h/ml, and \nCmin was 232 (83) ng/ml. \n \nAbsorption \nDaclatasvir administered as a tablet was readily absorbed following multiple oral doses with peak \nplasma concentrations occurring between 1 and 2 hours. \nDaclatasvir Cmax, AUC, and Cmin increased in a near dose-proportional manner. Steady state was \nachieved after 4 days of once-daily administration. At the 60 mg dose, exposure to daclatasvir was \nsimilar between healthy subjects and HCV-infected patients. \nIn vitro and in vivo studies showed that daclatasvir is a substrate of P-gp. The absolute bioavailability \nof the tablet formulation is 67%. \n \nEffect of food on oral absorption \nIn healthy subjects, administration of daclatasvir 60 mg tablet after a high-fat meal decreased \ndaclatasvir Cmax and AUC by 28% and 23%, respectively, compared with administration under fasting \nconditions. Administration of daclatasvir 60 mg tablet after a light meal resulted in no reduction in \ndaclatasvir exposure.  \n \nDistribution \nAt steady state, protein binding of daclatasvir in HCV-infected patients was approximately 99% and \nindependent of dose at the dose range studied (1 mg to 100 mg). In patients who received daclatasvir \n60 mg tablet orally followed by 100 \u03bcg [13C,15N]-daclatasvir intravenous dose, estimated volume of \ndistribution at steady state was 47 l. In vitro studies indicate that daclatasvir is actively and passively \ntransported into hepatocytes. The active transport is mediated by OCT1 and other unidentified uptake \ntransporters, but not by organic anion transporter (OAT) 2, sodium-taurocholate cotransporting \npolypeptide (NTCP), or OATPs. \n \nDaclatasvir is an inhibitor of P-gp, OATP 1B1 and BCRP. In vitro daclatasvir is an inhibitor of renal \nuptake transporters, OAT1 and 3, and OCT2, but is not expected to have a clinical effect on the \npharmacokinetics of substrates of these transporters. \n \nBiotransformation \nIn vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that daclatasvir is a substrate of CYP3A, with CYP3A4 being \nthe major CYP isoform responsible for the metabolism. No metabolites circulated at levels more than \n5% of the parent concentration. Daclatasvir in vitro did not inhibit (IC50 >40 \u00b5M) CYP enzymes 1A2, \n2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, or 2D6.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n30 \n\n \nElimination \nFollowing single-dose oral administration of 14C\u2013daclatasvir in healthy subjects, 88% of total \nradioactivity was recovered in feces (53% as unchanged drug) and 6.6% was excreted in the urine \n(primarily as unchanged drug). These data indicate that the liver is the major clearance organ for \ndaclatasvir in humans. In vitro studies indicate that daclatasvir is actively and passively transported \ninto hepatocytes. The active transport is mediated by OCT1 and other unidentified uptake transporters. \nFollowing multiple-dose administration of daclatasvir in HCV-infected patients, the terminal \nelimination half-life of daclatasvir ranged from 12 to 15 hours. In patients who received daclatasvir \n60 mg tablet orally followed by 100 \u03bcg [13C,15N]-daclatasvir intravenous dose, the total clearance was \n4.24 l/h. \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of daclatasvir following a single 60 mg oral dose were studied in non-HCV \ninfected subjects with renal impairment. Daclatasvir unbound AUC was estimated to be 18%, 39% and \n51% higher for subjects with creatinine clearance (CLcr) values of 60, 30 and 15 ml/min, respectively, \nrelative to subjects with normal renal function. Subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring \nhaemodialysis had a 27% increase in daclatasvir AUC and a 20% increase in unbound AUC compared \nto subjects with normal renal function (see section 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of daclatasvir following a single 30 mg oral dose were studied in non-HCV \ninfected subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-Pugh B), and severe (Child-Pugh C) \nhepatic impairment compared with unimpaired subjects. The Cmax and AUC of total daclatasvir (free \nand protein-bound drug) were lower in subjects with hepatic impairment; however, hepatic \nimpairment did not have a clinically significant effect on the free drug concentrations of daclatasvir \n(see section 4.2). \n \nElderly \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of data from clinical studies indicated that age had no apparent \neffect on the pharmacokinetics of daclatasvir. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of daclatasvir in paediatric patients have not been evaluated. \n \nGender \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis identified gender as a statistically significant covariate on \ndaclatasvir apparent oral clearance (CL/F) with female subjects having slightly lower CL/F, but the \nmagnitude of the effect on daclatasvir exposure is not clinically important.  \n \nRace \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of data from clinical studies identified race (categories \u201cother\u201d \n[patients who are not white, black or Asian] and \u201cblack\u201d) as a statistically significant covariate on \ndaclatasvir apparent oral clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (Vc/F) resulting in \nslightly higher exposures compared to white patients, but the magnitude of the effect on daclatasvir \nexposure is not clinically important. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nToxicology \nIn repeat-dose toxicology studies in animals, hepatic effects (Kupffer-cell hypertrophy/ hyperplasia, \nmononuclear cell infiltrates and bile duct hyperplasia) and adrenal gland effects (changes in \ncytoplasmic vacuolation and adrenal cortical hypertrophy/hyperplasia) were observed at exposures \nsimilar or slightly higher than the clinical AUC exposure. In dogs, bone marrow hypocellularity with \ncorrelating clinical pathology changes were observed at exposures 9-fold the clinical AUC exposure. \nNone of these effects have been observed in humans. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n31 \n\n \nCarcinogenesis and mutagenesis \nDaclatasvir was not carcinogenic in mice or in rats at exposures 8-fold or 4-fold, respectively, the \nclinical AUC exposure. No evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic activity was observed in in vitro \nmutagenesis (Ames) tests, mammalian mutation assays in Chinese hamster ovary cells, or in an in vivo \noral micronucleus study in rats.  \n \nFertility \nDaclatasvir had no effects on fertility in female rats at any dose tested. The highest AUC value in \nunaffected females was 18-fold the clinical AUC exposure. In male rats, effects on reproductive \nendpoints were limited to reduced prostate/seminal vesicle weights, and minimally increased \ndysmorphic sperm at 200 mg/kg/day; however, neither finding adversely affected fertility or the \nnumber of viable conceptuses sired. The AUC associated with this dose in males is 19-fold the clinical \nAUC exposure. \n \nEmbryo-foetal development \nDaclatasvir is embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats and rabbits at exposures at or above 4-fold (rat) and \n16-fold (rabbit) the clinical AUC exposure. Developmental toxicity consisted of increased \nembryofoetal lethality, reduced foetal body weights and increased incidence of foetal malformations \nand variations. In rats, malformations mainly affected the brain, skull, eyes, ears, nose, lip, palate or \nlimbs and in rabbits, the ribs and cardiovascular area. Maternal toxicity including mortality, abortions, \nadverse clinical signs, decreases in body weight and food consumption was noted in both species at \nexposures 25-fold (rat) and 72-fold (rabbit) the clinical AUC exposure. \n \nIn a study of pre- and postnatal development in rats, there was neither maternal nor developmental \ntoxicity at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day, associated with AUC values 2-fold the clinical AUC exposure. \nAt the highest dose (100 mg/kg/day), maternal toxicity included mortality and dystocia; \ndevelopmental toxicity included slight reductions in offspring viability in the peri- and neonatal \nperiods; and reductions in birth weight that persisted into adulthood. The AUC value associated with \nthis dose is 4-fold the clinical AUC exposure. \n \nExcretion into milk \nDaclatasvir was excreted into the milk of lactating rats with concentrations 1.7- to 2-fold maternal \nplasma levels.  \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again.  \n\uf0a7 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\uf0a7 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\uf0a7 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

What Daklinza is and what it is used for \n \nDaklinza contains the active ingredient daclatasvir. It is used to treat adults with hepatitis C, an \ninfectious disease that affects the liver, caused by the hepatitis C virus. \n \nThis medicine works by stopping the hepatitis C virus from multiplying and infecting new cells. This \nlowers the amount of hepatitis C virus in your body and removes the virus from your blood over a \nperiod of time. \n \nDaklinza must always be used together with other medicines against hepatitis C infection and must \nnever be used by itself.  \n \nIt is very important that you also read the package leaflets for the other medicines that you will be \ntaking with Daklinza. If you have any questions about your medicines, please ask your doctor or \npharmacist. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Daklinza \n \nDo not take Daklinza \n\uf0a7 if you are allergic to daclatasvir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6 \n\nof this leaflet) \n\uf0a7 if you are taking (by mouth or other ways that affect the whole body) any of the following \n\nmedicines \n- phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine or phenobarbital, used to treat epileptic seizures \n- rifampicin, rifabutin or rifapentine, antibiotics used to treat tuberculosis \n- dexamethasone, a steroid used to treat allergic and inflammatory diseases \n- medicines containing St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum, a herbal preparation). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n47 \n\nThese medicines lower the effect of Daklinza and may result in your treatment not working. If \nyou take any of these medicines, tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \nSince Daklinza must always be used in combination with other medicines against hepatitis C infection, \nplease make sure that you read the \"Do not take\" section of the package leaflets for these medicines. If \nyou are unsure of any information in the package leaflets, please contact your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Daklinza. \n \nTell your doctor if any of the following applies: \n\uf0a7 you currently take, or have taken in the last few months, the medicine amiodarone to treat \n\nirregular heartbeats (your doctor may consider alternative treatments if you have taken this \nmedicine) \n\n\uf0a7 you have a current or previous infection with the hepatitis B virus, since your doctor may want to \nmonitor you more closely \n\n\uf0a7 your liver is damaged and not functioning properly (decompensated liver disease) \n\uf0a7 you have diabetes. You may need closer monitoring of your blood glucose levels and/or \n\nadjustment of your diabetes medication after starting Daklinza. Some diabetic patients have \nexperienced low sugar levels in the blood (hypoglycaemia) after starting treatment with medicines \nlike Daklinza. \n\n \nTell your doctor immediately if you are taking any medicines for heart problems and during treatment \nyou experience: \n\uf0a7 Shortness of breath \n\uf0a7 Light-headedness \n\uf0a7 Palpitations \n\uf0a7 Fainting \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDaklinza is not recommended for patients below 18 years of age. Daklinza has not yet been studied in \nchildren and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and Daklinza \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This is because Daklinza may affect the way some medicines work. In addition some \nmedicines may affect the way Daklinza works. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of Daklinza or \nyou may not be able to take Daklinza with certain medicines.  \n \nDo not take Daklinza if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n\uf0a7 phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine or phenobarbital, used to treat epileptic seizures \n\uf0a7 rifampicin, rifabutin or rifapentine, antibiotics used to treat tuberculosis \n\uf0a7 dexamethasone, a steroid used to treat allergic and inflammatory diseases \n\uf0a7 medicines containing St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum, a herbal preparation). \nThese medicines lower the effect of Daklinza so your treatment will not work. If you take any of these \nmedicines, tell your doctor immediately. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you take any of the following medicines: \n\uf0a7 amiodarone or digoxin, used to treat irregular heart beats \n\uf0a7 atazanavir/ritonavir, atazanavir/cobicistat, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil \n\nfumarate combination tablet, etravirine, nevirapine or efavirenz, used to treat HIV infection \n\uf0a7 boceprevir or telaprevir, used to treat hepatitis C infection \n\uf0a7 clarithromycin, telithromycin or erythromycin, used to treat bacterial infections \n\uf0a7 warfarin and other similar medicines called vitamin K antagonists used to thin the blood.

Ribavirin can harm your unborn baby. It is \ntherefore very important that you (or your partner) do not become pregnant during this treatment. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether Daklinza passes into human breast milk. You should not breastfeed during \ntreatment with Daklinza. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome patients have reported dizziness, difficulty concentrating, and vision problems while taking \nDaklinza with other medicines for their hepatitis C infection.

Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nRecommended dose \nThe recommended dose of Daklinza is 60 mg once a day. Swallow the tablet whole. Do not chew or \ncrush the tablet as it has a very unpleasant taste. Daklinza can be taken with or without a meal. \n \nSome other medicines can interact with Daklinza, affecting the levels of Daklinza in your body. If you \nare taking any of these medicines, your doctor may decide to change your daily dose of Daklinza to \nensure that the treatment is safe and effective for you. \n \nSince Daklinza must always be used with other medicines against hepatitis C infection, please read the \npackage leaflets for these medicines. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nHow long to take Daklinza \nMake sure you take Daklinza for as long as your doctor has told you to take it. \n \nThe duration of your treatment with Daklinza will be either 12 or 24 weeks. The duration of your \ntreatment will depend on whether you have previously received treatment for your hepatitis C \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n49 \n\ninfection, the condition of your liver, and what other medicines you will take with Daklinza.

Do not stop taking Daklinza unless your \ndoctor told you to stop. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
