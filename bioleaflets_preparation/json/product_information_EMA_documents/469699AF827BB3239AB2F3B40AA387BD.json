This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section \n4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nINCRELEX 10 mg/ml solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml contains 10 mg of mecasermin*. \nEach vial of 4 ml contains 40 mg of mecasermin*. \n*Mecasermin is a recombinant DNA-derived human insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) produced in \nEscherichia coli. \n \nExcipient with known effect: \n\nOne ml contains 9 mg of benzyl alcohol. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection). \n \nAqueous, clear and colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nFor the long-term treatment of growth failure in children and adolescents from 2 to 18 years with confirmed \nsevere primary insulin-like growth factor-1 deficiency (Primary IGFD). \n \nSevere Primary IGFD is defined by: \n\n• height standard deviation score ≤ –3.0 and \n• basal IGF-1 levels below the 2.5th percentile for age and gender and \n• GH sufficiency. \n• Exclusion of secondary forms of IGF-1 deficiency, such as malnutrition, hypopituitarism, \nhypothyroidism, or chronic treatment with pharmacologic doses of anti-inflammatory steroids. \n\n \nSevere Primary IGFD includes patients with mutations in the GH receptor (GHR), post-GHR signaling \npathway, and IGF-1 gene defects; they are not GH deficient, and therefore, they cannot be expected to \nrespond adequately to exogenous GH treatment. In some cases, when deemed necessary, the physician may \ndecide to assist in the diagnosis by performing an IGF-I generation test. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with mecasermin should be directed by physicians who are experienced in the diagnosis and \nmanagement of patients with growth disorders. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPosology \nThe dose should be individualised for each patient. The recommended starting dose of mecasermin is \n0.04 mg/kg of body weight twice daily by subcutaneous injection. If no significant adverse reactions occur \nfor at least one week, the dose may be raised in increments of 0.04 mg/kg to the maximum dose of \n0.12 mg/kg given twice daily. Doses greater than 0.12 mg/kg twice daily should not be exceeded as this may \nincrease the risk of neoplasia (see section 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8).  \n \nIf the recommended dose is not tolerated by the patient, treatment with a lower dose can be considered. \nTreatment success should be evaluated based on height velocities. The lowest dose that was associated with \nsubstantial growth increases on an individual basis was 0.04 mg/kg twice daily (BID). \n\nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of mecasermin in children below age of 2 have not been established (see section 5.1). \nNo data are available. \nTherefore, this medicinal product is not recommended in children below age of 2. \n \nSpecial Populations \nHepatic impairment \nThere are limited data concerning the pharmacokinetics of mecasermin in children with hepatic impairment, in \nthis specific population of severe primary IGFD patients. It is recommended that the dose be individualised for \neach patient as described under posology \n \nRenal impairment \nThere are limited data concerning the pharmacokinetics of mecasermin in children with renal impairment, in this \nspecific population of severe primary IGFD patients. It is recommended that the dose be individualised for each \npatient as described under posology \n \nMethod of administration \nINCRELEX should be administered by subcutaneous injection shortly before or after a meal or snack. If \nhypoglycaemia occurs with recommended doses, despite adequate food intake, the dose should be reduced. If \nthe patient is unable to eat, for any reason, this medicinal product should be withheld. The dose of \nmecasermin should never be increased to make up for one or more omitted doses. \n \nInjection sites should be rotated to a different site with each injection. \n \nINCRELEX should not be administered intravenously. \n \nPrecaution to be taken before manipulating or administering the medicinal product \nThe solution should be clear immediately after removal from the refrigerator. If the solution is cloudy, or \ncontains particulate matter, it must not be injected. \n \nINCRELEX should be administered using sterile disposable syringes and injection needles. The syringes \nshould be of small enough volume that the prescribed dose can be withdrawn from the vial with reasonable \naccuracy. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nINCRELEX is contraindicated in children and adolescents with active or suspected neoplasia, or any \ncondition or medical history which increases the risk of benign or malignant neoplasia.  \nTherapy should be discontinued if evidence of neoplasia develops. \n \nAs INCRELEX contains benzyl alcohol, it must not be given to premature babies or neonates. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n \nBenign and malignant neoplasms \n \nThere is an increased risk of benign and malignant neoplasia in children and adolescents treated with \nINCRELEX, since IGF-1 plays a role in the initiation and progression of benign and malignant tumours. \n \nThere have been post-marketing reports of both benign and malignant neoplasms in children and adolescents \nwho have received treatment with INCRELEX.  These cases represented a variety of different malignancies \nand included rare malignancies usually not seen in children (see section 4.8). The increased risk of neoplasia \nmay be higher in patients who receive INCRELEX for unapproved uses or at higher than recommended \ndoses.  Current knowledge of IGF-1 biology suggests that IGF-1 plays a role in malignancies in all organs \nand tissues. Physicians should therefore be vigilant of any symptoms of potential malignancy.  \nIf benign or malignant neoplasia develops, INCRELEX treatment should be discontinued definitely and \nappropriate expert medical care sought.  \n \n \n \n \n \nMecasermin is not a substitute for GH treatment. \n  \nMecasermin should not be used for growth promotion in patients with closed epiphyses. \n \nMecasermin should be administered shortly before or after a meal or snack, because it may have insulin-like \nhypoglycaemic effects. Special attention should be paid to young children, children with a history of \nhypoglycaemia and children with inconsistent food intake. Patients should avoid engaging in any high-risk \nactivities within 2-3 hours after dosing, particularly at the initiation of mecasermin treatment, until a well-\ntolerated dose of INCRELEX has been established. If a person with severe hypoglycemia is unconscious or \notherwise unable to ingest food normally, an injection of glucagon may be required. Persons with a history of \nsevere hypoglycemia should have glucagon available. At the time of initial prescription, physicians should \neducate parents on the signs, symptoms and treatment of hypoglycaemia, including injection of glucagon. \n \nDoses of insulin and/or other hypoglycaemic medicinal products may need to be reduced for diabetic \nsubjects using this medicinal product. \n \nEchocardiogram is recommended before initiation of mecasermin treatment in all patients. Patients who \nterminate treatment should also have an echocardiogram. Patients with abnormal echocardiogram findings or \ncardiovascular symptoms should be followed regularly with echocardiogram procedures. \n \nLymphoid tissue (e.g., tonsillar) hypertrophy associated with complications, such as snoring, sleep apnoea, \nand chronic middle-ear effusions have been reported with the use of this medicinal product. Patients should \nhave examinations periodically and at the occurrence of clinical symptoms to rule out such potential \ncomplications or to initiate appropriate treatment. \n \nIntracranial hypertension (IH) with papilloedema, visual changes, headache, nausea and/or vomiting has \nbeen reported in patients treated with mecasermin, as has been reported with therapeutic GH administration. \nIH-associated signs and symptoms resolved after interruption of dosing. Funduscopic examination is \nrecommended at the initiation, periodically during the course of mecasermin therapy and at the occurrence of \nclinical symptoms. \n \nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis (with the potential to lead to avascular necrosis) and progression of \nscoliosis can occur in patients who experience rapid growth. These conditions and other symptoms and signs \nknown to be associated with GH treatment in general should be monitored during mecasermin treatment. \nAny patient with the onset of a limp or complaint of hip or knee pain should be evaluated. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nIn post-marketing experience in patients treated with INCRELEX, cases of hypersensitivity, urticaria, \npruritus and erythema have been reported. These have been observed both as being systemic and/or local to \nthe injection site. A small number of cases indicative of anaphylaxis requiring hospitalisation have been \nreported. Parents and patients should be informed that such reactions are possible and that if a systemic \nallergic reaction occurs, treatment should be interrupted and prompt medical attention should be sought. \n \nTreatment should be reconsidered if after a year patients remain non-responsive. \n \nPersons who have allergic reactions to injected IGF-1, who have unexpectedly high blood values of IGF-1 \nafter injection, or who fail to show a growth response without any identified cause may be having an \nantibody response to injected IGF-1. This may be through the production of anti-IGF-1 IgEs, sustaining \nantibodies or neutralizing antibodies respectively. In such instances, instructions for antibody testing should \nbe considered. \n \nExcipients \nINCRELEX contains 9 mg/ml benzyl alcohol as a preservative.  \n \nBenzyl alcohol may cause toxic reactions and anaphylactoid reactions in infants and children up to 3 years \nold. \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \nDoses of insulin and/or other hypoglycaemic medicinal products may need to be reduced (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females \nA negative pregnancy test is recommended for all women of child bearing potential prior to treatment with \nmecasermin. It is also recommended that all women of childbearing potential use adequate contraception \nduring treatment. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no or limited amount of data for the use of mecasermin in pregnant women. \n \nAnimal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for \nhumans is unknown. \n \nThis medicinal product should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \nBreast-feeding while taking INCRELEX is not recommended, because there is insufficient information on \nthe excretion of mecasermin in human milk. \n \nFertility \nMecasermin has been tested in a rat teratology study with no effects on fœtus up to 16 mg/kg (20 fold the \nmaximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area) and in a rabbit teratology with \nno effects on foetus at dose of 0.5 mg/kg (2 fold the MRHD based on body surface area). Mecasermin has no \neffects on fertility in rats using intravenous doses 0.25, 1, and 4 mg/day (up to 4 times the clinical exposure \nwith the MRHD based on AUC). \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nThe effects of mecasermin on the unborn child have not been studied. Therefore there is insufficient medical \ninformation to determine whether there are significant risks to a foetus. Studies have not been conducted \nwith mecasermin in breast-feeding mothers. INCRELEX should not be given to pregnant or nursing women. \nA negative pregnancy test and adequate contraception is required in all pre-menopausal women receiving \nINCRELEX. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nINCRELEX may have a major influence on the ability to drive or use machines in case of a hypoglycaemic \nepisode. Hypoglycaemia is a very common adverse reaction. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nAdverse reaction data was taken from a total of 413 clinical trial patients with severe Primary IGFD. Data \nwas also collected from post-marketing sources. \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions from the clinical trials were headache (44%), hypoglycaemia \n(28%), vomiting (26%), injection site hypertrophy (17%), and otitis media (17%).  \n \nIntracranial hypertension/increased intracranial pressure occurred in 4 (0.96%) of patients from the clinical \ntrials and occurred in 7 – 9 year old treatment naïve subjects. \n \nDuring clinical trials in other indications totaling approximately 300 patients, reports of local and/or systemic \nhypersensitivity were received for 8% of patients. There were also reports of systemic hypersensitivity from \npost-marketing use, of which some cases were indicative of anaphylaxis. Post-marketing reports of local \nallergic reactions were also received.  \n \nSome patients may develop antibodies to mecasermin. No attenuation of growth was observed as a \nconsequence of the development of antibodies. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nTable 1 contains very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) and uncommon (≥ 1/1000, < 1/100) \nadverse reactions which occurred in clinical trials. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness. Other adverse reactions have been identified during post \napproval use of INCRELEX. As these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, \nit is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency (not known). \n\nTable 1:  Adverse reactions \n\nSystem Organ Class \nReactions observed in the \nclinical trials \n\nReactions observed from the \npost-marketing environment \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nCommon: Thymus hypertrophy  \n \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders  Not known: Systemic \nhypersensitivity (anaphylaxis, \ngeneralized urticaria, angioedema, \ndyspnoea), local allergic reactions \nat the injection site (pruritus, \nurticaria) \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nVery common: Hypoglycaemia \nCommon: Hypoglycaemic \nseizure, hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nPsychiatric disorders Uncommon: Depression, \nnervousness \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders Very common: Headache  \n\n\n\n7 \n\nCommon: Convulsions, dizziness, \ntremor \nUncommon: Benign intracranial \nhypertension \n\nEye disorders Common:  Papilloedema  \nEar and labyrinth disorders Very common: Otitis media \n\nCommon:  Hypoacusis, ear pain, \nmiddle ear effusion \n\n \n\nCardiac disorders Common:  Cardiac murmur, \ntachycardia \nUncommon: Cardiomegaly, \nventricular hypertrophy, mitral \nvalve incompetence, tricuspid \nvalve incompetence \n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nCommon: Sleep apnoea \nsyndrome, adenoidal hypertrophy, \ntonsillar hypertrophy, snoring \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common: Vomiting, upper \nabdominal pain \nCommon: Abdominal pain \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nCommon: Skin hypertrophy, \nabnormal hair texture \n\nNot known: alopecia \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nVery common: Arthralgia, pain in \nextremity \nCommon: Scoliosis, myalgia \n\n \n\nNeoplasms benign, malignant \nand unspecified (incl cysts and \npolyps) \n\nCommon: Melanocytic naevus \n \n \n\nNot known: Benign and malignant \nneoplasms \n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders \n\nCommon: Gynaecomastia  \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nVery common: Injection site \nhypertrophy, injection site \nbruising \nCommon: Injection site pain, \ninjection site reaction, injection \nsite haematoma, injection site \nerythema, injection site \ninduration, injection site \nhaemorrhage, injection site \nirritation \nUncommon: Injection site rash, \ninjection site swelling, \nlipohypertrophy \n\n \n\nInvestigations Uncommon: Increased weight   \nSurgical and medical \nprocedures \n\nCommon: Ear tube insertion  \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nNeoplasms \nThere have been post-marketing reports of benign and malignant neoplasms in children and adolescents who \nhave received treatment with INCRELEX.

All cases were mild or moderate in severity and none was \nserious.  \nPost-marketing reports \nSystemic hypersensitivity included symptoms such as anaphylaxis, generalized urticaria, angioedema and \ndyspnoea. The symptoms in the cases indicative of anaphylaxis included hives, angioedema and dyspnoea. \nSome patients required hospitalization. Upon re-administration, symptoms did not re-occur in all patients. \nThere were also reports of local allergic reactions at the injection site. Typically these were pruritus and \nurticaria. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nOf the 115 (28%) subjects who experienced one or more episode of hypoglycaemia, 6 subjects experienced a \nhypoglycaemic seizure on one or more occasion. Symptomatic hypoglycaemia was generally avoided when a \nmeal or snack was consumed either shortly before or after the administration of INCRELEX. \n \nInjection site hypertrophy \nThis reaction occurred in 71 (17%) subjects from the clinical trials and was generally associated with lack of \nproper rotation of injections. When injections were properly dispersed, the condition resolved. \n \nTonsillar hypertrophy \nThis was noted in 38 (9%) subjects, particularly in the first 1 to 2 years of therapy with lesser tonsillar \ngrowth in subsequent years. \n \nSnoring \nThis occurred generally in the first year of treatment and was reported in 30 subjects (7%). \n \nIntracranial hypertension/increased intracranial pressure \nThis occurred in 4 subjects (0.96%); in two subjects INCRELEX was discontinued and not restarted; in two \nsubjects the event did not recur after restarting INCRELEX at a reduced dose. All 4 subjects recovered from \nthe event without sequelae.   \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAcute overdose could lead to hypoglycaemia. Treatment of acute overdose of mecasermin should be directed \nat alleviating any hypoglycaemic effects. Oral glucose or food should be consumed. If the overdose results in \nloss of consciousness, intravenous glucose or parenteral glucagon may be required to reverse the \nhypoglycaemic effects. \n \nLong-term overdose may result in signs and symptoms of acromegaly or gigantism.  Overdosing may lead to \nsupraphysiological IGF-1 levels and may increase the risk of benign and malignant neoplasm. \n \nIn case of an acute or a chronic overdose, Increlex must be discontinued immediately. If Increlex is restarted, \nthe dose should not exceed the recommended daily dosage (see section 4.2) \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Pituitary and hypothalamic hormones and analogues, somatropin and \nsomatropin agonists, ATC code: H01AC03 \n \nMecasermin is a human insulin-like growth factor-1 (rhIGF-1) produced by recombinant DNA technology. \nIGF-1 consists of 70 amino acids in a single chain with three intramolecular disulfide bridges and a \nmolecular weight of 7649 daltons. The amino acid sequence of the product is identical to that of endogenous \nhuman IGF-1. The rhIGF-1 protein is synthesised in bacteria (E. coli) that have been modified by the \naddition of the gene for human IGF-1.  \n \nMechanism of action \nInsulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is the principal hormonal mediator of statural growth. Under normal \ncircumstances, growth hormone (GH) binds to its receptor in the liver and other tissues and stimulates the \nsynthesis/secretion of IGF-1. In target tissues the Type 1 IGF-1 receptor, which is homologous to the insulin \nreceptor, is activated by IGF-1, leading to intracellular signalling which stimulates multiple processes \nleading to statural growth. The metabolic actions of IGF-1 are in part directed at stimulating the uptake of \nglucose, fatty acids, and amino acids so that metabolism supports growing tissues. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nThe following actions have been demonstrated for endogenous human IGF-1: \n \nTissue Growth \nSkeletal growth is accomplished at the epiphyseal plates at the ends of a growing bone. Growth and \nmetabolism of epiphyseal plate cells are directly stimulated by GH and IGF-1. \nOrgan growth: treatment of IGF-1 deficient rats with rhIGF-1 results in whole body and organ growth. \nCell growth: IGF-1 receptors are present on most types of cells and tissues. IGF-1 has mitogenic activity that \nleads to an increased number of cells in the body. \n \nCarbohydrate Metabolism \nIGF-1 suppresses hepatic glucose production, stimulates peripheral glucose utilization, and can reduce blood \nglucose and cause hypoglycaemia. \nIGF-1 has inhibitory effects on insulin secretion. \n \nBone/Mineral Metabolism \nCirculating IGF-1 plays an important role in the acquisition and maintenance of bone mass. IGF-1 increases \nbone density. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nFive clinical studies (4 open-label and 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled) were conducted with INCRELEX. \nSubcutaneous doses of mecasermin, generally ranging from 60 to 120 µg/kg given twice daily (BID), were \nadministered to 92 paediatric subjects with severe Primary IGFD. Patients were enrolled in the studies on the \nbasis of extreme short stature, slow growth rates, low IGF-1 serum concentrations and normal GH secretion. \nEighty-three (83) out of 92 patients were naïve to INCRELEX at baseline and 81 completed at least one year \nof INCRELEX treatment. Baseline characteristics for the 81 patients evaluated in the primary and secondary \nefficacy analyses from the combined studies were (mean ± SD): chronological age (years): 6.8 ± 3.8; age \nrange (years): 1.7 to 17.5; height (cm): 84.1 ± 15.8; height standard deviation score (SDS): -6.9 ± 1.8; height \nvelocity (cm/yr): 2.6 ± 1.7; height velocity SDS: -3.4 ± 1.6; IGF-1 (ng/ml): 24.5 ± 27.9; IGF-1 \nSDS: -4.2 ± 2.0; and bone age (years): 3.8 ± 2.8. Of these, 72 (89%) had Laron syndrome-like phenotype; 7 \n(9%) had GH gene deletion, 1 (1%) had neutralizing antibodies to GH and 1 (1%) had isolated genetic GH \ndeficiency. Forty-six (57%) of the subjects were male; 66 (81%) were Caucasian. Seventy-four (91%) of the \nsubjects were prepubertal at baseline. \n \nAnnual results for height velocity, height velocity SDS, and height SDS until year 8 are shown in Table 2. \nPre-treatment height velocity data were available for 75 subjects. The height velocities at a given year of \ntreatment were compared by paired t-tests to the pre-treatment height velocities of the same subjects \ncompleting that treatment year. The height velocities for years 2 through 8 remained statistically greater than \nbaseline. For the 21 treatment naïve subjects with near-adult height, the mean (± SD) of the difference \n\n\n\n10 \n\nbetween observed increase in height versus that expected from Laron was approximately 13 cm (± 8 cm) \nafter an average of 11 years of treatment. \n\nTable 2:  Annual Height Results by Number of Years Treated with INCRELEX \n\n Pre-Tx Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Year 6 Year 7 Year 8 \nHeight Velocity \n\n(cm/yr) \n         \n\nN 75 75 63 62 60 53 39 25 19 \nMean (SD) 2.6 (1.7) 8.0 \n\n(2.3) \n5.9 \n\n(1.7) \n5.5 \n\n(1.8) \n5.2 \n\n(1.5) \n4.9 \n\n(1.5) \n4.8 \n\n(1.4) \n4.3 \n\n(1.5) \n4.4 \n\n(1.5) \nMean (SD) for \n\nchange from pre-Tx \n +5.4 \n\n(2.6) \n+3.2 \n(2.6) \n\n+2.8 \n(2.4) \n\n+2.5 \n(2.5) \n\n+2.1 \n(2.1) \n\n+1.9 \n(2.1) \n\n+1.4 \n(2.2) \n\n+1.3  \n(2. 8) \n\nP-value for change \nfrom pre-Tx [1] \n\n <0.0001 <0.0001 <0.0001 <0.0001 <0.0001 <0.0001 0.0042 0.0486 \n\nHeight Velocity SDS          \nN 75 75 62 62 58 50 37 22 15 \n\nMean (SD) -3.4 (1.6) 1.7 \n(2.8) \n\n-0.0 \n(1.7) \n\n-0.1 \n(1.9) \n\n-0.2 \n(1.9) \n\n-0.3 \n(1.7) \n\n-0. 2  \n(1. 6) \n\n-0. 5 \n(1.7) \n\n-0.2 \n(1.6) \n\nMean (SD) for \nchange from pre-Tx \nP-value for change \n\nfrom pre-Tx [1] \n\n +5.2 \n(2.9) \n\n<0.0001 \n\n+3.4 \n(2.4) \n\n<0.0001 \n\n+3.3  \n(2. 3) \n\n<0.0001 \n\n+3.2 \n(2.1) \n\n<0.0001 \n\n+3.2 \n(2.1) \n\n0.0001 \n\n+3.3 \n(2.0) \n\n<0.0001 \n\n+3.0 \n(2.1) \n\n<0.0001 \n\n+3.3 \n(2.7) \n\n0.0003 \n\nHeight SDS          \nN 81 81 67 66 64 57 41 26 19 \n\nMean (SD) -6.9 (1.8) -6.1 \n(1.8) \n\n-5.6 \n(1.7) \n\n-5.3 \n(1.7) \n\n-5.1 \n(1.7) \n\n-5.0 \n(1.7) \n\n-4.9 \n(1.6) \n\n-4.9 \n(1.7) \n\n-5.1 \n(1.7) \n\nMean (SD) for \nchange from pre-Tx \nP-value for change \n\nfrom pre-Tx [1] \n\n +0.8 \n(0.6) \n\n<0.0001 \n\n+1.2 \n(0.9) \n\n<0.0001 \n\n+1.4 \n(1.1) \n\n<0.0001 \n\n+1.6 \n(1.2) \n\n<0.0001 \n\n+1. 7 \n(1.3) \n\n<0.0001 \n\n+1. 8 \n(1.1) \n\n<0.0001 \n\n+1. 7 \n(1.0) \n\n0.0001 \n\n+1.7 \n(1.0) \n\n<0.0001 \n\nPre-Tx = Pre-treatment; SD = Standard Deviation; SDS = Standard Deviation Score \n[1] P-values for comparison versus pre-Tx values were computed using paired t-tests. \n\nFor subjects with bone age available for at least 6 years after treatment initiation, the mean increase in bone \nage was comparable to the mean increase in chronological age; for these subjects, there does not appear to be \nany clinically significant advance of bone age relative to chronological age. \n \nEfficacy is dose dependent. The dose of 120 μg/kg given subcutaneously (SC) and twice daily (BID) was \nassociated with the greatest growth responses. \n \nAmong all subjects included for safety evaluation (n=92), 83% of the subjects reported at least one adverse \nevent during the course of the studies. There was no death during the studies. No subject discontinued the \nstudies due to adverse events. \n \nHypoglycaemia was the most frequently reported adverse event and a proper attention has to be given to \nmeals in relation to dosing. \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under “exceptional circumstances”.  \n \nThis means that due to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on \nthis medicinal product.  \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \nThe European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every year \nand this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nThe absolute subcutaneous bioavailability of mecasermin in severe Primary IGFD subjects has not been \ndetermined. The bioavailability of mecasermin after subcutaneous administration in healthy subjects has \nbeen reported to be approximately 100%. \n \nDistribution \nIn blood, IGF-1 is bound to six IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs), with ~80% bound as a complex with \nIGFBP-3 and an acid-labile subunit. IGFBP-3 is reduced in subjects with severe Primary IGFD, resulting in \nincreased clearance of IGF-1 in these subjects relative to healthy subjects. The total IGF-1 volume of \ndistribution (mean ± SD) after subcutaneous administration of INCRELEX in 12 subjects with severe \nPrimary IGFD is estimated to be 0.257 (± 0.073) l/kg at a mecasermin dose of 0.045 mg/kg, and is estimated \nto increase as the dose of mecasermin increases. Limited information is available on the concentration of \nunbound IGF-1 after the administration of INCRELEX. \n \nBiotransformation \nBoth the liver and the kidney have been shown to metabolise IGF-1.   \n \nElimination \nThe mean terminal t1/2 of total IGF-1 after single subcutaneous administration of 0.12 mg/kg in three \npaediatric subjects with severe Primary IGFD is estimated to be 5.8 hours.  Clearance of total IGF-1 is \ninversely proportional to serum IGFBP-3 levels and total IGF-1 systemic clearance (CL/F) is estimated to be \n0.04 l/hr/kg at 3 mg/l IGFBP-3 in 12 subjects. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThe pharmacokinetics of INCRELEX have not been studied in subjects greater than 65 years of age. \n \nChildren \nThe pharmacokinetics of INCRELEX have not been studied in subjects younger than 12 years of age. \n \nGender \nIn adolescents with Primary IGFD and in healthy adults there were no apparent differences between males \nand females in the pharmacokinetics of INCRELEX. \n \nRace \nNo information is available. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo studies have been conducted in children with renal impairment.   \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo studies have been conducted to determine the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \nmecasermin. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, \nrepeated dose toxicity or genotoxicity. \n \nAdverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical \nexposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: \n \nToxicity to reproduction \nIn rats and rabbits reproductive toxicity was studied after intravenous but not after subcutaneous application \n(the normal clinical route). These studies did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to \nfertility and pregnancy, but due to the different route of application the relevance of these findings is unclear. \nPlacental transfer of mecasermin was not studied. \n \nCarcinogenic potential \nMecasermin was administered subcutaneously to Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 0, 0.25, 1, 4, and \n10 mg/kg/day for up to 2 years. An increased incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia and \npheochromocytoma was observed in male rats at doses of 1 mg/kg/day and above (≥ 1 times the clinical \nexposure with the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] based on AUC) and female rats at all dose \nlevels (≥ 0.3 times the clinical exposure with the MRHD based on AUC).  \n \nAn increased incidence of keratoacanthoma in the skin was observed in male rats at doses of 4 and \n10 mg/kg/day (≥ 4 times the exposure with the MRHD based on AUC). An increased incidence of mammary \ngland carcinoma in both male and female rats was observed in animals treated with 10 mg/kg/day (7 times \nthe exposure with the MRHD based on AUC). Excess mortality secondary to IGF-1 induced hypoglycaemia \nwas observed in the carcinogenesis studies. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new safety \ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to \nreport side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if \n\ntheir signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What INCRELEX is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use INCRELEX \n3. How to use INCRELEX  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store INCRELEX \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n1. What INCRELEX is and what it is used for \n \n\n- INCRELEX is a liquid that contains mecasermin which is a man-made insulin-like growth factor-1 \n(IGF-1), which is similar to the IGF-1 made by your body. \n\n- It is used to treat children and adolescents from 2 to 18 years old who are very short for their age \nbecause their bodies do not make enough IGF-1. This condition is called primary IGF-1 deficiency. \n\n \n2. What you need to know before you use INCRELEX   \n \nDo not use INCRELEX \n- If you currently have any tumour or growth, either cancerous or non-cancerous \n- if you have had cancer in the past \n- if you have any conditions which may increase the risk of cancer \n- if you are allergic to mecasermin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n- in premature babies or neonates because it contains benzyl alcohol. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nThere is an increased risk of tumours and growths (both cancerous and non-cancerous) in children and \nadolescents treated with INCRELEX.  If any new growth, skin lesion or any unexpected symptom occurs \nduring treatment or after treatment, see your doctor immediately since mecasermin may play a role in cancer \ndevelopment.  \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using INCRELEX \n- if you have a curved spine (scoliosis). You should be monitored for progression of scoliosis. \n- if you develop a limp or hip or knee pain \n- if you have enlarged tonsils (tonsillar hypertrophy). You should have examinations periodically. \n- if you have symptoms of increased pressure in the brain (intracranial hypertension), such as visual \n\nchanges, headache, nausea and/or vomiting, contact the doctor for advice. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n- if you have a localised reaction at the injection site or generalised allergic reaction with INCRELEX. \nCall the doctor as soon as possible if you get a localised rash. Get medical help immediately if you have \na generalised allergic reaction (hives, trouble breathing, faintness or collapse and feeling generally \nunwell). \n\n- if you have finished growing (the bone growth plates are closed). In this case INCRELEX cannot help \nyou grow and should not be used. \n\n \n \nChildren under 2 years old \n \nThe use of this medicine has not been studied in children under 2 years of age and is therefore not \nrecommended. \n \nOther medicines and INCRELEX \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nEspecially tell the doctor if you take insulin or other anti-diabetes medicines. A dose adjustment may be \nneeded for these medicines. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor for advice before using this medicine. \n \nA negative pregnancy test is recommended for all women of child bearing potential prior to treatment with \nmecasermin. It is also recommended that all women of childbearing potential use adequate contraception \nduring treatment. \n \nMecasermin therapy should be discontinued if pregnancy occurs. \n \nMecasermin should not be administered to a breast-feeding mother. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nMecasermin may cause hypoglycaemia (very common side effect, see section 4) that may impair your ability \nto drive and use machines because your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced. \n \nYou should avoid engaging in any high-risk activities (e.g., driving, etc.) within 2-3 hours after dosing, \nparticularly at the start of INCRELEX treatment, until a dose of INCRELEX has been found which does not \ncause side effects that make these activities risky. \n \nINCRELEX contains benzyl alcohol and sodium \n \nINCRELEX contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative which may cause toxic reactions and allergic reactions \nin infants and children up to 3 years old. \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n3. How to use INCRELEX \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you \nare not sure. \n \nThe typical dose is 0.04 to 0.12 mg/kg of patient weight administered twice a day. See the ‘Instructions for \nUse’ at the end of this leaflet. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nInject INCRELEX just under your skin shortly before or after a meal or snack because it may have insulin-\nlike hypoglycaemic effects and so it may decrease blood sugar levels (see hypoglycaemia in section 4). Do \nnot inject your dose of INCRELEX if you cannot eat for any reason. Do not make up the missed dose by \ngiving two doses the next time. The next dose should be taken as usual, with a meal or snack. \n \nInject INCRELEX just below the skin in your upper arm, upper leg (thigh), stomach area (abdomen), or \nbuttocks. Never inject it into a vein or muscle. Change the injection site for each injection. \n \nOnly use INCRELEX that is clear and colourless. \n \nTreatment with mecasermin is a long-term therapy. For further information ask the doctor. \n \nIf you use more INCRELEX than you should \n \nMecasermin, like insulin, may lower blood sugar levels (see hypoglycaemia in section 4). \n \nIf more INCRELEX than recommended was injected, contact your doctor immediately. \n \nAcute overdose could lead to hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar).  \n \nTreatment of acute overdose of mecasermin should be directed at reversing hypoglycaemia. Sugar-\ncontaining fluids or food should be consumed. If the patient is not awake or alert enough to drink sugar-\ncontaining fluids, an injection of glucagon into the muscle may be necessary to reverse the low blood sugar. \nYour doctor or nurse will instruct you how to give the injection of glucagon. \n \nLong-term overdose may result in enlargement of certain body parts (e.g., hands, feet, parts of the face) or \nexcessive growth of the whole body. If you suspect long-term overdose, contact your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you forget to use INCRELEX \n \nDo not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \nIf a dose is skipped, the next dose should not be made larger to compensate. The next dose should be taken \nas usual, with a meal or snack. \n \nIf you stop using INCRELEX \n \nA disruption or early ending of treatment with mecasermin may impair the success of the growth therapy. \nPlease ask the doctor for advice before stopping the treatment. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. If you get any \nside effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. \n \nThe most frequently occurring side effects with mecasermin are: low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), vomiting, \ninjection site reactions, headache and middle ear infections. Serious allergic reactions have also been \nreported with INCRELEX. If you develop any of these events, please follow the advice given for each event \nin the sections below.  \n \nFrequency not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \nCancerous and non-cancerous tumours \nAn increase in both cancerous and non-cancerous tumours has been reported in patients treated with \nINCRELEX.  The risk of such tumours may be higher if INCRELEX is used for condition other than what is \nstated in Section 1 or used at higher than recommended dose as per Section 3.  \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nSerious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) \nGeneralised hives, difficulty in breathing, dizziness, swelling of the face and/or throat have been reported \nfollowing mecasermin use. Stop INCRELEX immediately and seek urgent medical advice if you develop a \nserious allergic reaction. \nLocal allergic reactions at the injection site (itching, hives) have also been reported. \n \nHair loss (alopecia) \nHair loss has also been reported following mecasermin use. \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)  \nMecasermin may lower blood sugar levels. Signs of low blood sugar are: dizziness, tiredness, restlessness, \nhunger, irritability, trouble concentrating, sweating, nausea and fast or irregular heartbeats.  \n \nSevere hypoglycaemia may cause unconsciousness, seizures/fits or death. Stop INCRELEX immediately and \nseek urgent medical advice if you develop seizures/fits or become unconscious.  \n \nIf you take INCRELEX, you should avoid participating in high risk activities (such as vigorous physical \nactivity) within 2 to 3 hours after INCRELEX injection, especially at the beginning of INCRELEX \ntreatment. \n\n \nBefore beginning treatment with INCRELEX the doctor or nurse will explain to you how to treat \nhypoglycaemia. You should always have a source of sugar such as orange juice, glucose gel, sweets, or milk \navailable in case symptoms of hypoglycaemia occur. For severe hypoglycaemia, if you are not responsive \nand cannot drink sugar-containing fluids, you should give an injection of glucagon. The doctor or nurse will \ninstruct you how to give the injection. Glucagon raises the blood sugar when it is injected. It is important that \nyou have a well-balanced diet including protein and fat such as meat and cheese in addition to sugar-\ncontaining foods. \n \nInjection site hypertrophy (tissue at injection site increases in size) and bruising \nThese can be avoided by changing the injection site at each injection (injection site rotation).  \n \nDigestive system  \nVomiting and pain in the upper belly have occurred with mecasermin treatment. \n \nInfections \nInfections of the middle ear have been observed in children with mecasermin treatment.  \n \nMusculoskeletal system \nJoint pains and pains in the limbs have occurred with mecasermin treatment.  \n \nNervous system \nHeadache has occurred with mecasermin treatment. \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \nSeizures \nSeizures (fits) have been observed with mecasermin treatment. \nDizziness and tremor have also been reported with mecasermin treatment. \n \nHeart abnormalities  \nA fast heart rate and abnormal heart sounds have been reported with mecasermin treatment. \n \nIncreased blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \nIncreased blood sugar has also been observed with mecasermin treatment. \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nEnlarged tonsils/adenoids \nMecasermin may enlarge your tonsils/adenoids. Some signs of enlarged tonsils/adenoids include: snoring, \ndifficulty breathing or swallowing, sleep apnoea (a condition where breathing stops briefly during sleep), or \nfluid in the middle ear, as well as infections of the ear. Sleep apnea can cause excessive daytime sleepiness. \nCall the doctor should these symptoms bother you. The doctor should regularly examine your \ntonsils/adenoids.  \n \nEnlarged thymus \nAn enlarged thymus (a specialized organ of the immune system) has been observed with mecasermin \ntreatment. \n \nPapilloedema \nA swelling at the back of the eye (due to increased pressure within the brain) may be observed by a doctor or \noptician during mecasermin treatment.  \n \nHypoacusis (hearing loss) \nHypoacusis (hearing loss), ear pain and fluid in the middle ear have been observed with mecasermin \ntreatment. Tell the doctor if you develop hearing problems. \n \nWorsened scoliosis (caused by rapid growth) \nIf you have scoliosis, you will need to be checked often for an increase in the curve of the spine.  \nPain in muscles has also been seen with mecasermin treatment. \n \nReproductive system \nBreast enlargement has been observed with mecasermin treatment. \n \nDigestive system  \nPain in the belly has occurred with mecasermin treatment. \n \nSkin and hair changes \nSkin thickening, moles and abnormal hair texture have been seen with mecasermin treatment. \n \nReactions at the injection site \nReactions including pain, irritation, bleeding, bruising, redness and hardening have been reported with \nINCRELEX treatment. Injection site reactions can be avoided by changing the injection site at each injection \n(injection site rotation). \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)  \nIncreased pressure in the brain (intracranial hypertension) \nINCRELEX can sometimes cause a temporary increase in pressure within the brain. The symptoms of \nintracranial hypertension can include visual changes, headache, nausea and/or vomiting. Tell the doctor \nimmediately if you have any of these symptoms. Your doctor can check to see if intracranial hypertension is \npresent. If it is present, your doctor may decide to temporarily reduce or discontinue mecasermin therapy. \nMecasermin may be started again after the episode is over.  \n \nHeart abnormalities \nIn some patients treated with mecasermin, an ultrasound examination of the heart (echocardiogram) showed \nan increased size of the heart muscle and abnormalities of heart valve function. Your doctor may perform an \nechocardiogram before, during and after mecasermin treatment.  \n \nReactions at the injection site \nReactions including rash, swelling and fatty lumps have been reported with INCRELEX treatment. Injection \nsite reactions can be avoided by changing the injection site at each injection (injection site rotation). \n \nWeight increase \nWeight increase has been observed with mecasermin treatment. \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nOther uncommon side effects seen with mecasermin treatment include depression, nervousness. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n5.

The syringes should be of small enough volume that the \nprescribed dose can be withdrawn from the vial with reasonable accuracy. \n \nPreparing the dose \n \n1. Wash your hands before getting INCRELEX ready for your injection. \n \n2. Use a new disposable needle and syringe every time you give a dose. Use syringes and needles only \n\nonce. Throw them away properly in a sharps container (such as a biohazard container), hard plastic \ncontainer (such as a detergent bottle), or metal container (such as an empty coffee can). Never share \nneedles and syringes. \n\n \n3. Check the liquid to make sure it is clear and colourless. Do not use after the expiry date (which is \n\nstated on the label after EXP and it refers to the last day of the month) or if it is cloudy or if you see \nbits. If a vial freezes, dispose appropriately. Ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you \nno longer use. \n\n \n4. If you are using a new vial, remove the protective cap. Do not remove the rubber stopper. \n \n5. Wipe the rubber stopper of the vial with an alcohol swab to prevent contamination of the vial by germs \n\nthat may be introduced by repeated needle insertions (see Figure 1). \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Wipe top \nwith alcohol \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n6. Before putting the needle into the vial, pull back on plunger to draw air into the syringe equal to the \n\nprescribed dose. Put the needle through the rubber top of the vial and push the plunger to inject air \ninto the vial (see Figure 2). \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7. Leave the syringe in the vial and turn both upside down. Hold the syringe and vial firmly (see Figure \n\n3). \n \n   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFigure 2: Inject air \ninto vial \n\nFigure 3: Prepare for \nextraction \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n8.  Make sure the tip of the needle is in the liquid (see Figure 4). Pull the plunger to withdraw the correct \n\ndose into the syringe (see Figure 5). \n \n          \n \n\n                           \n \n \n             \n    \n \n \n \n9.  Before you take the needle out of the vial, check the syringe for air bubbles. If bubbles are in the \n\nsyringe, hold the vial and syringe with needle straight up and tap the side of the syringe until the \nbubbles float to the top. Push the bubbles out with the plunger and draw liquid back in until you have \nthe correct dose (see Figure 6). \n\n \n \n\n        \n             \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFigure 4: Tip in \nliquid   \n\nFigure 5: Extract \ncorrect dose  \n\nFigure 6: Remove air bubbles \nand refill syringe \n\n\n\n35 \n\n10.  Remove the needle from the vial and replace the protective cap. Do not let the needle \ntouch anything. You are now ready to inject (see Figure 7). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInjecting the dose: \n \nInject INCRELEX as instructed by the doctor. \nDo not give the injection if you are unable to eat shortly before or after the injection. \n \n1. Decide on an injection area – upper arm, thigh, buttock, or abdomen (see below). The injection site \n\nshould be changed for each injection (rotate the injection site). \n \n\n                                                            \n \n \n \n2. Use alcohol or soap and water to clean the skin where you are going to inject you. The injection site \n\nshould be dry before you inject. \n\nFigure 7: Ready to \ninject \n\nUpper arm Thigh Buttock Abdomen  \n\n\n\n36 \n\n3. Lightly pinch the skin. Insert the needle in the way the doctor showed you. Release the skin (see \nFigure A). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4. Slowly push in the plunger of the syringe all the way, making sure you have injected all the liquid. \n\nPull the needle straight out and gently press on the spot where you injected you with gauze or a cotton \nball for a few seconds. Do not rub the area (see Figure B). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5. Follow the doctor’s instructions for throwing away the needle and syringe. Do not recap the syringe. \n\nUsed needle and syringe should be placed in a sharps container (such as a biohazard container), hard \nplastic container (such as a detergent bottle), or metal container (such as an empty coffee can). Such \ncontainers should be sealed and disposed of properly in the way your doctor described. \n\n \n\nFigure A: Lightly pinch \nthe skin and inject as \ninstructed \n\nFigure B: Press (don’t rub) \nwith gauze or cotton \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
