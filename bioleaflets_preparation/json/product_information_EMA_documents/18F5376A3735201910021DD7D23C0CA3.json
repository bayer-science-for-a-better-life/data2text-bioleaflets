NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nFintepla 2.2 mg/mL oral solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach mL contains 2.2 mg of fenfluramine (as fenfluramine hydrochloride). \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect \n \nGlucose (maize): 0.627 mg/mL \nSodium ethyl para-hydroxybenzoate (E 215): 0.23 mg/mL \nSodium methyl para-hydroxybenzoate (E 219): 2.3 mg/mL \nSulfur dioxide (E 220): 0.000009 mg/mL \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nOral solution.  \n \nClear, colourless, slightly viscous liquid, with a pH of 5. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nFintepla is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome as an add-on \ntherapy to other anti-epileptic medicines for patients 2 years of age and older. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nFintepla should be initiated and supervised by physicians with experience in the treatment of epilepsy. \n \nFintepla is prescribed and dispensed according to the Fintepla controlled access programme (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nPosology \n \nPaediatric (children aged 2 years and older) and adult populations \n \nPatients who are not taking stiripentol \nThe starting dose is 0.1 mg/kg twice daily (0.2 mg/kg/day). \nAfter 7 days, for patients who are tolerating fenfluramine, and require a further reduction of seizures, \nthe dose can be increased to 0.2 mg/kg twice daily (0.4 mg/kg/day).  \nAfter an additional 7 days, for patients who are tolerating fenfluramine, and require a further reduction \nof seizures, the dose can be increased to a maximum of 0.35 mg/kg twice daily (0.7 mg/kg/day), which \nis the recommended maintenance dose. \n\n\n\n3 \n\nFor patients requiring more rapid titration, the dose may be increased every 4 days. \nThe maximum daily dose of 26 mg (13 mg twice daily i.e. 6.0 mL twice daily) should not be \nexceeded. \nThe twice daily dose in mL can be determined as follows: \n \nTable 1: Dosing table in mL in patients not taking stiripentol \n \nRecommended \n\ntitration \nschedule – \nwithout \n\nstiripentol \n\nTwice \ndaily dose \n(mg/kg) \n\nWeight (kg) \n\n10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 \n\nStarting dose 0.1 0.5 \nmL \n\n0.6 \nmL \n\n0.8 \nmL \n\n1.0 \nmL \n\n1.3 \nmL \n\n1.5 \nmL \n\n1.7 \nmL \n\n1.9 \nmL \n\n2.1 \nmL \n\n2.3 \nmL \n\n2.5 \nmL \n\n2.7 \nmL \n\n2.9 \nmL \n\nDay 7 0.2 0.8 \nmL \n\n1.2 \nmL \n\n1.6 \nmL \n\n2.0 \nmL \n\n2.4 \nmL \n\n2.8 \nmL \n\n3.2 \nmL \n\n3.6 \nmL \n\n4.0 \nmL  \n\n4.4 \nmL  \n\n4.8 \nmL  \n\n5.2 \nmL  \n\n5.6 \nmL  \n\nDay 14 0.35 1.6 \nmL \n\n2.4 \nmL \n\n3.2 \nmL \n\n4.0 \nmL  \n\n4.8 \nmL \n\n5.6 \nmL  \n\n6.0 \nmL \n\n6.0 \nmL \n\n6.0 \nmL \n\n6.0 \nmL \n\n6.0 \nmL \n\n6.0 \nmL \n\n6.0 \nmL \n\n \nIf the calculated dose is 3.0 mL or less, the green printed 3 mL syringe should be used. \nIf the calculated dose is more than 3.0 mL, the purple printed 6 mL syringe should be used. \nThe calculated dose should be rounded to the nearest graduated increment. \n \nPatients who are taking stiripentol \nThe starting dose is 0.1 mg/kg twice daily (0.2 mg/kg/day). \nAfter 7 days, for patients who are tolerating fenfluramine, and require a further reduction of seizures, \nthe dose can be increased to 0.2 mg/kg twice daily (0.4 mg/kg/day), which is the recommended \nmaintenance dose. \nFor patients requiring more rapid titration, the dose may be increased every 4 days. \nA total dose of 17 mg (8.6 mg twice daily i.e. 4.0 mL twice daily) should not be exceeded. \nThe twice daily dose in mL can be determined as follows: \n \nTable 2: Dosing table in mL in patients receiving stiripentol \n \nRecommended \n\ntitration \nschedule with \n\nstiripentol \n\nTwice \ndaily dose \n(mg/kg) \n\nWeight (kg) \n\n10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 \n\nStarting dose 0.1 0.5 \nmL \n\n0.6 \nmL \n\n0.8 \nmL \n\n1.0 \nmL \n\n1.3 \nmL \n\n1.5 \nmL \n\n1.7 \nmL \n\n1.9 \nmL \n\n2.1 \nmL \n\n2.3 \nmL \n\n2.5 \nmL \n\n2.7 \nmL \n\n2.9 \nmL \n\nDay 7 0.2 1.0 \nmL \n\n1.5 \nmL \n\n2.0 \nmL \n\n2.5 \nmL \n\n3.0 \nmL \n\n3.6 \nmL \n\n4.0 \nmL  \n\n4.0 \nmL  \n\n4.0 \nmL  \n\n4.0 \nmL  \n\n4.0 \nmL  \n\n4.0 \nmL  \n\n4.0 \nmL  \n\n \nIf the calculated dose is 3.0 mL or less, the green printed 3 mL syringe should be used. \nIf the calculated dose is more than 3.0 mL, the purple printed 6 mL syringe should be used. \nThe calculated dose should be rounded to the nearest graduated increment. \n \nDiscontinuation of treatment \n \nWhen discontinuing treatment, the dose should be decreased gradually. As with all anti-epileptic \nmedicines, abrupt discontinuation should be avoided when possible to minimize the risk of increased \nseizure frequency and status epilepticus. \n \nSpecial populations \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPatients with renal impairment \nThere are no clinical data available in subjects with renal impairment.  \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nThere are no clinical data available in subjects with hepatic impairment.  \nAdministration to patients with moderate or severe liver impairment is not recommended. \n \nElderly \nThere are no data on the use of Fintepla in elderly patients. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Fintepla in children below 2 years of age has not yet been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nFintepla is to be administered orally. \nFintepla may be taken with or without food. \nFintepla is compatible with commercially available gastric and nasogastric feeding tubes (see section \n6.6). \nFintepla contains a very limited amount of digestible carbohydrates and is compatible with a ketogenic \ndiet. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nAortic or mitral valvular heart disease. \nPulmonary arterial hypertension. \nWithin 14 days of the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors due to an increased risk of \nserotonin syndrome. \n \n4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAortic or mitral valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension \n \nBecause of reported cases of valvular heart disease that may have been caused by fenfluramine at \nhigher doses used to treat adult obesity, cardiac monitoring must be performed using \nechocardiography. In the controlled clinical studies of fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet \nsyndrome, no valvular heart disease was observed. \n \nPrior to starting treatment, patients must undergo an echocardiogram to establish a baseline prior to \ninitiating treatment (see section 4.3) and exclude any pre-existing valvular heart disease or pulmonary \nhypertension. \n \nEchocardiogram monitoring should be conducted every 6 months for the first 2 years and annually \nthereafter. If an echocardiogram indicates pathological valvular changes, a follow-up echocardiogram \nshould be considered at an earlier timeframe to evaluate whether the abnormality is persistent. If \npathological abnormalities on the echocardiogram are observed, it is recommended to evaluate the \nbenefit versus risk of continuing fenfluramine treatment with the prescriber, caregiver, and \ncardiologist. \n \nIf treatment is stopped because of aortic or mitral valvular heart disease, appropriate monitoring and \nfollow-up should be provided in accordance with local guidelines for the treatment of aortic or mitral \nvalvular heart disease. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nWith past use in higher doses to treat adult obesity, fenfluramine was reported to be associated with \npulmonary arterial hypertension. Pulmonary arterial hypertension was not observed in the clinical \nprogramme, but because of the low incidence of this disease, the clinical trial experience with \nfenfluramine is inadequate to determine if fenfluramine increases the risk for pulmonary arterial \nhypertension in patients with Dravet syndrome. \n \nIf echocardiogram findings are suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension, a repeat \nechocardiogram should be performed as soon as possible and within 3 months to confirm these \nfindings.  If the echocardiogram finding is confirmed suggestive of an increased probability of \npulmonary arterial hypertension defined as “intermediate probability” by the 2015 European Society \nof Cardiology (ESC) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) Guidelines, it should lead to a \nbenefit-risk evaluation of continuation of Fintepla by the prescriber, carer, and cardiologist. If the \nechocardiogram finding, after confirmation, suggests of a high probability of pulmonary arterial \nhypertension, as defined by the 2015 ESC and ERS Guidelines, it is recommended fenfluramine \ntreatment should be stopped. \n \nDecreased appetite and weight loss \n \nFenfluramine can cause decreased appetite and weight loss (see section 4.8). An additive effect on \ndecreased appetite can occur when fenfluramine is combined with other anti-epileptic medicines, for \nexample stiripentol. The decrease in weight appears to be dose related. Most subjects resumed weight \ngain over time while continuing treatment. The patient's weight should be monitored. A benefit risk \nevaluation should be undertaken prior to commencing treatment with fenfluramine in patients with a \nhistory of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. \n \nFintepla controlled access programme \n \nA controlled access programme has been created to 1) prevent off-label use in weight management in \nobese patients and 2) confirm that prescribing physicians have been informed of the need for periodic \ncardiac monitoring in patients taking Fintepla.  \n \nSomnolence \n \nFenfluramine can cause somnolence. \n \nOther central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, could potentiate the somnolence effect of \nfenfluramine (see sections 4.5 and 4.7). \n \nSuicidal behaviour and ideation  \n \nSuicidal behaviour and ideation have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic medicines in \nseveral indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials with anti-epileptic \nmedicines that did not include fenfluramine has shown a small increased risk of suicidal behaviour and \nideation. The mechanism of this risk is not known, and the available data do not exclude the \npossibility of an increased risk for fenfluramine. Patients and caregivers of patients should be advised \nto seek medical advice should any signs of suicidal behaviour and ideation emerge. \n \nSerotonin syndrome \n \nAs with other serotonergic agents, serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, may \noccur with fenfluramine treatment, particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic agents \n(including SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, or triptans); with agents that impair metabolism of \nserotonin such as MAOIs; or with antipsychotics that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter \nsystems (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nSerotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (eg, agitation, hallucinations, \ncoma), autonomic instability (eg, tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular \naberrations (eg, hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea, \nvomiting, diarrhoea). \n \nIf concomitant treatment with fenfluramine and other serotonergic agents that may affect the \nserotonergic systems is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly \nduring treatment initiation and dose increases. \n\n \nIncreased seizure frequency \n \nAs with other anti-epileptic medicines, a clinically relevant increase in seizure frequency may occur \nduring treatment with fenfluramine, which may require adjustment in the dose of fenfluramine and/or \nconcomitant anti-epileptic medicines, or discontinuation of fenfluramine, should the benefit-risk be \nnegative.  \n \nCyproheptadine  \n \nCyproheptadine is a potent serotonin receptor antagonist and may therefore decrease the efficacy of \nfenfluramine. If cyproheptadine is added to treatment with fenfluramine, patients should be monitored \nfor worsening of seizures. If fenfluramine treatment is initiated in a patient taking cyproheptadine, \nfenfluramine’s efficacy may be reduced. \n \nGlaucoma \n \nFenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Discontinue therapy in \npatients with acute decreases in visual acuity. Consider discontinuation if there is ocular pain and \nanother cause cannot be determined. \n \nStrong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducers \n \nCo-administration with strong CYP1A2 inducers or CYP2B6 inducers may decrease fenfluramine \nplasma concentrations (see section 4.5). \nAn increase in fenfluramine dosage should be considered when co-administered with a strong \nCYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducer; the maximum daily dose should not be exceeded. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains sodium ethyl para-hydroxybenzoate (E 215) and sodium methyl para-\nhydroxybenzoate (E 219) which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed).  \n \nIt also contains sulfur dioxide (E 220) which may rarely cause severe hypersensitivity reactions and \nbronchospasm. \n \nPatients with rare glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per the maximum daily dose of \n12 mL, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \nThis medicinal product contains glucose which may be harmful to the teeth. \n \n4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPharmacodyamic interactions \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nPharmacodynamic interactions with other central nervous system depressants increase the risk of \naggravated central nervous system depression. Examples of such depressants are other serotonergic \nagents (including SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, or triptans); agents that impair metabolism \nof serotonin such as MAOIs; or antipsychotics that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter \nsystems (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nPharmacokinetic interactions \n \nClinical studies \n \nEffect of steady state stiripentol plus clobazam and/or valproate on fenfluramine \nAt steady state in the Phase 3 studies, the co-administration of 0.2 mg/kg twice daily (0.4 mg/kg/day), \nmaximum 17 mg/day, fenfluramine with a standard anti-epileptic medicine regimen of stiripentol plus \nclobazam and/or valproate, resulted in a 130% increase in fenfluramine AUC0-24 and a 60% decrease \nin norfenfluramine AUC0-24, as compared to 0.35 mg/kg twice daily (0.7 mg/kg/day), maximum \n26 mg/day, fenfluramine without stiripentol (see section 4.2). \n \nEffect of steady state cannabidiol on fenfluramine \nCo-administration of a single 0.35 mg/kg dose of fenfluramine with repeated doses of cannabidiol \nincreased the AUC0-INF of fenfluramine by 59% and the Cmax by 10%, and decreased the AUC0-INF of \nnorfenfluramine by 22% and the Cmax by 33%, as compared to fenfluramine administered alone. \nCo-administration of a single 0.35 mg/kg dose of fenfluramine, with repeated doses of cannabidiol, \ndid not affect the pharmacokinetics of cannabidiol, as compared to cannabidiol alone. No dose \nadjustment is necessary when fenfluramine is co-administered with cannabidiol. \n \nIn vitro studies \nCo-administration with strong CYP1A2 inducers or CYP2B6 inducers may decrease fenfluramine \nplasma concentrations. \n \nEffect of fenfluramine on other medicinal products \nCo-administration of a single 0.7 mg/kg dose of fenfluramine, with a single dose of a stiripentol, \nclobazam, and valproic acid combination, did not affect the pharmacokinetics of stiripentol, nor the \npharmacokinetics of clobazam or its Ndesmethyl-metabolite norclobazam, nor the pharmacokinetics \nof valproic acid, as compared to the stiripentol, clobazam, and valproic acid combination alone.  \n \nEffect of fenfluramine on CYP2D6 substrates  \nIn vitro studies indicate that fenfluramine may inhibit CYP2D6. It has been reported that steady-state \ndesipramine concentrations increase approximately 2-fold with concomitant administration of \nfenfluramine. Co-administration of fenfluramine with CYP2D6 substrates may increase their plasma \nconcentrations. \n \nEffect of fenfluramine on CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 substrates  \nIn vitro studies indicate that fenfluramine may induce CYP2B6 and may induce intestinal CYP3A4. \nCo-administration of fenfluramine with CYP2B6 substrates or CYP3A4 substrates may decrease their \nplasma concentrations. \n \nEffect of fenfluramine on MATE1 substrates  \nIn vitro studies indicate that norfenfluramine (major and pharmacologically active metabolite) may \ninhibit MATE1 at clinically relevant concentrations. Co-administration of fenfluramine with MATE1 \nsubstrates may increase their plasma concentrations. \n \n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy, and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nThere are limited data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of fenfluramine in pregnant \nwomen. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \nin the absence of paternal or maternal toxicity (see section 5.3). \n  \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Fintepla during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether fenfluramine/metabolites are excreted in human milk. \nAvailable pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of fenfluramine/metabolites in milk \n(see section 5.3). \n \nA risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. \n \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \nFintepla therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nNo effects of fenfluramine on human fertility up to clinical doses of 104 mg/day were noted. However, \nanimal studies suggest that Fintepla may possibly affect female fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nFintepla has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines because it may cause \nsomnolence and fatigue. Patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have \ngained sufficient experience to gauge whether it adversely affects their abilities (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are decreased appetite (44.2%), diarrhoea (30.8%), \npyrexia (25.6%), fatigue (25.6%), upper respiratory tract infection (20.5%), lethargy (17.5%), \nsomnolence (15.4%), and bronchitis (11.6%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions reported with fenfluramine in placebo-controlled clinical studies are listed in the \ntable below by System Organ Class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥1/10) \nor common (≥1/100 to <1/10).  \n \nTable 3: Adverse reactions  \n\nMedDRA System Organ \nClass  \n\nVery common  Common  \n\nInfections and infestations  Bronchitis \nUpper respiratory tract \ninfection \n\nEar infection  \n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders  \n\nDecreased appetite    \n\nPsychiatric disorders    Abnormal behaviour  \nIrritability \n\nNervous system disorders  Lethargy   \n\n\n\n9 \n\nSomnolence  \nStatus epilepticus \nTremor \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  Constipation \nDiarrhoea  \nVomiting \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions  \n\nPyrexia  \nFatigue  \n\n  \n\nInvestigations  Blood glucose decreased \nEchocardiogram abnormal \n(trace regurgitation) \nWeight decreased \n\n \n\nInjury, poisoning, and \nprocedural complications \n\nFall   \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nLong-term safety \nFenfluramine was used by 330 patients in an open-label trial for up to 3 years. The most commonly \nreported adverse reactions were decreased appetite (18.8%), echocardiogram abnormal (trace \nregurgitation) (8.2%), weight decreased (6.1%) and abnormal behaviour (5.2%). \n \nDecreased appetite and weight loss \nFenfluramine can cause decreased appetite and weight loss. In the controlled trials of children and \nyoung adults with Dravet syndrome 34.4% of fenfluramine-treated patients had decreased appetite, \ncompared to 8.3% of patients on placebo and approximately 18.9% of fenfluramine-treated patients \nhad a decrease in weight ≥7% from their baseline weight, compared to 2.4% of patients on placebo. \nThe decreases in appetite and weight appeared to be dose related. Most subjects resumed weight gain \nover time while continuing fenfluramine treatment. \n \nStatus epilepticus \nIn the phase 3 clinical trials the observed frequency of status epilepticus was 2.4% in the placebo \ngroup and 6.6% in the fenfluramine group. There were no discontinuations due to status epilepticus.  \n \nEchocardiographic safety assessments of valvular regurgitation \nThe possible occurrence of valvular heart disease was evaluated in the placebo-controlled and open-\nlabel extension studies for up to 3 years duration.  \n \nNo patient developed any valvular heart disease in the double-blind studies or during the open-label \nextension study with treatment up to 3 years duration. Trace mitral valve regurgitation was reported \n17.9% of subjects in the 0.2 mg/kg/day group (n=7/39), 22.5% in the 0.7 mg/kg/day group (n= 9/40), \n20.9% in the 0.4 mg/kg/day group (n=9/43) and in 9.5% in the placebo group (n= 8/84). Mild mitral \nregurgitation was reported in 2.3% of the 0.4 mg/kg/day group (n=1/43). Trace aortic regurgitation \nwas reported in 7.9% of the subjects in the 0.7 mg/kg/day group (n= 3/40). However, trace and mild \nmitral regurgitation, and trace aortic regurgitation are all non-pathologic findings as defined by the \n2015 ESC and ERS Guidelines. All of the incidences reported were transient.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\nOnly limited data have been reported concerning clinical effects and management of overdose of \nfenfluramine. Agitation, drowsiness, confusion, flushing, tremor (or shivering), fever, sweating, \nabdominal pain, hyperventilation, and dilated non-reactive pupils were reported at much higher doses \nof fenfluramine than those included in the clinical trial program.  \n \nReportedly, the treatment of fenfluramine intoxication should include gastric lavage. Vital functions \nshould be monitored closely, and supportive treatment administered in case of convulsions, \narrhythmias, or respiratory difficulties. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics; ATC code: N03AX26 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nFenfluramine is a serotonin releasing agent, and thereby stimulates multiple 5-HT receptor sub-types \nthrough the release of serotonin. Fenfluramine may reduce seizures by acting as an agonist at specific \nserotonin receptors in the brain, including the 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptors, and also by \nacting on the sigma-1 receptor. The precise mode of action of fenfluramine in Dravet syndrome is not \nknown. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nChildren and young adults \nThe effectiveness of fenfluramine in children and young adults with Dravet syndrome was evaluated \nin two randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled studies. \n \nStudy 1 (N=119) was a 3-arm, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel group, \nplacebo-controlled study consisting of a 6-week baseline period followed by a 2-week titration period \nand a 12-week maintenance period for a total of 14 weeks treatment. Eligible patients were \nrandomised 1:1:1 to one of two doses of fenfluramine (0.7 mg/kg/day or 0.2 mg/kg/day, maximum \n26 mg/day) or placebo. The mean (standard deviation) age of patients enrolled in Study 1 was \n9.0 (4.7) years, with a range of 2 to 18 years. The majority of patients were ≥6 years of age (73.9%) \nand the minority <6 years (26.1%), male (53.8%), and white (82.4%). All enrolled patients were \ninadequately controlled on at least one anti-epileptic medicine, with or without vagal nerve stimulation \nand/or ketogenic diet. Patients were taking between one and five anti-epileptic medicines at study \nentry. The most frequently used concomitant anti-epileptic medicines (≥25% overall) were valproate \n(59.6%), clobazam (58.8%), and topiramate (25.2%). In Study 1, the median baseline convulsive \nseizure frequency per 28 days was 34.0, 17.5, and 21.2 in the placebo, fenfluramine 0.2 mg/kg/day, \nand fenfluramine 0.7 mg/kg/day groups, respectively.  \n \nStudy 2 (previously known as 1504) (N=87) was a 2-arm, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, \nparallel group, placebo-controlled study consisting of a 6-week baseline period followed by a 3-week \ntitration period and a 12-week maintenance period for a total of 15 weeks treatment. Eligible patients \nwere randomised 1:1 to fenfluramine 0.4 mg/kg/day (maximum 17 mg/day) or placebo added to their \nstable standard of care regimen of stiripentol (plus clobazam and/or valproate) and possibly other \nanti-epileptic medicines. The mean (standard deviation) age of patients enrolled in Study 2 was \n9.1 (4.80) years, with a range of 2 to 19 years. The majority of patients were ≥6 years of age (72.4%) \nand the minority <6 years (27.6%), male (57.5%) and, where reported, white (59.8%). All enrolled \nsubjects were inadequately controlled on at least one anti-epileptic medicine, which included \nstiripentol, with or without vagal nerve stimulation and/or ketogenic diet. The median baseline \nconvulsive seizure frequency per 28 days was 10.7 and 14.3 in the placebo and fenfluramine \n0.4 mg/kg/day groups, respectively.  \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \nTable 4: Study 1 and Study 2 (previously known as 1504): results of primary and selected \nsecondary efficacy endpoints \n\n  Study 1 Study 2 \n  Placebo Fenfluramine \n\n0.2 mg/kg/day \nFenfluramine \n0.7 mg/kg/day \n\nPlacebo + \nstiripentol \n\nFenfluramine \n0.4 mg/kg/day \n+ stiripentol \n\nConvulsive \nSeizure \nFrequency \n \nMaintenance \nperiod \n\nN \nBaseline. \nMedian (min, \nmax) \n\n39 \n34.0 \n(3.3, \n\n147.3) \n\n39 \n17.5 \n\n(4.8, 623.5) \n\n40 \n21.2 \n\n(4.9, 127.0) \n\n44 \n10.7 \n\n(2.7, 162.7) \n\n43 \n14.3 \n\n(2.7, 213.3) \n\nN \nAt end of \nmaintenance \nperiod. \nMedian (min, \nmax) \n\n39 \n25.7 \n(3.6, \n\n204.7) \n\n39 \n17.1 \n\n(0.0, 194.3) \n\n40 \n4.9 \n\n(0, 105.5) \n\n44 \n11.4 \n\n(0.7, 169.3) \n\n42 \n3.9 \n\n(0.0, 518.0) \n\nReduction in \nmean monthly \nbaseline-\nadjusted \nConvulsive \nSeizure \nFrequency \ncompared to \nPlacebo \n\n- 36.7% \np=0.016 \n\n67.3% \np<0.001 \n\n- 54.9 % \np<0.001 \n\n% reduction \nin convulsive \nseizures  \n  \nMaintenance \nperiod  \n\nNumber (%) of \npatients with \n≥50% \nreduction in \nmonthly \nconvulsive \nseizures - \nchange \nfrom baseline  \nEffect size1 \n\nRelative Risk  \n\n4 \n(10.3%)  \n\n17 (43.6%)  \nES=33.3%  \nRR: 4.25 \n\n29 (72.5%)  \nES=62.2%  \nRR: 7.07 \n\n4 (9.1%)  23 (54.8%)  \nES=45.7 \nRR: 6.02 \n\n \n\nNumber (%) of \npatients with \n≥75% \nreduction in \nmonthly \nconvulsive \nseizures \n- change \nfrom baseline  \nEffect size1  \nRelative Risk \n\n2 (5.1%)  10 (25.6%)  \nES=20.5% \nRR: 5.00 \n\n21 (52.5%)  \nES=47.4% \nRR: 10.24 \n\n2 (4.5%)  17 (40.5%)  \nES=36.0%  \nRR: 8.90 \n\n \n\nNumber (%) of \npatients with \n≥100% \nreduction in \nmonthly \nconvulsive \nseizures - \nchange \nfrom baseline  \nEffect size1  \n\n0 (0%)  6 (15.4%)  \nES=15.4% \n\n \n\n6 (15.0%)  \nES=15.0% \n\n \n\n0 (0%)  2 (4.8%)  \nES=4.8% \n\n  \n\n\n\n12 \n\n  Study 1 Study 2 \n  Placebo Fenfluramine \n\n0.2 mg/kg/day \nFenfluramine \n0.7 mg/kg/day \n\nPlacebo + \nstiripentol \n\nFenfluramine \n0.4 mg/kg/day \n+ stiripentol \n\nLongest seizure-free interval \n(median) \n \nTitration + maintenance \nperiod \n\n9.5 days \n \n\n15.0 days \np=0.035 \n\n \n\n25.0 days \np<0.001 \n\n \n\n13.0 days \n \n\n22.0 days \np=0.004 \n\n \n\n1 Effect size (ES) (Risk difference) calculated as proportion of Active-Placebo; RR: Relative Risk  \n \nAdults \nThe Dravet syndrome population in Study 1 and Study 2 was predominantly paediatric patients, with \nonly 7 adult patients who were 18-19 years old (3.4%), and therefore limited efficacy and safety data \nwere obtained in the adult Dravet syndrome population. \n \nOpen-label data \n \nPatients who participated in Study 1 and Study 2 could participate in an open-label extension study. \nThe primary objective of the open-label study was long-term effectiveness and safety of fenfluramine \nat doses of 0.2 to 0.7 mg/kg/day, whereby the dose of fenfluramine could be titrated to optimize \ntreatment. Data are reported for 330 patients who participated in the open-label study and received \nfenfluramine for up to 3 years (median treatment period: 631 days; range: 7-1086). A total of 23% of \nsubjects discontinued study participation during the open-label extension treatment period, including \n15% due to lack of efficacy and 1% due to adverse events.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nFintepla in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in Dravet syndrome (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n  \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPharmacokinetics \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine were studied in healthy subjects and in \npaediatric patients with Dravet syndrome.  \n \nAbsorption \n \nFor fenfluramine, the Cmax occurs ~3 h following a single oral dose in healthy volunteers and is 28.6 \nng/mL following a dose of 0.35 mg/kg and 59.3 ng/mL following a dose of 0.7 mg/kg fenfluramine. \nThe AUCinf is 673 ng × h/mL and 1660 ng × h/mL following 0.35 mg/kg and 0.7 mg/kg, respectively. \nFor norfenfluramine, the Cmax occurs ~12 h following a single oral dose in healthy volunteers and is \n11.7 ng/mL and 16.1 ng/mL following a dose of 0.354 mg/kg or 0.78 mg/kg, respectively. The AUCinf \nis 798 ng × h/mL and ~800 ng × h/mL following 0.35 mg/kg and 0.7 mg/kg, respectively. Cmax and \nAUCinf of fenfluramine appear dose proportional over the 0.35 to 0.7 mg/kg dose range in healthy \nvolunteers. The Cmax and AUCinf of norfenfluramine are less than dose proportional over the 0.35 to \n0.7 mg/kg dose range in healthy volunteers. The AUCinf increase was 0.5-fold for the 0.7 mg/kg dose \ncompared to the 0.35 mg/kg dose. The Cmax increase was 0.7-fold for the 0.7 mg/kg dose compared to \nthe 0.35 mg/kg dose. \n \nIn paediatric patients following fenfluramine dosing of 0.2 mg/kg/day, administered twice daily, \nsteady state exposure (AUC0-24) is 371 ng*h/mL for fenfluramine and 222 ng*h/mL for \n\n\n\n13 \n\nnorfenfluramine. In paediatric patients following fenfluramine dosing of 0.7 mg/kg/day, administered \ntwice daily with a maximum of 26 mg/day; steady state AUC0-24 is 1400 ng*h/mL for fenfluramine \nand 869 ng*h/mL for norfenfluramine following a dose of 0.7 mg/kg/day, administered twice daily. \nCmax,ss was 68.6 ng/mL for fenfluramine and 37.8 ng/mL for norfenfluramine. When stiripentol is \ngiven concomitantly, the steady state AUC0-24 is 1030 ng*h/mL for fenfluramine and 139 ng*h/mL for \nnorfenfluramine following a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day, administered twice daily; the steady state AUC0-24 \nis 3240 ng*h/mL for fenfluramine and 364 ng*h/mL for norfenfluramine following a dose of \n0.35 mg/kg/day, administered twice daily. \n \nThe absolute bioavailability of fenfluramine is approximately 75-83%. There was no effect of food on \nthe pharmacokinetics of fenfluramine or norfenfluramine. \n \nThe plasma half-life of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine indicates that approximately 94% of \nsteady-state would be reached in approximately 4 days for fenfluramine and 5 days for \nnorfenfluramine (4 half-lives). In healthy subjects, the Cmax accumulation ratio is 3.7-fold for \nfenfluramine and 6.4-fold for norfenfluramine and the AUC0-24 accumulation ratio is 2.6-fold for \nfenfluramine and 3.7-fold for norfenfluramine.  \n \nDistribution \n \nFenfluramine is 50% bound to human plasma proteins in vitro and binding is independent of \nfenfluramine concentrations. The geometric mean (CV%) volume of distribution (Vz/F) of \nfenfluramine is 11.9 (16.5%) L/kg following oral administration of fenfluramine in healthy subjects.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nOver 75% of fenfluramine is metabolised to norfenfluramine prior to elimination, primarily by \nCYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP2D6. Norfenfluramine is then deaminated and oxidized to form inactive \nmetabolites. The extent to which these inactive metabolites are present in plasma and urine is \nunknown. The involvement of enzymes other than CYPs (e.g. UGTs) in the metabolism of \nnorfenfluramine is unknown, but literature data indicate that norfenfluramine may be glucuronidated \nto a significant extent. \n \nTransporters \n \nFenfluramine and norfenfluramine were not in vitro substrates of P-glycoprotein, BCRP, OATP1B1, \nOATP1B3, OATP1A2, OATP2B1, OCT1, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K. \n \nElimination \n \nMost of an orally administered dose of fenfluramine (>90%) is excreted in the urine mainly as \nmetabolite; less than 5% is found in faeces. The geometric mean (CV%) clearance (CL/F) of \nfenfluramine is 6.9 L/h (29%) and the half-life is 20 hours following oral administration of \nfenfluramine in healthy subjects. The elimination half-life of norfenfluramine is ~30 h. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nGenetic polymorphisms \nNo impact of genotype in CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4 on fenfluramine or \nnorfenfluramine PK was observed. \n \nRenal impairment \nRenal elimination is the predominant route of elimination of fenfluramine-related products, with more \nthan 90% of the administered dose eliminated in the urine as parent or metabolites. There are no \nhuman clinical data on the effect of renal impairment on the PK of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nHepatic impairment \nNo studies on the effect of hepatic impairment on the PK of fenfluramine in adults or children were \nfound. With hepatic metabolism of fenfluramine, plasma drug concentrations may be affected in \npatients with significant hepatic impairment. Subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment \nwere excluded from the phase 3 clinical trials. \n \nBody weight \nDrug clearance and PK exposure of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine are consistent across a broad \nrange of BMI (12.3 to 35 kg/m2). \n \nGender \nThe pharmacokinetics of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine were consistent between males and \nfemales. \n \nRace \nThe evaluation was limited by the small sample size of non-white subjects that no conclusion on the \neffect of race on the pharmacokinetics can be made. The genetic polymorphs of the enzymes that \nmetabolize fenfluramine are similar across races, only their frequency differs. Thus, although the mean \nexposure may differ slightly depending on race, the range of exposure would be expected to be \nsimilar. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity or genotoxicity. Knowledge of potential long-term toxicity \nincluding carcinogenic potential is however still limited. \n \nIn a lactation study, rats were dosed orally with radiolabeled dexfenfluramine at 1.2 mg/kg, and \nsamples of plasma and milk were collected over 24 hours following the dose. Both dexfenfluramine \nand nordexfenfluramine were found in milk at 2 hours after dosing and levels declined over 24 hours. \nNo dexfenfluramine was found in the milk at 24 hours. Nordexfenfluramine was present in small \namounts at 24 hours. The radioactivity milk:plasma ratio was 9 ± 2 at 2 hours and 5 ± 1 at 24 hours. \nBased on a bodyweight comparison, the human equivalent dose (0.2 mg/kg dexfenfluramine) is less \nthan the maximum recommended human dose of Fintepla. \n \nReproduction and development \n \nFenfluramine and norfenfluramine crossed the placenta in pregnant rats and rabbits. Plasma exposures \nwere higher in rat foetuses than in the dams, while plasma exposures in rabbits were comparable \nbetween does and foetuses; however the effects in human foetuses are unknown. \n \nIn an embryofoetal development study in rats, decreased foetal body weight and increased incidences \nof external and skeletal malformations were observed at the high dose level in association with \nmaternal toxicity. No foetal abnormalities were noted at exposures at least five-fold the plasma AUC \nin humans administered the maximum recommended therapeutic dose of Fintepla. \n \nNo fenfluramine-related external, visceral or skeletal malformations or variations were determined in \nan embryofoetal development study in rabbits but increased post-implantation losses were evident at \nall doses secondarily to fenfluramine maternal toxicity (body weight loss and decreased food \nconsumption). Additional clinical signs of dilated pupils and increased respiration rate and tremors \nwere observed. Plasma exposures (AUC) in rabbits were below those in humans at the maximum \nrecommended therapeutic dose of Fintepla. \n \nIn a pre- and post-natal study in rats, maternal toxicity was associated with an increase in stillbirths at \nthe high dose. No adverse effects on the F0 and F1 generations were confirmed at five-fold higher \n\n\n\n15 \n\nplasma exposures (AUC) than in humans at the maximum recommended therapeutic dose of Fintepla. \nIn the first generation of offspring, there were no effects on overall reproductive function.  \n \nFenfluramine did not affect the reproductive performance of male rats. In female rats, a reduction in \nthe fertility index (defined by the proportion of matings that resulted in pregnancies) was observed at \nmaternally toxic doses that correlated with less corpora lutea, significantly fewer implantation sites \nand a higher percentage of pre- and post-implantation losses. No effects on the fertility index were \nnoticed at plasma exposures (AUC) approximately equivalent to those in humans at the maximum \nrecommended therapeutic dose of Fintepla. \n  \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n30 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nFintepla 2.2 mg/mL oral solution \nfenfluramine \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you or your child may experience. See \nthe end of section 4 for how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you or your child starts taking this medicine because it \n\ncontains important information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you or your child only. Do not pass it on to others. It may \n\nharm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours or your child’s. \n- If you or your child experience any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This \n\nincludes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Fintepla is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Fintepla \n3. How to take Fintepla  \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Fintepla \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Fintepla is and what it is used for \n \nFintepla contains the active substance fenfluramine.  \n \nFintepla is used to treat seizures (fits) in patients aged 2 years and over who have a type of epilepsy \ncalled Dravet syndrome. It can help to reduce the number and severity of seizures. \n \nIt is not completely known how Fintepla works. However, it is thought to work by increasing the \nactivity in the brain of a natural substance called serotonin, and this may reduce seizures. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you or your child takes Fintepla \n \nDo not take Fintepla if:  \n• you or your child are allergic to fenfluramine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6) \n• you or your child have a heart problem such as ‘valve disease’ or ‘pulmonary arterial \n\nhypertension’ (high pressure in the arteries of the lungs)  \n• you or your child have taken medicines called monoamine oxidase inhibitors in the last \n\n2 weeks. \n \nDo not take Fintepla if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse before taking Fintepla. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Fintepla if: \n• you or your child have glaucoma \n• you or your child have had thoughts about harming or killing yourself \n\n\n\n31 \n\n• you or your child are taking a medicine called cyproheptadine, which is used to treat allergies or \nto improve appetite. \n \n\nIf any of the above applies to you or your child (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse before taking Fintepla. \n \nTests and checks \nBefore you or your child start taking Fintepla your doctor must check the heart with an \nechocardiogram (ECHO). The doctor will check that the valves in the heart work properly and the \npressure in the artery between the heart and lungs is not too high. Once you or your child has started \ntaking Fintepla, you will have an echocardiogram check every 6 months for the first 2 years and then \nonce a year. If Fintepla treatment is stopped, you or your child will need to have an echocardiogram \n6 months after the last dose. \n \nYour doctor should also check your weight before and during your treatment as Fintepla can cause you \nto lose weight. \n \n‘Serotonin syndrome’ \nTell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Fintepla if you or your child are taking medicines which \ncan increase the levels of serotonin in your brain. This is because taking these medicines and Fintepla \ncan cause serotonin syndrome, which is a life-threatening condition. Medicines that can increase \nserotonin levels include: \n• ‘triptans’ (such as sumatriptan) – used for migraine \n• MAOI medicines – used for depression \n• SSRI or SNRI medicines – used for depression and anxiety. \n \nLook out for the signs of serotonin syndrome which include: \n• being agitated, seeing things which are not there (hallucinations) or passing out \n• heart and circulation problems such as fast heartbeat, blood pressure going up and down, high \n\nbody temperature, sweating \n• twitching muscles and being uncoordinated \n• feeling or being sick and diarrhoea. \n\n \nTell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the serious side effects above. \n \nOther medicines and Fintepla \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken, or might take any \nother medicines. This is because Fintepla can affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some \nother medicines can affect the way Fintepla works.  \n \nFintepla can make you or your child feel sleepy. You or your child may be even more sleepy if you \ntake other medicines such as anti-depressants or alcohol at the same time as Fintepla. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking, have recently taken, or \nmight take: \n• stiripentol, a medicine for epilepsy, as your dose of Fintepla may need to be reduced \n• ‘triptans’, MAOI, SNRI or SSRI medicines – see above under ‘Serotonin syndrome’ \n• carbamazepine, primidone, rifampicin, phenobarbital and other barbiturates, phenytoin, and \n\nefavirenz, as your dose of Fintepla may need to be increased. \n \nAlso speak with your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child smoke as the dose of Fintepla may \nneed to be increased. \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you or your child are pregnant, think you or your child might be pregnant, or are planning to have a \nbaby or are breast-feeding, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nTalk to your doctor about driving, using machines, or if you or your child undertake activities such as \ncycling or other sports, because you or your child may feel sleepy after taking this medicine. \n \nFintepla contains sodium ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate (E 215) and sodium methyl p-\nhydroxybenzoate (E 219)  \nThis may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). \n \nFintepla contains sulfur dioxide (E 220)  \nThis may rarely cause hypersensitivity reactions and bronchospasm. \n \nFintepla contains glucose \nThis may be harmful to the teeth. \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicinal product. \n \nFintepla contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 12 mL, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to take Fintepla \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with them \nif you are not sure.  \n \nHow much to take \n• You will be told how many mL to take for each dose. \n• Take the medicine twice a day. \n• Your doctor will start you or your child on a low dose. This can then be gradually increased \n\ndepending on how well the medicine works and how it affects you or your child. \n• The maximum amount you can take is 6 mL twice a day. \n• If you are taking stiripentol, the maximum amount you can take is 4 mL twice a day. \n• Do not take more than the prescribed dose as it may cause serious side effects. \n \nTaking this medicine \n• Take this medicine by mouth. \n• Take the medicine with food or between meals. \n• Fintepla oral solution is compatible with a ketogenic diet. \n• The medicine is a liquid. Use the oral syringes provided to measure your dose, as explained below. \n• Use the green 3 mL syringe for doses up to 3.0 mL. \n• Use the purple 6 mL syringe for doses between 3.2 mL and 6.0 mL. \n• Fintepla oral solution is compatible with most enteral feeding tubes. \n• To flush the feeding tube, fill the syringe used for dosing with water and flush the tube. Do this 3 \n\ntimes.  \n  \n\n\n\n33 \n\n3 mL syringe - green 6 mL syringe - purple \n\n \n\n \n \n \n  \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n \n\n \n\nWrite on the carton the date you first opened \nthe bottle. \nYou must attach the bottle adaptor the first \ntime you open the bottle. The following \ninstructions tell you how to attach the \nadaptor. \nInserting the bottle adaptor: \nWhen the bottle is first opened the bottle \nadaptor must be pushed into the bottle. \nWash and dry your hands. \nRemove the bottle adaptor from its \npackaging. \nPlace the bottle on a flat, firm surface. \nOpen the bottle. \n \n\n \n\nHold the bottle firmly. \nLine up the bottle adapter with the open top \nof the bottle. \nPush the bottle adaptor into the bottle with \nyour palm until the adaptor is flush with the \ntop of the bottle. \nLeave in the bottle adaptor after using the \nmedicine. \nScrew the bottle cap onto the bottle with the \nbottle adaptor left in. \n\n \n\nTaking the medicine: \nBefore you measure out the dose, make sure \nthe plunger is pushed all the way into the oral \nsyringe. \nHold the bottle of medicine firmly on a hard, \nflat surface. \nPush the tip of the oral syringe into the bottle \nadaptor until it cannot be pushed further. \n \n\n \n\nHold the oral syringe and bottle together and \nturn upside down. \nSlowly pull the plunger to draw up the right \ndose. \nHold the oral syringe and bottle together and \nthen turn over. \nHolding the bottle firmly, gently pull the oral \nsyringe out of the bottle adaptor. \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\n \n\nPlace the tip of the oral syringe against the \ninside of the patient’s cheek. \nGently push the plunger until it is fully \npressed. There will be a small volume left in \nthe tip of the syringe. This is normal. \nDo not squirt the medicine into the back of \nthe throat as this may cause choking. \n\n \n\nPlace the cap back on the bottle and turn until \nit stops.  \nAlways leave the adaptor in place in the \nbottle. \n\n \n\nCleaning the syringe: \nRinse the oral syringe with clean water and \nallow it to air dry after each use.  \nRinse the inside of the syringe and the \nplunger. \nClean water can be pulled into the syringe \nwith the plunger and pushed out several \ntimes to clean the syringe. \nIt is okay to separate the plunger from the \nsyringe to rinse each part. \nIt is safe to clean the syringe and plunger in a \ndishwasher. \nThe syringe and plunger must be completely \ndry before the next use. \n\n \nIf you or your child take more Fintepla than you or your child should \nTalk to a doctor or go to a hospital straight away.
