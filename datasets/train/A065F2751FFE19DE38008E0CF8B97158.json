NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \nTractocile 6.75 mg/0.9 ml solution for injection \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \nEach vial of 0.9 ml solution contains 6.75 mg atosiban (as acetate).  \n\n \n\nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \nSolution for injection (injection). \n\nClear, colourless solution without particles. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \nTractocile is indicated to delay imminent pre-term birth in pregnant adult women with: \n\n\uf02d regular uterine contractions of at least 30 seconds duration at a rate of \uf0b3 4 per 30 minutes \n\n\uf02d a cervical dilation of 1 to 3 cm (0-3 for nulliparas) and effacement of \uf0b3 50% \n\n\uf02d a gestational age from 24 until 33 completed weeks \n\n\uf02d a normal foetal heart rate \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \nTreatment with Tractocile should be initiated and maintained by a physician experienced in the treatment of \n\npre-term labour. \n\n \n\nTractocile is administered intravenously in three successive stages: an initial bolus dose (6.75 mg), \n\nperformed with Tractocile 6.75 mg/0.9 ml solution for injection, immediately followed by a continuous high \n\ndose infusion (loading infusion 300 micrograms/min) of Tractocile 37.5 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for \n\ninfusion during three hours, followed by a lower dose of Tractocile 37.5 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for \n\ninfusion (subsequent infusion 100 micrograms/min) up to 45 hours. The duration of the treatment should not \n\nexceed 48 hours. The total dose given during a full course of Tractocile therapy should preferably not exceed \n\n330.75 mg of atosiban. \n\n \n\nIntravenous therapy using the initial bolus injection should be started as soon as possible after diagnosis of \n\npre-term labour. Once the bolus has been injected, proceed with the infusion (See Summary of Product \n\nCharacteristics of Tractocile 37.5 mg/5 ml, concentrate for solution for infusion). In the case of persistence \n\nof uterine contractions during treatment with Tractocile, alternative therapy should be considered. \n\n \n\nThe following table shows the full posology of the bolus injection followed by the infusion: \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nStep Regimen Infusion rate Atosiban dose \n\n1 0.9 ml intravenous bolus \n\ninjection given over 1 minute \n\nNot applicable 6.75 mg \n\n2 3 hours intravenous loading \n\ninfusion \n\n24 ml/hour (300 \u00b5g/min) 54 mg \n\n3 Up to 45 hours subsequent \n\nintravenous infusion \n\n8 ml/hour (100 \u00b5g/min) Up to 270 mg \n\n \n\nRe-treatment: \n\nIn case a re-treatment with atosiban is needed, it should also commence with a bolus injection of Tractocile \n\n6.75 mg/0.9 ml, solution for injection followed by infusion with Tractocile 37.5 mg/5 ml, concentrate for \n\nsolution for infusion. \n\n \n\nPatients with renal or hepatic impairment \n\nThere is no experience with atosiban treatment in patients with impaired function of the liver or kidneys. \n\nRenal impairment is not likely to warrant a dose adjustment, since only a small extent of atosiban is excreted \n\nin the urine. In patients with impaired hepatic function, atosiban should be used with caution. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Tractocile in pregnant women aged less than 18 years have not been established.  \n\nNo data are available. \n\n \nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nFor instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \nTractocile must not be used in the following conditions: \n\n \n\n\uf02d Gestational age below 24 or over 33 completed weeks \n\n\uf02d Premature rupture of the membranes >30 weeks of gestation \n\n\uf02d Abnormal foetal heart rate \n\n\uf02d Antepartum uterine haemorrhage requiring immediate delivery \n\n\uf02d Eclampsia and severe pre-eclampsia requiring delivery \n\n\uf02d Intrauterine foetal death \n\n\uf02d Suspected intrauterine infection \n\n\uf02d Placenta praevia \n\n\uf02d Abruptio placenta \n\n\uf02d Any other conditions of the mother or foetus, in which continuation of pregnancy is hazardous \n\n\uf02d Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nWhen atosiban is used in patients in whom premature rupture of membranes cannot be excluded, the benefits \n\nof delaying delivery should be balanced against the potential risk of chorioamnionitis. \n\n \n\nThere is no experience with atosiban treatment in patients with impaired function of the liver or kidneys. \n\nRenal impairment is not likely to warrant a dose adjustment, since only a small extent of atosiban is excreted \n\nin the urine. In patients with impaired hepatic function, atosiban should be used with caution (see sections \n\n4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nThere is only limited clinical experience in the use of atosiban in multiple pregnancies or the gestational age \n\ngroup between 24 and 27 weeks, because of the small number of patients treated. The benefit of atosiban in \n\nthese subgroups is therefore uncertain. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nRe-treatment with Tractocile is possible, but there is only limited clinical experience available with multiple \n\nre-treatments, up to 3 re-treatments (see section 4.2). \n\nIn case of intrauterine growth retardation, the decision to continue or reinitiate the administration of \n\nTractocile depends on the assessment of fetal maturity. \n\n \n\nMonitoring of uterine contractions and fetal heart rate during administration of atosiban and in case of \n\npersistent uterine contractions should be considered. \n\nAs an antagonist of oxytocin, atosiban may theoretically facilitate uterine relaxation and postpartum bleeding \n\ntherefore blood loss after delivery should be monitored. However, inadequate uterus contraction postpartum \n\nwas not observed during the clinical trials. \n\n \n\nMultiple pregnancy and medicinal products with tocolytic activity like calcium channel blockers and beta-\n\nmimetics are known to be associated with increased risk of pulmonary oedema. Therefore, atosiban should \n\nbe used with caution in case of multiple pregnancy and/or concomitant administration of other medicinal \n\nproducts with tocolytic activity (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nIt is unlikely that atosiban is involved in cytochrome P450 mediated drug-drug interactions as in vitro \n\ninvestigations have shown that atosiban is not a substrate for the cytochrome P450 system, and does not \n\ninhibit the drug metabolising cytochrome P450 enzymes. \n\n \n\nInteraction studies have been performed with labetalol and betamethasone in healthy, female \n\nvolunteers. No clinically relevant interaction was found between atosiban and bethamethasone or labetalol. \n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nAtosiban should only be used when pre-term labour has been diagnosed between 24 and 33 completed weeks \n\nof gestation. If during pregnancy the woman is already breast-feeding an earlier child, then breast-feeding \n\nshould be discontinued during treatment with Tractocile, since the release of oxytocin during breast-feeding \n\nmay augment uterine contractility, and may counteract the effect of tocolytic therapy. \n\n \n\nIn atosiban clinical trials no effects were observed on breast-feeding. Small amounts of atosiban have been \n\nshown to pass from plasma into the breast milk of breast-feeding women. \n\n \n\nEmbryo-fetal toxicity studies have not shown toxic effects of atosiban. No studies were performed that \n\ncovered fertility and early embryonic development (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \nNot relevant. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \nPossible adverse reactions of atosiban were described for the mother during the use of atosiban in clinical \n\ntrials. In total 48% of the patients treated with atosiban experienced adverse reactions during the clinical \n\ntrials. The observed adverse reactions were generally of a mild severity. The most commonly reported \n\nadverse reaction in the mother is nausea (14 %).  \n\n \n\nFor the newborn, the clinical trials did not reveal any specific adverse reactions of atosiban. The infant \n\nadverse reactions were in the range of normal variation and were comparable with both placebo and beta-\n\nmimetic group incidences. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: Very common \n\n(\u22651/10); Common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); Uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000). \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nMedDRA System Organ \n\nClass (SOC) \n\nVery \n\ncommon \n\nCommon Uncommon Rare \n\nImmune system disorders    Allergic reaction \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \n\ndisorders  \n\n Hyperglycaemia   \n\nPsychiatric disorder   Insomnia  \n\nNervous system disorders  Headache, \n\nDizziness \n\n  \n\nCardiac disorders  Tachycardia   \n\nVascular disorders  Hypotension, \n\nHot flush \n\n  \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea Vomiting   \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\n  Pruritis, \n\nRash \n\n \n\nReproductive system and \n\nbreast disorder \n\n   Uterine haemorrhage, \n\nuterine atony \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site \n\nconditions \n\n Injection site \n\nreaction  \n\nPyrexia  \n\n \n\nPost-marketing experience \n\n \n\nRespiratory events like dyspnoea and pulmonary oedema, particularly in association with concomitant \n\nadministration of other medicinal products with tocolytic activity, like calcium antagonists and beta-\n\nmimetics, and/or in women with multiple pregnancy, have been reported post-marketing. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \n\nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \nFew cases of atosiban overdosing were reported, they occurred without any specific signs or symptoms. \n\nThere is no known specific treatment in case of an overdose. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other gynecologicals, ATC code: G02CX01 \n\n \n\nTractocile contains atosiban (INN), a synthetic peptide ([Mpa1,D-Tyr(Et)2,Thr4,Orn8]-oxytocin) which is a \n\ncompetitive antagonist of human oxytocin at receptor level. In rats and guinea pigs, atosiban was shown to \n\nbind to oxytocin receptors, to decrease the frequency of contractions and the tone of the uterine musculature, \n\nresulting in a suppression of uterine contractions. Atosiban was also shown to bind to the vasopressin \n\nreceptor, thus inhibiting the effect of vasopressin. In animals atosiban did not exhibit cardiovascular effects. \n\n \n\nIn human pre-term labour, atosiban at the recommended dosage antagonises uterine contractions and induces \n\nuterine quiescence. The onset of uterus relaxation following atosiban is rapid, uterine contractions being \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n\nsignificantly reduced within 10 minutes to achieve stable uterine quiescence (\uf0a3 4 contractions/hour) for \n12 hours. \n\n \n\nPhase III clinical trials (CAP-001 studies) include data from 742 women who were diagnosed with pre-term \n\nlabour at 23\u201333 weeks of gestation and were randomised to receive either atosiban (according to this \n\nlabelling) or \uf062-agonist (dose-titrated). \n\n \n\nPrimary endpoint: the primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of women remaining undelivered and \n\nnot requiring alternative tocolysis within 7 days of treatment initiation. The data show that 59.6% (n=201) \n\nand 47.7% (n=163) of atosiban- and \uf062-agonist-treated women (p=0.0004), respectively, were undelivered \n\nand did not require alternative tocolysis within 7 days of starting treatment. Most of the treatment failures in \n\nCAP-001 were caused by poor tolerability. Treatment failures caused by insufficient efficacy were \n\nsignificantly (p=0.0003) more frequent in atosiban (n=48, 14.2%) than in the \uf062-agonist-treated women \n\n(n=20, 5.8%). \n\nIn the CAP-001 studies the probability of remaining undelivered and not requiring alternative tocolytics \n\nwithin 7 days of treatment initiation was similar for atosiban and beta-mimetics treated women at gestational \n\nage of 24-28 weeks. However, this finding is based on a very small sample (n=129 patients). \n\n \n\nSecondary endpoints: secondary efficacy parameters included the proportion of women remaining \n\nundelivered within 48 h of treatment initiation. There was no difference between the atosiban and beta-\n\nmimetic groups with regard to this parameter. \n\n \n\nMean (SD) gestational age at delivery was the same in the two groups: 35.6 (3.9) and 35.3 (4.2) weeks for \n\nthe atosiban and \uf062-agonist groups, respectively (p=0.37). Admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) \n\nwas similar for both treatment groups (approximately 30%), as was length of stay and ventilation therapy. \n\nMean (SD) birth weight was 2491 (813) grams in the atosiban group and 2461 (831) grams in the \uf062-agonist \n\ngroup (p=0.58). \n\n \n\nFetal and maternal outcome did apparently not differ between the atosiban and the \uf062-agonist group, but the \n\nclinical studies were not powered enough to rule out a possible difference. \n\n \n\nOf the 361 women who received atosiban treatment in the phase III studies, 73 received at least one re-\n\ntreatment, 8 received at least 2 re-treatments and 2 received 3 re-treatments (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAs the safety and efficacy of atosiban in women with a gestational age of less than 24 completed weeks has \n\nnot been established in controlled randomised studies, the treatment of this patient group with atosiban is not \n\nrecommended (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nIn a placebo-controlled study, fetal/infant deaths were 5/295 (1.7%) in the placebo group and 15/288 (5.2%) \n\nin the atosiban group, of which two occurred at five and eight months of age. Eleven out of the 15 deaths in \n\nthe atosiban group occurred in pregnancies with a gestational age of 20 to 24 weeks, although in this \n\nsubgroup patient distribution was unequal (19 women on atosiban, 4 on placebo). For women with a \n\ngestational age greater than 24 weeks there was no difference in mortality rate (1.7% in the placebo group \n\nand 1.5% in the atosiban group). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \nIn healthy non-pregnant subjects receiving atosiban infusions (10 to 300 micrograms/min over 12 hours), the \n\nsteady state plasma concentrations increased proportionally to the dose. \n\n \n\nThe clearance, volume of distribution and half-life were found to be independent of the dose. \n\n \n\nIn women in pre-term labour receiving atosiban by infusion (300 micrograms/min for 6 to 12 hours), steady \n\nstate plasma concentrations were reached within one hour following the start of the infusion (mean 442 \n\n\u00b1 73 ng/ml, range 298 to 533 ng/ml). \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nFollowing completion of the infusion, plasma concentration rapidly declined with an initial (t\u03b1) and terminal \n\n(t\u03b2) half-life of 0.21 \u00b1 0.01 and 1.7 \u00b1 0.3 hours, respectively. Mean value for clearance was 41.8 \n\n\u00b1 8.2 litres/h. Mean value of volume of distribution was 18.3 \u00b1 6.8 litres. \n\n \n\nPlasma protein binding of atosiban is 46 to 48% in pregnant women. It is not known whether the free \n\nfraction in the maternal and fetal compartments differs substantially. Atosiban does not partition into red \n\nblood cells. \n\n \n\nAtosiban passes the placenta. Following an infusion of 300 micrograms/min in healthy pregnant women at \n\nterm, the fetal/maternal atosiban concentration ratio was 0.12. \n\nTwo metabolites were identified in the plasma and urine from human subjects. The ratios of the main \n\nmetabolite M1 (des-(Orn8, Gly-NH29)-[Mpa1, D-Tyr(Et)2, Thr4]-oxytocin) to atosiban concentrations in \n\nplasma were 1.4 and 2.8 at the second hour and at the end of the infusion respectively. It is not known \n\nwhether M1 accumulates in tissues. Atosiban is found in only small quantities in urine, its urinary \n\nconcentration is about 50 times lower than that of M1. The proportion of atosiban eliminated in faeces is not \n\nknown. The main metabolite M1 is approximately 10 times less potent than atosiban in inhibiting oxytocin-\n\ninduced uterine contractions in vitro. Metabolite M1 is excreted in milk (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\nThere is no experience with atosiban treatment in patients with impaired function of the liver or kidneys. \n\nRenal impairment is not likely to warrant a dose adjustment, since only a small extent of atosiban is excreted \n\nin the urine. In patients with impaired hepatic function, atosiban should be used with caution (see sections \n\n4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nIt is unlikely that atosiban inhibits hepatic cytochrome P450 isoforms in humans (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \nNo systemic toxic effects were observed during the two-week intravenous toxicity studies (in rats and dogs) \n\nat doses which are approximately 10 times higher than the human therapeutic dose, and during the three-\n\nmonths toxicity studies in rats and dogs (up to 20 mg/kg/day s.c.). The highest atosiban subcutaneous dose \n\nnot producing any adverse effects was approximately two times the therapeutic human dose. \n\n \n\nNo studies were performed that covered fertility and early embryonic development. Reproduction toxicity \n\nstudies, with dosing from implantation up to late stage pregnancy, showed no effects on mothers and fetuses. \n\nThe exposure of the rat fetus was approximately four times that received by the human fetus during \n\nintravenous infusions in women. Animal studies have shown inhibition of lactation as expected from the \n\ninhibition of action of oxytocin. \n\n \n\nAtosiban was neither oncogenic nor mutagenic in in vitro and in vivo tests. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

The benefit of atosiban in \n\nthese subgroups is therefore uncertain. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nRe-treatment with Tractocile is possible, but there is only limited clinical experience available with multiple \n\nre-treatments, up to 3 re-treatments (see section 4.2). \n\nIn case of intrauterine growth retardation, the decision to continue or reinitiate the administration of \n\nTractocile depends on the assessment of fetal maturity. \n\n \n\nMonitoring of uterine contractions and fetal heart rate during administration of atosiban and in case of \n\npersistent uterine contractions should be considered. \n\n \n\nAs an antagonist of oxytocin, atosiban may theoretically facilitate uterine relaxation and postpartum bleeding \n\ntherefore blood loss after delivery should be monitored. However, inadequate uterus contraction postpartum \n\nwas not observed during the clinical trials. \n\n \n\nMultiple pregnancy and medicinal products with tocolytic activity like calcium channel blockers and beta-\n\nmimetics are known to be associated with increased risk of pulmonary oedema. Therefore, atosiban should \n\nbe used with caution in case of multiple pregnancy and/or concomitant administration of other medicinal \n\nproducts with tocolytic activity (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \nIt is unlikely that atosiban is involved in cytochrome P450 mediated drug-drug interactions as in vitro \n\ninvestigations have shown that atosiban is not a substrate for the cytochrome P450 system, and does not \n\ninhibit the drug metabolising cytochrome P450 enzymes. \n\n \n\nInteraction studies have been performed with labetalol and betamethasone in healthy, female \n\nvolunteers. No clinically relevant interaction was found between atosiban and bethamethasone or labetalol. \n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nAtosiban should only be used when pre-term labour has been diagnosed between 24 and 33 completed weeks \n\nof gestation. If during pregnancy the woman is already breast-feeding an earlier child, then breast-feeding \n\nshould be discontinued during treatment with Tractocile, since the release of oxytocin during breast-feeding \n\nmay augment uterine contractility, and may counteract the effect of tocolytic therapy. \n \n\nIn atosiban clinical trials no effects were observed on breast-feeding. Small amounts of atosiban have been \n\nshown to pass from plasma into the breast milk of breast-feeding women. \n\n \n\nEmbryo-fetal toxicity studies have not shown toxic effects of atosiban. No studies were performed that \n\ncovered fertility and early embryonic development (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \nNot relevant. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \nPossible adverse reactions of atosiban were described for the mother during the use of atosiban in clinical \n\ntrials. In total 48% of the patients treated with atosiban experienced adverse reactions during the clinical \n\ntrials. The observed adverse reactions were generally of a mild severity. The most commonly reported \n\nadverse reaction in the mother is nausea (14 %).  \n\n \n\nFor the newborn, the clinical trials did not reveal any specific adverse reactions of atosiban. The infant \n\nadverse reactions were in the range of normal variation and were comparable with both placebo and beta-\n\nmimetic group incidences. \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: Very common \n\n(\u22651/10); Common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); Uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000). \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nMedDRA System Organ \n\nClass (SOC) \n\nVery \n\ncommon \n\nCommon Uncommon Rare \n\nImmune system disorders    Allergic reaction \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \n\ndisorders  \n\n Hyperglycaemia   \n\nPsychiatric disorder   Insomnia  \n\nNervous system disorders  Headache, \n\nDizziness \n\n  \n\nCardiac disorders  Tachycardia   \n\nVascular disorders  Hypotension, \n\nHot flush \n\n  \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea Vomiting   \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\n  Pruritis, \n\nRash \n\n \n\nReproductive system and \n\nbreast disorder \n\n   Uterine haemorrhage, \n\nuterine atony \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site \n\nconditions \n\n Injection site \n\nreaction  \n\nPyrexia  \n\n \n\nPost-marketing experience \n\n \n\nRespiratory events like dyspnoea and pulmonary oedema, particularly in association with concomitant \n\nadministration of other medicinal products with tocolytic activity, like calcium antagonists and beta-\n\nmimetics, and/or in women with multiple pregnancy, have been reported post-marketing. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \n\nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \nFew cases of atosiban overdosing were reported, they occurred without any specific signs or symptoms. \n\nThere is no known specific treatment in case of an overdose. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other gynecologicals, ATC code: G02CX01 \n\n \n\nTractocile contains atosiban (INN), a synthetic peptide ([Mpa1,D-Tyr(Et)2,Thr4,Orn8]-oxytocin) which is a \n\ncompetitive antagonist of human oxytocin at receptor level. In rats and guinea pigs, atosiban was shown to \n\nbind to oxytocin receptors, to decrease the frequency of contractions and the tone of the uterine musculature, \n\nresulting in a suppression of uterine contractions. Atosiban was also shown to bind to the vasopressin \n\nreceptor, thus inhibiting the effect of vasopressin. In animals atosiban did not exhibit cardiovascular effects. \n\n \n\nIn human pre-term labour, atosiban at the recommended dosage antagonises uterine contractions and induces \n\nuterine quiescence. The onset of uterus relaxation following atosiban is rapid, uterine contractions being \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13 \n\nsignificantly reduced within 10 minutes to achieve stable uterine quiescence (\uf0a3 4 contractions/hour) for \n12 hours. \n\n \n\nPhase III clinical trials (CAP-001 studies) include data from 742 women who were diagnosed with pre-term \n\nlabour at 23\u201333 weeks of gestation and were randomised to receive either atosiban (according to this \n\nlabelling) or \uf062-agonist (dose-titrated). \n\n \n\nPrimary endpoint: the primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of women remaining undelivered and \n\nnot requiring alternative tocolysis within 7 days of treatment initiation. The data show that 59.6% (n=201) \n\nand 47.7% (n=163) of atosiban- and \uf062-agonist-treated women (p=0.0004), respectively, were undelivered \n\nand did not require alternative tocolysis within 7 days of starting treatment. Most of the treatment failures in \n\nCAP-001 were caused by poor tolerability. Treatment failures caused by insufficient efficacy were \n\nsignificantly (p=0.0003) more frequent in atosiban (n=48, 14.2%) than in the \uf062-agonist-treated women \n\n(n=20, 5.8%). \n\nIn the CAP-001 studies the probability of remaining undelivered and not requiring alternative tocolytics \n\nwithin 7 days of treatment initiation was similar for atosiban and beta-mimetics treated women at gestational \n\nage of 24-28 weeks. However, this finding is based on a very small sample (n=129 patients). \n\n \n\nSecondary endpoints: secondary efficacy parameters included the proportion of women remaining \n\nundelivered within 48 h of treatment initiation. There was no difference between the atosiban and beta-\n\nmimetic groups with regard to this parameter. \n\n \n\nMean (SD) gestational age at delivery was the same in the two groups: 35.6 (3.9) and 35.3 (4.2) weeks for \n\nthe atosiban and \uf062-agonist groups, respectively (p=0.37). Admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) \n\nwas similar for both treatment groups (approximately 30%), as was length of stay and ventilation therapy. \n\nMean (SD) birth weight was 2491 (813) grams in the atosiban group and 2461 (831) grams in the \uf062-agonist \n\ngroup (p=0.58). \n\n \n\nFetal and maternal outcome did apparently not differ between the atosiban and the \uf062-agonist group, but the \n\nclinical studies were not powered enough to rule out a possible difference. \n\n \n\nOf the 361 women who received atosiban treatment in the phase III studies, 73 received at least one re-\n\ntreatment, 8 received at least 2 re-treatments and 2 received 3 re-treatments (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAs the safety and efficacy of atosiban in women with a gestational age of less than 24 completed weeks has \n\nnot been established in controlled randomised studies, the treatment of this patient group with atosiban is not \n\nrecommended (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nIn a placebo-controlled study, fetal/infant deaths were 5/295 (1.7%) in the placebo group and 15/288 (5.2%) \n\nin the atosiban group, of which two occurred at five and eight months of age. Eleven out of the 15 deaths in \n\nthe atosiban group occurred in pregnancies with a gestational age of 20 to 24 weeks, although in this \n\nsubgroup patient distribution was unequal (19 women on atosiban, 4 on placebo). For women with a \n\ngestational age greater than 24 weeks there was no difference in mortality rate (1.7% in the placebo group \n\nand 1.5% in the atosiban group). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \nIn healthy non-pregnant subjects receiving atosiban infusions (10 to 300 micrograms/min over 12 hours), the \n\nsteady state plasma concentrations increased proportionally to the dose. \n\n \n\nThe clearance, volume of distribution and half-life were found to be independent of the dose. \n\n \n\nIn women in pre-term labour receiving atosiban by infusion (300 micrograms/min for 6 to 12 hours), steady \n\nstate plasma concentrations were reached within one hour following the start of the infusion (mean 442 \n\n\u00b1 73 ng/ml, range 298 to 533 ng/ml). \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nFollowing completion of the infusion, plasma concentration rapidly declined with an initial (t\u03b1) and terminal \n\n(t\u03b2) half-life of 0.21 \u00b1 0.01 and 1.7 \u00b1 0.3 hours, respectively. Mean value for clearance was 41.8 \n\n\u00b1 8.2 litres/h. Mean value of volume of distribution was 18.3 \u00b1 6.8 litres. \n\n \n\nPlasma protein binding of atosiban is 46 to 48% in pregnant women. It is not known whether the free \n\nfraction in the maternal and fetal compartments differs substantially. Atosiban does not partition into red \n\nblood cells. \n\n \n\nAtosiban passes the placenta. Following an infusion of 300 micrograms/min in healthy pregnant women at \n\nterm, the fetal/maternal atosiban concentration ratio was 0.12. \n\nTwo metabolites were identified in the plasma and urine from human subjects. The ratios of the main \n\nmetabolite M1 (des-(Orn8, Gly-NH29)-[Mpa1, D-Tyr(Et)2, Thr4]-oxytocin) to atosiban concentrations in \n\nplasma were 1.4 and 2.8 at the second hour and at the end of the infusion respectively. It is not known \n\nwhether M1 accumulates in tissues. Atosiban is found in only small quantities in urine, its urinary \n\nconcentration is about 50 times lower than that of M1. The proportion of atosiban eliminated in faeces is not \n\nknown. The main metabolite M1 is approximately 10 times less potent than atosiban in inhibiting oxytocin-\n\ninduced uterine contractions in vitro. Metabolite M1 is excreted in milk (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\nThere is no experience with atosiban treatment in patients with impaired function of the liver or kidneys. \n\nRenal impairment is not likely to warrant a dose adjustment, since only a small extent of atosiban is excreted \n\nin the urine. In patients with impaired hepatic function, atosiban should be used with caution (see sections \n\n4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nIt is unlikely that atosiban inhibits hepatic cytochrome P450 isoforms in humans (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \nNo systemic toxic effects were observed during the two-week intravenous toxicity studies (in rats and dogs) \n\nat doses which are approximately 10 times higher than the human therapeutic dose, and during the three-\n\nmonths toxicity studies in rats and dogs (up to 20 mg/kg/day s.c.). The highest atosiban subcutaneous dose \n\nnot producing any adverse effects was approximately two times the therapeutic human dose. \n\n \n\nNo studies were performed that covered fertility and early embryonic development. Reproduction toxicity \n\nstudies, with dosing from implantation up to late stage pregnancy, showed no effects on mothers and fetuses. \n\nThe exposure of the rat fetus was approximately four times that received by the human fetus during \n\nintravenous infusions in women. Animal studies have shown inhibition of lactation as expected from the \n\ninhibition of action of oxytocin. \n\n \n\nAtosiban was neither oncogenic nor mutagenic in in vitro and in vivo tests. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Replace it by 10 ml Tractocile \n\n37.5 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion from two 5 ml vials to obtain a concentration of 75 mg \n\natosiban in 100 ml. \n\n \n\nThe reconstituted product is a clear, colourless solution without particles. \n\n \n\nThe loading infusion is given by infusing 24 ml/hour (i.e. 18 mg/h) of the above prepared solution over the \n\n3 hour period under adequate medical supervision in an obstetric unit. After three hours the infusion rate is \n\nreduced to 8 ml/hour. \n\n \n\nPrepare new 100 ml bags in the same way as described to allow the infusion to be continued. \n\n \n\nIf an infusion bag with a different volume is used, a proportional calculation should be made for the \n\npreparation. \n\n \n\nTo achieve accurate dosing, a controlled infusion device is recommended to adjust the rate of flow in \n\ndrops/min. An intravenous microdrip chamber can provide a convenient range of infusion rates within the \n\nrecommended dose levels for Tractocile. \n\n \n\nIf other medicinal products need to be given intravenously at the same time, the intravenous cannula can be \n\nshared or another site of intravenous administration can be used. This permits the continued independent \n\ncontrol of the rate of infusion. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, midwife or pharmacist. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

What you need to know before you are given Tractocile  \n\n3. How Tractocile will be given  \n\n4. Possible side effects  \n\n5. How to store Tractocile  \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n1. What Tractocile is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nTractocile contains atosiban. Tractocile can be used to delay the premature birth of your baby. Tractocile is \n\nused in pregnant adult women, from week 24 to week 33 of the pregnancy.  \n\n \n\nTractocile works by making the contractions in your womb (uterus) less strong. It also makes the \n\ncontractions happen less often. It does this by blocking the effect of a natural hormone in your body called \n\n\u201coxytocin\u201d which causes your womb (uterus) to contract. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Tractocile  \n\n \n\nDo not use Tractocile: \n\n- if you are less than 24 weeks pregnant. \n\n- if you are more than 33 weeks pregnant. \n\n- if your waters have broken (premature rupture of your membranes) and you have completed 30 weeks \n\nof your pregnancy or more. \n\n- if your unborn baby (foetus) has an abnormal heart rate. \n\n- if you have bleeding from your vagina and your doctor wants your unborn baby to be delivered \n\nstraight away.  \n\n- if you have something called \u201csevere pre-eclampsia\u201d and your doctor wants your unborn baby to be \n\ndelivered straight away. Severe pre-eclampsia is when you have very high blood pressure, fluid \n\nretention and/or protein in your urine. \n\n- if you have something called \u201ceclampsia\u201d which is similar to \u201csevere pre-eclampsia\u201d but you would \n\nalso have fits (convulsions). This will mean your unborn baby needs to be delivered straight away. \n\n- if your unborn baby has died. \n\n- if you have or could have an infection of your womb (uterus). \n\n- if your placenta is covering the birth canal. \n\n- if your placenta is detaching from the wall of your womb. \n\n- if you or your unborn baby have any other conditions where it would be dangerous to continue with \n\nyour pregnancy. \n\n- if you are allergic to atosiban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n\n \n\nDo not use Tractocile if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, midwife or \n\npharmacist before you are given Tractocile. \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor, midwife or pharmacist before you are given Tractocile: \n\n- if you think your waters might have broken (premature rupture of your membranes). \n- if you have kidney or liver problems. \n- if you are between 24 and 27 weeks pregnant. \n- if you are pregnant with more than one baby. \n- if your contractions start again, treatment with Tractocile can be repeated up to three more times. \n- if your unborn baby is small for the time of your pregnancy. \n- Your womb may be less able to contract after your baby has been born. This may cause bleeding. \n- if you are pregnant with more than one baby and/or are given medicines that can delay the birth of \n\nyour baby, such as medicines used for high blood pressure. This may increase the risk of lung oedema \n\n(accumulation of fluid in the lungs). \n\n \n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, midwife or pharmacist before you \n\nare given Tractocile. \n\n  \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nTractocile has not been studied in pregnant women less than 18 years old. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Tractocile \nTell your doctor, midwife or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant and breast-feeding an earlier child, you should stop breast-feeding while you are given \n\nTractocile. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How Tractocile will be given \n\n \n\nTractocile will be given to you in a hospital by a doctor, nurse or midwife. They will decide how much you \n\nneed. They will also make sure the solution is clear and free from particles. \n\n \n\nTractocile will be given into a vein (intravenously) in three stages: \n\n- The first injection of 6.75 mg in 0.9 ml will be slowly injected into your vein over one minute. \n\n- Then a continuous infusion (drip) will be given at a dose of 18 mg per hour for 3 hours. \n\n- Then another continuous infusion (drip) at a dose of 6 mg per hour will be given for up to 45 hours, or \n\nuntil your contractions have stopped. \n\nTreatment should last no longer than 48 hours in total. \n\n \n\nFurther treatment with Tractocile can be used if your contractions start again. Treatment with Tractocile can \n\nbe repeated up to three more times. \n\n \n\nDuring treatment with Tractocile, your contractions and your unborn baby\u2019s heart rate may be monitored. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that no more than three re-treatments should be used during a pregnancy. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nThe side effects seen in the mother are generally of a mild severity.

Further treatment cycles of Tractocile \n\ncan be used should contractions recur. It is recommended that no more than three retreatments should be \n\nused during a pregnancy. \n\n \n\nPreparation of the intravenous infusion \n\nThe intravenous infusion is prepared by diluting Tractocile 37.5 mg/5 ml, concentrate for solution for \n\ninfusion in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection, Ringer's lactate solution or 5% w/v \n\nglucose solution. This is done by removing 10 ml of solution from a 100 ml infusion bag and replacing it \n\nwith 10 ml Tractocile 37.5 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion from two 5 ml vials to obtain a \n\nconcentration of 75 mg atosiban in 100 ml. If an infusion bag with a different volume is used, a proportional \n\ncalculation should be made for the preparation. \n\nTractocile should not be mixed with other medicinal products in the infusion bag. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
