NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nOpsumit 10 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 10 mg macitentan. \n \nExcipients with known effect  \nEach film-coated tablet contains approximately 37 mg of lactose (as monohydrate) and approximately \n0.06 mg of soya bean lecithin (E322). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \n5.5 mm, round, biconvex, white to off-white film-coated tablets, debossed with \u201c10\u201d on both sides. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nOpsumit, as monotherapy or in combination, is indicated for the long-term treatment of pulmonary \narterial hypertension (PAH) in adult patients of WHO Functional Class (FC) II to III. \n \nEfficacy has been shown in a PAH population including idiopathic and heritable PAH, PAH \nassociated with connective tissue disorders, and PAH associated with corrected simple congenital \nheart disease (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should only be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the treatment of PAH. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 10 mg once daily. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \n \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients over the age of 65 years (see section 5.2). There is limited \nclinical experience in patients over the age of 75 years. Therefore, Opsumit should be used with \ncaution in this population (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nBased on pharmacokinetic (PK) data, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate \nor severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). However, there is no clinical experience with \nthe use of macitentan in PAH patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Opsumit must not \n\n\n\n3 \n\nbe initiated in patients with severe hepatic impairment, or clinically significant elevated hepatic \naminotransferases (greater than 3 times the Upper Limit of Normal (> 3 \u00d7 ULN); see sections 4.3 and \n4.4).  \n \nRenal impairment \n \nBased on PK data, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. There is no \nclinical experience with the use of macitentan in PAH patients with severe renal impairment. The use \nof Opsumit is not recommended in patients undergoing dialysis (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of macitentan in children and adolescents below 18 years have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe film-coated tablets are not breakable and are to be swallowed whole, with water. They may be \ntaken with or without food.  \n \nOpsumit should be taken every day at about the same time. If the patient misses a dose of Opsumit, the \npatient should be told to take it as soon as possible and then take the next dose at the regularly \nscheduled time. The patient should be told not to take two doses at the same time if a dose has been \nmissed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance, soya or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\u2022 Pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\u2022 Women of childbearing potential who are not using reliable contraception (see sections 4.4 and \n\n4.6). \n\u2022 Breastfeeding (see section 4.6). \n\u2022 Patients with severe hepatic impairment (with or without cirrhosis) (see section 4.2). \n\u2022 Baseline values of hepatic aminotransferases (aspartate aminotransferases (AST) and/or alanine \n\naminotransferases (ALT) > 3 \u00d7 ULN) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe benefit/risk balance of macitentan has not been established in patients with WHO class I \nfunctional status of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  \n \nLiver function  \n \nElevations of liver aminotransferases (AST, ALT) have been associated with PAH and with endothelin \nreceptor antagonists (ERAs). Opsumit is not to be initiated in patients with severe hepatic impairment \nor elevated aminotransferases (> 3 \u00d7 ULN) (see sections 4.2 and 4.3) and is not recommended in \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment. Liver enzyme tests should be obtained prior to initiation of \nOpsumit. \n \nPatients should be monitored for signs of hepatic injury and monthly monitoring of ALT and AST is \nrecommended. If sustained, unexplained, clinically relevant aminotransferase elevations occur, or if \nelevations are accompanied by an increase in bilirubin > 2 \u00d7 ULN, or by clinical symptoms of liver \ninjury (e.g., jaundice), Opsumit treatment should be discontinued. \n \nReinitiation of Opsumit may be considered following the return of hepatic enzyme levels to within the \nnormal range in patients who have not experienced clinical symptoms of liver injury. The advice of a \nhepatologist is recommended. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nHaemoglobin concentration \n \nDecrease in haemoglobin concentrations has been associated with endothelin receptor antagonists \n(ERAs) including macitentan (see section 4.8). In placebo-controlled studies, macitentan-related \ndecreases in haemoglobin concentration were not progressive, stabilised after the first 4\u201312 weeks of \ntreatment and remained stable during chronic treatment. Cases of anaemia requiring blood cell \ntransfusion have been reported with macitentan and other ERAs. Initiation of Opsumit is not \nrecommended in patients with severe anaemia. It is recommended that haemoglobin concentrations be \nmeasured prior to initiation of treatment and tests repeated during treatment as clinically indicated. \n \nPulmonary veno-occlusive disease \n \nCases of pulmonary oedema have been reported with vasodilators (mainly prostacyclins) when used in \npatients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. Consequently, if signs of pulmonary oedema occur \nwhen macitentan is administered in patients with PAH, the possibility of pulmonary veno-occlusive \ndisease should be considered. \n \nUse in women of childbearing potential \n \nOpsumit treatment should only be initiated in women of childbearing potential when the absence of \npregnancy has been verified, appropriate advice on contraception provided, and reliable contraception \nis practised (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). Women should not become pregnant for 1 month after \ndiscontinuation of Opsumit. Monthly pregnancy tests during treatment with Opsumit are \nrecommended to allow the early detection of pregnancy. \n \nConcomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inducers \n \nIn the presence of strong CYP3A4 inducers reduced efficacy of macitentan could occur. The \ncombination of macitentan with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampicin, St. John\u2019s wort, \ncarbamazepine, and phenytoin) should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors \n \nCaution should be exercised when macitentan is administered concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 \ninhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone, \nritonavir, and saquinavir) (see section 4.5). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nPatients with renal impairment may run a higher risk of experiencing hypotension and anaemia during \ntreatment with macitentan. Therefore, monitoring of blood pressure and haemoglobin should be \nconsidered. There is no clinical experience with the use of macitentan in PAH patients with severe \nrenal impairment. Caution is recommended in this population. There is no experience with the use of \nmacitentan in patients undergoing dialysis, therefore Opsumit is not recommended in this population \n(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nElderly \n \nThere is limited clinical experience with macitentan in patients over the age of 75 years, therefore \nOpsumit should be used with caution in this population (see section 4.2). \n \nExcipients \n \nOpsumit contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nOpsumit contains soya bean lecithin. If a patient is hypersensitive to soya, Opsumit must not be used \n(see section 4.3). \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn vitro studies \n \nThe cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 are involved in the \nmetabolism of macitentan and formation of its metabolites (see section 5.2).  Macitentan and its active \nmetabolite do not have clinically relevant inhibitory or inducing effects on cytochrome P450 enzymes. \n \nMacitentan and its active metabolite are not inhibitors of hepatic or renal uptake transporters at \nclinically relevant concentrations, including the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1 \nand OATP1B3). Macitentan and its active metabolite are not relevant substrates of OATP1B1 and \nOATP1B3 but enter the liver by passive diffusion. \n \nMacitentan and its active metabolite are not inhibitors of hepatic or renal efflux pumps at clinically \nrelevant concentrations, including the multi-drug resistance protein (P-gp, MDR-1) and multidrug and \ntoxin extrusion transporters (MATE1 and MATE2-K). Macitentan is not a substrate for P-gp/MDR-1. \n \nAt clinically relevant concentrations, macitentan and its active metabolite do not interact with proteins \ninvolved in hepatic bile salt transport, i.e., the bile salt export pump (BSEP) and the sodium-dependent \ntaurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP). \n \nIn vivo studies \n \nStrong CYP3A4 inducers: Concomitant treatment with rifampicin 600 mg daily, a potent inducer of \nCYP3A4, reduced the steady-state exposure to macitentan by 79% but did not affect the exposure to \nthe active metabolite. Reduced efficacy of macitentan in the presence of a potent inducer of CYP3A4 \nsuch as rifampicin should be considered. The combination of macitentan with strong CYP3A4 \ninducers should be avoided (see section 4.4). \n \nKetoconazole: In the presence of ketoconazole 400 mg once daily, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, \nexposure to macitentan increased approximately 2-fold. The predicted increase was approximately \n3-fold in the presence of ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily using physiologically based \npharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling. The uncertainties of such modelling should be considered. \nExposure to the active metabolite of macitentan was reduced by 26%. Caution should be exercised \nwhen macitentan is administered concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (see section 4.4). \n \nWarfarin: Macitentan given as multiple doses of 10 mg once daily had no effect on exposure to \nS-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate) or R-warfarin (CYP3A4 substrate) after a single dose of 25 mg \nwarfarin. The pharmacodynamic effect of warfarin on International Normalised Ratio (INR) was not \naffected by macitentan. The pharmacokinetics of macitentan and its active metabolite were not \naffected by warfarin. \n \nSildenafil: At steady-state, the exposure to sildenafil 20 mg three times a day was increased by 15% \nduring concomitant administration of macitentan 10 mg once daily. Sildenafil, a CYP3A4 substrate, \ndid not affect the pharmacokinetics of macitentan, while there was a 15% reduction in the exposure to \nthe active metabolite of macitentan. These changes are not considered clinically relevant. In a \nplacebo-controlled trial in patients with PAH, the efficacy and safety of macitentan in combination \nwith sildenafil were demonstrated. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nCyclosporine A: Concomitant treatment with cyclosporine A 100 mg twice daily, a combined \nCYP3A4 and OATP inhibitor, did not alter the steady-state exposure to macitentan and its active \nmetabolite to a clinically relevant extent. \n \nHormonal contraceptives: Macitentan 10 mg once daily did not affect the pharmacokinetics of an oral \ncontraceptive (norethisterone 1 mg and ethinyl estradiol 35 \u00b5g). \n \nBreast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) substrate drugs: Macitentan 10 mg once daily did not affect \nthe pharmacokinetics of a BCRP substrate drug (riociguat 1 mg; rosuvastatin 10 mg). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy, and lactation \n \nUse in women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n \nOpsumit treatment should only be initiated in women of childbearing potential when the absence of \npregnancy has been verified, appropriate advice on contraception provided, and reliable contraception \nis practised (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). Women should not become pregnant for 1 month after \ndiscontinuation of Opsumit. Monthly pregnancy tests during treatment with Opsumit are \nrecommended to allow the early detection of pregnancy. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of macitentan in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is still unknown. Opsumit is \ncontraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential who are not using reliable \ncontraception (see section 4.3). \n \nBreastfeeding \n \nIt is unknown whether macitentan is excreted in human milk. In rats, macitentan and its metabolites \nare excreted into milk during lactation (see section 5.3). A risk to the breastfeeding child cannot be \nexcluded. Opsumit is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see section 4.3). \n \nMale fertility \n \nThe development of testicular tubular atrophy in male animals was observed after treatment with \nmacitentan (see section 5.3). The relevance of this finding to humans is unknown, but a deterioration \nof spermatogenesis cannot be excluded. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nMacitentan has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. No studies on the effects on \nthe ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, undesirable effects may occur \n(e.g., headache, hypotension) that may influence the ability to drive and use machines (see section \n4.8).  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are nasopharyngitis (14%), headache (13.6%) and \nanaemia (13.2%, see section 4.4). The majority of adverse reactions are mild to moderate in intensity. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe safety of macitentan has been evaluated in a long-term placebo-controlled trial of 742 patients \nwith symptomatic PAH. The mean treatment duration was 103.9 weeks in the macitentan 10 mg \ngroup, and 85.3 weeks in the placebo group. Adverse reactions associated with macitentan obtained \nfrom this clinical study are tabulated below.  \n \nFrequencies are defined as: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n(\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data).  \n \n\nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \n\nInfections and infestations Very common Nasopharyngitis \n\n Very common Bronchitis \n\n Common Pharyngitis \n\n Common Influenza \n\n Common Urinary tract infection \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nVery common Anaemia, haemoglobin \ndecrease5 \n\n Common Leukopenia6 \n\n Common Thrombocytopenia7 \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Common Aminotransferase elevations4  \n\nImmune system disorders Uncommon Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., \nangioedema, pruritus, rash)1 \n\nNervous system disorders Very common Headache \n\nVascular disorders Common Hypotension2 \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nCommon Nasal congestion1 \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nVery common Oedema, fluid retention3 \n\n1 Data derived from pooled placebo-controlled studies. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \n2 Hypotension has been associated with the use of ERAs including macitentan. In a long-term double-\nblind study in patients with PAH, hypotension was reported for 7.0% and 4.4% of patients on \nmacitentan 10 mg and placebo, respectively. This corresponded to 3.5 events / 100 patient-years on \nmacitentan 10 mg compared to 2.7 events / 100 patient-years on placebo. \n \n3 Oedema/fluid retention has been associated with the use of ERAs including macitentan. In a long-\nterm double-blind study in patients with PAH, the incidence of oedema AEs in the macitentan 10 mg \nand placebo treatment groups was 21.9% and 20.5%, respectively. In a double-blind study in patients \nwith idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the incidence of peripheral oedema AEs in the macitentan and \nplacebo treatment groups was 11.8% and 6.8%, respectively. In two double-blind clinical studies in \npatients with digital ulcers associated with systemic sclerosis, the incidences of peripheral oedema \n\n\n\n8 \n\nAEs ranged from 13.4% to 16.1% in the macitentan 10 mg groups and from 6.2% to 4.5% in the \nplacebo groups. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \n \n4 Liver aminotransferases \n \nThe incidence of aminotransferase elevations (ALT/AST) > 3 \u00d7 ULN was 3.4% on macitentan 10 mg \nand 4.5% on placebo in a double-blind study in patients with PAH. Elevations > 5 \u00d7 ULN occurred in \n2.5% of patients on macitentan 10 mg versus 2% of patients on placebo. \n \n5 Haemoglobin \n \nIn a double-blind study in patients with PAH, macitentan 10 mg was associated with a mean decrease \nin haemoglobin versus placebo of 1 g/dL. A decrease from baseline in haemoglobin concentration to \nbelow 10 g/dL was reported in 8.7% of patients treated with macitentan 10 mg and 3.4% of \nplacebo-treated patients. \n \n6 White blood cells \n \nIn a double-blind study in patients with PAH, macitentan 10 mg was associated with a decrease in \nmean leucocyte count from baseline of 0.7 \u00d7 109/L versus no change in placebo-treated patients.  \n \n7 Platelets \nIn a double-blind study in patients with PAH, macitentan 10 mg was associated with a decrease in \nmean platelet count of 17 \u00d7 109/L, versus a mean decrease of 11 \u00d7 109/L in placebo-treated patients. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety of macitentan in children and adolescents below 18 years has not yet been established. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nMacitentan has been administered as a single dose of up to 600 mg to healthy subjects. Adverse \nreactions of headache, nausea, and vomiting were observed. In the event of an overdose, standard \nsupportive measures must be taken, as required. Due to the high degree of protein binding of \nmacitentan, dialysis is unlikely to be effective. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: anti-hypertensives, anti-hypertensives for pulmonary arterial \nhypertension. ATC code: C02KX04. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nEndothelin (ET)-1 and its receptors (ETA and ETB) mediate a variety of effects such as \nvasoconstriction, fibrosis, proliferation, hypertrophy, and inflammation. In disease conditions such as \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nPAH, the local ET system is upregulated and is involved in vascular hypertrophy and in organ \ndamage. \n \nMacitentan is an orally active potent endothelin receptor antagonist, active on both ETA and ETB \nreceptors and approximately 100-fold more selective for ETA as compared to ETB in vitro. Macitentan \ndisplays high affinity and sustained occupancy of the ET receptors in human pulmonary arterial \nsmooth muscle cells. This prevents endothelin-mediated activation of second messenger systems that \nresult in vasoconstriction and smooth muscle cell proliferation. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nEfficacy in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension \n \nA multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, event-driven, Phase 3 outcome study \n(AC-055-302/SERAPHIN) was conducted in 742 patients with symptomatic PAH, who were \nrandomised to three treatment groups (placebo [N = 250], 3 mg [N = 250] or 10 mg [N = 242] of \nmacitentan once daily), to assess the long-term effect on morbidity or mortality. \n \nAt baseline, the majority of enrolled patients (64%) were treated with a stable dose of specific therapy \nfor PAH, either oral phosphodiesterase inhibitors (61%) and/or inhaled/oral prostanoids (6%). \n \nThe primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a morbidity or mortality event, up to the end \nof double-blind treatment, defined as death, or atrial septostomy, or lung transplantation, or initiation \nof intravenous (i.v.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) prostanoids, or other worsening of PAH. Other worsening \nof PAH was defined as the presence of all of the three following components: a sustained decrease in \n6-minute walk distance (6MWD) of at least 15% from baseline; worsening of PAH symptoms \n(worsening of WHO FC or right heart failure); and need for new treatment for PAH. All events were \nconfirmed by an independent adjudication committee, blinded to treatment allocation. \n \nAll patients were followed up to end-of-study (EOS) for vital status. EOS was declared when the \npredefined number of primary endpoint events was reached. In the period between end-of-treatment \n(EOT) and EOS, patients could receive open-label macitentan 10 mg or alternative PAH therapy. The \noverall median double-blind treatment duration was 115 weeks (up to a maximum of 188 weeks on \nmacitentan). \n \nThe mean age of all patients was 46 years (range 12\u201385 years of age, including 20 patients below 18, \n706 patients between 18\u201374 years, and 16 patients aged 75 and older) with the majority of subjects \nbeing Caucasian (55%) and female (77%). Approximately 52%, 46%, and 2% of patients were in \nWHO FC II, III, and IV, respectively. \n \nIdiopathic or heritable PAH was the most common aetiology in the study population (57%), followed \nby PAH due to connective tissue disorders (31%), PAH associated with corrected simple congenital \nheart disease (8%), and PAH associated with other aetiologies (medicinal products and toxins [3%] \nand HIV [1%]). \n \nOutcome endpoints \n \nTreatment with macitentan 10 mg resulted in a 45% risk reduction (hazard ratio [HR] 0.55; 97.5% CI: \n0.39 to 0.76; logrank p < 0.0001) of the composite morbidity-mortality endpoint up to EOT when \ncompared to placebo [Figure 1 and Table 1]. The treatment effect was established early and was \nsustained. \n \nEfficacy of macitentan 10 mg on the primary endpoint was consistent across subgroups of age, sex, \nethnic origin, geographical region, aetiology, by monotherapy or in combination with another PAH \ntherapy and by WHO FC (I/II and III/IV). \n  \n\n\n\n10 \n\nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier estimates of the first morbidity-mortality event in SERAPHIN \n\n \n \nTable 1 Summary of outcome events \n\nEndpoints \n& statistics \n\nPatients with events Treatment comparison:  \nmacitentan 10 mg vs placebo \n\nPlacebo \n\n(N = 250) \n\nMacitentan \n10 mg  \n\n(N = 242) \n\nAbsolute \nrisk \n\nreduction \n\nRelative risk \nreduction \n\n(97.5% CI) \nHR a \n\n(97.5% CI) \nLogrank \np-value \n\nMorbidity-\nmortality \nevent b \n\n \n53% 37% 16% 45% (24%; 61%)  \n\n0.55 \n(0.39; 0.76) < 0.0001 \n\nDeath c \n\nn (%) \n19 (7.6%) 14 (5.8%) 2% 36% (\u221242%; 71%) \n\n0.64 \n(0.29; 1.42) 0.20 \n\nWorsening \nof PAH   \nn (%) \n\n93 (37.2%) 59 (24.4%) 13% \n49% \n\n(27%; 65%) \n \n\n0.51 \n(0.35; 0.73) < 0.0001 i.v./s.c. prostanoid \n\ninitiation  \nn (%) \n\n6 (2.4%) 1 (0.4%) 2% \n\na = based on Cox\u2019s Proportional Hazards Model \nb = % of patients with an event at 36 months = 100 \u00d7 (1 - KM estimate) \nc= all cause death up to EOT regardless of prior worsening \n\n \nThe number of deaths of all causes up to EOS on macitentan 10 mg was 35 versus 44 on placebo (HR \n0.77; 97.5% CI: 0.46 to 1.28). \n \nThe risk of PAH-related death or hospitalisation for PAH up to EOT was reduced by 50% (HR 0.50; \n97.5% CI: 0.34 to 0.75; logrank p < 0.0001) in patients receiving macitentan 10 mg (50 events) \ncompared to placebo (84 events). At 36 months, 44.6% of patients on placebo and 29.4% of patients \n\n\n\n11 \n\non macitentan 10 mg (Absolute Risk Reduction = 15.2%) had been hospitalised for PAH or died from \na PAH-related cause. \n \nSymptomatic endpoints \n \nExercise capacity was evaluated as a secondary endpoint. Treatment with macitentan 10 mg at \nMonth 6 resulted in a placebo-corrected mean increase in 6MWD of 22 meters (97.5% CI: 3 to 41; \np = 0.0078). Evaluation of 6MWD by functional class resulted in a placebo-corrected mean increase \nfrom baseline to Month 6 in FC III/IV patients of 37 meters (97.5% CI: 5 to 69) and in FC I/II of 12 \nmeters (97.5% CI: \u22128 to 33). The increase in 6MWD achieved with macitentan was maintained for the \nduration of the study. \n \nTreatment with macitentan 10 mg at Month 6 led to a 74% higher chance of WHO FC improvement \nrelative to placebo (risk ratio 1.74; 97.5% CI: 1.10 to 2.74; p = 0.0063).  \n \nMacitentan 10 mg improved quality of life assessed by the SF-36 questionnaire.  \n \nHaemodynamic endpoints \n \nHaemodynamic parameters were assessed in a subset of patients (placebo [N = 67], macitentan 10 mg \n[N = 57]) after 6 months of treatment. Patients treated with macitentan 10 mg achieved a median \nreduction of 36.5% (97.5% CI: 21.7 to 49.2%) in pulmonary vascular resistance and an increase of \n0.58 L/min/m2 (97.5% CI: 0.28 to 0.93 L/min/m2) in cardiac index compared to placebo.   \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nmacitentan in all subsets of the paediatric population for PAH (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of macitentan and its active metabolite have mainly been documented in \nhealthy subjects. Exposure to macitentan in patients with PAH was approximately 1.2-fold greater \nthan in healthy subjects. The exposure to the active metabolite in patients, which is approximately \n5-fold less potent than macitentan, was approximately 1.3-fold higher than in healthy subjects. The \npharmacokinetics of macitentan in PAH patients were not influenced by the severity of the disease. \n \nAfter repeated administration, the pharmacokinetics of macitentan are dose-proportional up to and \nincluding 30 mg. \n \nAbsorption \n \nMaximum plasma concentrations of macitentan are achieved about 8 hours after administration. \nThereafter, plasma concentrations of macitentan and its active metabolite decrease slowly, with an \napparent elimination half-life of approximately 16 hours and 48 hours, respectively. \n \nIn healthy subjects, the exposure to macitentan and its active metabolite is unchanged in the presence \nof food and, therefore, macitentan may be taken with or without food. \n \nDistribution \n \nMacitentan and its active metabolite are highly bound to plasma proteins (> 99%), primarily to \nalbumin and to a lesser extent to alpha1-acid glycoprotein. Macitentan and its active metabolite \nACT-132577 are well distributed into tissues as indicated by an apparent volume of distribution \n(Vss/F) of approximately 50 L and 40 L for macitentan and ACT-132577, respectively. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nBiotransformation  \n \nMacitentan has four primary metabolic pathways. Oxidative depropylation of the sulfamide yields a \npharmacologically active metabolite. This reaction is dependent on the cytochrome P450 system, \nmainly CYP3A4 (approximately 99%) with minor contributions of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. \nThe active metabolite circulates in human plasma and may contribute to the pharmacological effect. \nOther metabolic pathways yield products without pharmacological activity. Several members of the \nCYP2C family, namely CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, as well as CYP3A4, are involved in the \nformation of these metabolites. \n \nElimination \n \nMacitentan is only excreted after extensive metabolism. The major excretion route is via urine, \naccounting for about 50% of the dose. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nThere is no clinically relevant effect of age, sex or ethnic origin on the pharmacokinetics of macitentan \nand its active metabolite. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nExposure to macitentan and its active metabolite was increased by 1.3- and 1.6-fold, respectively, in \npatients with severe renal impairment. This increase is not considered clinically relevant (see sections \n4.2 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nExposure to macitentan was decreased by 21%, 34%, and 6% and, for the active metabolite by 20%, \n25%, and 25% in subjects with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment, respectively. This \ndecrease is not considered clinically relevant (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn dogs, macitentan decreased blood pressure at exposures similar to the therapeutic human exposure. \nIntimal thickening of coronary arteries was observed at 17-fold the human exposure after 4 to 39 \nweeks of treatment. Due to the species-specific sensitivity and the safety margin, this finding is \nconsidered not relevant for humans. \n \nIncreased liver weight and hepatocellular hypertrophy were observed in mice, rats and dogs after \ntreatment with macitentan. These changes were largely reversible and considered non-adverse \nadaptations of the liver to increased metabolic demand. \n \nMacitentan induced minimal to slight mucosal hyperplasia and inflammatory infiltration in the \nsubmucosa of the nasal cavity in the mouse carcinogenicity study at all doses. No nasal cavity findings \nwere noted in the 3-month mouse toxicity study or in rat and dog studies. \n \nMacitentan was not genotoxic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo assays. Macitentan was not \nphototoxic in vivo after single dose at exposures of up to 24-fold the human exposure.  \nCarcinogenicity studies of 2 years\u2019 duration did not reveal a carcinogenic potential at exposures \n18-fold and 116-fold the human exposure in rats and mice, respectively. \n \nTesticular tubular dilatation was observed in chronic toxicity studies with male rats and dogs with \nsafety margins of 11.6 and 5.8, respectively. Tubular dilatation was fully reversible. After 2 years of \ntreatment, testicular tubular atrophy was seen in rats at 4-fold the human exposure. \nHypospermatogenesis was observed in the life-long carcinogenicity study in rats and in the repeat-\ndose toxicity studies in dogs at exposures that provide safety margins of 9.7 in rats and 23 in dogs. The \n\n\n\n13 \n\nsafety margins for fertility were 18 for male and 44 for female rats. No testicular findings were noted \nin mice after treatment up to 2 years. The effect of macitentan on human male fertility is not known \n(see section 4.6). \n \nMacitentan was teratogenic in rabbits and rats at all doses tested. In both species there were \ncardiovascular and mandibular arch fusion abnormalities. \n \nAdministration of macitentan to female rats from late pregnancy through lactation at maternal \nexposures 5-fold the human exposure, caused reduced pup survival and impairment of the \nreproductive capability of the offspring, which was exposed to macitentan during late intrauterine life \nand via the milk during the suckling period. \n \nTreatment of juvenile rats from postnatal Day 4 to Day 114 caused reduced body weight gain leading \nto secondary effects on development (slight delay of descensus testis, reversible reduction of \nlong-bone length, prolonged estrous cycle). Slightly increased pre- and post-implantation loss, \ndecreased mean number of pups, and decreased testis and epididymis weights, were observed at \nexposures 7-fold the human exposure. Testicular tubular atrophy, and minimal effects on reproductive \nvariables and sperm morphology were recorded at exposures 3.8-fold the human exposure. \n \n \n6.

Therefore you must \nnot take Opsumit if you are pregnant and you must also not become \npregnant while taking Opsumit. Moreover, if you are suffering from \npulmonary arterial hypertension, the occurrence of a pregnancy can \nseverely deteriorate the symptoms of your disease.  \n \nContraception \nYou need to use a reliable form of birth control (contraception) while \nyou are taking Opsumit. Be sure to discuss any questions you may have \nwith your doctor.  \n \n\n \nYou should have a pregnancy test before initiation of Opsumit and every \nmonth during treatment even if you think that you are not pregnant. \n \nLike other medicines of this class, Opsumit can induce anaemia (a \nreduced number of red blood cells) and can have effects on the liver. \nYour doctor will take blood test before you start treatment with Opsumit \nand during treatment to test: \n \n\u2022 whether you have anaemia (a reduced number of red blood \n\ncells) \n \n\n\u2022 whether your liver is working properly \n \n\n \nSigns that your liver may not be working properly include: \n\u2022 nausea (urge to vomit) \n\u2022 vomiting \n\u2022 fever (high temperature) \n\u2022 pain in your stomach (abdomen) \n\u2022 jaundice (yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes) \n\u2022 dark-coloured urine \n\u2022 itching of your skin \n\u2022 lethargy or fatigue (unusual tiredness or exhaustion) \n\u2022 flu-like syndrome (joint and muscle pain with fever) \n\n \nIf you notice any of these signs, tell your doctor immediately. \n \n\nThe recommended dose of Opsumit is one 10 mg tablet, once a day. \nSwallow the whole tablet, with a glass of water, do not chew or break \nthe tablet. You can take Opsumit with or without food. \n \nIf you forget to take Opsumit, take a dose as soon as you remember, \nthen continue to take your tablets at the usual times. Do not take a \ndouble dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. \n \nFor more information on Opsumit, please read carefully the patient \ninformation leaflet. \nIf you have any question about your treatment, ask your doctor or \npharmacist. \n \n\n\u00a92013 Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd \nOpsumit is a registered trademark of Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd \n\n \n\nFor the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension \n \n\nThis card contains important safety information you need to be aware of \nwhen receiving treatment with Opsumit.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Opsumit is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Opsumit \n3. How to take Opsumit \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Opsumit \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Opsumit is and what it is used for \n \nOpsumit contains the active substance macitentan, which belongs to the class of medicines called \n\u201cendothelin receptor antagonists\u201d. \n \nOpsumit is used for the long-term treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adults; it can \nbe used on its own or with other medicines for PAH. PAH is high blood pressure in the blood vessels \nthat carry blood from the heart to the lungs (the pulmonary arteries). In people with PAH, these \narteries get narrower, so the heart has to work harder to pump blood through them. This causes people \nto feel tired, dizzy, and short of breath. \n \nOpsumit widens the pulmonary arteries, making it easier for the heart to pump blood through them. \nThis lowers the blood pressure, relieves the symptoms and improves the course of the disease. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Opsumit \n \nDo not take Opsumit \n\u2022 if you are allergic to macitentan, soya or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\u2022 if you are pregnant, if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you could become pregnant \n\nbecause you are not using reliable birth control (contraception). See section \u2018Pregnancy and \nbreastfeeding\u2019. \n\n\u2022 if you are breastfeeding. See section \u2018Pregnancy and breastfeeding\u2019. \n\u2022 if you have liver disease or if you have very high levels of liver enzymes in your blood. Talk to \n\nyour doctor, who will decide whether this medicine is suitable for you. \n \nIf any of these apply to you, please tell your doctor. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Opsumit. \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \nYou will need blood tests, as indicated by your doctor: \nYour doctor will take blood test before you start treatment with Opsumit and during treatment to test: \n\u2022 whether you have anaemia (a reduced number of red blood cells) \n\u2022 whether your liver is working properly \n \nIf you have anaemia (a reduced number of red blood cells), you may have the following signs: \n\u2022 dizziness  \n\u2022 fatigue/malaise/weakness \n\u2022 fast heart rate, palpitations \n\u2022 pallor \n\n \nIf you notice any of these signs, tell your doctor. \n \nSigns that your liver may not be working properly include: \n\u2022 feeling sick (nausea) \n\u2022 vomiting \n\u2022 fever  \n\u2022 pain in your stomach (abdomen) \n\u2022 yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes (jaundice) \n\u2022 dark-coloured urine \n\u2022 itching of your skin \n\u2022 unusual tiredness or exhaustion (lethargy or fatigue) \n\u2022 flu-like syndrome (joint and muscle pain with fever) \n \nIf you notice any of these signs, tell your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you have kidney problems, talk to your doctor before using Opsumit. Macitentan may lead to more \nreduction of blood pressure and decrease in haemoglobin in patients with kidney problems. \n \nIn patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (obstruction of the lung veins), the use of \nmedicines for treatment of PAH, including Opsumit, may lead to pulmonary oedema. If you have \nsigns of pulmonary oedema when using Opsumit, such as a sudden, important increase in \nbreathlessness and low oxygen, tell your doctor immediately. Your doctor may perform additional \ntests, and will determine what treatment regimen is most suitable for you. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years because Opsumit has not been \ntested in children. \n \nElderly \nThere is limited experience with Opsumit in patients older than 75 years. Opsumit should be used with \ncaution in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Opsumit \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicine. \nOpsumit can affect other medicines. \n \nIf you take Opsumit together with other medicines including those listed below, the effects of Opsumit \nor the other medicines might be altered. Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any \nof the following medicines: \n \n\u2022 rifampicin, clarithromycin, telithromycin (antibiotics used to treat infections), \n\u2022 phenytoin (a medicine used to treat seizures), \n\u2022 carbamazepine (used to treat depression and epilepsy), \n\u2022 St. John\u2019s Wort (an herbal preparation used to treat depression), \n\n\n\n29 \n\n\u2022 ritonavir, saquinavir (used to treat HIV infections), \n\u2022 nefazodone (used to treat depression), \n\u2022 ketoconazole (except shampoo), itraconazole, voriconazole (medicines used against fungal \n\ninfections) \n \nPregnancy and breastfeeding \nIf you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nOpsumit may harm unborn babies conceived before, during or soon after treatment. \n \n\u2022 If it is possible you could become pregnant, use a reliable form of birth control (contraception) \n\nwhile you are taking Opsumit. Talk to your doctor about this. \n\u2022 Do not take Opsumit if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. \n\u2022 If you become pregnant or think that you may be pregnant while you are taking Opsumit, or \n\nshortly after stopping Opsumit (up to 1 month), see your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you are a woman who could become pregnant, your doctor will ask you to take a pregnancy test \nbefore you start taking Opsumit and regularly (once a month) while you are taking Opsumit. \n \nIt is not known if Opsumit is transferred to breast milk. Do not breastfeed while you are taking \nOpsumit. Talk to your doctor about this. \n \nDriving and using machines \nOpsumit can cause side effects such as headaches and hypotension (listed in section 4), and the \nsymptoms of your condition can also make you less fit to drive. \n \nOpsumit contains lactose, lecithin from soya and sodium \nOpsumit contains a sugar called lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \nOpsumit contains lecithin derived from soya.

called \"endothelin receptor antagonists\". opsumit is used for the long-term treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) in adults; it can be used on its own or with other medicines for pah. pah is high blood pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs (the pulmonary arteries). in people with pah, these arteries get narrower, so the heart has to work harder to pump blood through them. this causes people to feel tired, dizzy, and short of breath. opsumit widens the pulmonary arteries, making it easier for the heart to pump blood through them. this lowers the blood pressure, relieves the symptoms and improves the course of the disease.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "opsumit", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 7,
