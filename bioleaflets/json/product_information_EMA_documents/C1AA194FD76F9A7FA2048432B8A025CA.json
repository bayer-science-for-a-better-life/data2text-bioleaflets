NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \n \nMemantine Mylan 10 mg film-coated tablets \nMemantine Mylan 20 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION  \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 10 mg of memantine hydrochloride equivalent to 8.31 mg \nmemantine. \nEach film-coated tablet contains 20 mg of memantine hydrochloride equivalent to 16.62 mg \nmemantine. \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nMemantine Mylan 10 mg film-coated tablets \nA dark yellow film-coated, tapered oblong shaped, biconvex tablet debossed with “ME” on the left of \nthe score and “10” on the right of the score on one side of the tablet and a score on the other side. \nThe tablet can be divided into equal doses. \n \nMemantine Mylan 20 mg film-coated tablets \nA red film-coated, oval, biconvex, bevelled edge tablet debossed with “ME” on one side of the tablet \nand “20” on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS  \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of adult patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and \ntreatment of Alzheimer’s dementia. \n \nPosology \n \nTherapy should only be started if a caregiver is available who will regularly monitor the intake of the \nmedicinal product by the patient. Diagnosis should be made according to current guidelines. The \ntolerance and dosing of memantine should be reassessed on a regular basis, preferably within three \nmonths after start of treatment. Thereafter, the clinical benefit of memantine and the patient’s \ntolerance of treatment should be reassessed on a regular basis according to current clinical guidelines. \nMaintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit is favourable and the \npatient tolerates treatment with memantine. Discontinuation of memantine should be considered when \nevidence of a therapeutic effect is no longer present or if the patient does not tolerate treatment. \n \nAdults \n \nDose titration \nThe maximum daily dose is 20 mg per day. In order to reduce the risk of undesirable effects, the \nmaintenance dose is achieved by upward titration of 5 mg per week over the first 3 weeks as follows: \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nWeek 1 (day 1-7): \nThe patient should take half a 10 mg film-coated tablet (5 mg) per day for 7 days. \n \nWeek 2 (day 8-14): \nThe patient should take one 10 mg film-coated tablet (10 mg) per day for 7 days. \n \nWeek 3 (day 15-21): \nThe patient should take one and a half 10 mg film-coated tablets (15 mg) per day for 7 days. \n \nFrom Week 4 on: \nThe patient should take two 10 mg film-coated tablets (20 mg) or one 20 mg film-coated tablet per \nday. \n \nMaintenance dose \nThe recommended maintenance dose is 20 mg per day. \n \nElderly \nOn the basis of the clinical studies, the recommended dose for patients over the age of 65 years is \n20 mg per day (two 10 mg film-coated tablets or one 20 mg film-coated tablet once a day) as \ndescribed above. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with mildly impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 50 – 80 ml/min) no dose \nadjustment is required. In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 – \n49 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg per day. If tolerated well after at least 7 days of treatment, the \ndose could be increased up to 20 mg/day according to standard titration scheme. In patients with \nsevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance 5 – 29 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg per day. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with mild or moderate hepatic impaired function (Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B), no \ndose adjustment is needed. No data on the use of memantine in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment are available. Administration of Memantine Mylan is not recommended in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment. \n \nPaediatric population \nNo data available. \n \nMethod of administration \nMemantine Mylan should be administered orally once a day and should be taken at the same time \nevery day. The film-coated tablets can be taken with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCaution is recommended in patients with epilepsy, former history of convulsions or patients with \npredisposing factors for epilepsy. \n \nConcomitant use of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-antagonists such as amantadine, ketamine or \ndextromethorphan should be avoided. These compounds act at the same receptor system as \nmemantine, and therefore adverse reactions (mainly central nervous system (CNS)-related) may be \nmore frequent or more pronounced (see also section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nSome factors that may raise urine pH (see section 5.2 “Elimination”) may necessitate careful \nmonitoring of the patient. These factors include drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore to a \nvegetarian diet, or a massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. Also, urine pH may be elevated by \nstates of renal tubulary acidosis (RTA) or severe infections of the urinary tract with Proteus bacteria. \n \nIn most clinical trials, patients with recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated congestive heart \nfailure (NYHA III-IV), or uncontrolled hypertension were excluded. As a consequence, only limited \ndata are available and patients with these conditions should be closely supervised. \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDue to the pharmacological effects and the mechanism of action of memantine the following \ninteractions may occur: \n \n• The mode of action suggests that the effects of L-dopa, dopaminergic agonists, and \n\nanticholinergics may be enhanced by concomitant treatment with NMDA-antagonists such as \nmemantine. The effects of barbiturates and neuroleptics may be reduced. Concomitant \nadministration of memantine with the antispasmodic agents, dantrolene or baclofen, can modify \ntheir effects and a dose adjustment may be necessary. \n\n• Concomitant use of memantine and amantadine should be avoided, owing to the risk of \npharmacotoxic psychosis. Both compounds are chemically related NMDA-antagonists. The same \nmay be true for ketamine and dextromethorphan (see also section 4.4). There is one published case \nreport on a possible risk also for the combination of memantine and phenytoin. \n\n• Other active substances such as cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine and \nnicotine that use the same renal cationic transport system as amantadine may also possibly interact \nwith memantine leading to a potential risk of increased plasma levels. \n\n• There may be a possibility of reduced serum level of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) when memantine \nis co-administered with HCT or any combination with HCT. \n\n• In post-marketing experience, isolated cases with international normalized ratio (INR) increases \nhave been reported in patients concomitantly treated with warfarin. Although no causal \nrelationship has been established, close monitoring of prothrombin time or INR is advisable for \npatients concomitantly treated with oral anticoagulants. \n\n \nIn single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in young healthy subjects, no relevant active substance \nactive substance interaction of memantine with glyburide/metformin or donepezil was observed. \n \nIn a clinical study in young healthy subjects, no relevant effect of memantine on the pharmacokinetics \nof galantamine was observed. \n \nMemantine did not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A, flavin containing monooxygenase, \nepoxide hydrolase or sulphation in vitro. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of memantine in pregnant women. Animal studies \nindicate a potential for reducing intrauterine growth at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly \nhigher than at human exposure (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \nMemantine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether memantine is excreted in human breast milk but, taking into consideration the \nlipophilicity of the substance, this probably occurs. Women taking memantine should not breast-feed. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nFertility \nNo adverse effects of memantine were noted on non-clinical male and female fertility studies. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nModerate to severe Alzheimer’s disease usually causes impairment of driving performance and \ncompromises the ability to use machinery. Furthermore, memantine has minor to moderate influence \non the ability to drive and use machines such that outpatients should be warned to take special care. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nIn clinical trials in mild to severe dementia, involving 1,784 patients treated with memantine and 1,595 \npatients treated with placebo, the overall incidence rate of adverse reactions with memantine did not \ndiffer from those with placebo; the adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity. The \nmost frequently occurring adverse reactions with a higher incidence in the memantine group than in \nthe placebo group were dizziness (6.3% vs 5.6%, respectively), headache (5.2% vs 3.9%), constipation \n(4.6% vs 2.6%), somnolence (3.4% vs 2.2%) and hypertension (4.1% vs 2.8%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following adverse reactions listed in the Table below have been accumulated in clinical studies \nwith memantine and since its introduction in the market.  \n \nAdverse reactions are ranked according to system organ class, using the following convention: very \ncommon (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within \neach frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \nInfections and infestations Uncommon Fungal infections \n\n \nImmune system disorders Common Drug hypersensitivity \n\n \nPsychiatric disorders Common Somnolence \n\n \nUncommon Confusion \n\n \nUncommon Hallucinations1 \n\n \nNot known Psychotic reactions2 \n\n \nNervous system disorders Common Dizziness \n\n \nCommon  \n \n\nBalance disorders \n\nUncommon Gait abnormal \n \n\nVery rare Seizures \n \n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon Cardiac failure \n \n\nVascular disorders Common Hypertension \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nUncommon Venous \nthrombosis/thromboembolism \n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n \n\nCommon Dyspnoea \n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Constipation \n \n\nUncommon Vomiting \n \n\nNot known Pancreatitis2 \n \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n \n\nCommon Elevated liver function test \n \n\nNot known \n \n\nHepatitis \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n \n\nCommon Headache \n \n\nUncommon  \n \n\nFatigue \n\n1 Hallucinations have mainly been observed in patients with severe Alzheimer´s disease. \n2 Isolated cases reported in post-marketing experience. \n \nAlzheimer’s disease has been associated with depression, suicidal ideation and suicide. In post-\nmarketing experience these reactions have been reported in patients treated with memantine. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V*. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOnly limited experience with overdose is available from clinical studies and post-marketing \nexperience. \n \nSymptoms \nRelative large overdoses (200 mg and 105 mg/day for 3 days, respectively) have been associated with \neither only symptoms of tiredness, weakness and/or diarrhoea or no symptoms. In the overdose cases \nbelow 140 mg or unknown dose the patients revealed symptoms from central nervous system \n(confusion, drowsiness, somnolence, vertigo, agitation, aggression, hallucination, and gait disturbance) \nand/or of gastrointestinal origin (vomiting and diarrhoea). \n \nIn the most extreme case of overdose, the patient survived the oral intake of a total of 2000 mg \nmemantine with effects on the central nervous system (coma for 10 days, and later diplopia and \nagitation). The patient received symptomatic treatment and plasmapheresis. The patient recovered \nwithout permanent sequelae. \n \nIn another case of a large overdose, the patient also survived and recovered. The patient had received \n400 mg memantine orally. The patient experienced central nervous system symptoms such as \nrestlessness, psychosis, visual hallucinations, proconvulsiveness, somnolence, stupor, and \nunconsciousness. \n \nTreatment \n\n\n\n7 \n\nIn the event of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic. No specific antidote for intoxication or \noverdose is available. Standard clinical procedures to remove active substance material, e.g. gastric \nlavage, carbo medicinalis (interruption of potential entero-hepatic recirculation), acidification of urine, \nforced diuresis should be used as appropriate. \n \nIn case of signs and symptoms of general central nervous system (CNS) overstimulation, careful \nsymptomatic clinical treatment should be considered. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psychoanaleptics, other anti-dementia drugs, ATC code: N06DX01. \n \nThere is increasing evidence that malfunctioning of glutamatergic neurotransmission, in particular at \nNMDA-receptors, contributes to both expression of symptoms and disease progression in \nneurodegenerative dementia. \n \nMemantine is a voltage-dependent, moderate-affinity uncompetitive NMDA-receptor antagonist. It \nmodulates the effects of pathologically elevated tonic levels of glutamate that may lead to neuronal \ndysfunction. \n \nClinical studies \nA pivotal monotherapy study in a population of patients suffering from moderate to severe \nAlzheimer’s disease (mini mental state examination (MMSE) total scores at baseline of 3 - 14) \nincluded a total of 252 outpatients. The study showed beneficial effects of memantine treatment in \ncomparison to placebo at 6 months (observed cases analysis for the clinician´s interview based \nimpression of change (CIBIC-plus): p=0.025; Alzheimer´s disease cooperative study – activities of \ndaily living (ADCS-ADLsev): p=0.003; severe impairment battery (SIB): p=0.002). \n \nA pivotal monotherapy study of memantine in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease \n(MMSE total scores at baseline of 10 to 22) included 403 patients. Memantine-treated patients showed \na statistically significantly better effect than placebo-treated patients on the primary endpoints: \nAlzheimer´s disease assessment scale (ADAS-cog) (p=0.003) and CIBIC-plus (p=0.004) at week 24 \n(last observation carried forward (LOCF)). In another monotherapy study in mild to moderate \nAlzheimer’s disease a total of 470 patients (MMSE total scores at baseline of 11-23) were randomised. \nIn the prospectively defined primary analysis statistical significance was not reached at the primary \nefficacy endpoint at week 24. \n \nA meta-analysis of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease (MMSE total scores < 20) \nfrom the six phase III, placebo-controlled, 6-month studies (including monotherapy studies and studies \nwith patients on a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) showed that there was a statistically \nsignificant effect in favour of memantine treatment for the cognitive, global, and functional domains. \nWhen patients were identified with concurrent worsening in all three domains, results showed a \nstatistically significant effect of memantine in preventing worsening, as twice as many placebo-treated \npatients as memantine-treated patients showed worsening in all three domains (21% vs. 11%, \np< 0.0001). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nMemantine has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 100%. Tmax is between 3 and 8 hours. \nThere is no indication that food influences the absorption of memantine. \n \nDistribution \n\n\n\n8 \n\nDaily doses of 20 mg lead to steady-state plasma concentrations of memantine ranging from 70 to \n150 ng/ml (0.5 – 1 μmol) with large interindividual variations. When daily doses of 5 to 30 mg were \nadministered, a mean cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum ratio of 0.52 was calculated. The volume of \ndistribution is around 10 l/kg. About 45% of memantine is bound to plasma-proteins. \n \nBiotransformation \nIn man, about 80% of the circulating memantine-related material is present as the parent compound. \nMain human metabolites are N-3,5-dimethyl-gludantan, the isomeric mixture of 4- and 6-hydroxy-\nmemantine, and 1-nitroso-3,5-dimethyl-adamantane. None of these metabolites exhibit NMDA-\nantagonistic activity. No cytochrome P 450 catalysed metabolism has been detected in vitro. \n \nIn a study using orally administered 14C-memantine, a mean of 84% of the dose was recovered within \n20 days, more than 99% being excreted renally. \n \nElimination \nMemantine is eliminated in a monoexponential manner with a terminal t½ of 60 to 100 hours. In \nvolunteers with normal kidney function, total clearance (Cltot) amounts to 170 ml/min/1.73 m2 and part \nof total renal clearance is achieved by tubular secretion. \n \nRenal handling also involves tubular reabsorption, probably mediated by cation transport proteins. The \nrenal elimination rate of memantine under alkaline urine conditions may be reduced by a factor of 7 to \n9 (see section 4.4). Alkalisation of urine may result from drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore \nto a vegetarian diet, or from the massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. \n \nLinearity \nStudies in volunteers have demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 10 to 40 mg. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \nAt a dose of memantine of 20 mg per day the CSF levels match the ki-value (ki = inhibition constant) \nof memantine, which is 0.5 μmol in human frontal cortex. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn short term studies in rats, memantine like other NMDA-antagonists have induced neuronal \nvacuolisation and necrosis (Olney lesions) only after doses leading to very high peak serum \nconcentrations. Ataxia and other preclinical signs have preceded the vacuolisation and necrosis. As the \neffects have neither been observed in long term studies in rodents nor in non-rodents, the clinical \nrelevance of these findings is unknown. \n \nOcular changes were inconsistently observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in rodents and dogs, but \nnot in monkeys. Specific ophthalmoscopic examinations in clinical studies with memantine did not \ndisclose any ocular changes. \n \nPhospholipidosis in pulmonary macrophages due to accumulation of memantine in lysosomes was \nobserved in rodents. This effect is known from other active substances with cationic amphiphilic \nproperties. There is a possible relationship between this accumulation and the vacuolisation observed \nin lungs. This effect was only observed at high doses in rodents. The clinical relevance of these \nfindings is unknown. \n \nNo genotoxicity has been observed following testing of memantine in standard assays. There was no \nevidence of any carcinogenicity in life long studies in mice and rats. Memantine was not teratogenic in \nrats and rabbits, even at maternally toxic doses, and no adverse effects of memantine were noted on \nfertility. In rats, foetal growth reduction was noted at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly \nhigher than at human exposure. \n \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Memantine Mylan is and what it is used for \n \nMemantine Mylan contains the active substance memantine. It belongs to a group of medicines known \nas anti-dementia medicines. \nMemory loss in Alzheimer’s disease is due to a disturbance of message signals in the brain. The brain \ncontains so-called N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptors that are involved in transmitting nerve \nsignals important in learning and memory. Memantine Mylan belongs to a group of medicines called \nNMDA-receptor antagonists. Memantine Mylan acts on these NMDA-receptors improving the \ntransmission of nerve signals and the memory. \n \nMemantine Mylan is used for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Memantine Mylan \n \nDo not take Memantine Mylan: \n- if you are allergic to memantine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Memantine Mylan \n- if you have a history of epileptic seizures \n- if you have recently experienced a myocardial infarction (heart attack), or if you are suffering \n\nfrom congestive heart failure or from an uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure). \n \nIn these situations the treatment should be carefully supervised, and the clinical benefit of Memantine \nMylan reassessed by your doctor on a regular basis. \n \nIf you suffer from renal impairment (kidney problems), your doctor should closely monitor your \nkidney function and if necessary adapt the memantine doses accordingly. \n \nThe use of medicinal products called amantadine (for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease), ketamine \n(a substance generally used as an anaesthetic), dextromethorphan (generally used to treat cough) and \nother NMDA-antagonists at the same time should be avoided. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nMemantine Mylan is not recommended for children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Memantine Mylan \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nIn particular, Memantine Mylan may change the effects of the following medicines and their dose may \nneed to be adjusted by your doctor: \n- amantadine, ketamine, dextromethorphan \n- dantrolene, baclofen \n- cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine, nicotine \n- hydrochlorothiazide (or any combination with hydrochlorothiazide) \n- anticholinergics (substances generally used to treat movement disorders or intestinal cramps) \n- anticonvulsants (substances used to prevent and relieve seizures) \n- barbiturates (substances generally used to induce sleep) \n- dopaminergic agonists (substances such as L-dopa, bromocriptine) \n- neuroleptics (substances used in the treatment of mental disorders) \n- oral anticoagulants \n \nIf you go into hospital, let your doctor know that you are taking Memantine Mylan. \n \nMemantine Mylan with food and drink \nYou should inform your doctor if you have recently changed or intend to change your diet \nsubstantially (e.g. from normal diet to strict vegetarian diet) or if you are suffering from states of renal \ntubulary acidosis (RTA, an excess of acid-forming substances in the blood due to renal dysfunction \n(poor kidney function)) or severe infections of the urinary tract (structure that carries urine), as your \ndoctor may need to adjust the dose of your medicine. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  \n \nPregnancy \nThe use of memantine in pregnant women is not recommended. \n \nBreast-feeding \nWomen taking Memantine Mylan should not breast-feed. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYour doctor will tell you whether your illness allows you to drive and to use machines safely. \nAlso, Memantine Mylan may change your reactivity, making driving or operating machinery \ninappropriate. \n \nMemantine Mylan contains sodium  \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n \n3. How to take Memantine Mylan \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nDosage \n\n\n\n26 \n\nThe recommended dose of Memantine Mylan for adults and older people is 20 mg once a day. In order \nto reduce the risk of side effects this dose is achieved gradually by the following daily treatment \nscheme: \n \nweek 1 half a 10 mg tablet \nweek 2 one 10 mg tablet \nweek 3 one and a half 10 mg \n\ntablets \nweek 4 and \nbeyond \n\ntwo 10 mg tablets once a \nday \n\n \nThe usual starting dose is half a 10 mg tablet once a day (5 mg) for the first week. This is increased to \none 10 mg tablet once a day (10 mg) in the second week and to 1 and a half 10 mg tablets once a day \nin the third week. From the fourth week on, the usual dose is two 10 mg tablets once a day (20 mg). \n \nDosage in patients with impaired kidney function \nIf you have impaired kidney function, your doctor will decide upon a dose that suits your condition. In \nthis case, monitoring of your kidney function should be performed by your doctor at specified \nintervals. \n \nAdministration \nMemantine Mylan should be administered orally once a day. To benefit from your medicine you \nshould take it regularly every day at the same time of the day.
