CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of transplant rejection in adult kidney or liver allograft recipients. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nTreatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal \nproducts in adult patients. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nEnvarsus is a once-a-day oral formulation of tacrolimus. Tacrolimus therapy requires careful \nmonitoring by adequately qualified and equipped personnel. This medicinal product should only be \nprescribed, and changes in immunosuppressive therapy be initiated, by physicians experienced in \nimmunosuppressive therapy and the management of transplant patients. \n \nInadvertent, unintentional, or unsupervised switching of immediate- or prolonged-release formulations \nof tacrolimus is unsafe. This can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of adverse reactions, \nincluding under- or overimmunosuppression, due to clinically relevant differences in systemic \nexposure to tacrolimus. Patients should be maintained on a single formulation of tacrolimus with the \ncorresponding daily dosing regimen; alterations in formulation or regimen should only take place \nunder the close supervision of a transplant specialist (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Following conversion \nto any alternative formulation, therapeutic drug monitoring must be performed and dose adjustments \nmade to ensure that systemic exposure to tacrolimus is maintained. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended initial doses presented below are intended to act solely as a guideline. Tacrolimus \nis routinely administered in conjunction with other immunosuppressive agents in the initial \npost-operative period. The dose may vary depending upon the immunosuppressive regimen chosen.  \n \nEnvarsus dosing should primarily be based on clinical assessments of rejection and tolerability in each \npatient individually aided by blood level monitoring (see below under “Therapeutic drug \nmonitoring”). If clinical signs of rejection are apparent, alteration of the immunosuppressive regimen \nshould be considered. \n \nAs tacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, adjustments to the dose regimen may take several \ndays before steady state is achieved. \n \nTo suppress graft rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, no limit to the \nduration of oral therapy can be given. \n \nEnvarsus doses are usually reduced in the post-transplant period. Post-transplant changes in the \ncondition of the patient may alter the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus and may necessitate further dose \nadjustments. \n \nMissed dose \nA forgotten dose should be taken as soon as possible on the same day. A double dose should not be \ntaken on the next day. \n \nProphylaxis of kidney transplant rejection \nEnvarsus therapy should commence at a dose of 0.17 mg/kg/day administered once daily in the \nmorning. Administration should commence within 24 hours after the completion of surgery. \n \nProphylaxis of liver transplant rejection \nEnvarsus therapy should commence at a dose of 0.11–0.13 mg/kg/day administered once daily in the \nmorning. Administration should commence within 24 hours after the completion of surgery.  \n \nConversion of Prograf- or Advagraf-treated patients to Envarsus - allograft transplant patients \nEnvarsus is not interchangeable with other existing tacrolimus containing medicinal products \n(immediate-release or prolonged-release) on an equal dose by dose basis. \nAllograft transplant patients maintained on twice daily Prograf (immediate-release) or Advagraf (once \ndaily) dosing requiring conversion to once daily Envarsus should be converted on a 1:0.7 (mg:mg) \n\n\n\n4 \n\ntotal daily dose basis and the Envarsus maintenance dose should, therefore, be 30% less than the \nPrograf or Advagraf dose.  \n \nIn stable patients converted from tacrolimus immediate-release products (twice daily) to Envarsus \n(once daily) on a 1:0.7 (mg:mg) total daily dose basis, the mean systemic exposure to tacrolimus \n(AUC0-24) was similar to that of immediate-release tacrolimus. The relationship between tacrolimus \ntrough levels (C24) and systemic exposure (AUC0-24) for Envarsus is similar to that of \nimmediate-release tacrolimus. No studies have been conducted with conversion of patients from \nAdvagraf to Envarsus; however, data from healthy volunteers would suggest that the same conversion \nrate is applicable as with the conversion from Prograf to Envarsus. \n \nWhen converting from tacrolimus immediate-release products (e.g. Prograf capsules) or from \nAdvagraf prolonged-release capsules to Envarsus, trough levels should be measured prior to \nconversion and within two weeks after conversion. Dose adjustments should be made to ensure that \nsimilar systemic exposure is maintained after the switch. It should be noted that black patients may \nrequire a higher dose to achieve the targeted trough levels.  \n \nConversion from ciclosporin to tacrolimus \nCare should be taken when converting patients from ciclosporin-based to tacrolimus-based therapy \n(see sections 4.4 and 4.5). The combined administration of ciclosporin and tacrolimus is not \nrecommended. Tacrolimus therapy should be initiated after considering ciclosporin blood \nconcentrations and the clinical condition of the patient. Dosing should be delayed in the presence of \nelevated ciclosporin blood levels. In practice, tacrolimus-based therapy has been initiated 12 to \n24 hours after discontinuation of ciclosporin. Monitoring of ciclosporin blood levels should be \ncontinued following conversion as the clearance of ciclosporin might be affected. \n \nTreatment of allograft rejection \nIncreased doses of tacrolimus, supplemental corticosteroid therapy, and introduction of short courses \nof mono-/polyclonal antibodies have all been used to manage rejection episodes. If signs of toxicity \nsuch as severe adverse reactions are noted (see section 4.8), the dose of Envarsus may need to be \nreduced. \n \nTreatment of allograft rejection after kidney or liver transplantation \nFor conversion from other immunosuppressants to once daily tacrolimus, treatment should begin with \nthe initial oral dose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation respectively for prophylaxis of \ntransplant rejection. \n \nTherapeutic drug monitoring \n \nDosing should primarily be based on clinical assessments of rejection and tolerability in each \nindividual patient aided by whole blood tacrolimus trough level monitoring. \n \nAs an aid to optimise dosing, several immunoassays are available for determining tacrolimus \nconcentrations in whole blood. Comparisons of concentrations from the published literature to \nindividual values in clinical practice should be assessed with care and knowledge of the assay methods \nemployed. In current clinical practice, whole blood levels are monitored using immunoassay methods. \nThe relationship between tacrolimus trough levels and systemic exposure (AUC0-24) is well correlated \nand is similar between the immediate-release formulation and Envarsus. \n \nBlood trough levels of tacrolimus should be monitored during the post-transplantation period. \nTacrolimus blood trough levels should be determined approximately 24 hours post-dosing of \nEnvarsus, just prior to the next dose. Blood trough levels of tacrolimus should also be closely \nmonitored following conversion from tacrolimus products, dose adjustments, changes in the \nimmunosuppressive regimen, or co-administration of substances which may alter tacrolimus whole \nblood concentrations (see section 4.5). The frequency of blood level monitoring should be based on \nclinical needs. As tacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, following adjustments to the Envarsus \ndose regimen it may take several days before the targeted steady state is achieved. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nData from clinical studies suggest that the majority of patients can be successfully managed if \ntacrolimus blood trough levels are maintained below 20 ng/mL. It is necessary to consider the clinical \ncondition of the patient when interpreting whole blood levels. In clinical practice, whole blood trough \nlevels have generally been in the range of 5-20 ng/mL in kidney transplant patients in the early \npost-transplant period, and 5-15 ng/mL during subsequent maintenance therapy. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients (> 65 years) \nThere is no evidence currently available to indicate that dose should be adjusted in elderly patients. \n \nHepatic impairment \nDose reduction may be necessary in patients with severe liver impairment in order to maintain the \ntacrolimus blood trough levels within the recommended target range. \n \nRenal impairment \nAs the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus are unaffected by renal function (see section 5.2), no dose \nadjustment is required. However, owing to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, careful monitoring \nof renal function is recommended (including serial serum creatinine concentrations, calculation of \ncreatinine clearance, and monitoring of urine output). \n \nRace \nIn comparison to Caucasians, black patients may require higher tacrolimus doses to achieve similar \ntrough levels. In clinical studies patients converted from twice daily Prograf were converted to \nEnvarsus at 1:0.85 (mg:mg). \n \nGender \nThere is no evidence that male and female patients require different doses to achieve similar trough \nlevels. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Envarsus in children below 18 years of age have not yet been established.  \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nEnvarsus is a once-a-day oral formulation of tacrolimus. It is recommended that the oral daily dose of \nEnvarsus is administered once daily in the morning.  \nThe tablets should be swallowed whole with fluid (preferably water) immediately following removal \nfrom the blister. Envarsus should generally be taken on an empty stomach to achieve maximal \nabsorption (see section 5.2).  \nPatients should be advised not to swallow the desiccant. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nHypersensitivity to other macrolides. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMedication errors, including inadvertent, unintentional or unsupervised substitution of immediate- or \nprolonged-release tacrolimus formulations, have been observed with tacrolimus. This has led to \nserious adverse reactions, including graft rejection, or other adverse reactions which could be a \nconsequence of either under- or over-exposure to tacrolimus. Patients should be maintained on a single \nformulation of tacrolimus with the corresponding daily dosing regimen; alterations in formulation or \n\n\n\n6 \n\nregimen should only take place under the close supervision of a transplant specialist (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.8). \n \nFor treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal \nproducts in adult patients clinical studies are not yet available for the prolonged-release formulation \nEnvarsus.  \n \nFor prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult heart, lung, pancreas, or intestine allograft recipients \nclinical data are not yet available for Envarsus. \n \nDuring the initial post-transplant period, monitoring of the following parameters should be undertaken \non a routine basis: blood pressure, ECG, neurological and visual status, fasting blood glucose levels, \nelectrolytes (particularly potassium), liver and renal function tests, haematology parameters, \ncoagulation values, and plasma protein determinations. If clinically relevant changes are seen, \nadjustments of the immunosuppressive regimen should be considered. \n \nWhen substances with a potential for interaction (see section 4.5), particularly strong inhibitors of \nCYP3A4 (such as telaprevir, boceprevir, ritonavir, ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, \ntelithromycin, or clarithromycin) or inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin or rifabutin), are being \ncombined with tacrolimus, tacrolimus blood levels should be monitored to adjust the tacrolimus dose \nas appropriate in order to maintain similar tacrolimus exposure. \n \nHerbal preparations containing St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) should be avoided when \ntaking tacrolimus due to the risk of interactions that lead to a decrease in both blood concentrations \nand the therapeutic effect of tacrolimus (see section 4.5). \n \nThe combined administration of ciclosporin and tacrolimus should be avoided and care should be \ntaken when administering tacrolimus to patients who have previously received ciclosporin (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.5). \n \nHigh potassium intake or potassium-sparing diuretics should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \nCertain combinations of tacrolimus with substances known to have nephrotoxic or neurotoxic effects \nmay increase the risk of these effects (see section 4.5). \n \nImmunosuppressants may affect the response to vaccination and vaccination during treatment with \ntacrolimus may be less effective. The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \n \nGastrointestinal perforation has been reported in patients treated with tacrolimus. As gastrointestinal \nperforation is a medically important event that may lead to a life-threatening or serious condition, \nadequate treatments should be considered immediately after suspected symptoms or signs occur. \nSince levels of tacrolimus in blood may significantly change during diarrhoea episodes, extra \nmonitoring of tacrolimus concentrations is recommended during episodes of diarrhoea.  \n \nEye disorders \n \nEye disorders, sometimes progressing to loss of vision, have been reported in patients treated with \ntacrolimus. Some cases have reported resolution on switching to alternative immunosuppression. \nPatients should be advised to report changes in visual acuity, changes in colour vision, blurred vision, \nor visual field defect, and in such cases, prompt evaluation is recommended with referral to an \nophthalmologist as appropriate. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nCardiac disorders \n \nVentricular hypertrophy or hypertrophy of the septum, reported as cardiomyopathies, have been \nobserved in tacrolimus treated patients on rare occasions. Most cases have been reversible, occurring \nwith tacrolimus blood trough concentrations much higher than the recommended maximum levels. \nOther factors observed to increase the risk of these clinical conditions included pre-existing heart \ndisease, corticosteroid usage, hypertension, renal or hepatic dysfunction, infections, fluid overload and \noedema. Accordingly, high-risk patients receiving substantial immunosuppression should be \nmonitored, using such procedures as echocardiography or ECG pre- and post-transplant (e.g. initially \nat 3 months and then at 9-12 months). If abnormalities develop, dose reduction of tacrolimus or \nchange of treatment to another immunosuppressive agent should be considered. Tacrolimus may \nprolong the QT interval but at this time lacks substantial evidence for causing Torsades de Pointes. \nCaution should be exercised in patients with diagnosed or suspected Congenital Long QT Syndrome. \n \nLymphoproliferative disorders and malignancies \n \nPatients treated with tacrolimus have been reported to develop Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-associated \nlymphoproliferative disorders (see section 4.8). A combination of immunosuppressives, such as \nantilymphocytic antibodies (e.g. basiliximab, daclizumab), given concomitantly increases the risk of \nEBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders. EBV-Viral Capsid Antigen (VCA)-negative patients \nhave been reported to have an increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders. Therefore, \nin this patient group, EBV-VCA serology should be ascertained before starting treatment with \nEnvarsus. During treatment, careful monitoring with EBV-PCR (Polymerase-Chain-Reaction) is \nrecommended. Positive EBV-PCR may persist for months and is per se not indicative of \nlymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma. \n \nAs with other potent immunosuppressive compounds, the risk of secondary cancer is unknown (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nAs with other immunosuppressive agents, owing to the potential risk of malignant skin changes, \nexposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a \nsunscreen with a high protection factor. \n \nInfection including opportunistic infections \n \nPatients treated with immunosuppressants, including Envarsus, are at increased risk for infections \nincluding opportunistic infections (bacterial, fungal, viral and protozoal) such as BK virus associated \nnephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Patients are \nalso at an increased risk of infections with viral hepatitis (e.g. hepatitis B and C reactivation and de \nnovo infection, as well as hepatitis E, which may become chronic). These infections are often related \nto a high total immunosuppressive burden and may lead to serious or fatal conditions that physicians \nshould consider in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients with deteriorating hepatic \nor renal function or neurological symptoms. Prevention and management should be in accordance with \nappropriate clinical guidance. \n \nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) \n \nPatients treated with tacrolimus have been reported to develop posterior reversible encephalopathy \nsyndrome (PRES). If patients taking tacrolimus present with symptoms indicating PRES such as \nheadache, altered mental status, seizures and visual disturbances, a radiological procedure (e.g. MRI) \nshould be performed. If PRES is diagnosed, adequate blood pressure and seizure control and \nimmediate discontinuation of systemic tacrolimus is advised. Most patients completely recover after \nappropriate measures are taken. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nPure red cell aplasia \n \nCases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with tacrolimus. All \npatients reported risk factors for PRCA such as parvovirus B19 infection, underlying disease or \nconcomitant medicinal product associated with PRCA. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nThere is limited experience in non-Caucasian patients and patients at elevated immunological risk (e.g. \nretransplantation, evidence of panel reactive antibodies, PRA). \nDose reduction may be necessary in patients with severe liver impairment (see section 4.2). \n \nExcipients \n \nEnvarsus contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nSystemically available tacrolimus is metabolised by hepatic CYP3A4. There is also evidence of \ngastrointestinal metabolism by CYP3A4 in the intestinal wall. Concomitant use of substances known \nto inhibit or induce CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and thereby increase or \ndecrease tacrolimus blood levels. \nIt is strongly recommended to closely monitor tacrolimus blood levels, as well as renal function and \nother undesirable effects, whenever substances which have the potential to alter CYP3A4 metabolism \nor otherwise influence tacrolimus blood levels are used concomitantly, and to interrupt or adjust the \ntacrolimus dose as appropriate in order to maintain similar tacrolimus exposure (see sections 4.2 and \n4.4). \n \nEffect of other medicinal products on the metabolism of tacrolimus \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors potentially leading to increased tacrolimus blood levels \nClinically, the following substances have been shown to increase tacrolimus blood levels: \nStrong interactions have been observed with antifungal agents such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, \nitraconazole, voriconazole and isavuconazole, the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin, HIV protease \ninhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) protease inhibitors (e.g. \ntelaprevir, boceprevir, and the combination of ombitasvir and paritaprevir with ritonavir, when used \nwith and without dasabuvir), or the CMV antiviral letermovir, the pharmacokinetic enhancer \ncobicistat, and the tyrosine kinase inhibitors nilotinib and imatinib. Concomitant use of these \nsubstances may require decreased tacrolimus doses in nearly all patients. \n \nPharmacokinetics studies have indicated that the increase in blood levels is mainly a result of increase \nin oral bioavailability of tacrolimus owing to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism. Effect on \nhepatic clearance is less pronounced. \n \nWeaker interactions have been observed with clotrimazole, clarithromycin, josamycin, nifedipine, \nnicardipine, diltiazem, verapamil, amiodarone, danazol, ethinylestradiol, omeprazole and nefazodone. \n \nIn vitro the following substances have been shown to be potential inhibitors of tacrolimus metabolism: \nbromocriptine, cortisone, dapsone, ergotamine, gestodene, lidocaine, mephenytoin, miconazole, \nmidazolam, nilvadipine, norethindrone, quinidine, tamoxifen and (triacetyl)oleandomycin. \nGrapefruit juice has been reported to increase the blood level of tacrolimus and should, therefore, be \navoided. \nLansoprazol and ciclosporin may potentially inhibit CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of tacrolimus and, \nthereby, increase tacrolimus whole blood concentrations. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nOther interactions potentially leading to increased tacrolimus blood levels \nTacrolimus is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Possible interactions with other active substances \nknown to have high affinity for plasma proteins should be considered (e.g. NSAIDs, oral \nanticoagulants or oral antidiabetics). \nOther potential interactions that may increase systemic exposure of tacrolimus include prokinetic \nagents (such as metoclopramide and cisapride), cimetidine and magnesium-aluminium-hydroxide. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers potentially leading to decreased tacrolimus blood levels \nClinically, the following substances have been shown to decrease tacrolimus blood levels: \nInteractions have been observed with rifampicin, phenytoin, and St. John’s Wort (Hypericum \nperforatum) which may require increased tacrolimus doses in almost all patients. Clinically significant \ninteractions have also been observed with phenobarbital. Maintenance doses of corticosteroids have \nbeen shown to reduce tacrolimus blood levels. \n \nHigh dose prednisolone or methylprednisolone administered for the treatment of acute rejection have \nthe potential to increase or decrease tacrolimus blood levels. \n \nCarbamazepine, metamizole and isoniazid have the potential to decrease tacrolimus concentrations. \n \nImpact of DAA therapy  \nThe pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus may be impacted by changes in liver function during DAA \ntherapy, related to clearance of HCV virus. A close monitoring and potential dose adjustment of \ntacrolimus is warranted to ensure continued efficacy. \n \nEffect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicinal products \n \nTacrolimus is a known CYP3A4 inhibitor; thus, concomitant use of tacrolimus with medicinal \nproducts known to be metabolised by CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of such medicinal products. \nThe half-life of ciclosporin is prolonged when tacrolimus is given concomitantly. In addition, \nsynergistic/additive nephrotoxic effects can occur. For these reasons, the combined administration of \nciclosporin and tacrolimus is not recommended, and care should be taken when administering \ntacrolimus to patients who have previously received ciclosporin (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \nTacrolimus has been shown to increase the blood level of phenytoin. \nAs tacrolimus may reduce the clearance of steroid-based contraceptives leading to increased hormone \nexposure, particular care should be exercised when deciding upon contraceptive measures. \nLimited knowledge of interactions between tacrolimus and statins is available. Clinical data suggest \nthat the pharmacokinetics of statins are largely unaltered by the co-administration of tacrolimus. \nAnimal data have shown that tacrolimus could potentially decrease the clearance and increase the \nhalf-life of pentobarbital and antipyrine.  \n \nMycophenolic acid \nCaution should be exercised when switching combination therapy from ciclosporin, which interferes \nwith enterohepatic recirculation of mycophenolic acid, to tacrolimus, which is devoid of this effect, as \nthis might result in changes of mycophenolic acid exposure. Drugs which interfere with mycophenolic \nacid's enterohepatic cycle have potential to reduce the plasma level and efficacy of mycophenolic acid. \nTherapeutic drug monitoring of mycophenolic acid may be appropriate when switching from \nciclosporin to tacrolimus or vice versa. \n \nOther interactions leading to clinically detrimental effects \n \nConcurrent use of tacrolimus with medicinal products known to have nephrotoxic or neurotoxic \neffects may increase these effects (e.g. aminoglycosides, gyrase inhibitors, vancomycin, \ncotrimoxazole, NSAIDs, ganciclovir, or aciclovir). \nEnhanced nephrotoxicity has been observed following the administration of amphotericin B and \nibuprofen in conjunction with tacrolimus. \n\n\n\n10 \n\nAs tacrolimus treatment may be associated with hyperkalaemia, or may increase pre-existing \nhyperkalaemia, high potassium intake, or potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. amiloride, triamterene, or \nspironolactone) should be avoided (see section 4.4). \nImmunosuppressants may affect the response to vaccination, and vaccination during treatment with \ntacrolimus may be less effective. The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nHuman data show that tacrolimus crosses the placenta. Limited data from organ transplant recipients \nshow no evidence of an increased risk of adverse events on the course and outcome of pregnancy \nunder tacrolimus treatment compared with other immunosuppressive medicinal products. However, \ncases of spontaneous abortion have been reported. To date, no other relevant epidemiological data are \navailable. Tacrolimus treatment can be considered in pregnant women when there is no safer \nalternative, and when the perceived benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \nIn case of in utero exposure, monitoring of the newborn for potential adverse events of tacrolimus is \nrecommended (in particular, effects on the kidneys). There is a risk for premature delivery (<37 week) \n(incidence of 66 of 123 births, i.e. 53.7%; however, data showed that the majority of the newborns had \nnormal birth weight for their gestational age) as well as for hyperkalaemia in the newborn (incidence 8 \nof 111 neonates, i.e. 7.2 %) which, however normalises spontaneously. In rats and rabbits, tacrolimus \ncaused embryofoetal toxicity at doses which demonstrated maternal toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nHuman data demonstrate that tacrolimus is excreted in breast milk. As detrimental effects on the \nnewborn cannot be excluded, women should not breast-feed whilst receiving Envarsus. \n \nFertility \n \nA negative effect of tacrolimus on male fertility in the form of reduced sperm count and motility was \nobserved in rats (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nEnvarsus may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Tacrolimus may cause \nvisual and neurological disturbances. This effect may be enhanced if Envarsus is administered in \nassociation with alcohol. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions for tacrolimus (occurring in >10% of patients) are \ntremor, renal impairment, hyperglycaemic conditions, diabetes mellitus, hyperkalaemia, infections, \nhypertension and insomnia. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to \n<1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable \neffects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nInfections and infestations \nPatients receiving tacrolimus are frequently at increased risk for infections (viral, bacterial, fungal, \nprotozoal). The course of pre-existing infections may be aggravated. Both generalised and localised \ninfections can occur. \nCases of BK virus associated nephropathy, as well as cases of JC virus associated progressive \nmultifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), have been reported in patients treated with \nimmunosuppressants, including tacrolimus. \n \nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl. cysts and polyps) \nPatients receiving immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk of developing malignancies. \nBenign as well as malignant neoplasms including EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders and \nskin malignancies have been reported in association with tacrolimus treatment. \n \nImmune system disorders \nAllergic and anaphylactoid reactions have been observed in patients receiving tacrolimus (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nSystem Organ

primary graft \ndysfunction \n\n    \n\n \nMedication errors, including inadvertent, unintentional or unsupervised substitution of immediate- or \nprolonged-release tacrolimus formulations, have been observed. A number of associated cases of \ntransplant rejection have been reported.  \n \nIn clinical studies in kidney transplant patients receiving Envarsus, the most frequent adverse reactions \n(at least in 2% of patients) were tremor, diabetes mellitus, blood creatinine increased, urinary tract \ninfection, hypertension, BK virus infection, renal impairment, diarrhoea, toxicity to various agents, \nand toxic nephropathy all of which are known to occur in the respective patient population under \nimmunosuppressive treatment. In all, there appears to be no significant difference in the pattern of \nadverse events suspected to be causally related to study drug between once daily Envarsus and \ntacrolimus immediate-release capsules (Prograf). \nAmong the most frequent adverse reactions (at least in 2% of patients) in clinical studies in liver \ntransplant patients receiving Envarsus were tremor, headache, fatigue, hyperkalaemia, hypertension, \nrenal failure, blood creatinine increased, dizziness, hepatitis C, muscle spasms, tinea infection, \nleukopenia, sinusitis, and upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), all of which are known to occur in \nthe respective patient population under immunosuppressive treatment. As in kidney transplant \nrecipients, there appears to be no meaningful difference in the pattern of suspected adverse drug \nreactions between once daily Envarsus and tacrolimus immediate-release capsules (Prograf). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n15 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nExperience with overdose is limited. Several cases of accidental overdose have been reported with \ntacrolimus. Symptoms have included tremor, headache, nausea and vomiting, infections, urticaria, \nlethargy and increases in blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine and alanine aminotransferase levels. \nNo specific antidote to tacrolimus therapy is available. If overdose occurs, general supportive \nmeasures and symptomatic treatment should be conducted. \nBased on its high molecular weight, poor aqueous solubility, and extensive erythrocyte and plasma \nprotein binding, it is anticipated that tacrolimus will not be dialysable. In isolated patients with very \nhigh plasma levels, haemofiltration or -diafiltration have been effective in reducing toxic \nconcentrations. In cases of oral intoxication, gastric lavage and/or the use of adsorbents (such as \nactivated charcoal) may be helpful if used shortly after intake. \nIt should be noted however, that there has been no direct experience with Envarsus in overdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, calcineurin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AD02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAt the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus appear to be mediated by binding to a cytosolic \nprotein (FKBP12) which is responsible for the intracellular accumulation of the compound. The \nFKBP12-tacrolimus complex specifically and competitively binds to and inhibits calcineurin, leading \nto a calcium-dependent inhibition of T-cell signal transduction pathways, thereby preventing \ntranscription of a discrete set of cytokine genes. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nTacrolimus is a highly potent immunosuppressive agent and has proven activity in both in vitro and in \nvivo experiments. \nIn particular, tacrolimus inhibits the formation of cytotoxic lymphocytes, which are mainly responsible \nfor graft rejection. Tacrolimus suppresses T-cell activation and T-helper-cell dependent B-cell \nproliferation, as well as the formation of lymphokines (such as interleukins-2, -3, and γ-interferon) and \nthe expression of the interleukin-2 receptor. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nResults from clinical studies performed with once-daily tacrolimus \n \nKidney transplantation \nThe efficacy and safety of Envarsus and Prograf, both in combination with mycophenolate mofetil \n(MMF), corticosteroids and IL-2 receptor antagonist as per the standard of care were compared in a \nrandomised, double-blind, double-dummy study, in 543 de novo kidney transplant recipients.  \nThe percentage of patients with one or greater than one episode of clinically-suspected and treated \nrejections during the 360-day study was 13.8% for the Envarsus group (N=268) and 15.6% for the \nPrograf group (N=275). The event rate for centrally read, biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (BPAR) \nduring the 360-day study was 13.1% in the Envarsus group (N=268) and 13.5% in the Prograf group \n(N=275). The efficacy failure rate as measured by the composite endpoint of death, graft loss, \ncentrally read BPAR and loss to follow-up was 18.3% in the Envarsus group and 19.6% in the Prograf \ngroup. The treatment difference (Envarsus-Prograf) was -1.35% (95% confidence interval [-7.94%, \n5.27%]). Treatment-emergent fatal adverse events occurred in 1.8% of Envarsus patients and 2.5% of \nPrograf patients. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nThe efficacy and safety of Envarsus and Prograf, both in combination with mycophenolate mofetil \n(MMF) or mycophenolate sodium (MPS) and corticosteroids, were compared in 324 stable kidney \ntransplant recipients. The event rate for locally read BPAR during the 360-day study was 1.2% in the \nEnvarsus group (N=162) post conversion from Prograf at a dose ratio of 1:0.7 (mg:mg) and 1.2% in \nthe group maintained on Prograf (N=162). The efficacy failure rate as measured by the composite \nendpoint of death, graft loss, locally read BPAR and loss to follow-up was 2.5% in both the Envarsus \nand Prograf groups. The treatment difference (Envarsus-Prograf) was 0% (95% confidence interval [-\n4.21%, 4.21%]). The treatment failure rate using the same composite end-point with centrally read \nBPAR was 1.9% in the Envarsus group and 3.7% in the Prograf group (95% confidence interval [-\n6.51%, 2.31%]). Treatment emergent fatal adverse events occurred in 1.2% of Envarsus patients and \n0.6% of Prograf patients. \n \nLiver transplantation \nThe pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Envarsus and tacrolimus immediate-release capsules, \nboth in combination with corticosteroids were compared in 117 liver transplant recipients, of whom \n88 received treatment with Envarsus. In the de novo liver transplant study, 29 subjects were treated \nwith Envarsus. The event rate of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection within the 360-day study period \nwas not significantly different between the Envarsus group and the tacrolimus immediate-release \ngroup. The overall incidence of fatal treatment emergent adverse events for the combined de novo and \nstable liver transplant population was not significantly different between the Envarsus group and the \ntacrolimus immediate-release group.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe oral bioavailability of Envarsus was decreased when the medicinal product was administered after \na meal; the extent of absorption was decreased by 55% and the maximum plasma concentration was \ndecreased by 22% when taken directly after a high-fat meal. Therefore, Envarsus should generally be \ntaken on an empty stomach to achieve maximal absorption. \n \nIn man tacrolimus has been shown to be able to be absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract. \nAvailable tacrolimus is generally rapidly absorbed. Envarsus is a prolonged-release formulation of \ntacrolimus resulting in an extended oral absorption profile with an average time to maximum blood \nconcentration (Cmax) of approximately 6 hours (tmax) at steady state.  \n \nAbsorption is variable and the mean oral bioavailability of tacrolimus is in the range of 20%-25% \n(individual range in adult patients 6%-43%). The oral bioavailability is approximately 40% higher for \nEnvarsus as compared to the same dose of tacrolimus immediate-release formulation (Prograf) in \nkidney transplant patients.  \n \nHigher Cavg (~50%), reduced peak trough fluctuation (Cmax/Cmin) and a longer Tmax were seen for \nEnvarsus when compared with both, tacrolimus immediate-release formulation (Prograf) and a \ntacrolimus once daily formulation (Advagraf). Mean values for Cmax, percentage degree of fluctuation \nand percentage degree of swing were significantly lower with administration of Envarsus tablets. \n \nA strong correlation exists between AUC and whole blood trough levels at steady-state for Envarsus. \nMonitoring of whole blood trough levels therefore provides a good estimate of systemic exposure. \n \nIn vitro test results indicate that there is no risk of in vivo dose dumping related to alcohol intake.  \n \nDistribution \n \nIn man, the disposition of tacrolimus after intravenous infusion may be described as biphasic. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nIn the systemic circulation, tacrolimus binds strongly to erythrocytes resulting in an approximate 20:1 \ndistribution ratio of whole blood/plasma concentrations. In plasma, tacrolimus is highly bound \n(>98.8%) to plasma proteins, mainly to serum albumin and α-1-acid glycoprotein. \nTacrolimus is extensively distributed in the body. The steady-state volume of distribution based on \nplasma concentrations is approximately 1,300 L (healthy subjects). Corresponding data based on \nwhole blood averaged 47.6 L. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nTacrolimus is widely metabolised in the liver, primarily by the cytochrome P450-3A4. Tacrolimus is \nalso considerably metabolised in the intestinal wall. There are several metabolites identified. Only one \nof these has been shown in vitro to have immunosuppressive activity similar to that of tacrolimus. The \nother metabolites have only weak or no immunosuppressive activity. In systemic circulation only one \nof the inactive metabolites is present at low concentrations. Therefore, metabolites do not contribute to \nthe pharmacological activity of tacrolimus.  \n \nElimination \n \nTacrolimus is a low-clearance substance. In healthy subjects, the average total body clearance \nestimated from whole blood concentrations was 2.25 L/h. In adult liver, kidney, and heart transplant \npatients, values of 4.1 L/h, 6.7 L/h, and 3.9 L/h, respectively, have been observed. Factors such as low \nhaematocrit and protein levels, which result in an increase in the unbound fraction of tacrolimus, or \ncorticosteroid-induced increased metabolism, are considered to be responsible for the higher clearance \nrates observed following transplantation. \nThe half-life of tacrolimus is long and variable. In healthy subjects, the mean half-life in whole blood \nis approximately 30 hours. \nFollowing intravenous and oral administration of 14C-labelled tacrolimus, most of the radioactivity \nwas eliminated in the faeces. Approximately 2% of the radioactivity was eliminated in the urine. Less \nthan 1% of unchanged tacrolimus was detected in the urine and faeces, indicating that tacrolimus is \nalmost completely metabolised prior to elimination bile being the principal route of elimination. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe kidneys and the pancreas were the primary organs affected in toxicity studies performed in rats \nand baboons. In rats, tacrolimus caused toxic effects to the nervous system and the eyes. Reversible \ncardiotoxic effects were observed in rabbits following intravenous administration of tacrolimus. \nEmbryofoetal toxicity was observed in rats and rabbits and was limited to doses that caused significant \ntoxicity in maternal animals. In rats, female reproductive function including birth was impaired at \ntoxic doses and the offspring showed reduced birth weights, viability and growth. \nA negative effect of tacrolimus on male fertility in the form of reduced sperm count and motility was \nobserved in rats. \n \n \n6.

What you need to know before you take Envarsus \n3. How to take Envarsus \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Envarsus \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Envarsus is and what it is used for \n \nEnvarsus contains the active substance tacrolimus. It is an immunosuppressant. Following your kidney \nor liver transplant, your body’s immune system will try to reject the new organ.  \n \nEnvarsus is used to control your body’s immune response, enabling your body to accept the \ntransplanted organ. \n \nYou may also be given Envarsus for an ongoing rejection of your transplanted liver, kidney, heart or \nother organ when any previous treatment you were taking was unable to control this immune response \nafter your transplantation. \n \nEnvarsus is used in adults. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Envarsus \n \nDo not take Envarsus: \n- if you are allergic to tacrolimus or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you are allergic to sirolimus or to any macrolide-antibiotic (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin, \n\njosamycin). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nEnvarsus contains the active substance tacrolimus presented in a prolonged release formulation. \nEnvarsus is taken once daily and is not interchangeable with other existing medicines containing \ntacrolimus (immediate release or prolonged release) on an equal dose by dose basis. \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Envarsus: \n- if you have, or have had, liver problems. \n- if you have diarrhoea for more than one day. \n- if you are taking any medicines mentioned below under “Other medicines and Envarsus”. \n- if you have an alteration of the electrical activity of your heart called “QT prolongation”. \n \nTell your doctor immediately if during treatment you suffer from: \n- problems with your vision such as blurred vision, changes in colour vision, difficulty in seeing \n\ndetail or if your field of vision becomes restricted. \n- if you feel strong abdominal pain accompanied or not with other symptoms, such as chills, \n\nfever, nausea or vomiting  \n- an infection, leading to problems with your kidney or neurological symptoms \n- headache, altered mental status, seizures and visual disturbances \n- weakness, change in skin or eye colour, easy bruising, infection, cough, anaemia \n \nYour doctor may need to adjust your dose of Envarsus or will decide to stop treatment with \ntacrolimus. \n \nYou should keep in regular contact with your doctor. From time to time, your doctor may need to do \nblood, urine, heart, or eye tests, to set the right dose of Envarsus. \n \nYou should limit your exposure to the sun and UV (ultraviolet) light whilst taking Envarsus. This is \nbecause immunosuppressants could increase the risk of skin cancer. Wear appropriate protective \nclothing and use a sunscreen with a high sun protection factor. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe use of Envarsus is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Envarsus \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal preparations. \n \nIt is not recommended that Envarsus is taken with ciclosporin (another medicine used for the \nprevention of transplant organ rejection). \n \nTell your doctor if you have hepatitis C. Your liver function may change with treatment of hepatitis C \nand this may affect the levels of tacrolimus in your blood. Your doctor may need to closely monitor \ntacrolimus blood levels and make adjustments to the dose after you start treatment for hepatitis C. \n \nEnvarsus blood levels can be affected by other medicines you take, and blood levels of other \nmedicines can be affected by taking Envarsus, which may require interruption, an increase or a \ndecrease in Envarsus dose. In particular, you should tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently \ntaken medicines like: \n- antifungal medicines and antibiotics, particularly so-called macrolide antibiotics, used to treat \n\ninfections (e.g. ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clotrimazole, and \nisavuconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, josamycin, isoniazid and rifampicin) \n\n- letermovir, used to prevent illness caused by CMV (human cytomegalovirus) \n- HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir), the booster medicine cobicistat, \n\nand combination tablets, used to treat HIV infection \n- HCV protease inhibitors (e.g. telaprevir, boceprevir, and the combination \n\nombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir), used to treat hepatitis C  \n- nilotinib and imatinib (used to treat certain cancers) \n- mycophenolic acid, used to suppress the immune system to prevent transplant rejection \n- medicines for stomach ulcer and acid reflux (e.g. omeprazole, lansoprazole or cimetidine) \n- antiemetics, used to treat nausea and vomiting (e.g. metoclopramide) \n- cisapride or the antacid magnesium-aluminium-hydroxide, used to treat heartburn \n\n\n\n40 \n\n- the contraceptive pill or other hormone treatments with ethinylestradiol, hormone treatments \nwith danazol \n\n- medicines used to treat high blood pressure or heart problems (e.g. nifedipine, nicardipine, \ndiltiazem and verapamil) \n\n- anti-arrhythmic substances (e.g. amiodarone) used to control arrhythmia (uneven beating of the \nheart) \n\n- medicines known as “statins”, used to treat elevated cholesterol and triglycerides \n- phenytoin or phenobarbital, used to treat epilepsy \n- prednisolone and methylprednisolone, belonging to the class of corticosteroids and used to treat \n\ninflammations or suppress the immune system (e.g. in transplant rejection) \n- carbamazepine, used to prevent and control seizures \n- metamizole, used to treat pain and high fever \n- nefazodone, used to treat depression \n- herbal preparations containing St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking or need to take ibuprofen (used to treat fever, inflammation and \npain), amphotericin B (used to treat fungal infections), antibiotics (used to treat bacterial infections, \ne.g. aminoglycosides, vancomycin or clotrimazole) or antivirals (used to treat viral infections, e.g. \naciclovir). These may worsen kidney or nervous system problems when taken together with Envarsus. \n \nWhile you take Envarsus your doctor also needs to know if you are taking potassium supplements or \ncertain diuretics used for heart failure, hypertension and kidney disease (e.g. amiloride, triamterene, or \nspironolactone), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory substances (NSAIDs, e.g. ibuprofen) used for fever, \ninflammation and pain, anticoagulants (blood thinners), or oral medicines for diabetes. \n \nIf you need to have any vaccinations, please tell your doctor before. \n \nEnvarsus with food and drink \nAvoid grapefruit (also as juice) while on treatment with Envarsus, since it can affect its levels in the \nblood. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \nTacrolimus passes into breast milk. Therefore, you should not breast-feed whilst taking Envarsus. \n \nDriving and using machines \nDo not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel dizzy or sleepy, or have problems seeing clearly \nafter taking Envarsus. These effects are more frequent if you also drink alcohol. \n \nEnvarsus contains lactose \nEnvarsus contains lactose (milk sugar).  \n• Envarsus 0.75 mg tablets:  41.7 mg \n• Envarsus 1 mg tablets:  41.7 mg \n• Envarsus 4 mg tablets:  104 mg \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Envarsus \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  \nThis medicine should only be prescribed for you by a doctor with experience in the treatment of \ntransplant patients. \n \n\nhttps://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/understanding-seizures-basics\n\n\n41 \n\nImportant information \nMake sure that you receive the same tacrolimus medicine every time you collect your prescription, \nunless your transplant specialist has agreed to change to a different tacrolimus medicine. \nThis medicine should be taken once a day. If the appearance of this medicine is not the same as usual, \nor if doe instructions have changed, speak to your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible to make \nsure that you have the right medicine. \n \nHow much Envarsus do I have to take \nThe starting dose to prevent the rejection of your transplanted organ will be determined by your doctor \ncalculated according to your body weight.  \n \nInitial daily doses just after transplantation will generally be in the range of: \n0.11 - 0.17 mg per kg body weight per day \ndepending on the transplanted organ. When treating rejection, the same doses may be used. \n \nYour dose depends on your general condition and on which other immunosuppressive medicines you \nare taking. Following the initiation of your treatment with this medicine, frequent blood tests will be \ntaken by your doctor to define the correct dose. Afterwards regular blood tests by your doctor will be \nrequired to define the correct dose and to adjust the dose from time to time. Your doctor will usually \nreduce your Envarsus dose once your condition has stabilised.  \n \nHow should I take the Envarsus tablets \nEnvarsus is taken orally once daily, generally on an empty stomach.  \n \nTake the tablets immediately following removal from the blister. The tablets should be swallowed \nwhole with a glass of water. Do not swallow the desiccant contained in the foil wrapper. \n \nHow long should I take the Envarsus tablets \nYou will need to take Envarsus every day as long as you need immunosuppression to prevent rejection \nof your transplanted organ. You should keep in regular contact with your doctor. \n \nIf you take more Envarsus than you should \nIf you have accidentally taken too much Envarsus, contact your doctor or nearest hospital emergency \ndepartment immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take Envarsus \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. Take the tablet as soon as possible on the \nsame day.  \n \nIf you stop taking Envarsus  \nStopping your treatment with Envarsus may increase the risk of rejection of your transplanted organ. \nDo not stop your treatment unless your doctor tells you to do so. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nTacrolimus reduces your body’s defence mechanism (immune system), which will not be as good at \nfighting infections.
