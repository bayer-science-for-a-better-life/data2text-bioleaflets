NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nOnduarp 40 mg/5 mg tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 40 mg telmisartan and 5 mg amlodipine (as amlodipine besilate). \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect:  \nEach tablet contains 168.64 mg sorbitol (E420). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet \n \nBlue and white oval shaped two layer tablets engraved with the product code A1 and the company \nlogo on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension in adults: \n \nAdd on therapy \nOnduarp is indicated in adults whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on amlodipine. \n \nReplacement therapy \nAdult patients receiving telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets can instead receive tablets of \nOnduarp containing the same component doses. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of Onduarp is one tablet per day. \n \nThe maximum recommended dose is Onduarp 80 mg/10 mg, one tablet per day. Onduarp is indicated \nfor long term treatment. \n \nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended as bioavailability \nmay be increased in some patients resulting in increased blood pressure lowering effects (see section \n4.5). \n \nAdd on therapy \nOnduarp 40 mg/5 mg tablets may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \ncontrolled with amlodipine 5 mg alone. \n \nIndividual dose titration with the components (i.e. amlodipine and telmisartan) is recommended before \nchanging to the fixed dose combination. When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy \nto the fixed combination may be considered. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nPatients treated with 10 mg amlodipine who experience any dose limiting adverse reactions such as \noedema, may be switched to Onduarp 40 mg/5 mg once daily, reducing the dose of amlodipine \nwithout reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response. \n \nReplacement therapy \nPatients receiving telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets can instead receive tablets of \nOnduarp containing the same component doses in one tablet once daily, e.g. to enhance convenience \nor compliance \n \nSpecial population \n \nElderly patients \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients. Little information is available in the very elderly \npatients. \n \nPatients with renal impairment  \nNo posology adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Limited \nexperience is available in patients with severe renal impairment or haemodialysis. Caution is advised \nwhen using Onduarp in such patients as amlodipine and telmisartan are not dialysable (see also section \n4.4). \n \nConcomitant use of telmisartan with aliskiren is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment \n(GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see section 4.3). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment Onduarp should be administered with caution. \nFor telmisartan the posology should not exceed 40 mg once daily (see section 4.4). Onduarp is \ncontraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Onduarp in children aged below 18 years have not been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nOnduarp can be taken with or without food. It is recommended to take Onduarp with some liquid. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to dihydropyridine derivatives, or to any of the \n\nexcipients listed in section 6.1 \n• Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n• Biliary obstructive disorders and severe hepatic impairment \n• Shock (including cardiogenic shock) \n• Severe hypotension  \n• Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. high grade aortic stenosis)  \n• Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction \n \nThe concomitant use of telmisartan with aliskiren is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus \nor renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPregnancy \nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued \nangiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nbe changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use \nin pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should \nbe stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see section 4.3 and \n4.6). \n \nHepatic impairment \nTelmisartan is mostly eliminated in the bile. Patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic \ninsufficiency can be expected to have reduced clearance. Furthermore as with all calcium antagonists, \namlodipine half-life is prolonged in patients with impaired liver function and dose recommendations \nhave not been established. Onduarp should therefore be used with caution in these patients. \n \nRenovascular hypertension \nThere is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral \nrenal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal \nproducts that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.  \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation \nWhen Onduarp is used in patients with impaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium \nand creatinine serum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of \nOnduarp in patients with a recent kidney transplant. Telmisartan and amlodipine are not dialysable. \n \nIntravascular hypovolaemia  \nSymptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume and/or \nsodium depleted by e.g. vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such \nconditions should be corrected before the administration of telmisartan. If hypotension occurs with \nOnduarp, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous \ninfusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once blood pressure has been stabilised. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system \nThe use of telmisartan in combination with aliskiren is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see section 4.3). \n \nAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, hypotension, syncope, \nhyperkalaemia and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) have been reported in \nsusceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that affect this system. Dual \nblockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. by administering telmisartan with other \nblockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system) is therefore not recommended. Close monitoring \nof renal function is advisable if co-administration is considered necessary. \n \nOther conditions with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system \nIn patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the \nrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying \nrenal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system \nhas been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nPrimary aldosteronism \nPatients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products \nacting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of telmisartan is not \nrecommended. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \nAs with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral \nstenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nUnstable angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction \nThere are no data to support the use of Onduarp in unstable angina pectoris and during or within one \nmonth of a myocardial infarction. \n \nHeart failure \nIn a long-term, placebo controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA III and IV \nheart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine was associated with increased reports of \npulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the incidence of worsening heart failure as \ncompared to placebo (see section 5.1). \n \nDiabetic patients treated with insulin or antidiabetics \nIn these patients hypoglycaemia may occur under telmisartan treatment. Therefore, in these patients an \nappropriate blood glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or \nantidiabetics may be required when indicated. \n \nHyperkalaemia \nThe use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may cause \nhyperkalaemia. Hyperkalaemia may be fatal in the elderly, in patients with renal insufficiency, in \ndiabetic patients, in patients concomitantly treated with other medicinal products that may increase \npotassium levels, and/or in patients with intercurrent events.  \n \nBefore considering the concomitant use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-\naldosterone system, the benefit risk ratio should be evaluated. \nThe main risk factors for hyperkalaemia to be considered are: \n-  Diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, age (>70 years) \n-  Combination with one or more other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-\n\naldosterone system and/or potassium supplements. Medicinal products or therapeutic classes of \nmedicinal products that may provoke hyperkalaemia are salt substitutes containing potassium, \npotassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal \nanti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, \nimmunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim. \n\n-  Intercurrent events, in particular dehydration, acute cardiac decompensation, metabolic acidosis, \nworsening of renal function, sudden worsening of the renal condition (e.g. infectious diseases), \ncellular lysis (e.g. acute limb ischemia, rhabdomyolysis, extensive trauma). \n\n \nSerum potassium should be monitored closely in these patients (see section 4.5). \n \nSorbitol \nThis medicinal product contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \nintolerance should not take Onduarp. \n \nOther \nAs with any antihypertensive medicinal product, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with \nischaemic cardiomyopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction \nor stroke. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n  \nNo interactions between the two components of this fixed dose combinations have been observed in \nclinical studies.  \n \nInteractions common to the combination \nNo drug interaction studies have been performed. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nTo be taken into account with concomitant use  \n \nOther antihypertensive medicinal products  \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of Onduarp can be increased by concomitant use of other \nantihypertensive medicinal products. \n \nMedicinal products with blood pressure lowering potential \nBased on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal products \nmay potentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including Onduarp, e.g. baclofen, \namifostine, neuroleptics or antidepressants. Furthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated \nby alcohol. \n \nCorticosteroids (systemic route) \nReduction of the antihypertensive effect. \n \nInteractions linked to telmisartan  \n \nContraindicated (see section 4.3) \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \nThe combination of telmisartan with aliskiren is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or \nrenal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections \n4.3, 4.4). \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \n \nPotassium sparing diuretics or potassium supplements \nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists such as telmisartan, attenuate diuretic induced potassium loss. \nPotassium sparing diuretics e.g. spirinolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride, potassium \nsupplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to a significant increase in serum \npotassium. If concomitant use is indicated because of documented hypokalaemia, they should be used \nwith caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. \n \nLithium \nReversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and with \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists, including telmisartan. If use of the combination proves necessary, \ncareful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.  \n \nConcomitant use requiring caution \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products \nNSAIDs (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non-\nselective NSAIDs) may reduce the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists. \nIn some patients with compromised renal function (e.g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with \ncompromised renal function), the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and \nmedicinal products that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, \nincluding possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore, the combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy \nand periodically thereafter. \n \nRamipril \nIn one study the co-administration of telmisartan and ramipril led to an increase of up to 2.5 fold in the \nAUC0-24 and Cmax of ramipril and ramiprilat. The clinical relevance of this observation is not known. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nConcomitant use to be taken into account \n \nDigoxin \nWhen telmisartan was co-administered with digoxin, median increases in digoxin peak plasma \nconcentration (49%) and in trough concentration (20%) were observed. When initiating, adjusting, and \ndiscontinuing telmisartan, monitor digoxin levels in order to maintain levels within the therapeutic \nrange. \n \nInteractions linked to amlodipine \n \nConcomitant use requiring caution \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors \nWith concomitant use with the CYP3A4 inhibitor erythromycin in young patients and diltiazem in \nelderly patients respectively, the plasma concentration of amlodipine increased by 22 % and 50 % \nrespectively. However, the clinical relevance of this finding is uncertain. It cannot be ruled out that \nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (i.e. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) may increase the plasma \nconcentrations of amlodipine to a greater extent than diltiazem. Amlodipine should be used with \ncaution together with CYP3A4 inhibitors. However, no adverse events attributable to such interaction \nhave been reported. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers \nThere is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. The concomitant \nuse of CYP3A4 inducers (i.e. rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) may lead to a lower plasma \nconcentration of amlodipine. \n \nGrapefruit and grapefruit juice \nConcomitant administration of 240 ml of grapefruit juice with a single oral dose of 10 mg amlodipine \nin 20 healthy volunteers did not show a significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of \namlodipine. The concomitant use of amlodipine and grapefruit or grapefruit juice is still not \nrecommended in patients as the bioavailability of amlodipine may increase in some and may result in \nincreased hypotensive effects. \n \nConcomitant use to be taken into account \n \nSimvastatin \nCo-administration of multiple doses of amlodipine with simvastatin 80 mg resulted in an increase in \nexposure to simvastatin up to 77 % compared to simvastatin alone. Therefore, the dose of simvastatin \nin patients on amlodipine should be limited to 20 mg daily. \n \nOthers \nAmlodipine has been safely administered with digoxin, warfarin, atorvastatin, sildenafil, anti-acid \nmedicinal products (aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, simeticone), cimetidine, \nciclosporin, antibiotics and oral hypoglycaemic medicinal products. When amlodipine and sildenafil \nwere used in combination, each agent independently exerted its own blood pressure lowering effect. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of Onduarp in pregnant women. Animal reproductive toxicity \nstudies with Onduarp have not been performed. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nTelmisartan \n \nThe use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of \npregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during \nthe second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nStudies with telmisartan in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of medicinal products. Unless continued \nangiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should \nbe changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use \nin pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should \nbe stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy during the second and third trimesters is known \nto induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification \nretardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3). \nShould exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of \npregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for \nhypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nAmlodipine \n \nData on a limited number of exposed pregnancies do not indicate that amlodipine or other calcium \nreceptor antagonists have a harmful effect on the health of the fetus. However, there may be a risk of \nprolonged delivery. \n \nBreast-feeding \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of telmisartan and/or amlodipine during breast-\nfeeding, Onduarp is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles \nduring breast-feeding are preferable, especially while breast-feeding a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nFertility \nNo data from controlled clinical studies with the Fixed Dose Combination or with the individual \ncomponents are available. \n \nSeparate reproductive toxicity studies with the combination of telmisartan and amlodipine have not \nbeen conducted. \nIn preclinical studies, no effects of telmisartan on male and female fertility were observed. \nSimilarly, no effects on male and female fertility were reported for amlodipine (see section 5.3). \n \nReversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa which can impair fecundation have been \nobserved for calcium channel blockers in preclinical and in vitro studies. No clinical relevance has \nbeen established. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nOnduarp has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised \nthat they may experience adverse reactions such as syncope, somnolence, dizziness, or vertigo during \ntreatment (see section 4.8). Therefore, caution should be recommended when driving a car or using \nmachines. If patients experience these adverse reactions, they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks \nsuch as driving or using machines. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reactions include dizziness and peripheral oedema.

Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with \nfatal outcome have been reported. \n \nTreatment \nThe patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. \nManagement depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. Suggested \nmeasures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the \ntreatment of overdose of both telmisartan and amlodipine.  \nSerum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient \nshould be placed in a supine position with elevation of extremities, with salt and volume replacement \ngiven quickly. Supportive treatment should be instituted. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be \nbeneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. Telmisartan and Amlodipine are not \nremoved by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin II antagonists \nand calcium channel blockers; ATC Code: C09DB04. \n \nOnduarp combines two antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control \nblood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, \ntelmisartan, and a dihydropyridinic calcium channel blocker, amlodipine. \nThe combination of these substances has an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure \nto a greater degree than either component alone. \nOnduarp once daily produces effective and consistent reductions in blood pressure across the 24-hour \ntherapeutic dose range.   \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nTelmisartan \nTelmisartan is an orally active and specific angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. Telmisartan \ndisplaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor subtype, \nwhich is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Telmisartan does not exhibit any partial \nagonist activity at the AT1 receptor. Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor. The binding is \nlong-lasting. Telmisartan does not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and other less \ncharacterised AT receptors. The functional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the effect of \ntheir possible overstimulation by angiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan. Plasma \naldosterone levels are decreased by telmisartan. Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma renin or \nblock ion channels. Telmisartan does not inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), the \nenzyme which also degrades bradykinin. Therefore it is not expected to potentiate bradykinin-\nmediated adverse reactions. \n \nIn humans, an 80 mg dose of telmisartan almost completely inhibits the angiotensin II evoked blood \npressure increase. The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and still measurable up to \n48 hours. \n \nAfter the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within \n3 hours. The maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4 to 8 weeks after the start of \ntreatment and is sustained during long-term therapy. \n \nThe antihypertensive effect persists constantly over 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours \nbefore the next dose as shown by ambulatory blood pressure measurements. This is confirmed by \ntrough to peak ratios consistently above 80 % seen after doses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in \nplacebo controlled clinical studies. There is an apparent trend to a dose relationship to a time to \nrecovery of baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP). In this respect data concerning diastolic blood \npressure (DBP) are inconsistent.  \n \nIn patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without \naffecting pulse rate. The contribution of the medicinal product's diuretic and natriuretic effect to its \nhypotensive activity has still to be defined. The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable \nto that of substances representative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products \n(demonstrated in clinical trials comparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, \nhydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril). \n \nUpon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment \nvalues over a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension.  \n \nThe incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those \ngiven angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two \nantihypertensive treatments. \n \nAmlodipine \nAmlodipine is a calcium ion influx inhibitor of the dihydropyridine group (slow channel blocker or \ncalcium ion antagonist) and inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac and \nvascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a \ndirect relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, leading to reductions in peripheral vascular \nresistance and in blood pressure. Experimental data indicate that amlodipine binds to both \ndihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine binding sites. Amlodipine is relatively vessel-selective, with \na greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. \n \nIn patients with hypertension, once daily dosing provides clinically significant reductions of blood \npressure in both the supine and standing positions throughout the 24 hour interval. Due to the slow \nonset of action, acute hypotension is not a feature of amlodipine administration. \nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \nplasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n \nAmlodipine has not been associated with any adverse metabolic effects or changes in plasma lipids \nand is suitable for use in patients with asthma, diabetes, and gout. \n \nUse in patients with heart failure \nHaemodynamic studies and exercise based controlled clinical trials in NYHA Class II-IV heart failure \npatients have shown that amlodipine did not lead to clinical deterioration as measured by exercise \ntolerance, left ventricular ejection fraction and clinical symptomatology. \n \nA placebo controlled study (PRAISE) designed to evaluate patients in NYHA Class III-IV heart \nfailure receiving digoxin, diuretics and ACE inhibitors has shown that amlodipine did not lead to an \nincrease in risk of mortality or combined mortality and morbidity with heart failure. \n \nIn a follow-up, long term, placebo controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with \nNYHA III and IV heart failure without clinical symptoms or objective findings suggestive of \nunderlying ischaemic disease, on stable doses of ACE inhibitors, digitalis, and diuretics, amlodipine \nhad no effect on total cardiovascular mortality. In this same population amlodipine was associated \nwith increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the incidence of \nworsening heart failure as compared to placebo. \n \nTelmisartan/Amlodipine \nIn an 8-week multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group factorial study \nin 1461 patients with mild to severe hypertension (mean seated diastolic blood pressure ≥95 and \n≤119 mmHg), treatment with each combination dose of Onduarp resulted in significantly greater \ndiastolic and systolic blood pressure reductions and higher control rates compared to the respective \nmonotherapy components. \n \nOnduarp showed dose-related reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure across the therapeutic \ndose range of −21.8/−16.5 mmHg (40 mg/5 mg), −22.1/−18.2 mmHg (80 mg/5 mg), \n−24.7/−20.2 mmHg (40 mg/10 mg) and −26.4/−20.1 mmHg (80 mg/10 mg). The reduction in diastolic \nblood pressure <90 mmHg was achieved in 71.6 %, 74.8 %, 82.1 %, 85.3 % of patients respectively. \nValues are adjusted for baseline and country. \n \nThe majority of the antihypertensive effect was attained within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy. \nIn a subset of 1050 patients with moderate to severe hypertension (DBP ≥100 mmHg) 32.7 - 51.8 % \nresponded sufficiently to monotherapy of either telmisartan or amlodipine. The observed mean \nchanges in systolic/diastolic blood pressure with a combination therapy containing amlodipine 5 mg \n(−22.2/−17.2 mmHg with 40 mg/5 mg; −22.5/−19.1 mmHg with 80 mg/5 mg) were comparable to or \ngreater than those seen with amlodipine 10 mg (−21.0/−17.6 mmHg) and associated with significant \nlower oedema rates (1.4 % with 40 mg/5 mg; 0.5 % with 80 mg/5 mg; 17.6 % with amlodipine \n10 mg). \n \nAutomated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) performed in a subset of 562 patients \nconfirmed the results seen with in-clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions consistently \nover the entire 24-hours dosing period. \n \nIn a further multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group study, a total of \n1097 patients with mild to severe hypertension who were not adequately controlled on amlodipine \n5 mg received Onduarp (40 mg/5 mg or 80 mg/5 mg) or amlodipine alone (5 mg or 10 mg). After 8 \nweeks of treatment, each of the combinations was statistically significantly superior to both \namlodipine monotherapy doses in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressures (−13.6/−9.4 mmHg, \n−15.0/−10.6 mmHg with 40 mg/5 mg, 80 mg/5 mg versus −6.2/−5.7 mmHg, −11.1/−8.0 mmHg with \namlodipine 5 mg and 10 mg and higher diastolic blood pressure control rates compared to the \nrespective monotherapies were achieved (56.7 %, 63.8 % with 40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg versus \n42 %, 56.7 % with amlodipine 5 mg and 10 mg). Oedema rates were significantly lower with \n40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg compared to amlodipine 10 mg (4.4 % versus 24.9 %, respectively). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\n \nIn another multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group study, a total of \n947 patients with mild to severe hypertension who were not adequately controlled on amlodipine \n10 mg received Onduarp (40 mg/10 mg or 80 mg/10 mg) or amlodipine alone (10 mg). After 8 weeks \nof treatment, each of the combination treatments was statistically significantly superior to amlodipine \nmonotherapy in reducing diastolic and systolic blood pressure (−11.1/−9.2 mmHg, −11.3/ −9.3 mmHg \nwith 40 mg/10 mg, 80 mg/10 mg versus −7.4/−6.5 mmHg with amlodipine 10 mg) and higher diastolic \nblood pressure normalisation rates compared to monotherapy were achieved (63.7 %, 66.5 % with \n40 mg/10 mg, 80 mg/10 mg versus 51.1 % with amlodipine 10 mg). \n \nIn two corresponding open-label long-term follow up studies performed over a further 6 months the \neffect of Onduarp was maintained over the trial period. Furthermore it was shown that some patients \nnot adequately controlled with Onduarp 40 mg/10 mg had additional blood pressure reduction by up-\ntitration to Onduarp 80 mg/10 mg. \n \nThe overall incidence of adverse reactions with Onduarp in the clinical trial programme was low with \nonly 12.7 % of patients on treatment experiencing adverse reactions. The most common adverse \nreactions were peripheral oedema and dizziness, see also section 4.8. The adverse reactions reported \nwere in agreement with those anticipated from the safety profiles of the components telmisartan and \namlodipine. No new or more severe adverse reactions were observed. The oedema related events \n(peripheral oedema, generalised oedema, and oedema) were consistently lower in patients who \nreceived Onduarp as compared to patients who received amlodipine 10 mg. In the factorial design trial \nthe oedema rates were 1.3 % with Onduarp 40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg, 8.8 % with Onduarp \n40 mg/10 mg and 80 mg/10 mg and 18.4 % with Amlodipine 10 mg. In patients not controlled on \namlodipine 5 mg the oedema rates were 4.4 % for 40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg and 24.9 % for \namlodipine 10 mg. \n \nThe antihypertensive effect of Onduarp was similar irrespective of age and gender, and was similar in \npatients with and without diabetes. \n \nOnduarp has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension. Telmisartan has been \nstudied in a large outcome study in 25,620 patients with high cardiovascular risk (ONTARGET). \nAmlodipine has been studied in patients with chronic stable angina, vasospastic angina and \nangiographically documented coronary artery disease. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nOnduarp in all subsets of the paediatric population in hypertension (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPharmacokinetic of the fixed dose combination (FDC) \nThe rate and extent of absorption of Onduarp are equivalent to the bioavailability of telmisartan and \namlodipine when administered as individual tablets. \n \nAbsorption \nAbsorption of telmisartan is rapid although the amount absorbed varies. The mean absolute \nbioavailability for telmisartan is about 50 %. When telmisartan is taken with food, the reduction in the \narea under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) of telmisartan varies from approximately \n6 % (40 mg dose) to approximately 19 % (160 mg dose). By 3 hours after administration, plasma \nconcentrations are similar whether telmisartan is taken fasting or with food.  \n \nAfter oral administration of therapeutic doses, amlodipine is well absorbed with peak blood levels \nbetween 6-12 hours post dose. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64 and 80%. \nAmlodipine bioavailability is not affected by food ingestion. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\nDistribution \nTelmisartan is largely bound to plasma protein (>99.5 %), mainly albumin and alpha-1 acid \nglycoprotein. The mean steady state apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) is approximately 500 l. \n \nThe volume of distribution of amlodipine is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies have shown that \napproximately 97.5 % of circulating amlodipine is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients. \n \nBiotransformation \nTelmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide of the parent compound. No \npharmacological activity has been shown for the conjugate.  \n \nAmlodipine is extensively (approximatively 90 %) metabolised by the liver to inactive metabolites. \n \nElimination \nTelmisartan is characterised by biexponential decay pharmacokinetics with a terminal elimination \nhalf-life of >20 hours. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and, to a smaller extent, the area \nunder the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), increase disproportionately with dose. There is no \nevidence of clinically relevant accumulation of telmisartan taken at the recommended dose. Plasma \nconcentrations were higher in females than in males, without relevant influence on efficacy. \n \nAfter oral (and intravenous) administration, telmisartan is nearly exclusively excreted with the faeces, \nmainly as unchanged compound. Cumulative urinary excretion is <1 % of dose. Total plasma \nclearance (Cltot) is high (approximately 1,000 ml/min) compared with hepatic blood flow (about \n1,500 ml/min). \n \nAmlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of \napproximately 30 to 50 hours consistent with once daily dosing. Steady-state plasma levels are \nreached after continuous administration for 7-8 days. Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60 % of \namlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine.  \n \nLinearity/non-linearity  \nThe small reduction in AUC for telmisartan is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic \nefficacy. There is no linear relationship between doses and plasma levels. Cmax and to a lesser extent \nAUC increase disproportionately at doses above 40 mg. \n \nAmlodipine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population (age below 18 years) \nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population. \n \nGender \nDifferences in plasma concentrations of telmisartan were observed, with Cmax and AUC being \napproximately 3- and 2-fold higher, respectively, in females compared to males. \n \nElderly \nThe pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ in young and elderly patients. \nThe time to reach peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine is similar in elderly and younger subjects. \nIn elderly patients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline with resulting increases in AUC and \nelimination half-life. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with mild to moderate and severe renal impairment, doubling of plasma concentrations of \ntelmisartan was observed. However, lower plasma concentrations were observed in patients with renal \ninsufficiency undergoing dialysis. Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma protein in renal-insufficient \nsubjects and cannot be removed by dialysis.

The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal \nimpairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nPharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute \nbioavailability of telmisartan up to nearly 100 %. The elimination half-life of telmisartan is not \nchanged in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased \nclearance of amlodipine with resulting increase of approximately 40-60 % in AUC. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSince the non-clinical toxicity profiles of telmisartan and amlodipine are not overlapping, no \nexacerbation of toxicity was expected for the combination. This has been confirmed in a subchronic \n(13-week) toxicology study in rats, in which dose levels of 3.2/0.8, 10/2.5 and 40/10 mg/kg of \ntelmisartan and amlodipine were tested. \n \nPreclinical data available for the components of this fixed dose combination are reported below. \n \nTelmisartan \nIn preclinical safety studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic \nrange caused reduced red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes in renal \nhaemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), as well as increased serum potassium \nin normotensive animals. In dogs, renal tubular dilation and atrophy were observed. Gastric mucosal \ninjury (erosion, ulcers or inflammation) also was noted in rats and dogs. These pharmacologically-\nmediated undesirable effects, known from preclinical studies with both angiotensin converting enzyme \ninhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, were prevented by oral saline supplementation. In \nboth species, increased plasma renin activity and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the renal juxtaglomerular \ncells were observed. These changes, also a class effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors \nand other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, do not appear to have clinical significance. \nNo clear evidence of a teratogenic effect was observed, however at toxic dose levels of telmisartan an \neffect on the postnatal development of the offspring such as lower body weight and delayed eye \nopening was observed. \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no \nevidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice. \n \nAmlodipine \nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. \nIn reproductive toxicity studies in rats, delayed parturition, difficult labour and impaired fetal and pup \nsurvival were seen at high doses. There was no effect on the fertility of rats treated orally with \namlodipine maleate (males for 64 days and females for 14 days prior to mating) at doses of up to \n10 mg amlodipine/kg/day (about 10 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose of 10 mg/day on \nan mg/m2 basis).  \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension in adults: \n \nAdd on therapy \nOnduarp is indicated in adults whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on amlodipine. \n \nReplacement therapy \nAdult patients receiving telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets can instead receive tablets of \nOnduarp containing the same component doses. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of Onduarp is one tablet per day. \n \nThe maximum recommended dose is Onduarp 80 mg/10 mg, one tablet per day. Onduarp is indicated \nfor long term treatment. \n \nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended as bioavailability \nmay be increased in some patients resulting in increased blood pressure lowering effects (see section \n4.5). \n \nAdd on therapy \nOnduarp 40 mg/10 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \ncontrolled with amlodipine 10 mg. \n \nIndividual dose titration with the components (i.e. amlodipine and telmisartan) is recommended before \nchanging to the fixed dose combination. When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy \nto the fixed combination may be considered. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\nPatients treated with 10 mg amlodipine who experience any dose limiting adverse reactions such as \noedema, may be switched to Onduarp 40 mg/5 mg once daily, reducing the dose of amlodipine \nwithout reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response. \n \nReplacement therapy \nPatients receiving telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets can instead receive tablets of \nOnduarp containing the same component doses in one tablet once daily, e.g. to enhance convenience \nor compliance \n \nSpecial population \n \nElderly patients \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients. Little information is available in the very elderly \npatients. \n \nPatients with renal impairment  \nNo posology adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Limited \nexperience is available in patients with severe renal impairment or haemodialysis. Caution is advised \nwhen using Onduarp in such patients as amlodipine and telmisartan are not dialysable (see also section \n4.4). \n \nConcomitant use of telmisartan with aliskiren is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment \n(GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see section 4.3). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment Onduarp should be administered with caution. \nFor telmisartan the posology should not exceed 40 mg once daily (see section 4.4). Onduarp is \ncontraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Onduarp in children aged below 18 years have not been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nOnduarp can be taken with or without food. It is recommended to take Onduarp with some liquid. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to dihydropyridine derivatives, or to any of the \n\nexcipients listed in section 6.1 \n• Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n• Biliary obstructive disorders and severe hepatic impairment \n• Shock (including cardiogenic shock) \n• Severe hypotension  \n• Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. high grade aortic stenosis)  \n• Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction \n \nThe concomitant use of telmisartan with aliskiren is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus \nor renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPregnancy \nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued \nangiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\nbe changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use \nin pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should \nbe stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see section 4.3 and \n4.6). \n \nHepatic impairment \nTelmisartan is mostly eliminated in the bile. Patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic \ninsufficiency can be expected to have reduced clearance. Furthermore as with all calcium antagonists, \namlodipine half-life is prolonged in patients with impaired liver function and dose recommendations \nhave not been established. Onduarp should therefore be used with caution in these patients. \n \nRenovascular hypertension \nThere is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral \nrenal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal \nproducts that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.  \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation \nWhen Onduarp is used in patients with impaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium \nand creatinine serum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of \nOnduarp in patients with a recent kidney transplant. Telmisartan and amlodipine are not dialysable. \n \nIntravascular hypovolaemia  \nSymptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume and/or \nsodium depleted by e.g. vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such \nconditions should be corrected before the administration of telmisartan. If hypotension occurs with \nOnduarp, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous \ninfusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once blood pressure has been stabilised. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system \nThe use of telmisartan in combination with aliskiren is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see section 4.3). \n \nAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, hypotension, syncope, \nhyperkalaemia and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) have been reported in \nsusceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that affect this system. Dual \nblockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. by administering telmisartan with other \nblockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system) is therefore not recommended. Close monitoring \nof renal function is advisable if co-administration is considered necessary. \n \nOther conditions with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system \nIn patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the \nrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying \nrenal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system \nhas been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nPrimary aldosteronism \nPatients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products \nacting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of telmisartan is not \nrecommended. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \nAs with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral \nstenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nUnstable angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction \nThere are no data to support the use of Onduarp in unstable angina pectoris and during or within one \nmonth of a myocardial infarction. \n \nHeart failure \nIn a long-term, placebo controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA III and IV \nheart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine was associated with increased reports of \npulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the incidence of worsening heart failure as \ncompared to placebo (see section 5.1). \n \nDiabetic patients treated with insulin or antidiabetics \nIn these patients hypoglycaemia may occur under telmisartan treatment. Therefore, in these patients an \nappropriate blood glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or \nantidiabetics may be required when indicated. \n \nHyperkalaemia \nThe use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may cause \nhyperkalaemia. Hyperkalaemia may be fatal in the elderly, in patients with renal insufficiency, in \ndiabetic patients, in patients concomitantly treated with other medicinal products that may increase \npotassium levels, and/or in patients with intercurrent events.  \n \nBefore considering the concomitant use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-\naldosterone system, the benefit risk ratio should be evaluated. \nThe main risk factors for hyperkalaemia to be considered are: \n-  Diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, age (>70 years) \n-  Combination with one or more other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-\n\naldosterone system and/or potassium supplements. Medicinal products or therapeutic classes of \nmedicinal products that may provoke hyperkalaemia are salt substitutes containing potassium, \npotassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal \nanti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, \nimmunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim. \n\n-  Intercurrent events, in particular dehydration, acute cardiac decompensation, metabolic acidosis, \nworsening of renal function, sudden worsening of the renal condition (e.g. infectious diseases), \ncellular lysis (e.g. acute limb ischemia, rhabdomyolysis, extensive trauma). \n\n \nSerum potassium should be monitored closely in these patients (see section 4.5). \n \nSorbitol \nThis medicinal product contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \nintolerance should not take Onduarp. \n \nOther \nAs with any antihypertensive medicinal product, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with \nischaemic cardiomyopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction \nor stroke. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n  \nNo interactions between the two components of this fixed dose combinations have been observed in \nclinical studies.  \n \nInteractions common to the combination \nNo drug interaction studies have been performed. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\nTo be taken into account with concomitant use  \n \nOther antihypertensive medicinal products  \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of Onduarp can be increased by concomitant use of other \nantihypertensive medicinal products. \n \nMedicinal products with blood pressure lowering potential \nBased on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal products \nmay potentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including Onduarp, e.g. baclofen, \namifostine, neuroleptics or antidepressants. Furthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated \nby alcohol. \n \nCorticosteroids (systemic route) \nReduction of the antihypertensive effect. \n \nInteractions linked to telmisartan  \n \nContraindicated (see section 4.3) \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \nThe combination of telmisartan with aliskiren is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or \nrenal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections \n4.3, 4.4). \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \n \nPotassium sparing diuretics or potassium supplements \nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists such as telmisartan, attenuate diuretic induced potassium loss. \nPotassium sparing diuretics e.g. spirinolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride, potassium \nsupplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to a significant increase in serum \npotassium. If concomitant use is indicated because of documented hypokalaemia, they should be used \nwith caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. \n \nLithium \nReversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and with \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists, including telmisartan. If use of the combination proves necessary, \ncareful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.  \n \nConcomitant use requiring caution \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products \nNSAIDs (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non-\nselective NSAIDs) may reduce the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists. \nIn some patients with compromised renal function (e.g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with \ncompromised renal function), the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and \nmedicinal products that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, \nincluding possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore, the combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy \nand periodically thereafter. \n \nRamipril \nIn one study the co-administration of telmisartan and ramipril led to an increase of up to 2.5 fold in the \nAUC0-24 and Cmax of ramipril and ramiprilat. The clinical relevance of this observation is not known. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\nConcomitant use to be taken into account \n \nDigoxin \nWhen telmisartan was co-administered with digoxin, median increases in digoxin peak plasma \nconcentration (49%) and in trough concentration (20%) were observed. When initiating, adjusting, and \ndiscontinuing telmisartan, monitor digoxin levels in order to maintain levels within the therapeutic \nrange. \n \nInteractions linked to amlodipine \n \nConcomitant use requiring caution \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors \nWith concomitant use with the CYP3A4 inhibitor erythromycin in young patients and diltiazem in \nelderly patients respectively, the plasma concentration of amlodipine increased by 22 % and 50 % \nrespectively. However, the clinical relevance of this finding is uncertain. It cannot be ruled out that \nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (i.e. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) may increase the plasma \nconcentrations of amlodipine to a greater extent than diltiazem. Amlodipine should be used with \ncaution together with CYP3A4 inhibitors. However, no adverse events attributable to such interaction \nhave been reported. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers \nThere is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. The concomitant \nuse of CYP3A4 inducers (i.e. rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) may lead to a lower plasma \nconcentration of amlodipine. \n \nGrapefruit and grapefruit juice \nConcomitant administration of 240 ml of grapefruit juice with a single oral dose of 10 mg amlodipine \nin 20 healthy volunteers did not show a significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of \namlodipine. The concomitant use of amlodipine and grapefruit or grapefruit juice is still not \nrecommended in patients as the bioavailability of amlodipine may increase in some and may result in \nincreased hypotensive effects. \n \nConcomitant use to be taken into account \n \nSimvastatin \nCo-administration of multiple doses of amlodipine with simvastatin 80 mg resulted in an increase in \nexposure to simvastatin up to 77 % compared to simvastatin alone. Therefore, the dose of simvastatin \nin patients on amlodipine should be limited to 20 mg daily. \n \nOthers \nAmlodipine has been safely administered with digoxin, warfarin, atorvastatin, sildenafil, anti-acid \nmedicinal products (aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, simeticone), cimetidine, \nciclosporin, antibiotics and oral hypoglycaemic medicinal products. When amlodipine and sildenafil \nwere used in combination, each agent independently exerted its own blood pressure lowering effect. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of Onduarp in pregnant women. Animal reproductive toxicity \nstudies with Onduarp have not been performed. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\nTelmisartan \n \nThe use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of \npregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during \nthe second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nStudies with telmisartan in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of medicinal products. Unless continued \nangiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should \nbe changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use \nin pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should \nbe stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy during the second and third trimesters is known \nto induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification \nretardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3). \nShould exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of \npregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for \nhypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nAmlodipine \n \nData on a limited number of exposed pregnancies do not indicate that amlodipine or other calcium \nreceptor antagonists have a harmful effect on the health of the fetus. However, there may be a risk of \nprolonged delivery. \n \nBreast-feeding \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of telmisartan and/or amlodipine during breast-\nfeeding, Onduarp is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles \nduring breast-feeding are preferable, especially while breast-feeding a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nFertility \nNo data from controlled clinical studies with the Fixed Dose Combination or with the individual \ncomponents are available. \n \nSeparate reproductive toxicity studies with the combination of telmisartan and amlodipine have not \nbeen conducted. \nIn preclinical studies, no effects of telmisartan on male and female fertility were observed. \nSimilarly, no effects on male and female fertility were reported for amlodipine (see section 5.3). \n \nReversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa which can impair fecundation have been \nobserved for calcium channel blockers in preclinical and in vitro studies. No clinical relevance has \nbeen established. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nOnduarp has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised \nthat they may experience adverse reactions such as syncope, somnolence, dizziness, or vertigo during \ntreatment (see section 4.8).

Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with \nfatal outcome have been reported. \n \nTreatment \nThe patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. \nManagement depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. Suggested \nmeasures include induction of emesis and / or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the \ntreatment of overdose of both telmisartan and amlodipine.  \nSerum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient \nshould be placed in a supine position with elevation of extremities, with salt and volume replacement \ngiven quickly. Supportive treatment should be instituted. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be \nbeneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. Telmisartan and Amlodipine are not \nremoved by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin II antagonists \nand calcium channel blockers; ATC Code: C09DB04. \n \nOnduarp combines two antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control \nblood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, \ntelmisartan, and a dihydropyridinic calcium channel blocker, amlodipine. \nThe combination of these substances has an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure \nto a greater degree than either component alone. \nOnduarp once daily produces effective and consistent reductions in blood pressure across the 24-hour \ntherapeutic dose range.   \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\nTelmisartan \nTelmisartan is an orally active and specific angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. Telmisartan \ndisplaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor subtype, \nwhich is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Telmisartan does not exhibit any partial \nagonist activity at the AT1 receptor. Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor. The binding is \nlong-lasting. Telmisartan does not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and other less \ncharacterised AT receptors. The functional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the effect of \ntheir possible overstimulation by angiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan. Plasma \naldosterone levels are decreased by telmisartan. Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma renin or \nblock ion channels. Telmisartan does not inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), the \nenzyme which also degrades bradykinin. Therefore it is not expected to potentiate bradykinin-\nmediated adverse reactions. \n \nIn humans, an 80 mg dose of telmisartan almost completely inhibits the angiotensin II evoked blood \npressure increase. The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and still measurable up to \n48 hours. \n \nAfter the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within \n3 hours. The maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4 to 8 weeks after the start of \ntreatment and is sustained during long-term therapy. \n \nThe antihypertensive effect persists constantly over 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours \nbefore the next dose as shown by ambulatory blood pressure measurements. This is confirmed by \ntrough to peak ratios consistently above 80 % seen after doses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in \nplacebo controlled clinical studies. There is an apparent trend to a dose relationship to a time to \nrecovery of baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP). In this respect data concerning diastolic blood \npressure (DBP) are inconsistent.  \n \nIn patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without \naffecting pulse rate. The contribution of the medicinal product's diuretic and natriuretic effect to its \nhypotensive activity has still to be defined. The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable \nto that of substances representative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products \n(demonstrated in clinical trials comparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, \nhydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril). \n \nUpon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment \nvalues over a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension.  \n \nThe incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those \ngiven angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two \nantihypertensive treatments. \n \nAmlodipine \nAmlodipine is a calcium ion influx inhibitor of the dihydropyridine group (slow channel blocker or \ncalcium ion antagonist) and inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac and \nvascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a \ndirect relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, leading to reductions in peripheral vascular \nresistance and in blood pressure. Experimental data indicate that amlodipine binds to both \ndihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine binding sites. Amlodipine is relatively vessel-selective, with \na greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. \n \nIn patients with hypertension, once daily dosing provides clinically significant reductions of blood \npressure in both the supine and standing positions throughout the 24 hour interval. Due to the slow \nonset of action, acute hypotension is not a feature of amlodipine administration. \nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \nplasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n \nAmlodipine has not been associated with any adverse metabolic effects or changes in plasma lipids \nand is suitable for use in patients with asthma, diabetes, and gout. \n \nUse in patients with heart failure \nHaemodynamic studies and exercise based controlled clinical trials in NYHA Class II-IV heart failure \npatients have shown that amlodipine did not lead to clinical deterioration as measured by exercise \ntolerance, left ventricular ejection fraction and clinical symptomatology. \n \nA placebo controlled study (PRAISE) designed to evaluate patients in NYHA Class III-IV heart \nfailure receiving digoxin, diuretics and ACE inhibitors has shown that amlodipine did not lead to an \nincrease in risk of mortality or combined mortality and morbidity with heart failure. \n \nIn a follow-up, long term, placebo controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with \nNYHA III and IV heart failure without clinical symptoms or objective findings suggestive of \nunderlying ischaemic disease, on stable doses of ACE inhibitors, digitalis, and diuretics, amlodipine \nhad no effect on total cardiovascular mortality. In this same population amlodipine was associated \nwith increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the incidence of \nworsening heart failure as compared to placebo. \n \nTelmisartan/Amlodipine \nIn an 8-week multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group factorial study \nin 1461 patients with mild to severe hypertension (mean seated diastolic blood pressure ≥95 and \n≤119 mmHg), treatment with each combination dose of Onduarp resulted in significantly greater \ndiastolic and systolic blood pressure reductions and higher control rates compared to the respective \nmonotherapy components. \n \nOnduarp showed dose-related reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure across the therapeutic \ndose range of −21.8/−16.5 mmHg (40 mg/5 mg), −22.1/−18.2 mmHg (80 mg/5 mg), \n−24.7/−20.2 mmHg (40 mg/10 mg) and −26.4/−20.1 mmHg (80 mg/10 mg). The reduction in diastolic \nblood pressure <90 mmHg was achieved in 71.6 %, 74.8 %, 82.1 %, 85.3 % of patients respectively. \nValues are adjusted for baseline and country. \n \nThe majority of the antihypertensive effect was attained within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy. \nIn a subset of 1050 patients with moderate to severe hypertension (DBP ≥100 mmHg) 32.7 - 51.8 % \nresponded sufficiently to monotherapy of either telmisartan or amlodipine. The observed mean \nchanges in systolic/diastolic blood pressure with a combination therapy containing amlodipine 5 mg \n(−22.2/−17.2 mmHg with 40 mg/5 mg; −22.5/−19.1 mmHg with 80 mg/5 mg) were comparable to or \ngreater than those seen with amlodipine 10 mg (−21.0/−17.6 mmHg) and associated with significant \nlower oedema rates (1.4 % with 40 mg/5 mg; 0.5% with 80 mg/5 mg; 17.6 % with amlodipine 10 mg). \n \nAutomated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) performed in a subset of 562 patients \nconfirmed the results seen with in-clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions consistently \nover the entire 24-hours dosing period. \n \nIn a further multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group study, a total of \n1097 patients with mild to severe hypertension who were not adequately controlled on amlodipine \n5 mg received Onduarp (40 mg/5 mg or 80 mg/5 mg) or amlodipine alone (5 mg or 10 mg). After \n8 weeks of treatment, each of the combinations was statistically significantly superior to both \namlodipine monotherapy doses in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressures (−13.6/−9.4 mmHg, \n−15.0/−10.6 mmHg with 40 mg/5 mg, 80 mg/5 mg versus −6.2/−5.7 mmHg, −11.1/−8.0 mmHg with \namlodipine 5 mg and 10 mg and higher diastolic blood pressure control rates compared to the \nrespective monotherapies were achieved (56.7 %, 63.8 % with 40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg versus \n42 %, 56.7 % with amlodipine 5 mg and 10 mg). Oedema rates were significantly lower with \n40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg compared to amlodipine 10 mg (4.4 % versus 24.9 %, respectively). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\nIn another multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group study, a total of \n947 patients with mild to severe hypertension who were not adequately controlled on amlodipine \n10 mg received Onduarp (40 mg/10 mg or 80 mg/10 mg) or amlodipine alone (10 mg). After 8 weeks \nof treatment, each of the combination treatments was statistically significantly superior to amlodipine \nmonotherapy in reducing diastolic and systolic blood pressure (−11.1/−9.2 mmHg, −11.3/ −9.3 mmHg \nwith 40 mg/10 mg, 80 mg/10 mg versus −7.4/−6.5 mmHg with amlodipine 10 mg) and higher diastolic \nblood pressure normalisation rates compared to monotherapy were achieved (63.7 %, 66.5 % with \n40 mg/10 mg, 80 mg/10 mg versus 51.1 % with amlodipine 10 mg). \n \nIn two corresponding open-label long-term follow up studies performed over a further 6 months the \neffect of Onduarp was maintained over the trial period. Furthermore it was shown that some patients \nnot adequately controlled with Onduarp 40 mg/10 mg had additional blood pressure reduction by up-\ntitration to Onduarp 80 mg/10 mg. \n \nThe overall incidence of adverse reactions with Onduarp in the clinical trial programme was low with \nonly 12.7 % of patients on treatment experiencing adverse reactions. The most common adverse \nreactions were peripheral oedema and dizziness, see also section 4.8. The adverse reactions reported \nwere in agreement with those anticipated from the safety profiles of the components telmisartan and \namlodipine. No new or more severe adverse reactions were observed. The oedema related events \n(peripheral oedema, generalised oedema, and oedema) were consistently lower in patients who \nreceived Onduarp as compared to patients who received amlodipine 10 mg. In the factorial design trial \nthe oedema rates were 1.3 % with Onduarp 40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg, 8.8 % with Onduarp \n40 mg/10 mg and 80 mg/10 mg and 18.4 % with Amlodipine 10 mg. In patients not controlled on \namlodipine 5 mg the oedema rates were 4.4 % for 40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg and 24.9 % for \namlodipine 10 mg. \n \nThe antihypertensive effect of Onduarp was similar irrespective of age and gender, and was similar in \npatients with and without diabetes. \n \nOnduarp has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension. Telmisartan has been \nstudied in a large outcome study in 25,620 patients with high cardiovascular risk (ONTARGET). \nAmlodipine has been studied in patients with chronic stable angina, vasospastic angina and \nangiographically documented coronary artery disease. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nOnduarp in all subsets of the paediatric population in hypertension (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPharmacokinetic of the fixed dose combination (FDC) \nThe rate and extent of absorption of Onduarp are equivalent to the bioavailability of telmisartan and \namlodipine when administered as individual tablets. \n \nAbsorption \nAbsorption of telmisartan is rapid although the amount absorbed varies. The mean absolute \nbioavailability for telmisartan is about 50 %. When telmisartan is taken with food, the reduction in the \narea under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) of telmisartan varies from approximately \n6 % (40 mg dose) to approximately 19 % (160 mg dose). By 3 hours after administration, plasma \nconcentrations are similar whether telmisartan is taken fasting or with food.  \n \nAfter oral administration of therapeutic doses, amlodipine is well absorbed with peak blood levels \nbetween 6-12 hours post dose. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64 and 80 %. \nAmlodipine bioavailability is not affected by food ingestion. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\nDistribution \nTelmisartan is largely bound to plasma protein (>99.5 %), mainly albumin and alpha-1 acid \nglycoprotein. The mean steady state apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) is approximately 500 l. \n \nThe volume of distribution of amlodipine is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies have shown that \napproximately 97.5 % of circulating amlodipine is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients. \n \nBiotransformation \nTelmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide of the parent compound. No \npharmacological activity has been shown for the conjugate.  \n \nAmlodipine is extensively (approximatively 90 %) metabolised by the liver to inactive metabolites. \n \nElimination \nTelmisartan is characterised by biexponential decay pharmacokinetics with a terminal elimination \nhalf-life of >20 hours. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and, to a smaller extent, the area \nunder the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), increase disproportionately with dose. There is no \nevidence of clinically relevant accumulation of telmisartan taken at the recommended dose. Plasma \nconcentrations were higher in females than in males, without relevant influence on efficacy. \n \nAfter oral (and intravenous) administration, telmisartan is nearly exclusively excreted with the faeces, \nmainly as unchanged compound. Cumulative urinary excretion is <1 % of dose. Total plasma \nclearance (Cltot) is high (approximately 1,000 ml/min) compared with hepatic blood flow (about \n1,500 ml/min). \n \nAmlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of \napproximately 30 to 50 hours consistent with once daily dosing. Steady-state plasma levels are \nreached after continuous administration for 7-8 days. Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60 % of \namlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine.  \n \nLinearity/non-linearity  \nThe small reduction in AUC for telmisartan is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic \nefficacy. There is no linear relationship between doses and plasma levels. Cmax and to a lesser extent \nAUC increase disproportionately at doses above 40 mg. \n \nAmlodipine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population (age below 18 years) \nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population. \n \nGender \nDifferences in plasma concentrations of telmisartan were observed, with Cmax and AUC being \napproximately 3- and 2-fold higher, respectively, in females compared to males. \n \nElderly \nThe pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ in young and elderly patients. \nThe time to reach peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine is similar in elderly and younger subjects. \nIn elderly patients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline with resulting increases in AUC and \nelimination half-life. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with mild to moderate and severe renal impairment, doubling of plasma concentrations of \ntelmisartan was observed. However, lower plasma concentrations were observed in patients with renal \ninsufficiency undergoing dialysis. Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma protein in renal-insufficient \nsubjects and cannot be removed by dialysis. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\nrenal impairment. The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal \nimpairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nPharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute \nbioavailability of telmisartan up to nearly 100 %. The elimination half-life of telmisartan is not \nchanged in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased \nclearance of amlodipine with resulting increase of approximately 40–60 % in AUC. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSince the non-clinical toxicity profiles of telmisartan and amlodipine are not overlapping, no \nexacerbation of toxicity was expected for the combination. This has been confirmed in a subchronic \n(13-week) toxicology study in rats, in which dose levels of 3.2/0.8, 10/2.5 and 40/10 mg/kg of \ntelmisartan and amlodipine were tested. \n \nPreclinical data available for the components of this fixed dose combination are reported below. \n \nTelmisartan \nIn preclinical safety studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic \nrange caused reduced red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes in renal \nhaemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), as well as increased serum potassium \nin normotensive animals. In dogs, renal tubular dilation and atrophy were observed. Gastric mucosal \ninjury (erosion, ulcers or inflammation) also was noted in rats and dogs. These pharmacologically-\nmediated undesirable effects, known from preclinical studies with both angiotensin converting enzyme \ninhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, were prevented by oral saline supplementation. In \nboth species, increased plasma renin activity and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the renal juxtaglomerular \ncells were observed. These changes, also a class effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors \nand other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, do not appear to have clinical significance. \nNo clear evidence of a teratogenic effect was observed, however at toxic dose levels of telmisartan an \neffect on the postnatal development of the offspring such as lower body weight and delayed eye \nopening was observed. \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no \nevidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice. \n \nAmlodipine \nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. \nIn reproductive toxicity studies in rats, delayed parturition, difficult labour and impaired fetal and pup \nsurvival were seen at high doses. There was no effect on the fertility of rats treated orally with \namlodipine maleate (males for 64 days and females for 14 days prior to mating) at doses of up to \n10 mg amlodipine/kg/day (about 10 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose of 10 mg/day on \nan mg/m2 basis).  \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nOnduarp 80 mg/5 mg tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 80 mg telmisartan and 5 mg amlodipine (as amlodipine besilate). \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect:  \nEach tablet contains 337.28 mg sorbitol (E420). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet \n \nBlue and white oval shaped two layer tablets engraved with the product code A3 and the company \nlogo on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension in adults: \n \nAdd on therapy \nOnduarp is indicated in adults whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on amlodipine. \n \nReplacement therapy \nAdult patients receiving telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets can instead receive tablets of \nOnduarp containing the same component doses. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of Onduarp is one tablet per day. \n \nThe maximum recommended dose is Onduarp 80 mg/10 mg, one tablet per day. Onduarp is indicated \nfor long term treatment. \n \nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended as bioavailability \nmay be increased in some patients resulting in increased blood pressure lowering effects (see section \n4.5). \n \nAdd on therapy \nOnduarp 80 mg/5 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \ncontrolled with Onduarp 40 mg/5 mg. \n \nIndividual dose titration with the components (i.e. amlodipine and telmisartan) is recommended before \nchanging to the fixed dose combination. When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy \nto the fixed combination may be considered. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\nPatients treated with 10 mg amlodipine who experience any dose limiting adverse reactions such as \noedema, may be switched to Onduarp 40 mg/5 mg once daily, reducing the dose of amlodipine \nwithout reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response. \n \nReplacement therapy \nPatients receiving telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets can instead receive tablets of \nOnduarp containing the same component doses in one tablet once daily, e.g. to enhance convenience \nor compliance \n \nSpecial population \n \nElderly patients \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients. Little information is available in the very elderly \npatients. \n \nPatients with renal impairment  \nNo posology adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Limited \nexperience is available in patients with severe renal impairment or haemodialysis. Caution is advised \nwhen using Onduarp in such patients as amlodipine and telmisartan are not dialysable (see also section \n4.4). \n \nConcomitant use of telmisartan with aliskiren is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment \n(GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see section 4.3). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment Onduarp should be administered with caution. \nFor telmisartan the posology should not exceed 40 mg once daily (see section 4.4). Onduarp is \ncontraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Onduarp in children aged below 18 years have not been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nOnduarp can be taken with or without food. It is recommended to take Onduarp with some liquid. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to dihydropyridine derivatives, or to any of the \n\nexcipients listed in section 6.1 \n• Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n• Biliary obstructive disorders and severe hepatic impairment \n• Shock (including cardiogenic shock) \n• Severe hypotension  \n• Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. high grade aortic stenosis)  \n• Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction \n \nThe concomitant use of telmisartan with aliskiren is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus \nor renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPregnancy \nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued \nangiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\nbe changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use \nin pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should \nbe stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see section 4.3 and \n4.6). \n \nHepatic impairment \nTelmisartan is mostly eliminated in the bile. Patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic \ninsufficiency can be expected to have reduced clearance. Furthermore as with all calcium antagonists, \namlodipine half-life is prolonged in patients with impaired liver function and dose recommendations \nhave not been established. Onduarp should therefore be used with caution in these patients. \n \nRenovascular hypertension \nThere is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral \nrenal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal \nproducts that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.  \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation \nWhen Onduarp is used in patients with impaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium \nand creatinine serum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of \nOnduarp in patients with a recent kidney transplant. Telmisartan and amlodipine are not dialysable. \n \nIntravascular hypovolaemia  \nSymptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume and/or \nsodium depleted by e.g. vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such \nconditions should be corrected before the administration of telmisartan. If hypotension occurs with \nOnduarp, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous \ninfusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once blood pressure has been stabilised. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system \nThe use of telmisartan in combination with aliskiren is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see section 4.3). \n \nAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, hypotension, syncope, \nhyperkalaemia and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) have been reported in \nsusceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that affect this system. Dual \nblockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. by administering telmisartan with other \nblockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system) is therefore not recommended. Close monitoring \nof renal function is advisable if co-administration is considered necessary. \n \nOther conditions with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system \nIn patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the \nrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying \nrenal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system \nhas been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nPrimary aldosteronism \nPatients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products \nacting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of telmisartan is not \nrecommended. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \nAs with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral \nstenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\nUnstable angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction \nThere are no data to support the use of Onduarp in unstable angina pectoris and during or within one \nmonth of a myocardial infarction. \n \nHeart failure \nIn a long-term, placebo controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA III and IV \nheart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine was associated with increased reports of \npulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the incidence of worsening heart failure as \ncompared to placebo (see section 5.1). \n \nDiabetic patients treated with insulin or antidiabetics \nIn these patients hypoglycaemia may occur under telmisartan treatment. Therefore, in these patients an \nappropriate blood glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or \nantidiabetics may be required when indicated. \n \nHyperkalaemia \nThe use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may cause \nhyperkalaemia. Hyperkalaemia may be fatal in the elderly, in patients with renal insufficiency, in \ndiabetic patients, in patients concomitantly treated with other medicinal products that may increase \npotassium levels, and/or in patients with intercurrent events.  \n \nBefore considering the concomitant use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-\naldosterone system, the benefit risk ratio should be evaluated. \nThe main risk factors for hyperkalaemia to be considered are: \n-  Diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, age (>70 years) \n-  Combination with one or more other medicinal products that affect the \n\nrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and/or potassium supplements. Medicinal products or \ntherapeutic classes of medicinal products that may provoke hyperkalaemia are salt substitutes \ncontaining potassium, potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor \nantagonists, non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective \nCOX-2 inhibitors), heparin, immunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim. \n\n-  Intercurrent events, in particular dehydration, acute cardiac decompensation, metabolic acidosis, \nworsening of renal function, sudden worsening of the renal condition (e.g. infectious diseases), \ncellular lysis (e.g. acute limb ischemia, rhabdomyolysis, extensive trauma). \n\n \nSerum potassium should be monitored closely in these patients (see section 4.5). \n \nSorbitol \nThis medicinal product contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \nintolerance should not take Onduarp. \n \nOther \nAs with any antihypertensive medicinal product, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with \nischaemic cardiomyopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction \nor stroke. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n  \nNo interactions between the two components of this fixed dose combinations have been observed in \nclinical studies.  \n \nInteractions common to the combination \nNo drug interaction studies have been performed. \n \nTo be taken into account with concomitant use  \n \nOther antihypertensive medicinal products  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\nThe blood pressure lowering effect of Onduarp can be increased by concomitant use of other \nantihypertensive medicinal products. \n \nMedicinal products with blood pressure lowering potential \nBased on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal products \nmay potentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including Onduarp, e.g. baclofen, \namifostine, neuroleptics or antidepressants. Furthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated \nby alcohol. \n \nCorticosteroids (systemic route) \nReduction of the antihypertensive effect. \n \nInteractions linked to telmisartan  \n \nContraindicated (see section 4.3) \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \nThe combination of telmisartan with aliskiren is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or \nrenal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections \n4.3, 4.4). \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \n \nPotassium sparing diuretics or potassium supplements \nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists such as telmisartan, attenuate diuretic induced potassium loss. \nPotassium sparing diuretics e.g. spirinolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride, potassium \nsupplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to a significant increase in serum \npotassium. If concomitant use is indicated because of documented hypokalaemia, they should be used \nwith caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. \n \nLithium \nReversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and with \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists, including telmisartan. If use of the combination proves necessary, \ncareful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.  \n \nConcomitant use requiring caution \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products \nNSAIDs (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non-\nselective NSAIDs) may reduce the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists. \nIn some patients with compromised renal function (e.g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with \ncompromised renal function), the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and \nmedicinal products that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, \nincluding possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore, the combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy \nand periodically thereafter. \n \nRamipril \nIn one study the co-administration of telmisartan and ramipril led to an increase of up to 2.5 fold in the \nAUC0-24 and Cmax of ramipril and ramiprilat. The clinical relevance of this observation is not known. \n \nConcomitant use to be taken into account \n \nDigoxin \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\nWhen telmisartan was co-administered with digoxin, median increases in digoxin peak plasma \nconcentration (49%) and in trough concentration (20%) were observed. When initiating, adjusting, and \ndiscontinuing telmisartan, monitor digoxin levels in order to maintain levels within the therapeutic \nrange. \n \nInteractions linked to amlodipine \n \nConcomitant use requiring caution \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors \nWith concomitant use with the CYP3A4 inhibitor erythromycin in young patients and diltiazem in \nelderly patients respectively, the plasma concentration of amlodipine increased by 22 % and 50 % \nrespectively. However, the clinical relevance of this finding is uncertain. It cannot be ruled out that \nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (i.e. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) may increase the plasma \nconcentrations of amlodipine to a greater extent than diltiazem. Amlodipine should be used with \ncaution together with CYP3A4 inhibitors. However, no adverse events attributable to such interaction \nhave been reported. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers \nThere is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. The concomitant \nuse of CYP3A4 inducers (i.e. rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) may lead to a lower plasma \nconcentration of amlodipine. \n \nGrapefruit and grapefruit juice \nConcomitant administration of 240 ml of grapefruit juice with a single oral dose of 10 mg amlodipine \nin 20 healthy volunteers did not show a significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of \namlodipine. The concomitant use of amlodipine and grapefruit or grapefruit juice is still not \nrecommended in patients as the bioavailability of amlodipine may increase in some and may result in \nincreased hypotensive effects. \n \nConcomitant use to be taken into account \n \nSimvastatin \nCo-administration of multiple doses of amlodipine with simvastatin 80 mg resulted in an increase in \nexposure to simvastatin up to 77 % compared to simvastatin alone. Therefore, the dose of simvastatin \nin patients on amlodipine should be limited to 20 mg daily. \n \nOthers \nAmlodipine has been safely administered with digoxin, warfarin, atorvastatin, sildenafil, anti-acid \nmedicinal products (aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, simeticone), cimetidine, \nciclosporin, antibiotics and oral hypoglycaemic medicinal products. When amlodipine and sildenafil \nwere used in combination, each agent independently exerted its own blood pressure lowering effect. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of Onduarp in pregnant women. Animal reproductive toxicity \nstudies with Onduarp have not been performed. \n \nTelmisartan \n \nThe use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of \npregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during \nthe second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nStudies with telmisartan in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of medicinal products. Unless continued \nangiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should \nbe changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use \nin pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should \nbe stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy during the second and third trimesters is known \nto induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification \nretardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3). \nShould exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of \npregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for \nhypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nAmlodipine \n \nData on a limited number of exposed pregnancies do not indicate that amlodipine or other calcium \nreceptor antagonists have a harmful effect on the health of the fetus. However, there may be a risk of \nprolonged delivery. \n \nBreast-feeding \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of telmisartan and/or amlodipine during breast-\nfeeding, Onduarp is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles \nduring breast-feeding are preferable, especially while breast-feeding a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nFertility \nNo data from controlled clinical studies with the Fixed Dose Combination or with the individual \ncomponents are available. \n \nSeparate reproductive toxicity studies with the combination of telmisartan and amlodipine have not \nbeen conducted. \nIn preclinical studies, no effects of telmisartan on male and female fertility were observed. \nSimilarly, no effects on male and female fertility were reported for amlodipine (see section 5.3). \n \nReversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa which can impair fecundation have been \nobserved for calcium channel blockers in preclinical and in vitro studies. No clinical relevance has \nbeen established. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nOnduarp has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised \nthat they may experience adverse reactions such as syncope, somnolence, dizziness, or vertigo during \ntreatment (see section 4.8). Therefore, caution should be recommended when driving a car or using \nmachines. If patients experience these adverse reactions, they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks \nsuch as driving or using machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reactions include dizziness and peripheral oedema. Serious syncope may \noccur rarely (less than 1 case per 1,000 patients). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\n \nThe safety and tolerability of Onduarp has been evaluated in five controlled clinical studies with over \n3500 patients, over 2500 of whom received telmisartan in combination with amlodipine. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: \nvery common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare \n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata).  \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nCommon \n \n\nUncommon \n \n\nRare \n \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n  cystitis \n\nPsychiatric disorders   depression,  \nanxiety, \ninsomnia \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\ndizziness somnolence, \nmigraine,  \nheadache,  \nparaesthesia \n\nsyncope,  \nperipheral neuropathy, \nhypoaesthesia, \ndysgeusia, \ntremor \n \n\nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders \n\n vertigo   \n\nCardiac disorders  bradycardia, \npalpitations \n\n \n\nVascular disorders  hypotension, \northostatic \nhypotension, flushing \n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\n cough \n \n\n \n\nGastro-intestinal \ndisorders \n\n abdominal pain, \ndiarrhoea, \nnausea \n\nvomiting, \ngingival hypertrophy, \ndyspepsia, \ndry mouth \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n pruritus eczema, erythema,  \nrash  \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\n arthralgia, \nmuscle spasms \n(cramps in legs), \nmyalgia \n\nback pain, \npain in extremity (leg \npain) \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\n  nocturia  \n \n\nReproductive system, \nand breast disorders \n\n erectile dysfunction  \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nperipheral oedema \n \n\nasthenia, \nchest pain, fatigue, \noedema \n\n \n\nmalaise \n \n \n\n \nInvestigations  hepatic enzymes \n\nincreased \nblood uric acid \nincreased \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n\nAdditional information on individual components   \n \nAdverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components (telmisartan or \namlodipine) may be potential adverse reactions with Onduarp as well, even if not observed in clinical \ntrials or during the post-marketing period. \n \nTelmisartan \n \nInfections and infestations  \n Uncommon: \n \n Rare: \n\nUpper respiratory tract infection including pharyngitis and \nsinusitis, urinary tract infection including cystitis  \nSepsis including fatal outcome1 \n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n Uncommon: \n Rare: \n \n\nAnaemia  \nThrombocytopenia, eosinophilia \n\nImmune system disorders \n Rare: \n \n\nHypersensitivity, anaphylactic reaction \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n Uncommon: \n Rare: \n \n\nHyperkalaemia \nHypoglycaemia (in diabetic patients) \n\nEye disorders  \n Rare: Visual disturbance \n\n \nCardiac disorders  \n Rare: Tachycardia  \n\n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n Uncommon: Dyspnoea \n\n \nGastrointestinal disorders  \n Uncommon: \n Rare: \n\nFlatulence \nStomach discomfort \n \n\nHepato-biliary disorders  \n Rare: \n \n\nHepatic function abnormal, liver disorder2 \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n Uncommon: \n Rare: \n\nHyperhidrosis \nAngioedema (with fatal outcome), drug eruption, toxic skin \neruption, urticaria \n \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n Rare: \n \n\nTendon pain (tendinitis like symptoms) \n\nRenal and urinary disorders  \n Uncommon: Renal impairment including acute renal failure \n\n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n Rare: Influenza-like illness \n\n \nInvestigations  \n Uncommon: Blood creatinine increased \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\n Rare: Blood creatine phosphokinase increased, haemoglobin decreased \n1: the event may be a chance finding or related to a mechanism currently not known \n2: most cases of hepatic function abnormal / liver disorder from post-marketing experience with \ntelmisartan occurred in Japanese patients.

Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with \nfatal outcome have been reported. \n \nTreatment \nThe patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. \nManagement depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. Suggested \nmeasures include induction of emesis and / or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the \ntreatment of overdose of both telmisartan and amlodipine.  \nSerum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient \nshould be placed in a supine position with elevation of extremities, with salt and volume replacement \ngiven quickly. Supportive treatment should be instituted. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be \nbeneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. Telmisartan and Amlodipine are not \nremoved by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin II antagonists \nand calcium channel blockers; ATC Code: C09DB04. \n \nOnduarp combines two antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control \nblood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, \ntelmisartan, and a dihydropyridinic calcium channel blocker, amlodipine. \nThe combination of these substances has an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure \nto a greater degree than either component alone. \nOnduarp once daily produces effective and consistent reductions in blood pressure across the 24-hour \ntherapeutic dose range.   \n \nTelmisartan \nTelmisartan is an orally active and specific angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. Telmisartan \ndisplaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor subtype, \nwhich is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Telmisartan does not exhibit any partial \nagonist activity at the AT1 receptor. Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor. The binding is \nlong-lasting. Telmisartan does not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and other less \ncharacterised AT receptors. The functional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the effect of \ntheir possible overstimulation by angiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan. Plasma \naldosterone levels are decreased by telmisartan. Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma renin or \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\nblock ion channels. Telmisartan does not inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), the \nenzyme which also degrades bradykinin. Therefore it is not expected to potentiate \nbradykinin-mediated adverse reactions. \n \nIn humans, an 80 mg dose of telmisartan almost completely inhibits the angiotensin II evoked blood \npressure increase. The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and still measurable up to \n48 hours. \n \nAfter the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within \n3 hours. The maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4 to 8 weeks after the start of \ntreatment and is sustained during long-term therapy. \n \nThe antihypertensive effect persists constantly over 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours \nbefore the next dose as shown by ambulatory blood pressure measurements. This is confirmed by \ntrough to peak ratios consistently above 80 % seen after doses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in \nplacebo controlled clinical studies. There is an apparent trend to a dose relationship to a time to \nrecovery of baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP). In this respect data concerning diastolic blood \npressure (DBP) are inconsistent.  \n \nIn patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without \naffecting pulse rate. The contribution of the medicinal product's diuretic and natriuretic effect to its \nhypotensive activity has still to be defined. The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable \nto that of substances representative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products \n(demonstrated in clinical trials comparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, \nhydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril). \n \nUpon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment \nvalues over a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension.  \n \nThe incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those \ngiven angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two \nantihypertensive treatments. \n \nAmlodipine \nAmlodipine is a calcium ion influx inhibitor of the dihydropyridine group (slow channel blocker or \ncalcium ion antagonist) and inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac and \nvascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a \ndirect relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, leading to reductions in peripheral vascular \nresistance and in blood pressure. Experimental data indicate that amlodipine binds to both \ndihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine binding sites. Amlodipine is relatively vessel-selective, with \na greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. \n \nIn patients with hypertension, once daily dosing provides clinically significant reductions of blood \npressure in both the supine and standing positions throughout the 24 hour interval. Due to the slow \nonset of action, acute hypotension is not a feature of amlodipine administration. \nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \nplasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. \n \nAmlodipine has not been associated with any adverse metabolic effects or changes in plasma lipids \nand is suitable for use in patients with asthma, diabetes, and gout. \n \nUse in patients with heart failure \nHaemodynamic studies and exercise based controlled clinical trials in NYHA Class II-IV heart failure \npatients have shown that amlodipine did not lead to clinical deterioration as measured by exercise \ntolerance, left ventricular ejection fraction and clinical symptomatology. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\nA placebo controlled study (PRAISE) designed to evaluate patients in NYHA Class III-IV heart \nfailure receiving digoxin, diuretics and ACE inhibitors has shown that amlodipine did not lead to an \nincrease in risk of mortality or combined mortality and morbidity with heart failure. \n \nIn a follow-up, long term, placebo controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA \nIII and IV heart failure without clinical symptoms or objective findings suggestive of underlying \nischaemic disease, on stable doses of ACE inhibitors, digitalis, and diuretics, amlodipine had no effect \non total cardiovascular mortality. In this same population amlodipine was associated with increased \nreports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the incidence of worsening heart \nfailure as compared to placebo. \n \nTelmisartan/Amlodipine \nIn an 8-week multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group factorial study \nin 1461 patients with mild to severe hypertension (mean seated diastolic blood pressure ≥95 and \n≤119 mmHg), treatment with each combination dose of Onduarp resulted in significantly greater \ndiastolic and systolic blood pressure reductions and higher control rates compared to the respective \nmonotherapy components. \n \nOnduarp showed dose-related reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure across the therapeutic \ndose range of −21.8/−16.5 mmHg (40 mg/5 mg), −22.1/−18.2 mmHg (80 mg/5 mg), \n−24.7/−20.2 mmHg (40 mg/10 mg) and −26.4/−20.1 mmHg (80 mg/10 mg). The reduction in diastolic \nblood pressure <90 mmHg was achieved in 71.6 %, 74.8 %, 82.1 %, 85.3% of patients respectively. \nValues are adjusted for baseline and country. \n \nThe majority of the antihypertensive effect was attained within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy. \nIn a subset of 1050 patients with moderate to severe hypertension (DBP ≥100 mmHg) 32.7 - 51.8 % \nresponded sufficiently to monotherapy of either telmisartan or amlodipine. The observed mean \nchanges in systolic/diastolic blood pressure with a combination therapy containing amlodipine 5 mg \n(−22.2/−17.2 mmHg with 40 mg/5 mg; −22.5/−19.1 mmHg with 80 mg/5 mg) were comparable to or \ngreater than those seen with amlodipine 10 mg (−21.0/−17.6 mmHg) and associated with significant \nlower oedema rates (1.4% with 40 mg/5 mg; 0.5 % with 80 mg/5 mg; 17.6 % with amlodipine 10 mg). \n \nAutomated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) performed in a subset of 562 patients \nconfirmed the results seen with in-clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions consistently \nover the entire 24-hours dosing period. \n \nIn a further multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group study, a total of \n1097 patients with mild to severe hypertension who were not adequately controlled on amlodipine \n5 mg received Onduarp (40 mg/5 mg or 80 mg/5 mg) or amlodipine alone (5 mg or 10 mg). After \n8 weeks of treatment, each of the combinations was statistically significantly superior to both \namlodipine monotherapy doses in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressures (−13.6/−9.4 mmHg, \n−15.0/−10.6 mmHg with 40 mg/5 mg, 80 mg/5 mg versus −6.2/−5.7 mmHg, −11.1/−8.0 mmHg with \namlodipine 5 mg and 10 mg and higher diastolic blood pressure control rates compared to the \nrespective monotherapies were achieved (56.7 %, 63.8 % with 40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg versus \n42 %, 56.7 % with amlodipine 5 mg and 10 mg). Oedema rates were significantly lower with \n40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg compared to amlodipine 10 mg (4.4% versus 24.9 %, respectively). \n \nIn another multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group study, a total of \n947 patients with mild to severe hypertension who were not adequately controlled on amlodipine \n10 mg received Onduarp (40 mg/10 mg or 80 mg/10 mg) or amlodipine alone (10 mg). After 8 weeks \nof treatment, each of the combination treatments was statistically significantly superior to amlodipine \nmonotherapy in reducing diastolic and systolic blood pressure (−11.1/−9.2 mmHg, −11.3/−9.3 mmHg \nwith 40 mg/10 mg, 80 mg/10 mg versus −7.4/−6.5 mmHg with amlodipine 10 mg) and higher diastolic \nblood pressure normalisation rates compared to monotherapy were achieved (63.7 %, 66.5 % with \n40 mg/10 mg, 80 mg/10 mg versus 51.1 % with amlodipine 10 mg). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\nIn two corresponding open-label long-term follow up studies performed over a further 6 months the \neffect of Onduarp was maintained over the trial period. Furthermore it was shown that some patients \nnot adequately controlled with Onduarp 40 mg/10 mg had additional blood pressure reduction by up-\ntitration to Onduarp 80 mg/10 mg. \n \nThe overall incidence of adverse reactions with Onduarp in the clinical trial programme was low with \nonly 12.7 % of patients on treatment experiencing adverse reactions. The most common adverse \nreactions were peripheral oedema and dizziness, see also section 4.8. The adverse reactions reported \nwere in agreement with those anticipated from the safety profiles of the components telmisartan and \namlodipine. No new or more severe adverse reactions were observed. The oedema related events \n(peripheral oedema, generalised oedema, and oedema) were consistently lower in patients who \nreceived Onduarp as compared to patients who received amlodipine 10 mg. In the factorial design trial \nthe oedema rates were 1.3 % with Onduarp 40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg, 8.8 % with Onduarp \n40 mg/10 mg and 80 mg/10 mg and 18.4 % with Amlodipine 10 mg. In patients not controlled on \namlodipine 5 mg the oedema rates were 4.4 % for 40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg and 24.9 % for \namlodipine 10 mg. \n \nThe antihypertensive effect of Onduarp was similar irrespective of age and gender, and was similar in \npatients with and without diabetes. \n \nOnduarp has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension. Telmisartan has been \nstudied in a large outcome study in 25,620 patients with high cardiovascular risk (ONTARGET). \nAmlodipine has been studied in patients with chronic stable angina, vasospastic angina and \nangiographically documented coronary artery disease. \n \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nOnduarp in all subsets of the paediatric population in hypertension (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPharmacokinetic of the fixed dose combination (FDC) \nThe rate and extent of absorption of Onduarp are equivalent to the bioavailability of telmisartan and \namlodipine when administered as individual tablets. \n \nAbsorption \nAbsorption of telmisartan is rapid although the amount absorbed varies. The mean absolute \nbioavailability for telmisartan is about 50 %. When telmisartan is taken with food, the reduction in the \narea under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) of telmisartan varies from approximately \n6 % (40 mg dose) to approximately 19 % (160 mg dose). By 3 hours after administration, plasma \nconcentrations are similar whether telmisartan is taken fasting or with food.  \n \nAfter oral administration of therapeutic doses, amlodipine is well absorbed with peak blood levels \nbetween 6-12 hours post dose. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64 and 80 %. \nAmlodipine bioavailability is not affected by food ingestion. \n \nDistribution \nTelmisartan is largely bound to plasma protein (>99.5 %), mainly albumin and alpha-1 acid \nglycoprotein. The mean steady state apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) is approximately 500 l. \n \nThe volume of distribution of amlodipine is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies have shown that \napproximately 97.5 % of circulating amlodipine is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\nBiotransformation \nTelmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide of the parent compound. No \npharmacological activity has been shown for the conjugate.  \n \nAmlodipine is extensively (approximatively 90 %) metabolised by the liver to inactive metabolites. \n \nElimination \nTelmisartan is characterised by biexponential decay pharmacokinetics with a terminal elimination \nhalf-life of >20 hours. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and, to a smaller extent, the area \nunder the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), increase disproportionately with dose. There is no \nevidence of clinically relevant accumulation of telmisartan taken at the recommended dose. Plasma \nconcentrations were higher in females than in males, without relevant influence on efficacy. \n \nAfter oral (and intravenous) administration, telmisartan is nearly exclusively excreted with the faeces, \nmainly as unchanged compound. Cumulative urinary excretion is <1 % of dose. Total plasma \nclearance (Cltot) is high (approximately 1,000 ml/min) compared with hepatic blood flow (about \n1,500 ml/min). \n \nAmlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of \napproximately 30 to 50 hours consistent with once daily dosing. Steady-state plasma levels are \nreached after continuous administration for 7–8 days. Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60 % of \namlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine.  \n \nLinearity/non-linearity  \nThe small reduction in AUC for telmisartan is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic \nefficacy. There is no linear relationship between doses and plasma levels. Cmax and to a lesser extent \nAUC increase disproportionately at doses above 40 mg. \n \nAmlodipine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population (age below 18 years) \nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population. \n \nGender \nDifferences in plasma concentrations of telmisartan were observed, with Cmax and AUC being \napproximately 3- and 2-fold higher, respectively, in females compared to males. \n \nElderly \nThe pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ in young and elderly patients. \nThe time to reach peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine is similar in elderly and younger subjects. \nIn elderly patients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline with resulting increases in AUC and \nelimination half-life. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with mild to moderate and severe renal impairment, doubling of plasma concentrations of \ntelmisartan was observed. However, lower plasma concentrations were observed in patients with renal \ninsufficiency undergoing dialysis. Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma protein in renal-insufficient \nsubjects and cannot be removed by dialysis. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with \nrenal impairment. The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal \nimpairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nPharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute \nbioavailability of telmisartan up to nearly 100 %. The elimination half-life of telmisartan is not \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n\nchanged in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased \nclearance of amlodipine with resulting increase of approximately 40–60 % in AUC. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSince the non-clinical toxicity profiles of telmisartan and amlodipine are not overlapping, no \nexacerbation of toxicity was expected for the combination. This has been confirmed in a subchronic \n(13-week) toxicology study in rats, in which dose levels of 3.2/0.8, 10/2.5 and 40/10 mg/kg of \ntelmisartan and amlodipine were tested. \n \nPreclinical data available for the components of this fixed dose combination are reported below. \n \nTelmisartan \nIn preclinical safety studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic \nrange caused reduced red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes in renal \nhaemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), as well as increased serum potassium \nin normotensive animals. In dogs, renal tubular dilation and atrophy were observed. Gastric mucosal \ninjury (erosion, ulcers or inflammation) also was noted in rats and dogs. These pharmacologically-\nmediated undesirable effects, known from preclinical studies with both angiotensin converting enzyme \ninhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, were prevented by oral saline supplementation. In \nboth species, increased plasma renin activity and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the renal juxtaglomerular \ncells were observed. These changes, also a class effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors \nand other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, do not appear to have clinical significance. \nNo clear evidence of a teratogenic effect was observed, however at toxic dose levels of telmisartan an \neffect on the postnatal development of the offspring such as lower body weight and delayed eye \nopening was observed. \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no \nevidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice. \n \nAmlodipine \nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. \nIn reproductive toxicity studies in rats, delayed parturition, difficult labour and impaired fetal and pup \nsurvival were seen at high doses. There was no effect on the fertility of rats treated orally with \namlodipine maleate (males for 64 days and females for 14 days prior to mating) at doses of up to \n10 mg amlodipine/kg/day (about 10 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose of 10 mg/day on \nan mg/m2 basis).  \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension in adults: \n \nAdd on therapy \nOnduarp is indicated in adults whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on amlodipine. \n \nReplacement therapy \nAdult patients receiving telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets can instead receive tablets of \nOnduarp containing the same component doses. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of Onduarp is one tablet per day. \n \nThe maximum recommended dose is Onduarp 80 mg/10 mg, one tablet per day. Onduarp is indicated \nfor long term treatment. \n \nAdministration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended as bioavailability \nmay be increased in some patients resulting in increased blood pressure lowering effects (see section \n4.5). \n \nAdd on therapy \nOnduarp 80 mg/10 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \ncontrolled on Onduarp 40 mg/10 mg or Onduarp 80 mg/5 mg. \n \nIndividual dose titration with the components (i.e. amlodipine and telmisartan) is recommended before \nchanging to the fixed dose combination. When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy \nto the fixed combination may be considered. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n\nPatients treated with 10 mg amlodipine who experience any dose limiting adverse reactions such as \noedema, may be switched to Onduarp 40 mg/5 mg once daily, reducing the dose of amlodipine \nwithout reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response. \n \nReplacement therapy \nPatients receiving telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets can instead receive tablets of \nOnduarp containing the same component doses in one tablet once daily, e.g. to enhance convenience \nor compliance \n \nSpecial population \n \nElderly patients \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients. Little information is available in the very elderly \npatients. \n \nPatients with renal impairment  \nNo posology adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Limited \nexperience is available in patients with severe renal impairment or haemodialysis. Caution is advised \nwhen using Onduarp in such patients as amlodipine and telmisartan are not dialysable (see also section \n4.4). \n \nConcomitant use of telmisartan with aliskiren is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment \n(GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see section 4.3). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment Onduarp should be administered with caution. \nFor telmisartan the posology should not exceed 40 mg once daily (see section 4.4). Onduarp is \ncontraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Onduarp in children aged below 18 years have not been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nOnduarp can be taken with or without food. It is recommended to take Onduarp with some liquid. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to dihydropyridine derivatives, or to any of the \n\nexcipients listed in section 6.1 \n• Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n• Biliary obstructive disorders and severe hepatic impairment \n• Shock (including cardiogenic shock) \n• Severe hypotension  \n• Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. high grade aortic stenosis)  \n• Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction \n \nThe concomitant use of telmisartan with aliskiren is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus \nor renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPregnancy \nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued \nangiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\nbe changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use \nin pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should \nbe stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see section 4.3 and \n4.6). \n \nHepatic impairment \nTelmisartan is mostly eliminated in the bile. Patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic \ninsufficiency can be expected to have reduced clearance. Furthermore as with all calcium antagonists, \namlodipine half-life is prolonged in patients with impaired liver function and dose recommendations \nhave not been established. Onduarp should therefore be used with caution in these patients. \n \nRenovascular hypertension \nThere is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral \nrenal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal \nproducts that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.  \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation \nWhen Onduarp is used in patients with impaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium \nand creatinine serum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of \nOnduarp in patients with a recent kidney transplant. Telmisartan and amlodipine are not dialysable. \n \nIntravascular hypovolaemia  \nSymptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume and/or \nsodium depleted by e.g. vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such \nconditions should be corrected before the administration of telmisartan. If hypotension occurs with \nOnduarp, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous \ninfusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once blood pressure has been stabilised. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system \nThe use of telmisartan in combination with aliskiren is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see section 4.3). \n \nAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, hypotension, syncope, \nhyperkalaemia and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) have been reported in \nsusceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that affect this system. Dual \nblockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. by administering telmisartan with other \nblockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system) is therefore not recommended. Close monitoring \nof renal function is advisable if co-administration is considered necessary. \n \nOther conditions with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system \nIn patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the \nrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying \nrenal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system \nhas been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nPrimary aldosteronism \nPatients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products \nacting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of telmisartan is not \nrecommended. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \nAs with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral \nstenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n\nUnstable angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction \nThere are no data to support the use of Onduarp in unstable angina pectoris and during or within one \nmonth of a myocardial infarction. \n \nHeart failure \nIn a long-term, placebo controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA III and IV \nheart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine was associated with increased reports of \npulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the incidence of worsening heart failure as \ncompared to placebo (see section 5.1). \n \nDiabetic patients treated with insulin or antidiabetics \nIn these patients hypoglycaemia may occur under telmisartan treatment. Therefore, in these patients an \nappropriate blood glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or \nantidiabetics may be required when indicated. \n \nHyperkalaemia \nThe use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may cause \nhyperkalaemia. Hyperkalaemia may be fatal in the elderly, in patients with renal insufficiency, in \ndiabetic patients, in patients concomitantly treated with other medicinal products that may increase \npotassium levels, and/or in patients with intercurrent events,.  \n \nBefore considering the concomitant use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-\naldosterone system, the benefit risk ratio should be evaluated. \nThe main risk factors for hyperkalaemia to be considered are: \n-  Diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, age (>70 years) \n-  Combination with one or more other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-\n\naldosterone system and/or potassium supplements. Medicinal products or therapeutic classes of \nmedicinal products that may provoke hyperkalaemia are salt substitutes containing potassium, \npotassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal \nanti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, \nimmunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim. \n\n-  Intercurrent events, in particular dehydration, acute cardiac decompensation, metabolic acidosis, \nworsening of renal function, sudden worsening of the renal condition (e.g. infectious diseases), \ncellular lysis (e.g. acute limb ischemia, rhabdomyolysis, extensive trauma). \n\n \nSerum potassium should be monitored closely in these patients (see section 4.5). \n \nSorbitol \nThis medicinal product contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \nintolerance should not take Onduarp. \n \nOther \nAs with any antihypertensive medicinal product, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with \nischaemic cardiomyopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction \nor stroke. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n  \nNo interactions between the two components of this fixed dose combinations have been observed in \nclinical studies.  \n \nInteractions common to the combination \nNo drug interaction studies have been performed. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\nTo be taken into account with concomitant use  \n \nOther antihypertensive medicinal products  \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of Onduarp can be increased by concomitant use of other \nantihypertensive medicinal products. \n \nMedicinal products with blood pressure lowering potential \nBased on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal products \nmay potentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including Onduarp, e.g. baclofen, \namifostine, neuroleptics or antidepressants. Furthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated \nby alcohol. \n \nCorticosteroids (systemic route) \nReduction of the antihypertensive effect. \n \nInteractions linked to telmisartan  \n \nContraindicated (see section 4.3) \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \nThe combination of telmisartan with aliskiren is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or \nrenal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and is not recommended in other patients (see sections \n4.3, 4.4). \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \n \nPotassium sparing diuretics or potassium supplements \nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists such as telmisartan, attenuate diuretic induced potassium loss. \nPotassium sparing diuretics e.g. spirinolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride, potassium \nsupplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to a significant increase in serum \npotassium. If concomitant use is indicated because of documented hypokalaemia, they should be used \nwith caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. \n \nLithium \nReversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and with \nangiotensin II receptor antagonists, including telmisartan. If use of the combination proves necessary, \ncareful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.  \n \nConcomitant use requiring caution \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products \nNSAIDs (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non-\nselective NSAIDs) may reduce the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists. \nIn some patients with compromised renal function (e.g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with \ncompromised renal function), the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and \nmedicinal products that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, \nincluding possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore, the combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy \nand periodically thereafter. \n \nRamipril \nIn one study the co-administration of telmisartan and ramipril led to an increase of up to 2.5 fold in the \nAUC0-24 and Cmax of ramipril and ramiprilat. The clinical relevance of this observation is not known. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n\nConcomitant use to be taken into account \n \nDigoxin \nWhen telmisartan was co-administered with digoxin, median increases in digoxin peak plasma \nconcentration (49%) and in trough concentration (20%) were observed. When initiating, adjusting, and \ndiscontinuing telmisartan, monitor digoxin levels in order to maintain levels within the therapeutic \nrange. \n \nInteractions linked to amlodipine \n \nConcomitant use requiring caution \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors \nWith concomitant use with the CYP3A4 inhibitor erythromycin in young patients and diltiazem in \nelderly patients respectively, the plasma concentration of amlodipine increased by 22 % and 50 % \nrespectively. However, the clinical relevance of this finding is uncertain. It cannot be ruled out that \nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (i.e. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) may increase the plasma \nconcentrations of amlodipine to a greater extent than diltiazem. Amlodipine should be used with \ncaution together with CYP3A4 inhibitors. However, no adverse events attributable to such interaction \nhave been reported. \n \nCYP3A4 inducers \nThere is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. The concomitant \nuse of CYP3A4 inducers (i.e. rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) may lead to a lower plasma \nconcentration of amlodipine. \n \nGrapefruit and grapefruit juice \nConcomitant administration of 240 ml of grapefruit juice with a single oral dose of 10 mg amlodipine \nin 20 healthy volunteers did not show a significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of \namlodipine. The concomitant use of amlodipine and grapefruit or grapefruit juice is still not \nrecommended in patients as the bioavailability of amlodipine may increase in some and may result in \nincreased hypotensive effects. \n \nConcomitant use to be taken into account \n \nSimvastatin \nCo-administration of multiple doses of amlodipine with simvastatin 80 mg resulted in an increase in \nexposure to simvastatin up to 77 % compared to simvastatin alone. Therefore, the dose of simvastatin \nin patients on amlodipine should be limited to 20 mg daily. \n \nOthers \nAmlodipine has been safely administered with digoxin, warfarin, atorvastatin, sildenafil, anti-acid \nmedicinal products (aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, simeticone), cimetidine, \nciclosporin, antibiotics and oral hypoglycaemic medicinal products. When amlodipine and sildenafil \nwere used in combination, each agent independently exerted its own blood pressure lowering effect. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of Onduarp in pregnant women. Animal reproductive toxicity \nstudies with Onduarp have not been performed. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n\nTelmisartan \n \nThe use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of \npregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during \nthe second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nStudies with telmisartan in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of medicinal products. Unless continued \nangiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should \nbe changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use \nin pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should \nbe stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy during the second and third trimesters is known \nto induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification \nretardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3). \nShould exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of \npregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for \nhypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nAmlodipine \n \nData on a limited number of exposed pregnancies do not indicate that amlodipine or other calcium \nreceptor antagonists have a harmful effect on the health of the fetus. However, there may be a risk of \nprolonged delivery. \n \nBreast-feeding \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of telmisartan and/or amlodipine during breast-\nfeeding, Onduarp is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles \nduring breast-feeding are preferable, especially while breast-feeding a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nFertility \nNo data from controlled clinical studies with the Fixed Dose Combination or with the individual \ncomponents are available. \n \nSeparate reproductive toxicity studies with the combination of telmisartan and amlodipine have not \nbeen conducted. \nIn preclinical studies, no effects of telmisartan on male and female fertility were observed. \nSimilarly, no effects on male and female fertility were reported for amlodipine (see section 5.3). \n \nReversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa which can impair fecundation have been \nobserved for calcium channel blockers in preclinical and in vitro studies. No clinical relevance has \nbeen established. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nOnduarp has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised \nthat they may experience adverse reactions such as syncope, somnolence, dizziness, or vertigo during \ntreatment (see section 4.8). Therefore, caution should be recommended when driving a car or using \nmachines. If patients experience these adverse reactions, they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks \nsuch as driving or using machines. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reactions include dizziness and peripheral oedema.

If hypotension occurs, the patient \nshould be placed in a supine position with elevation of extremities, with salt and volume replacement \ngiven quickly. Supportive treatment should be instituted. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be \nbeneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. Telmisartan and Amlodipine are not \nremoved by haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin II antagonists \nand calcium channel blockers; ATC Code: C09DB04. \n \nOnduarp combines two antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control \nblood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, \ntelmisartan, and a dihydropyridinic calcium channel blocker, amlodipine. \nThe combination of these substances has an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure \nto a greater degree than either component alone. \nOnduarp once daily produces effective and consistent reductions in blood pressure across the 24-hour \ntherapeutic dose range.   \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n64 \n\nTelmisartan \nTelmisartan is an orally active and specific angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. Telmisartan \ndisplaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor subtype, \nwhich is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Telmisartan does not exhibit any partial \nagonist activity at the AT1 receptor. Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor. The binding is \nlong-lasting. Telmisartan does not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and other less \ncharacterised AT receptors. The functional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the effect of \ntheir possible overstimulation by angiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan. Plasma \naldosterone levels are decreased by telmisartan. Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma renin or \nblock ion channels. Telmisartan does not inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), the \nenzyme which also degrades bradykinin. Therefore it is not expected to potentiate bradykinin-\nmediated adverse reactions. \n \nIn humans, an 80 mg dose of telmisartan almost completely inhibits the angiotensin II evoked blood \npressure increase. The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and still measurable up to \n48 hours. \n \nAfter the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within \n3 hours. The maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4 to 8 weeks after the start of \ntreatment and is sustained during long-term therapy. \n \nThe antihypertensive effect persists constantly over 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours \nbefore the next dose as shown by ambulatory blood pressure measurements. This is confirmed by \ntrough to peak ratios consistently above 80 % seen after doses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in \nplacebo controlled clinical studies. There is an apparent trend to a dose relationship to a time to \nrecovery of baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP). In this respect data concerning diastolic blood \npressure (DBP) are inconsistent.  \n \nIn patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without \naffecting pulse rate. The contribution of the medicinal product’s diuretic and natriuretic effect to its \nhypotensive activity has still to be defined. The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable \nto that of substances representative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products \n(demonstrated in clinical trials comparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, \nhydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril). \n \nUpon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment \nvalues over a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension.  \n \nThe incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those \ngiven angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two \nantihypertensive treatments. \n \nAmlodipine \nAmlodipine is a calcium ion influx inhibitor of the dihydropyridine group (slow channel blocker or \ncalcium ion antagonist) and inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac and \nvascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a \ndirect relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, leading to reductions in peripheral vascular \nresistance and in blood pressure. Experimental data indicate that amlodipine binds to both \ndihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine binding sites. Amlodipine is relatively vessel-selective, with \na greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. \n \nIn patients with hypertension, once daily dosing provides clinically significant reductions of blood \npressure in both the supine and standing positions throughout the 24 hour interval. Due to the slow \nonset of action, acute hypotension is not a feature of amlodipine administration. \nIn hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a \ndecrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal \nplasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n65 \n\n \nAmlodipine has not been associated with any adverse metabolic effects or changes in plasma lipids \nand is suitable for use in patients with asthma, diabetes, and gout. \n \nUse in patients with heart failure \nHaemodynamic studies and exercise based controlled clinical trials in NYHA Class II-IV heart failure \npatients have shown that amlodipine did not lead to clinical deterioration as measured by exercise \ntolerance, left ventricular ejection fraction and clinical symptomatology. \n \nA placebo controlled study (PRAISE) designed to evaluate patients in NYHA Class III-IV heart \nfailure receiving digoxin, diuretics and ACE inhibitors has shown that amlodipine did not lead to an \nincrease in risk of mortality or combined mortality and morbidity with heart failure. \n \nIn a follow-up, long term, placebo controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with \nNYHA III and IV heart failure without clinical symptoms or objective findings suggestive of \nunderlying ischaemic disease, on stable doses of ACE inhibitors, digitalis, and diuretics, amlodipine \nhad no effect on total cardiovascular mortality. In this same population amlodipine was associated \nwith increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the incidence of \nworsening heart failure as compared to placebo. \n \nTelmisartan/Amlodipine \nIn an 8-week multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group factorial study \nin 1461 patients with mild to severe hypertension (mean seated diastolic blood pressure ≥95 and \n≤119 mmHg), treatment with each combination dose of Onduarp resulted in significantly greater \ndiastolic and systolic blood pressure reductions and higher control rates compared to the respective \nmonotherapy components. \n \nOnduarp showed dose-related reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure across the therapeutic \ndose range of −21.8/−16.5 mmHg (40 mg/5 mg), −22.1/−18.2 mmHg (80 mg/5 mg), \n−24.7/−20.2 mmHg (40 mg/10 mg) and −26.4/−20.1 mmHg (80 mg/10 mg). The reduction in diastolic \nblood pressure <90 mmHg was achieved in 71.6 %, 74.8 %, 82.1 %, 85.3 % of patients respectively. \nValues are adjusted for baseline and country. \n \nThe majority of the antihypertensive effect was attained within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy. \nIn a subset of 1050 patients with moderate to severe hypertension (DBP ≥100 mmHg) 32.7 - 51.8 % \nresponded sufficiently to monotherapy of either telmisartan or amlodipine. The observed mean \nchanges in systolic/diastolic blood pressure with a combination therapy containing amlodipine 5 mg \n(−22.2/−17.2 mmHg with 40 mg/5 mg; −22.5/−19.1 mmHg with 80 mg/5 mg) were comparable to or \ngreater than those seen with amlodipine 10 mg (−21.0/−17.6 mmHg) and associated with significant \nlower oedema rates (1.4 % with 40 mg/5 mg; 0.5 % with 80 mg/5 mg; 17.6 % with amlodipine \n10 mg). \n \nAutomated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) performed in a subset of 562 patients \nconfirmed the results seen with in-clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions consistently \nover the entire 24-hours dosing period. \n \nIn a further multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group study, a total of \n1097 patients with mild to severe hypertension who were not adequately controlled on amlodipine \n5 mg received Onduarp (40 mg/5 mg or 80 mg/5 mg) or amlodipine alone (5 mg or 10 mg). After \n8 weeks of treatment, each of the combinations was statistically significantly superior to both \namlodipine monotherapy doses in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressures (−13.6/−9.4 mmHg, \n−15.0/−10.6 mmHg with 40 mg/5 mg, 80 mg/5 mg versus −6.2/−5.7 mmHg, −11.1/−8.0 mmHg with \namlodipine 5 mg and 10 mg and higher diastolic blood pressure control rates compared to the \nrespective monotherapies were achieved (56.7 %, 63.8 % with 40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg versus \n42 %, 56.7 % with amlodipine 5 mg and 10 mg). Oedema rates were significantly lower with \n40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg compared to amlodipine 10 mg (4.4% versus 24.9 %, respectively). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n66 \n\n \nIn another multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group study, a total of \n947 patients with mild to severe hypertension who were not adequately controlled on amlodipine \n10 mg received Onduarp (40 mg/10 mg or 80 mg/10 mg) or amlodipine alone (10 mg). After 8 weeks \nof treatment, each of the combination treatments was statistically significantly superior to amlodipine \nmonotherapy in reducing diastolic and systolic blood pressure (−11.1/−9.2 mmHg, −11.3/ −9.3 mmHg \nwith 40 mg/10 mg, 80 mg/10 mg versus −7.4/−6.5 mmHg with amlodipine 10 mg) and higher diastolic \nblood pressure normalisation rates compared to monotherapy were achieved (63.7 %, 66.5 % with \n40 mg/10 mg, 80 mg/10 mg versus 51.1 % with amlodipine 10 mg). \n \nIn two corresponding open-label long-term follow up studies performed over a further 6 months the \neffect of Onduarp was maintained over the trial period. Furthermore it was shown that some patients \nnot adequately controlled with Onduarp 40 mg/10 mg had additional blood pressure reduction by up-\ntitration to Onduarp 80 mg/10 mg. \n \nThe overall incidence of adverse reactions with Onduarp in the clinical trial programme was low with \nonly 12.7 % of patients on treatment experiencing adverse reactions. The most common adverse \nreactions were peripheral oedema and dizziness, see also section 4.8. The adverse reactions reported \nwere in agreement with those anticipated from the safety profiles of the components telmisartan and \namlodipine. No new or more severe adverse reactions were observed. The oedema related events \n(peripheral oedema, generalised oedema, and oedema) were consistently lower in patients who \nreceived Onduarp as compared to patients who received amlodipine 10 mg. In the factorial design trial \nthe oedema rates were 1.3% with Onduarp 40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg, 8.8 % with Onduarp \n40 mg/10 mg and 80 mg/10 mg and 18.4 % with Amlodipine 10 mg. In patients not controlled on \namlodipine 5 mg the oedema rates were 4.4 % for 40 mg/5 mg and 80 mg/5 mg and 24.9 % for \namlodipine 10 mg. \n \nThe antihypertensive effect of Onduarp was similar irrespective of age and gender, and was similar in \npatients with and without diabetes. \n \nOnduarp has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension. Telmisartan has been \nstudied in a large outcome study in 25,620 patients with high cardiovascular risk (ONTARGET). \nAmlodipine has been studied in patients with chronic stable angina, vasospastic angina and \nangiographically documented coronary artery disease. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nOnduarp in all subsets of the paediatric population in hypertension (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPharmacokinetic of the fixed dose combination (FDC) \nThe rate and extent of absorption of Onduarp are equivalent to the bioavailability of telmisartan and \namlodipine when administered as individual tablets. \n \nAbsorption \nAbsorption of telmisartan is rapid although the amount absorbed varies. The mean absolute \nbioavailability for telmisartan is about 50 %. When telmisartan is taken with food, the reduction in the \narea under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) of telmisartan varies from approximately \n6 % (40 mg dose) to approximately 19 % (160 mg dose). By 3 hours after administration, plasma \nconcentrations are similar whether telmisartan is taken fasting or with food.  \n \nAfter oral administration of therapeutic doses, amlodipine is well absorbed with peak blood levels \nbetween 6-12 hours post dose. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64 and 80 %. \nAmlodipine bioavailability is not affected by food ingestion. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n67 \n\nDistribution \nTelmisartan is largely bound to plasma protein (>99.5 %), mainly albumin and alpha-1 acid \nglycoprotein. The mean steady state apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) is approximately 500 l. \n \nThe volume of distribution of amlodipine is approximately 21 l/kg. In vitro studies have shown that \napproximately 97.5 % of circulating amlodipine is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients. \n \nBiotransformation \nTelmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide of the parent compound. No \npharmacological activity has been shown for the conjugate.  \n \nAmlodipine is extensively (approximatively 90 %) metabolised by the liver to inactive metabolites. \n \nElimination \nTelmisartan is characterised by biexponential decay pharmacokinetics with a terminal elimination \nhalf-life of >20 hours. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and, to a smaller extent, the area \nunder the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), increase disproportionately with dose. There is no \nevidence of clinically relevant accumulation of telmisartan taken at the recommended dose. Plasma \nconcentrations were higher in females than in males, without relevant influence on efficacy. \n \nAfter oral (and intravenous) administration, telmisartan is nearly exclusively excreted with the faeces, \nmainly as unchanged compound. Cumulative urinary excretion is <1 % of dose. Total plasma \nclearance (Cltot) is high (approximately 1,000 ml/min) compared with hepatic blood flow (about \n1,500 ml/min). \n \nAmlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of \napproximately 30 to 50 hours consistent with once daily dosing. Steady-state plasma levels are \nreached after continuous administration for 7-8 days. Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60 % of \namlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine.  \n \nLinearity/non-linearity  \nThe small reduction in AUC for telmisartan is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic \nefficacy. There is no linear relationship between doses and plasma levels. Cmax and to a lesser extent \nAUC increase disproportionately at doses above 40 mg. \n \nAmlodipine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population (age below 18 years) \nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population. \n \nGender \nDifferences in plasma concentrations of telmisartan were observed, with Cmax and AUC being \napproximately 3-  and 2-fold higher, respectively, in females compared to males. \n \nElderly \nThe pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ in young and elderly patients. \nThe time to reach peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine is similar in elderly and younger subjects. \nIn elderly patients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline with resulting increases in AUC and \nelimination half-life. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with mild to moderate and severe renal impairment, doubling of plasma concentrations of \ntelmisartan was observed. However, lower plasma concentrations were observed in patients with renal \ninsufficiency undergoing dialysis. Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma protein in renal-insufficient \nsubjects and cannot be removed by dialysis. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n68 \n\nrenal impairment. The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal \nimpairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nPharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute \nbioavailability of telmisartan up to nearly 100 %. The elimination half-life of telmisartan is not \nchanged in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased \nclearance of amlodipine with resulting increase of approximately 40-60 % in AUC. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSince the non-clinical toxicity profiles of telmisartan and amlodipine are not overlapping, no \nexacerbation of toxicity was expected for the combination. This has been confirmed in a subchronic \n(13-week) toxicology study in rats, in which dose levels of 3.2/0.8, 10/2.5 and 40/10 mg/kg of \ntelmisartan and amlodipine were tested. \n \nPreclinical data available for the components of this fixed dose combination are reported below. \n \nTelmisartan \nIn preclinical safety studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic \nrange caused reduced red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes in renal \nhaemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), as well as increased serum potassium \nin normotensive animals. In dogs, renal tubular dilation and atrophy were observed. Gastric mucosal \ninjury (erosion, ulcers or inflammation) also was noted in rats and dogs. These pharmacologically-\nmediated undesirable effects, known from preclinical studies with both angiotensin converting enzyme \ninhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, were prevented by oral saline supplementation. In \nboth species, increased plasma renin activity and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the renal juxtaglomerular \ncells were observed. These changes, also a class effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors \nand other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, do not appear to have clinical significance. \nNo clear evidence of a teratogenic effect was observed, however at toxic dose levels of telmisartan an \neffect on the postnatal development of the offsprings such as lower body weight and delayed eye \nopening was observed. \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no \nevidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice. \n \nAmlodipine \nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. \nIn reproductive toxicity studies in rats, delayed parturition, difficult labour and impaired fetal and pup \nsurvival were seen at high doses. There was no effect on the fertility of rats treated orally with \namlodipine maleate (males for 64 days and females for 14 days prior to mating) at doses of up to \n10 mg amlodipine/kg/day (about 10 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose of 10 mg/day on \nan mg/m2 basis).  \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any of the side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What Onduarp is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Onduarp \n3. How to take Onduarp \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Onduarp \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Onduarp is and what it is used for \n \nOnduarp tablets contain two active substances called telmisartan and amlodipine. Both of these \nsubstances help to control your high blood pressure: \n- Telmisartan belongs to a group of substances called “angiotensin-II receptor antagonists”. \nAngiotensin II is a substance produced in the body which causes blood vessels to narrow, thus \nincreasing blood pressure. Telmisartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II. \n- Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called “calcium channel blockers”. Amlodipine stops \ncalcium from moving into the blood vessel wall which stops the blood vessels from tightening. \nThis means that both of these active substances work together to help stop your blood vessels \ntightening. As a result, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered. \n \nOnduarp is used to treat high blood pressure \n- in adult patients whose blood pressure is not controlled enough with amlodipine. \n- in adult patients who already receive telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets and who wish \nto take instead the same doses in one tablet for convenience. \n \nHigh blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which puts patients at \nrisk of serious events such as heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness. There are \nusually no symptoms of high blood pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly \nmeasure blood pressure to verify if it is within the normal range. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Onduarp \n\n \nDo not take Onduarp \n \n• if you are allergic to telmisartan or amlodipine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n• if you are allergic to other medicines of the dihydropyridine type (one type of calcium channel \n\nblocker). \n• if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Onduarp in early pregnancy – \n\nsee Warnings and precautions and Pregnancy section.) \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n98 \n\n• if you have severe liver problems or biliary obstruction (problems with drainage of the bile from \nthe liver and gall bladder). \n\n• if you suffer from severe low blood pressure (including shock). \n• if you suffer from low heart output because of a serious heart problem. \n• if you have diabetes mellitus or impaired kidney function and you are treated with Rasilez. \n \nIf any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Onduarp. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of the following conditions or \nillnesses: \n \n• Kidney disease or kidney transplant. \n• Narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys (renal artery stenosis). \n• Liver disease. \n• Heart trouble. \n• Raised aldosterone levels (which lead to water and salt retention in the body along with \n\nimbalance of various blood minerals). \n• Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body \n\nwater) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy (‘water tablets’), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, \nor vomiting. \n\n• Elevated potassium levels in your blood. \n• Diabetes. \n• Narrowing of the aorta (aortic stenosis). \n• Heart-associated chest pain also at rest or with minimal effort (unstable angina pectoris). \n• A heart attack within the last four weeks. \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Onduarp:  \n• if you are taking Rasilez, a medicine used to treat high blood pressure. \n• if you are taking digoxin. \n \nIn case of surgery or anaesthesia, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Onduarp. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe use of Onduarp in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended.  \n \nOther medicines and Onduarp \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Your doctor may need to change the dose of these other medicines or take other \nprecautions. In some cases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially \nto the medicines listed below taken at the same time with Onduarp: \n \n• Lithium-containing medicines to treat some types of depression. \n• Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, potassium-sparing diuretics (certain ‘water tablets’). \n• ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, renin inhibitors. \n• NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. acetylsalicylic acid or ibuprofen), \n\nheparin, immunosuppressives (e.g. cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and the antibiotic trimethoprim. \n• Rifampicin, St. John’s wort. \n• Medicines used for HIV/AIDS (e.g. ritonavir) or for treatment of fungal infections (e.g. \n\nketoconazole). \n• Erythromycin (antibiotic). \n• Diltiazem (cardiac medicine). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n99 \n\n• Simvastatin to treat elevated levels of cholesterol. \n• Rasilez, a medicine used to treat high blood pressure. \n• Digoxin. \n \nAs with other blood pressure lowering medicines, the effect of Onduarp may be reduced when you \ntake NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. acetylsalicylic acid or ibuprofen) or \ncorticosteroids. \n \nOnduarp may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high blood \npressure or of medicines with blood pressure lowering potential (e.g. baclofen, amifostine, \nneuroleptics or antidepressants). Furthermore low blood pressure may be aggravated by alcohol. You \nmay notice this as dizziness when standing up. \n \nOnduarp with food and drink \n \nSee section 3. \n \nGrapefruit juice and grapefruit should not be consumed when you take Onduarp. This is because \ngrapefruit and grapefruit juice may lead to increased blood levels of the active ingredient amlodipine \nin some patients and may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of Onduarp. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally \nadvise you to stop taking Onduarp before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are \npregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Onduarp. Onduarp is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may \ncause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Onduarp is not \nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for \nyou if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nSome people may experience side effects such as fainting, sleepiness, dizziness or a feeling of \nspinning (vertigo) when they are treated for high blood pressure. If you experience these side effects, \ndo not drive or use machines. \n \nOnduarp contains sorbitol.  \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, consult your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Onduarp \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  \n \nThe recommended dose is one tablet a day. Try to take the tablet at the same time each day. \nRemove your Onduarp tablet from the blister only directly prior to intake. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n100 \n\nYou can take Onduarp with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed with some water or \nother non-alcoholic drink. \n \nIf your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed one 40 mg/5 mg tablet or one \n40 mg/10 mg tablet per day. \n \nIf you take more Onduarp than you should \nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or your nearest hospital \nemergency department immediately. You might experience low blood pressure and rapid heart beat. \nSlow heart beat, dizziness, reduced kidney function including kidney failure, marked and prolonged \nlow blood pressure including shock and death have also been reported. \n \nIf you forget to take Onduarp \nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember and then carry on as before. If you do not \ntake your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a double dose to make \nup for forgotten individual doses. \n \nIf you stop taking Onduarp \nIt is important that you take Onduarp every day until your doctor tells you otherwise. If you have the \nimpression that the effect of Onduarp is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nSome side effects can be serious and need immediate medical attention: \n \nYou should see your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms: \n \nSepsis (often called \"blood poisoning\", is a severe infection with whole-body inflammatory response), \nrapid swelling of the skin and mucosa (angioedema); these side effects are rare (may affect up to 1 in \n1,000 people) but are extremely serious and patients should stop taking the medicine and see their \ndoctor immediately.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any of the side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What Onduarp is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Onduarp \n3. How to take Onduarp \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Onduarp \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Onduarp is and what it is used for \n \nOnduarp tablets contain two active substances called telmisartan and amlodipine. Both of these \nsubstances help to control your high blood pressure: \n- Telmisartan belongs to a group of substances called “angiotensin-II receptor antagonists”. \nAngiotensin II is a substance produced in the body which causes blood vessels to narrow, thus \nincreasing blood pressure. Telmisartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II. \n- Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called “calcium channel blockers”. Amlodipine stops \ncalcium from moving into the blood vessel wall which stops the blood vessels from tightening. \nThis means that both of these active substances work together to help stop your blood vessels \ntightening. As a result, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered. \n \nOnduarp is used to treat high blood pressure \n- in adult patients whose blood pressure is not controlled enough with amlodipine. \n- in adult patients who already receive telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets and who wish \nto take instead the same doses in one tablet for convenience. \n \nHigh blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which puts patients at \nrisk of serious events such as heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness. There are \nusually no symptoms of high blood pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly \nmeasure blood pressure to verify if it is within the normal range. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Onduarp \n\n \nDo not take Onduarp \n \n• if you are allergic to telmisartan or amlodipine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n• if you are allergic to other medicines of the dihydropyridine type (one type of calcium channel \n\nblocker). \n• if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Onduarp in early pregnancy – \n\nsee Warnings and precautions and Pregnancy section.) \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n106 \n\n• if you have severe liver problems or biliary obstruction (problems with drainage of the bile from \nthe liver and gall bladder). \n\n• if you suffer from severe low blood pressure (including shock). \n• if you suffer from low heart output because of a serious heart problem. \n• if you have diabetes mellitus or impaired kidney function and you are treated with Rasilez. \n \nIf any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Onduarp. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of the following conditions or \nillnesses: \n \n• Kidney disease or kidney transplant. \n• Narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys (renal artery stenosis). \n• Liver disease. \n• Heart trouble. \n• Raised aldosterone levels (which lead to water and salt retention in the body along with \n\nimbalance of various blood minerals). \n• Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body \n\nwater) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy (‘water tablets’), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, \nor vomiting. \n\n• Elevated potassium levels in your blood. \n• Diabetes. \n• Narrowing of the aorta (aortic stenosis). \n• Heart-associated chest pain also at rest or with minimal effort (unstable angina pectoris). \n• A heart attack within the last four weeks. \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Onduarp: \n• if you are taking Rasilez, a medicine used to treat high blood pressure. \n• if you are taking digoxin. \n \nIn case of surgery or anaesthesia, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Onduarp.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe use of Onduarp in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended.  \n \nOther medicines and Onduarp \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Your doctor may need to change the dose of these other medicines or take other \nprecautions. In some cases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially \nto the medicines listed below taken at the same time with Onduarp: \n \n• Lithium-containing medicines to treat some types of depression. \n• Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, potassium-sparing diuretics (certain ‘water tablets’). \n• ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, renin inhibitors. \n• NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. acetylsalicylic acid or ibuprofen), \n\nheparin, immunosuppressives (e.g. cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and the antibiotic trimethoprim. \n• Rifampicin, St. John’s wort. \n• Medicines used for HIV/AIDS (e.g. ritonavir) or for treatment of fungal infections (e.g. \n\nketoconazole). \n• Erythromycin (antibiotic). \n• Diltiazem (cardiac medicine). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n107 \n\n• Simvastatin to treat elevated levels of cholesterol. \n• Rasilez, a medicine used to treat high blood pressure. \n• Digoxin. \n \nAs with other blood pressure lowering medicines, the effect of Onduarp may be reduced when you \ntake NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. acetylsalicylic acid or ibuprofen) or \ncorticosteroids. \n \nOnduarp may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high blood \npressure or of medicines with blood pressure lowering potential (e.g. baclofen, amifostine, \nneuroleptics or antidepressants). Furthermore low blood pressure may be aggravated by alcohol. You \nmay notice this as dizziness when standing up. \n \nOnduarp with food and drink \n \nSee section 3. \n \nGrapefruit juice and grapefruit should not be consumed when you take Onduarp. This is because \ngrapefruit and grapefruit juice may lead to increased blood levels of the active ingredient amlodipine \nin some patients and may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of Onduarp. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally \nadvise you to stop taking Onduarp before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are \npregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Onduarp. Onduarp is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may \ncause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Onduarp is not \nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for \nyou if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nSome people may experience side effects such as fainting, sleepiness, dizziness or a feeling of \nspinning (vertigo) when they are treated for high blood pressure. If you experience these side effects, \ndo not drive or use machines. \n \nOnduarp contains sorbitol.  \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, consult your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Onduarp \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  \n \nThe recommended dose is one tablet a day. Try to take the tablet at the same time each day. \nRemove your Onduarp tablet from the blister only directly prior to intake. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n108 \n\nYou can take Onduarp with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed with some water or \nother non-alcoholic drink. \n \nIf your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed one 40 mg/5 mg tablet or one \n40 mg/10 mg tablet per day. \n \nIf you take more Onduarp than you should \nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or your nearest hospital \nemergency department immediately. You might experience low blood pressure and rapid heart beat. \nSlow heart beat, dizziness, reduced kidney function including kidney failure, marked and prolonged \nlow blood pressure including shock and death have also been reported. \n \nIf you forget to take Onduarp \nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember and then carry on as before. If you do not \ntake your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a double dose to make \nup for forgotten individual doses. \n \nIf you stop taking Onduarp \nIt is important that you take Onduarp every day until your doctor tells you otherwise. If you have the \nimpression that the effect of Onduarp is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nSome side effects can be serious and need immediate medical attention: \n \nYou should see your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms: \n \nSepsis (often called \"blood poisoning\", is a severe infection with whole-body inflammatory response), \nrapid swelling of the skin and mucosa (angioedema); these side effects are rare (may affect up to 1 in \n1,000 people) but are extremely serious and patients should stop taking the medicine and see their \ndoctor immediately. If these effects are not treated they could be fatal.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any of the side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

What you need to know before you take Onduarp \n3. How to take Onduarp \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Onduarp \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Onduarp is and what it is used for \n \nOnduarp tablets contain two active substances called telmisartan and amlodipine. Both of these \nsubstances help to control your high blood pressure: \n- Telmisartan belongs to a group of substances called “angiotensin-II receptor antagonists”. \nAngiotensin II is a substance produced in the body which causes blood vessels to narrow, thus \nincreasing blood pressure. Telmisartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II. \n- Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called “calcium channel blockers”. Amlodipine stops \ncalcium from moving into the blood vessel wall which stops the blood vessels from tightening. \nThis means that both of these active substances work together to help stop your blood vessels \ntightening. As a result, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered. \n \nOnduarp is used to treat high blood pressure \n- in adult patients whose blood pressure is not controlled enough with amlodipine. \n- in adult patients who already receive telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets and who wish \nto take instead the same doses in one tablet for convenience. \n \nHigh blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which puts patients at \nrisk of serious events such as heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness. There are \nusually no symptoms of high blood pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly \nmeasure blood pressure to verify if it is within the normal range. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Onduarp \n\n \nDo not take Onduarp \n• if you are allergic to telmisartan or amlodipine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n• if you are allergic to other medicines of the dihydropyridine type (one type of calcium channel \n\nblocker). \n• if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Onduarp in early pregnancy – \n\nsee Warnings and precautions and Pregnancy section.) \n• if you have severe liver problems or biliary obstruction (problems with drainage of the bile from \n\nthe liver and gall bladder). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n114 \n\n• if you suffer from severe low blood pressure (including shock). \n• if you suffer from low heart output because of a serious heart problem. \n• if you have diabetes mellitus or impaired kidney function and you are treated with Rasilez. \n \nIf any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Onduarp. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of the following conditions or \nillnesses: \n \n• Kidney disease or kidney transplant. \n• Narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys (renal artery stenosis). \n• Liver disease. \n• Heart trouble. \n• Raised aldosterone levels (which lead to water and salt retention in the body along with \n\nimbalance of various blood minerals). \n• Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body \n\nwater) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy (‘water tablets’), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, \nor vomiting. \n\n• Elevated potassium levels in your blood. \n• Diabetes. \n• Narrowing of the aorta (aortic stenosis). \n• Heart-associated chest pain also at rest or with minimal effort (unstable angina pectoris). \n• A heart attack within the last four weeks. \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Onduarp: \n• if you are taking Rasilez, a medicine used to treat high blood pressure. \n• if you are taking digoxin. \n \nIn case of surgery or anaesthesia, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Onduarp.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe use of Onduarp in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended.  \n \nOther medicines and Onduarp \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Your doctor may need to change the dose of these other medicines or take other \nprecautions. In some cases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially \nto the medicines listed below taken at the same time with Onduarp: \n \n• Lithium-containing medicines to treat some types of depression. \n• Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, potassium-sparing diuretics (certain ‘water tablets’). \n• ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, renin inhibitors. \n• NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. acetylsalicylic acid or ibuprofen), \n\nheparin, immunosuppressives (e.g. cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and the antibiotic trimethoprim. \n• Rifampicin, St. John’s wort. \n• Medicines used for HIV/AIDS (e.g. ritonavir) or for treatment of fungal infections (e.g. \n\nketoconazole). \n• Erythromycin (antibiotic). \n• Diltiazem (cardiac medicine). \n• Simvastatin to treat elevated levels of cholesterol. \n• Rasilez, a medicine used to treat high blood pressure. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n115 \n\n• Digoxin. \n \nAs with other blood pressure lowering medicines, the effect of Onduarp may be reduced when you \ntake NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. acetylsalicylic acid or ibuprofen) or \ncorticosteroids. \n \nOnduarp may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high blood \npressure or of medicines with blood pressure lowering potential (e.g. baclofen, amifostine, \nneuroleptics or antidepressants). Furthermore low blood pressure may be aggravated by alcohol. You \nmay notice this as dizziness when standing up. \n \nOnduarp with food and drink \n \nSee section 3. \n \nGrapefruit juice and grapefruit should not be consumed when you take Onduarp. This is because \ngrapefruit and grapefruit juice may lead to increased blood levels of the active ingredient amlodipine \nin some patients and may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of Onduarp. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally \nadvise you to stop taking Onduarp before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are \npregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Onduarp. Onduarp is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may \ncause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Onduarp is not \nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for \nyou if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nSome people may experience side effects such as fainting, sleepiness, dizziness or a feeling of \nspinning (vertigo) when they are treated for high blood pressure. If you experience these side effects, \ndo not drive or use machines. \n \nOnduarp contains sorbitol.  \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, consult your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Onduarp \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  \n \nThe recommended dose is one tablet a day. Try to take the tablet at the same time each day. \nRemove your Onduarp tablet from the blister only directly prior to intake. \n \nYou can take Onduarp with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed with some water or \nother non-alcoholic drink. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n116 \n\n \nIf your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed one 40 mg/5 mg tablet or one \n40 mg/10 mg tablet per day. \n \nIf you take more Onduarp than you should \nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or your nearest hospital \nemergency department immediately. You might experience low blood pressure and rapid heart beat. \nSlow heart beat, dizziness, reduced kidney function including kidney failure, marked and prolonged \nlow blood pressure including shock and death have also been reported. \n \nIf you forget to take Onduarp \nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember and then carry on as before. If you do not \ntake your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a double dose to make \nup for forgotten individual doses. \n \nIf you stop taking Onduarp \nIt is important that you take Onduarp every day until your doctor tells you otherwise. If you have the \nimpression that the effect of Onduarp is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any of the side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What Onduarp is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Onduarp \n3. How to take Onduarp \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Onduarp \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Onduarp is and what it is used for \n \nOnduarp tablets contain two active substances called telmisartan and amlodipine. Both of these \nsubstances help to control your high blood pressure: \n- Telmisartan belongs to a group of substances called “angiotensin-II receptor antagonists”. \nAngiotensin II is a substance produced in the body which causes blood vessels to narrow, thus \nincreasing blood pressure. Telmisartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II. \n- Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called “calcium channel blockers”. Amlodipine stops \ncalcium from moving into the blood vessel wall which stops the blood vessels from tightening. \nThis means that both of these active substances work together to help stop your blood vessels \ntightening. As a result, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered. \n \nOnduarp is used to treat high blood pressure \n- in adult patients whose blood pressure is not controlled enough with amlodipine. \n- in adult patients who already receive telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets and who wish \nto take instead the same doses in one tablet for convenience. \n \nHigh blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which puts patients at \nrisk of serious events such as heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness. There are \nusually no symptoms of high blood pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly \nmeasure blood pressure to verify if it is within the normal range. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Onduarp \n\n \nDo not take Onduarp \n \n• if you are allergic to telmisartan or amlodipine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n• if you are allergic to other medicines of the dihydropyridine type (one type of calcium channel \n\nblocker). \n• if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Onduarp in early pregnancy – \n\nsee Warnings and precautions and Pregnancy section.) \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n122 \n\n• if you have severe liver problems or biliary obstruction (problems with drainage of the bile from \nthe liver and gall bladder). \n\n• if you suffer from severe low blood pressure (including shock). \n• if you suffer from low heart output because of a serious heart problem. \n• if you have diabetes mellitus or impaired kidney function and you are treated with Rasilez. \n \nIf any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Onduarp. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of the following conditions or \nillnesses: \n \n• Kidney disease or kidney transplant. \n• Narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys (renal artery stenosis). \n• Liver disease. \n• Heart trouble. \n• Raised aldosterone levels (which lead to water and salt retention in the body along with \n\nimbalance of various blood minerals). \n• Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body \n\nwater) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy (‘water tablets’), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, \nor vomiting. \n\n• Elevated potassium levels in your blood. \n• Diabetes. \n• Narrowing of the aorta (aortic stenosis). \n• Heart-associated chest pain also at rest or with minimal effort (unstable angina pectoris). \n• A heart attack within the last four weeks. \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Onduarp: \n• if you are taking Rasilez, a medicine used to treat high blood pressure. \n• if you are taking digoxin. \n \nIn case of surgery or anaesthesia, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Onduarp.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe use of Onduarp in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended.  \n \nOther medicines and Onduarp \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Your doctor may need to change the dose of these other medicines or take other \nprecautions. In some cases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially \nto the medicines listed below taken at the same time with Onduarp: \n \n• Lithium-containing medicines to treat some types of depression. \n• Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, potassium-sparing diuretics (certain ‘water tablets’). \n• ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, renin inhibitors. \n• NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. acetylsalicylic acid or ibuprofen), \n\nheparin, immunosuppressives (e.g. cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and the antibiotic trimethoprim. \n• Rifampicin, St. John’s wort. \n• Medicines used for HIV/AIDS (e.g. ritonavir) or for treatment of fungal infections (e.g. \n\nketoconazole). \n• Erythromycin (antibiotic). \n• Diltiazem (cardiac medicine). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n123 \n\n• Simvastatin to treat elevated levels of cholesterol. \n• Rasilez, a medicine used to treat high blood pressure. \n• Digoxin. \n \nAs with other blood pressure lowering medicines, the effect of Onduarp may be reduced when you \ntake NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. acetylsalicylic acid or ibuprofen) or \ncorticosteroids. \n \nOnduarp may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high blood \npressure or of medicines with blood pressure lowering potential (e.g. baclofen, amifostine, \nneuroleptics or antidepressants). Furthermore low blood pressure may be aggravated by alcohol. You \nmay notice this as dizziness when standing up. \n \nOnduarp with food and drink \n \nSee section 3. \n \nGrapefruit juice and grapefruit should not be consumed when you take Onduarp. This is because \ngrapefruit and grapefruit juice may lead to increased blood levels of the active ingredient amlodipine \nin some patients and may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of Onduarp. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally \nadvise you to stop taking Onduarp before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are \npregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Onduarp. Onduarp is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may \ncause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Onduarp is not \nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for \nyou if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nSome people may experience side effects such as fainting, sleepiness, dizziness or a feeling of \nspinning (vertigo) when they are treated for high blood pressure. If you experience these side effects, \ndo not drive or use machines. \n \nOnduarp contains sorbitol.  \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, consult your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Onduarp \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.  \n \nThe recommended dose is one tablet a day. Try to take the tablet at the same time each day. \nRemove your Onduarp tablet from the blister only directly prior to intake. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n124 \n\nYou can take Onduarp with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed with some water or \nother non-alcoholic drink. \n \nIf your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed one 40 mg/5 mg tablet or one \n40 mg/10 mg tablet per day. \n \nIf you take more Onduarp than you should \nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or your nearest hospital \nemergency department immediately. You might experience low blood pressure and rapid heart beat. \nSlow heart beat, dizziness, reduced kidney function including kidney failure, marked and prolonged \nlow blood pressure including shock and death have also been reported. \n \nIf you forget to take Onduarp \nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember and then carry on as before. If you do not \ntake your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a double dose to make \nup for forgotten individual doses. \n \nIf you stop taking Onduarp \nIt is important that you take Onduarp every day until your doctor tells you otherwise. If you have the \nimpression that the effect of Onduarp is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
