This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nAJOVY 225 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \nAJOVY 225 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne pre-filled syringe contains 225 mg fremanezumab. \nOne pre-filled pen contains 225 mg fremanezumab. \n \nFremanezumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells \nby recombinant DNA technology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) \n \nClear to opalescent, colourless to slightly yellow solution with a pH of 5.5 and an osmolality of \n300-450 mOsm/kg. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAJOVY is indicated for prophylaxis of migraine in adults who have at least 4 migraine days per \nmonth. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe treatment should be initiated by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of \nmigraine. \n \nPosology \n \nTreatment is intended for patients with at least 4 migraine days per month when initiating treatment \nwith fremanezumab. \n \nTwo dosing options are available: \n\n\u2022 225 mg once monthly (monthly dosing) or \n\u2022 675 mg every three months (quarterly dosing) \n\n \nWhen switching dosing regimens, the first dose of the new regimen should be administered on the \nnext scheduled dosing date of the prior regimen.  \n \nWhen initiating treatment with fremanezumab, concomitant migraine preventive treatment may be \ncontinued if considered necessary by the prescriber (see section 5.1). \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n \nThe treatment benefit should be assessed within 3 months after initiation of treatment. Any further \ndecision to continue treatment should be taken on an individual patient basis. Evaluation of the need to \ncontinue treatment is recommended regularly thereafter. \n \nMissed dose \nIf a fremanezumab injection is missed on the planned date, dosing should resume as soon as possible \non the indicated dose and regimen. A double dose must not be administered to make up for a missed \ndose. \n \nSpecial Populations \n \nElderly \nThere is limited data available on the use of fremanezumab in patients \u226565 years of age. Based on the \nresults of population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment or hepatic \nimpairment (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of AJOVY in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have not yet \nbeen established. No data are available.  \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nSubcutaneous use. \n \nAJOVY is for subcutaneous injection only. It should not be administered by the intravenous or \nintramuscular route. AJOVY can be injected into areas of the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm that are \nnot tender, bruised, red, or indurated. For multiple injections, injection sites should be alternated. \n \nPatients may self-inject if instructed in subcutaneous self-injection technique by a healthcare \nprofessional. For further instructions on administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nHypersensitivity reactions such as rash, pruritus, urticaria and swelling have been reported \nuncommonly with fremanezumab (see section 4.8). Most reactions were reported from within hours to \none month after administration and were mild to moderate, but some led to discontinuation or required \ncorticosteroid treatment. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinuation of fremanezumab \nadministration should be considered and appropriate therapy should be initiated. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nMajor cardiovascular diseases \n \nPatients with certain major cardiovascular diseases were excluded from clinical studies (see \nsection 5.1). No safety data are available in these patients. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., is essentially \n\u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal clinical drug interaction studies have been performed with AJOVY. No pharmacokinetic \ndrug interactions are expected based on the characteristics of fremanezumab. Furthermore, \nconcomitant use of acute migraine treatments (specifically analgesics, ergots, and triptans) and \nmigraine preventive medicinal products during the clinical studies did not affect the pharmacokinetics \nof fremanezumab. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is a limited amount of data from the use of AJOVY in pregnant women. Animal studies do not \nindicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a \nprecautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of AJOVY during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether fremanezumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgG is known to be excreted \nin breast milk during the first days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon \nafterwards; consequently, a risk to breast-fed infants cannot be excluded during this short period. \nAfterwards, use of fremanezumab could be considered during breast-feeding only if clinically needed. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no fertility data in humans. Available non-clinical data do not suggest an effect on fertility \n(see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAJOVY has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nA total of over 2,500 patients (more than 1,900 patient years) have been treated with AJOVY in \nregistration studies. More than 1,400 patients were treated for at least 12 months. \n \nCommonly reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were local reactions at the injection site \n(pain [24%], induration [17%], erythema [16%] and pruritus [2%]). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nADRs from clinical studies are presented according to MedDRA system organ classification. Within \neach frequency grouping, ADRs are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness. Frequency \ncategories are based on the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000). Within each \nsystem organ class, ADRs are ranked by frequency, most frequent reactions first. \n \nThe following ADRs have been identified in the AJOVY clinical development programme (Table 1).  \n \nTable 1: Adverse reactions in clinical studies \n\nMedDRA System Organ Class Frequency Adverse Reaction \nImmune system disorders Uncommon Hypersensitivity reactions such \n\nas rash, pruritus, urticaria and \nswelling \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nVery common Injection site pain \nInjection site induration \nInjection site erythema \n\nCommon Injection site pruritus \nUncommon Injection site rash \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInjection site reactions \nThe most frequently observed local reactions at the injection site were pain, induration and erythema. \nAll local injection site reactions were transient and predominantly mild to moderate in severity. Pain, \ninduration and erythema were typically observed immediately after injection while pruritus and rash \nappeared within a median of 24 and 48 hours, respectively. All injection site reactions resolved, \nmostly within a few hours or days. Injection site reactions generally did not necessitate discontinuation \nof the medicinal product. \n \nImmunogenicity \nIn placebo-controlled studies, 0.4 % of patients (6 out of 1,701) treated with fremanezumab developed \nanti-drug antibodies (ADA). The antibody responses were of low titer. One of these 6 patients \ndeveloped neutralising antibodies. With 12 months of treatment, ADA were detected in 2.3% of the \npatients (43 out of 1,888) with 0.95% of the patients developing neutralising antibodies. The safety \nand efficacy of fremanezumab were not affected by ADA development. \n  \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDoses up to 2,000 mg have been administered intravenously in clinical trials without dose-limiting \ntoxicity. In case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or \nsymptoms of adverse effects and given appropriate symptomatic treatment if necessary. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Not yet assigned. ATC code: Not yet assigned. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nFremanezumab is a humanised IgG2\u0394a/kappa monoclonal antibody derived from a murine precursor. \nFremanezumab selectively binds the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) ligand and blocks both \nCGRP isoforms (\u03b1-and \u03b2-CGRP) from binding to the CGRP receptor. While the precise mechanism of \naction by which fremanezumab prevents migraine attacks is unknown, it is believed that prevention of \nmigraine is obtained by its effect modulating the trigeminal system. CGRP levels have been shown to \nincrease significantly during migraine and return to normal with headache relief. \n \nFremanezumab is highly specific for CGRP and does not bind to closely related family members (e.g., \namylin, calcitonin, intermedin and adrenomedullin). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy of fremanezumab was assessed in two randomised, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled phase III studies in adult patients with episodic (Study 1) and chronic migraine (Study 2). \nThe patients enrolled had at least a 12-month history of migraine (with and without aura) according to \nthe International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-III) diagnostic criteria. Elderly patients \n(>70 years), patients using opioids or barbiturates on more than 4 days per month, and patients with \npre-existing myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and thromboembolic events were \nexcluded. \n \nEpisodic migraine study (Study 1) \nThe efficacy of fremanezumab was evaluated in episodic migraine in a randomised, multicentre, \n12-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind study (Study 1). Adults with a history of episodic migraine \n(less than 15 headache days per month) were included in the study. A total of 875 patients \n(742 females, 133 males) were randomised into one of three arms: 675 mg fremanezumab every three \nmonths (quarterly, n=291), 225 mg fremanezumab once a month (monthly, n=290), or monthly \nadministration of placebo (n=294) administered via subcutaneous injection. Demographics and \nbaseline disease characteristics were balanced and comparable between the study arms. Patients had a \nmedian age of 42 years (range: 18 to 70 years), 85% were female, and 80% were white. The mean \nmigraine frequency at baseline was approximately 9 migraine days per month. Patients were allowed \nto use acute headache treatments during the study. A sub-set of patients (21%) was also allowed to use \none commonly used concomitant, preventive medicinal product (beta-blockers, calcium channel \nblocker/benzocycloheptene, antidepressants, anticonvulsants). Overall, 19% of the patients had \npreviously used topiramate. A total of 791 patients completed the 12-week double-blind treatment \nperiod. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in the monthly average number of \nmigraine days during the 12-week treatment period. Key secondary endpoints were the achievement of \nat least 50% reduction from baseline in monthly migraine days (50% responder rate), mean change \nfrom baseline in the patient reported MIDAS score, and change from baseline in monthly average \nnumber of days of acute headache medicinal product use. Both monthly and quarterly dosing regimens \nof fremanezumab demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement from \nbaseline compared to placebo for key endpoints (see Table 2). The effect also occurred from as early \nas the first month and sustained over the treatment period (see Figure 1). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nFigure 1: Mean Change from Baseline in the Monthly Average Number of Migraine Days for \nStudy 1 \n\n<0.0001\n<0.0001\n\n<0.0001\n<0.0001\n\n0.0003\n<0.0001\n\n<0.0001\n<0.0001\n\n0.0009\n<0.0001\n\n0.0013\n0.0002\n\nAJOVY Quarterly\nAJOVY Monthly\n\nBaseline Week 1 Week 2 Week 3 Month 1 Month 2 Month 3Visit:\n\n-4.5\n\n-4.0\n\n-3.5\n\n-3.0\n\n-2.5\n\n-2.0\n\n-1.5\n\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\nLS\n M\n\nea\nn \n\n(+\n/- \n\nSE\n) C\n\nha\nng\n\ne \nfr\n\nom\n B\n\nas\nel\n\nin\ne\n\nAJOVY MonthlyAJOVY QuarterlyPlacebo\n\n \nMean at baseline (monthly average number of migraine days): Placebo: 9.1, AJOVY Quarterly: 9.2, AJOVY \nMonthly: 8.9. \n \nTable 2: Key Efficacy Outcomes in Study 1 in Episodic Migraine \nEfficacy Endpoint Placebo \n\n(n=290) \nFremanezumab  \n675 mg quarterly \n(n=288) \n\nFremanezumab \n225 mg monthly \n(n=287) \n\nMMD \nMean changea (95% CI) \nTD (95% CI)b \nBaseline (SD) \n\n \n-2.2 (-2.68, -1.71) \n- \n9.1 (2.65) \n\n \n-3.4 (-3.94, -2.96) \n-1.2 (-1.74, -0.69) \n9.2 (2.62) \n\n \n-3.7 (-4.15, -3.18) \n-1.4 (-1.96, -0.90) \n8.9 (2.63) \n\nP-value (vs. placebo)a - p<0.0001 p<0.0001 \nMHD \nMean changea (95% CI) \nTD (95% CI)b \nBaseline (SD) \n\n \n-1.5 (-1.88, -1.06) \n- \n6.9 (3.13) \n\n \n-3.0 (-3.39, -2.55) \n-1.5 (-1.95, -1.02) \n7.2 (3.14) \n\n \n-2.9 (-3.34, -2.51) \n-1.5 (-1.92, -0.99) \n6.8 (2.90) \n\nP-value (vs. placebo)a - p<0.0001 p<0.0001 \n50% Responder Rate \nMMD \nPercentage [%] \n\n \n \n27.9% \n\n \n \n44.4% \n\n \n \n47.7% \n\nP-value (vs. placebo) - p<0.0001 p<0.0001 \n75% Responder Rate \nMMD \nPercentage [%] \n\n \n \n9.7% \n\n \n \n18.4% \n\n \n \n18.5% \n\nP-value (vs. placebo) - p=0.0025 p=0.0023 \nMIDAS total \nMean changea (95% CI) \nBaseline (SD) \n\n \n-17.5 (-20.62, -14.47) \n37.3 (27.75) \n\n \n-23.0 (-26.10, -19.82) \n41.7 (33.09) \n\n \n-24.6 (-27.68, -21.45) \n38 (33.30) \n\nP-value (vs. placebo)a - p=0.0023 p<0.0001 \nMAHMD \nMean changea (95% CI) \nTD (95% CI)b \nBaseline (SD) \n\n \n-1.6 (-2.04, -1.20) \n- \n7.7 (3.60) \n\n \n-2.9 (-3.34, -2.48) \n-1.3 (-1.73, -0.78) \n7.7 (3.70) \n\n \n-3.0 (-3.41, -2.56) \n-1.3 (-1.81, -0.86) \n7.7 (3.37) \n\nP-value (vs. placebo)a - p<0.0001 p<0.0001 \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nCI = confidence interval; MAHMD = monthly acute headache medication days; MHD = monthly headache days \nof at least moderate severity; MIDAS = Migraine Disability Assessment; MMD = monthly migraine days; \nSD = standard deviation; TD = treatment difference \na For all endpoints mean change and CIs are based on the ANCOVA model that included treatment, gender, \nregion, and baseline preventive medication use (yes/no) as fixed effects and corresponding baseline value and \nyears since onset of migraine as covariates. \nb Treatment difference is based on the MMRM analysis with treatment, gender, region, and baseline preventive \nmedication use (yes/no), month, and treatment month as fixed effects and corresponding baseline value and years \nsince onset of migraine as covariates. \n \nIn patients on one other concomitant, migraine preventive medicinal product, the treatment difference \nfor the reduction of monthly migraine days (MMD) observed between fremanezumab 675 mg \nquarterly and placebo was -1.8 days (95% CI: -2.95, -0.55) and between fremanezumab 225 mg \nmonthly and placebo -2.0 days (95% CI: -3.21, -0.86). \n \nIn patients who had previously used topiramate the treatment difference for the reduction of monthly \nmigraine days (MMD) observed between fremanezumab 675 mg quarterly and placebo was -2.3 days \n(95% CI: -3.64, -1.00) and between fremanezumab 225 mg monthly and placebo -2.4 days \n(95% CI: -3.61, -1.13). \n \nChronic migraine study (Study 2) \nFremanezumab was evaluated in chronic migraine in a randomised, multicentre, 12-week, placebo-\ncontrolled, double-blind study (Study 2). The study population included adults with a history of \nchronic migraine (15 headache days or higher per month). A total of 1,130 patients (991 females, \n139 males) were randomised into one of three arms: 675 mg fremanezumab starting dose followed by \n225 mg fremanezumab once a month (monthly, n=379), 675 mg fremanezumab every three months \n(quarterly, n=376), or monthly administration of placebo (n=375) administered via subcutaneous \ninjection. Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced and comparable between \nthe study arms. Patients had a median age of 41 years (range: 18 to 70 years), 88% were female, and \n79% were white. The mean headache frequency at baseline was approximately 21 headache days per \nmonth (of which 13 headache days were of at least moderate severity). Patients were allowed to use \nacute headache treatments during the study. A sub-set of patients (21%) was also allowed to use one \ncommonly used concomitant, preventive medicinal product (beta-blockers, calcium channel \nblocker/benzocycloheptene, antidepressants, anticonvulsants). Overall, 30% of the patients had \npreviously used topiramate and 15% onabotulinumtoxin A. A total of 1,034 patients completed the \n12-week double-blind treatment period. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in the monthly average number of \nheadache days of at least moderate severity during the 12-week treatment period. Key secondary \nendpoints were the achievement of at least 50% reduction from baseline in monthly headache days of \nat least moderate severity (50% responder rate), mean change from baseline in the patient reported \nHIT-6 score, and change from baseline in monthly average number of days of acute headache \nmedicinal product use. Both monthly and quarterly dosing regimens of fremanezumab demonstrated \nstatistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement from baseline compared to placebo for \nkey endpoints (see Table 3).

The observed \ntreatment difference for the reduction of monthly headache days (MHD) of at least moderate severity \nbetween fremanezumab 675 mg quarterly and placebo in these patients was -2.2 days (95% CI: -3.14, \n-1.22) and between fremanezumab 225 mg monthly with 675 mg starting dose and placebo -2.7 days \n(95% CI: -3.71, -1.78). \n \nLong-term study (Study 3) \nFor all episodic and chronic migraine patients, efficacy was sustained for up to 12 additional months \nin the long-term study (Study 3), in which patients received 225 mg fremanezumab monthly or \n675 mg quarterly. 79% of patients completed the 12-month treatment period of Study 3. Pooled across \nthe two dosing regimens, a reduction of 6.6 monthly migraine days was observed after 15 months \nrelative to Study 1 and Study 2 baseline. 61% of patients completing Study 3 achieved a 50% response \nin the last month of the study. No safety signal was observed during the 15-month combined treatment \nperiod. \n \nIntrinsic and extrinsic factors \nThe efficacy and safety of fremanezumab was demonstrated regardless of age, gender, race, use of \nconcomitant preventive medicinal products (beta-blockers, calcium channel \nblocker/benzocycloheptene, antidepressants, anticonvulsants), use of topiramate or \nonabotulinumtoxin A for migraine in the past, and acute headache medication overuse. \nThere is limited data available on the use of fremanezumab in patients \u226565 years of age (2% of the \npatients). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nAJOVY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of migraine headaches (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter single subcutaneous administrations of 225 mg and 675 mg fremanezumab, median time to \nmaximum concentrations (tmax) in healthy subjects was 5 to 7 days. The absolute bioavailability of \nfremanezumab after subcutaneous administration of 225 mg and 900 mg in healthy subjects was 55% \n(\u00b1SD of 23%) to 66% (\u00b1SD of 26%). Dose proportionality, based on population pharmacokinetics, \nwas observed between 225 mg to 675 mg. Steady state was achieved by approximately 168 days \n(about 6 months) following 225 mg monthly and 675 mg quarterly dosing regimens. Median \naccumulation ratio, based on once monthly and once quarterly dosing regimens, is approximately 2.4 \nand 1.2, respectively. \n \nDistribution \n \nAssuming the model-derived estimated bioavailability of 66% (\u00b1SD of 26%) holds for the patient \npopulation, the volume of distribution for a typical patient was 3.6 L (35.1% CV) following \nsubcutaneous administration of 225 mg, 675 mg and 900 mg of fremanezumab. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nSimilar to other monoclonal antibodies, fremanezumab is expected to be degraded by enzymatic \nproteolysis into small peptides and amino acids. \n \nElimination \n \nAssuming the model-derived estimated bioavailability of 66% (\u00b1SD of 26%) holds for the patient \npopulation, central clearance for a typical patient was 0.09 L/day (23.4% CV) following subcutaneous \nadministration of 225 mg, 675 mg and 900 mg of fremanezumab. The formed small peptides and \namino acids may be re-used in the body for de novo synthesis of proteins or are excreted by the \nkidney. Fremanezumab has an estimated half-life of 30 days. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis looking at age, race, gender, and weight was conducted on data \nfrom 2,546 subjects. Approximately twice as much exposure is expected in the lowest body weight \nquartile (43.5 to 60.5 kg) compared to the highest body weight quartile (84.4 to131.8 kg). However, \nbody weight did not have an observed effect on the clinical efficacy based on the exposure-response \nanalyses in episodic and chronic migraine patients. No dose adjustments are required for \nfremanezumab. No data on exposure-efficacy relationship in subjects with body weight >132 kg is \navailable. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nSince monoclonal antibodies are not known to be eliminated via renal pathways or metabolised in the \nliver, renal and hepatic impairment are not expected to impact the pharmacokinetics of fremanezumab. \nPatients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) have not been studied. Population \npharmacokinetic analysis of integrated data from the AJOVY clinical studies did not reveal a \ndifference in the pharmacokinetics of fremanezumab in patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment or hepatic impairment relative to those with normal renal or hepatic function (see \nsection 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, toxicity to reproduction and development. \n \nAs fremanezumab is a monoclonal antibody, no genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies have been \nconducted. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What AJOVY is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use AJOVY  \n3. How to use AJOVY  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store AJOVY \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What AJOVY is and what it is used for \n \nWhat AJOVY is \nAJOVY is a medicine containing the active substance fremanezumab, a monoclonal antibody, a type \nof protein that recognises and attaches to a specific target in the body.  \n \nHow AJOVY works \nA substance in the body called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays an important role in \nmigraine. Fremanezumab attaches to CGRP and prevents it from working. This reduction in CGRP's \nactivity reduces migraine attacks. \n \nWhat AJOVY is used for \nAJOVY is used to prevent migraine in adults who have at least 4 migraine days per month. \n \nWhat are the benefits of using AJOVY \nAJOVY reduces the frequency of migraine attacks and days with headache.

Depending on your dose you \n\nwill need to use 1 pre-filled pen or 3 pre-filled pens. \n\u2022 AJOVY is injected under your skin (subcutaneous injection). You should not inject yourself \n\nuntil you have been trained by your doctor or nurse. \n\u2022 Carefully read the AJOVY package leaflet to learn more about your medicine. \n\u2022 Do not shake the pre-filled pen. \n\u2022 Put the carton back in the refrigerator immediately, if you have any unused pre-filled pens \n\nin the carton. \n\n \nAJOVY pre-filled pen (before use)  \n\n \n \n\nAJOVY pre-filled pen (after use)  \n\n          \n \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\n\u2022 The blue plunger moves down the viewing window during the injection. The blue plunger fills \nthe window when the injection is complete. (Note: When the blue plunger has filled the \nviewing window you will still be able to see the grey stopper.)  \n\n\u2022 When injecting AJOVY, hold the pre-filled pen so that your hand does not cover the viewing \nwindow. \n\n \n\nStep 1: Getting ready for an injection  \n\na) Gather the following supplies for your injection: \n\u2212 1 or 3 AJOVY pre-filled pens to enable 1 or 3 injections depending on your dose \n\u2212 1 alcohol swab per injection \n\u2212 1 gauze pad or cotton ball per injection \n\u2212 1 sharps disposal or puncture-resistant container \n\nb) Place the supplies you have gathered on a clean, flat surface. \nc) Wait for 30 minutes to let AJOVY reach room temperature (<30\u00b0C) to reduce \n\ndiscomfort during injection.  \n\u2212 Do not leave the pre-filled pen in direct sunlight. \n\u2212 Do not warm up the pre-filled pen using a microwave or any other heat source. \n\nd) Wash your hands with soap and water and dry well with a clean towel. \ne) Inspect your AJOVY pre-filled pen. \n\n\u2212 Check the pen label. Make sure the name AJOVY appears on the label. \n\u2212 Check that the medicine in the pen viewing window looks clear and is colourless to \n\nslightly yellow. \n\u2212 You may see small air bubbles in the pre-filled pen. This is normal. \n\u2212 Do not use the pre-filled pen if you see any of the following: \n\n\uf0a7 The pen looks damaged. \n\uf0a7 The expiration date has passed or if the pre-filled pen has been out of the \n\nrefrigerator for longer than 24 hours. \n\uf0a7 The medicine is cloudy, discoloured, or contains particles. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nf) Choose your injection area. \n\u2212 Choose an injection area from the following areas: \n\n\uf0a7 Your stomach area (abdomen), avoid about 5 cm around the belly button \n\uf0a7 The front of your thighs, about 5 cm above the knee and 5 cm below the groin \n\uf0a7 The back of your upper arms, in the fleshy areas of the upper back portion \n\n\u2212 If multiple injections are required, they may be given in the same or different area \n(abdomen, thigh, upper arm), but you should avoid injecting in exactly the same place. \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\n \ng) Clean your injection area. \n\n\u2212 Clean the chosen injection area using a new alcohol swab. \n\u2212 Wait 10 seconds to allow the skin to dry before injecting. \n\u2212 Do not inject AJOVY into an area that is tender, red, hot, bruised, hardened, tattooed \n\nor that has scars or stretch marks. \n \n\nStep 2: How to inject  \n\na) Remove the protective cap and do not replace.  \n\u2212 Pull the protective cap straight off. Do not twist. \n\u2212 Do not put the protective cap back on the pre-filled pen, to avoid injury and infection. \n\u2212 Do not touch the needle shield area. \n\n \n\nb) Inject by following the steps below. \n\u2212 Place the pre-filled pen at a 90\u00b0 angle against your skin at the injection site. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u2212 Press down on the pre-filled pen and keep pressed down against the skin for about 30 \nseconds. Do not remove pressure until the 3 steps below are complete. \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\n1. You hear the first \n\u201cclick\u201d (this signals \nthe start of the \ninjection and the blue \nplunger starts to \nmove). \n\n2. You hear a second \u201cclick\u201d \n(about 15 seconds after the \nfirst \u201cclick\u201d; the plunger \nwill be moving to the \nbottom of the viewing \nwindow as the medicine is \nbeing injected). \n\n3. You wait another 10 seconds \n(to make sure all of the \nmedicine is injected). \n\n \n \n \n\nc) Check that the blue plunger has filled the viewing window and remove the pre-filled pen \nfrom your skin. \n\n\u2212 After you have injected all of the medicine, i.e. the blue plunger has filled the viewing \nwindow and you are able to see the grey stopper, remove the pre-filled pen from the \nskin by lifting the pre-filled pen straight up and dispose straightaway into a sharp \ndisposal container (see step 3). \n\n\u2212 As the pre-filled pen is lifted from the skin, the needle shield returns to the original \nposition and locks into place, covering the needle. \n\n\u2212 Do not put the protective cap back on the pre-filled pen at any time to avoid injury \nand infection. \n\n \n \n\nd) Apply pressure at the injection site. \n\u2212 Use a clean, dry cotton ball, or gauze to gently press on the injection site for a few \n\nseconds. \n\u2212 Do not rub the injection site or re-use the pre-filled pen. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n46 \n \n\nStep 3: Disposal of the pre-filled pen  \n\na) Dispose of your pre-filled pen right away. \n\u2212 Put your used pre-filled pens in a sharps disposal container right away after use.  \n\u2212 Do not throw away (dispose of) pre-filled pens with your household waste.  \n\u2212 Do not recycle used sharps disposal container. \n\nb) Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse how to throw away the container.  \n \n \nIf your dose is 675 mg, repeat steps 1 e) to 3 a) with the second and third pre-filled pen \nto inject the full dose. \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX IV \n \n\nSCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS \nOF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S) \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\nScientific conclusions \n \nTaking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for fremanezumab, the scientific \nconclusions of CHMP are as follows: \n \nIn view of available data from clinical trials and spontaneous reports, the PRAC considers that a \ncausal relationship between fremanezumab and hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria, \npruritus, rash and swelling/oedema is at least a reasonable possibility and the product information \nshould be amended accordingly. \n \nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n \n \nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n \nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for fremanezumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the \nbenefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing fremanezumab is unchanged subject to \nthe proposed changes to the product information \n \nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

nurse. read the \"instructions for use\" for the pre-filled syringe carefully before using ajovy. how much and when to inject your doctor will discuss and decide with you the most appropriate dosing schedule. there are two alternative recommended dosing options: - one injection (225 mg) once a month (monthly dosing) or - three injections (675 mg) every 3 months (quarterly dosing) if your dose is 675 mg, inject the three injections one after another, each in a different place. use a reminder method such as notes in a calendar or diary to help you remember your next dose so that you do not miss a dose or have a dose too soon after the last one. if you use more ajovy than you should if you have used more ajovy than you should, tell your doctor. if you forget or miss to use ajovy if you have missed a dose of ajovy, inject your missed dose as soon as you can. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. if you are not sure when to inject ajovy, talk to your doctor, pharmacist
