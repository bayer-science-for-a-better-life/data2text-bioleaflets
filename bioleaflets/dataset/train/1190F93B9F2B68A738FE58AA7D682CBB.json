This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \n\nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nSenshio 60 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 60 mg ospemifene. \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 1.82 mg lactose as monohydrate. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n\nOval biconvex, white to off-white, film-coated tablets of dimensions 12 mm x 6.45 mm, debossed \n\nwith \u201c60\u201d on one side. \n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nSenshio is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe symptomatic vulvar and vaginal atrophy \n\n(VVA) in post-menopausal women who are not candidates for local vaginal oestrogen therapy.  \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is one 60 mg tablet once daily with food taken at the same time each day.  \n\n \n\nIf a dose is missed it should be taken with food as soon as the patient remembers. A double dose \n\nshould not be taken in the same day.  \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly (>65 years old) \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients above the age of 65 years (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (see \n\nsection 5.2).  \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Ospemifene \n\nhas not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment, therefore Senshio is not \n\nrecommended for use in such patients (see section 5.2).  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of ospemifene in the paediatric population for the indication of the treatment \n\nof moderate to severe symptomatic VVA in post-menopausal women. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nOral use. \n\n \n\nOne tablet should be swallowed whole once daily with food and should be taken at the same time each \n\nday.  \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nActive or past history of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), including deep vein thrombosis, \n\npulmonary embolism and retinal vein thrombosis. \n\nUnexplained vaginal bleeding. \n\nPatients with suspected breast cancer or patients undergoing active treatment (including adjuvant \n\ntherapy) for breast cancer (see section 4.4). \n\nSuspected or active sex-hormone dependent malignancy (e.g. endometrial cancer). \n\nPatients with signs or symptoms of endometrial hyperplasia; safety in this patient group has not been \n\nstudied. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nFor the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, ospemifene should only be initiated for symptoms \n\nthat adversely affect quality of life e.g. dyspareunia and vaginal dryness. In all cases, a careful \n\nappraisal of the risks and benefits should be undertaken at least annually taking into consideration \n\nother menopausal symptoms, effects on uterine and breast tissues, thromboembolic and \n\ncerebrovascular risks. Ospemifene should only be continued as long as the benefit outweighs the risk. \n\n \n\nEndometrial findings \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, a mean increase of 0.8 mm in endometrial thickness after 12 months (as assessed by \n\nprotocol-specified ultrasonography) was observed and there was no increase in vaginal bleeding or \n\nspotting in the ospemifene-treated group compared to the placebo-treated group. If bleeding or \n\nspotting occurs on therapy, or continues after treatment has been discontinued, this should always be \n\ninvestigated, which may include an endometrial biopsy to exclude endometrial malignancy. The \n\nincidence of endometrial hyperplasia was 0.3% (1 case out of 317 biopsies) after 1 year of treatment \n\nwith an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.74% (see section 5.1). In post-menopausal women who \n\nreceived ospemifene treatment up to 1 year, benign endometrial polyps were reported in 0.4% \n\ncompared to 0.2% in women who received placebo treatment.  \n\n \n\nVenous thromboembolic events (VTEs) \n\n \n\nThe risk of VTE (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) is increased with other selective \n\nestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). The risk of VTE associated with ospemifene cannot be \n\nexcluded. Generally recognised risk factors for VTE include advanced age, a family history, severe \n\nobesity (BMI>30 kg/m\n2\n) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The risk of VTE is temporarily \n\nincreased with prolonged immobilisation, major trauma or major surgery. Ospemifene should be \n\ndiscontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to and during prolonged immobilisation (e.g., post-surgical \n\nrecovery, prolonged bed rest). Treatment should be resumed only after the patient is mobilised.  \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nIf VTE develops after initiating therapy, the treatment should be discontinued. Patients should be \n\nadvised to contact their doctors immediately when they experience a potential thromboembolic \n\nsymptom (e.g. painful swelling of a leg, sudden pain in the chest, dyspnoea). \n\n \n\nCerebro-vascular events \n\n \n\nThe risk of cerebrovascular events is possibly increased with other SERMs. The risk of \n\ncerebrovascular events associated with ospemifene cannot be excluded. This should be considered \n\nwhen prescribing ospemifene for postmenopausal women with a history of stroke or other significant \n\nstroke risk factors.  \n\n \n\nPre-existing gynaecological pathology other than signs of vaginal atrophy \n\n \n\nThere are limited clinical trial data on the use of ospemifene in patients with other gynaecological \n\nconditions. It is recommended that any additional pathology be investigated and treated appropriately \n\nbefore starting ospemifene. \n\n \n\nBreast cancer \n\n \n\nOspemifene has not been formally studied in women with a prior history of breast cancer. No data are \n\navailable on its concomitant use with medicinal products used in the treatment of early or advanced \n\nbreast cancer. Therefore ospemifene should be used for the treatment of VVA only after the treatment \n\nof breast cancer, including adjuvant therapy, has been completed. \n\n \n\nHot flushes \n\n \n\nOspemifene may increase the incidence of hot flushes and is not effective in reducing hot flushes \n\nassociated with oestrogen deficiency. In some asymptomatic patients, hot flushes may occur upon \n\nbeginning therapy. About 1% of subjects discontinued in the Phase 2/3 clinical programme due to hot \n\nflushes. \n\n \n\nCo-administration with fluconazole \n\n \n\nCaution is recommended when co-administering ospemifene with fluconazole (see section 4.5). If \n\nnecessary, because of impaired tolerance, ospemifene should be stopped as long as treatment with \n\nfluconazole lasts. \n\n \n\nLactose content \n\n \n\nSenshio contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \n\ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\nSodium content \n\n \n\nSenshio contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nEffects of other medicinal products on ospemifene \n\n \n\nFluconazole, a moderate CYP3A / moderate CYP2C9 / strong CYP2C19 inhibitor, increased the AUC \n\nof ospemifene by 2.7-fold. These results suggest that co-administration of ospemifene with any \n\nmedicinal product that inhibits both CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 activity (e.g. fluconazole) would be \n\nexpected to increase the exposure of ospemifene in a similar way. Therefore, caution is recommended \n\n\n\n5 \n\nwhen co-administering ospemifene with fluconazole. In case of impaired tolerance of ospemifene, the \n\nlatter should be stopped as long as treatment with fluconazole lasts. \n\n \n\nKetoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and moderate P-glycoprotein inhibitor, increased the AUC \n\nof ospemifene by 1.4-fold. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant given the \n\ninherent pharmacokinetic variability of ospemifene. There is therefore no reason to expect that strong \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors would cause a clinically meaningful change in ospemifene exposure. Co-\n\nadministration of ospemifene with strong/moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided in patients \n\nwho are known or suspected to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers based on genotyping or previous \n\nhistory/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates. \n\n \n\nRifampicin, a strong CYP3A / CYP2C9 enzyme inducer, decreased the AUC of ospemifene by 58%. \n\nTherefore, co-administration of ospemifene with strong enzyme inducers like carbamazepine, \n\nphenytoin, St John\u2019s wort and rifabutin would be expected to decrease the exposure of ospemifene, \nwhich may decrease the clinical effect.  \n\n \n\nInhibition of UGT1A3, UGT2B7, UGT1A1, or UGT1A8 may potentially affect the glucuronidation of \n\nospemifene and/or 4-hydroxyospemifene. \n\n \n\nIn healthy subjects, the absorption of ospemifene is not affected by co-administration of oral \n\nomeprazole, a medicinal product that increases gastric pH. \n\n \n\nEffects of ospemifene on other medicinal products \n\n \n\nInteraction studies were performed with probe substrates for CYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP3A4 \n\n(midazolam), CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 (omeprazole) and CYP2B6 (bupropion). Ospemifene did not \n\ncause a clinically meaningful change in the exposure to the substrates, indicating that ospemifene does \n\nnot affect those enzyme activities in vivo to a clinically significant extent. \n\n \n\nOspemifene and its major metabolite, 4-hydroxyospemifene, inhibited organic cation transporter \n\n(OCT)1 in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, ospemifene may increase \n\nconcentrations of medicinal products which are substrates of OCT1 (e.g. metformin, acyclovir, \n\nganciclovir and oxaliplatin). \n\n \n\nIn vitro, ospemifene and 4-hydroxyospemifene inhibited glucuronidation mainly via UGT1A3 and \n\nUGT1A9 at clinically relevant concentrations. The pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are \n\nmainly metabolised by UGT1A3 and UGT1A9 could be affected when administered concomitantly \n\nwith ospemifene and co-administration should be made with caution. \n\n \n\nThe safety of using ospemifene concomitantly with oestrogens or other SERMS, such as tamoxifen, \n\ntoremifene, bazedoxifene and raloxifene, has not been studied and its concurrent use is not \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nDue to its lipophilic nature and absorption characteristics, an interaction between ospemifene and \n\nmedicinal products like orlistat, cannot be ruled out. Therefore, caution is recommended when \n\nospemifene is combined with orlistat. A clinical monitoring of a decrease in the efficacy of \n\nospemifene should be made. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nSenshio is only for use in postmenopausal women and should not be used in women of child-bearing \n\npotential. If pregnancy occurs during treatment with ospemifene, ospemifene should be withdrawn \n\nimmediately.  \n\nThere are no data on the use of ospemifene in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \n\nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk in humans is unknown. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nSenshio is not indicated during breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nOspemifene is not indicated for fertile women. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nSenshio has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions are hot flushes (7.5%). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions are listed below by MedDRA preferred term system organ class and by frequency. \n\nFrequencies are defined as very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 \nto <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from \navailable data).  \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions  \n\nMedDRA system organ class Common Uncommon \n\nInfections and infestations Vulvovaginal candidiasis / \n\nmycotic infections \n- \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n- \n\nDrug hypersensitivity\nb\n,  \n\nHypersensitivity\nb\n,  \n\nSwollen tongue \n\nNervous system disorders Headache\nc\n  \n\nVascular disorders Hot flush - \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nRash (includes rash \n\nerythematous, rash generalised) \n\nPruritus \n\nUrticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \n\ntissue disorders \n\nMuscle spasms \n- \n\nReproductive system and breast \n\ndisorders \n\nVaginal discharge,  \n\nGenital discharge, Vaginal \n\nhaemorrhage \n\nEndometrial hypertrophy\na\n \n\n(sonographic endometrial \n\nthickness) \n\na\n Endometrial hypertrophy is a MedDRA dictionary term that represents sonographic endometrial \n\nthickness findings. \n\nb\n Hypersensitivity reactions including adverse reactions listed under skin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders, swollen tongue, pharyngeal oedema and throat tightening were reported. \n\nc \nThe frequency of headache reported in the table is that calculated from the Phase 2/3 clinical trials, \n\nwhere the frequency was comparable between 60 mg ospemifene (5.4%) and placebo (5.9%) groups. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nOspemifene has been administered to subjects in single doses for up to 800 mg day and repeat doses \n\nup to 240 mg/day for 7 days and up to 200 mg/day for 12 weeks. There is no specific antidote for \n\nospemifene. In the event of overdose, general supportive measures should be initiated based on the \n\npatient\u2019s signs and symptoms. \n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, selective estrogen \n\nreceptor modulators, ATC code: G03XC05. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nDecreases in oestrogen levels that occur after the menopause lead to VVA, characterised by decreased \n\nmaturation of vaginal epithelial cells, a progressive decrease in the vascularity of the vaginal tissues, \n\nand decreased lubrication. The glycogen content of vaginal epithelial cells also decreases, resulting in \n\nreduced colonisation by lactobacilli and increased vaginal pH. These changes result in clinical signs \n\nwhich include vaginal dryness, redness, petechiae, pallor, and friability in the mucosa. In addition, \n\nthese changes can result in chronic symptoms associated with VVA, the most common of which are \n\nvaginal dryness and dyspareunia.  \n\n \n\nOspemifene\u2019s biological actions are mediated through the binding of ospemifene and its major \nmetabolite to oestrogen receptors. The relative contribution of the metabolite to the pharmacological \n\neffect is estimated to be approximately 40%. This binding results in activation of some oestrogenic \n\npathways (agonism) and blockade of other oestrogenic pathways (antagonism). The biological activity \n\nprofile in humans is predominantly due to the parent compound. \n\n \n\nNonclinical findings show that ospemifene and its major metabolite have an oestrogen like effect in \n\nthe vagina increasing the cellular maturation and mucification of the vaginal epithelium. In the \n\nmammary gland, they have a predominantly oestrogen antagonist effect. In bone, ospemifene has \n\nagonist-like activity. In the uterus ospemifene and its major metabolite have weak partial \n\nagonist/antagonist effects. These non-clinical findings are consistent with findings from clinical trials, \n\nin which ospemifene demonstrated benefits on vaginal physiology without apparent oestrogen-like \n\neffects on breast tissue (see subheading Clinical safety). \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety  \n\n \n\nThe clinical efficacy and safety of ospemifene was determined primarily from two multi-centre, \n\nplacebo-controlled trials of 12 weeks duration (trials 1 and 2) and a third long-term safety trial of \n\n52 weeks duration (trial 3) in post-menopausal patients with VVA. In those trials, a total of \n\n1,102 subjects received 60 mg of ospemifene and 787 subjects received placebo. \n\nIn the two 12 weeks studies (trials 1 and 2), 739 patients received ospemifene and 724 patients \n\nreceived placebo. All patients received non-hormonal vaginal lubricant for use as needed; therefore, \n\nthe effects on efficacy endpoints in the ospemifene treatment group were in addition to those achieved \n\nwith lubricant use alone. The study population consisted of generally healthy post-menopausal women \n\nbetween 41 to 80 years of age (mean age = 59 years), who at baseline had \u2264 5.0% superficial cells in \nthe vaginal smear, a vaginal pH >5.0 and were required to have at least one moderate or severe VVA \n\nsymptom, where patients had to choose the symptom that was the most bothersome (MBS). There \n\nwere four co-primary endpoints for which change from baseline was assessed: percentage parabasal \n\ncells and superficial cells in the vaginal smear, vaginal pH, and MBS of VVA (dryness or \n\ndyspareunia).  \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nThe long-term study (trial 3) was a 52-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety and \n\nefficacy study in 426 postmenopausal women with an intact uterus. Of the 426 subjects enrolled in the \n\nstudy, 363 (85.2%) subjects were randomised to once-daily oral doses of ospemifene 60 mg and \n\n63 (14.8%) subjects were randomised to placebo. The mean age of participants was 61.7 years in the \n\nospemifene 60 mg group and 62.9 years in the placebo group. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy \n\n \n\nPhysiological responses (objective measures) \n\nOspemifene (OSP) improved post-menopausal physiologic changes. In two separate 12 week pivotal \n\ntrials (trials 1 and 2), ospemifene was associated with a statistically significant mean decrease from \n\nbaseline in the percentage of parabasal cells and vaginal pH and a statistically significant mean \n\nincrease from baseline in the percentage of superficial cells, compared with placebo (P<0.001 for each \n\nparameter) at weeks 4 and 12. This improvement in objective measures (superficial and parabasal cells \n\nand pH) were sustained in ospemifene treated women in a long-term study of up to 52 weeks. The \n\nmagnitude of effect was similar in all three trials.  \n\n \n\nSymptoms (subjective measures) \n\nThe most bothersome symptom (MBS) was assessed at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks with the severity \n\nscored as follows: None=0, Mild=1, Moderate=2, Severe=3. Table 1 shows the mean change in \n\nseverity score in MBS after 12 weeks with the associated statistical testing for the difference vs. \n\nplacebo for trials 1 and 2.  \n\n \n\nTable 1: Primary efficacy analysis - change from baseline to week 12 in most bothersome \n\nsymptom (ITT, LOCF) \n\n \n\nStudy Dryness Dyspareunia \n\n 60 mg OSP Placebo p-value 60 mg OSP Placebo p-value \n\nTrial 1 -1.26 -0.84 0.021 -1.19 -0.89 0.023 \n\nTrial 2 -1.3 -1.1 0.0803 -1.5 -1.2 0.0001 \n\n \n\nTable 2 shows the percentage of subjects who reported a change in their MBS at week 12.  \n\n\u201cImprovement\u201d was defined as a reduction in the severity score of 1 or more.  \n\u201cRelief\u201d was defined as no or only mild symptoms at week 12.  \n\u201cSubstantial improvement\u201d was restricted to patients who had moderate or severe MBS at baseline and \nchanged from severe to mild or severe or moderate to none. \n\n \n\nTable 2.

For subjects completing the trial 1 \n\nextension study (ospemifene, n=41; placebo, n= 18) and for subjects in the long-term 52-week safety \n\nstudy (trial 3: ospemifene, n=276; placebo, n=46), endometrial safety was assessed by endometrial \n\nbiopsy at baseline and at 12 months. In total, there were 317 subjects on ospemifene and 64 subjects \n\non placebo who had a baseline as well as a week 52 biopsy. No cases of endometrial hyperplasia were \n\nreported at either time point.  \n\n \n\nThere was a single subject (0.3%) who developed endometrial hyperplasia in the ospemifene group \n\n(simple hyperplasia without atypia) 88 days after the last dose of study drug. No subjects in either \n\ngroup developed endometrial cancer or breast cancer during the trials. Across all placebo controlled \n\nclinical trials, there was no significant difference in breast related adverse events between ospemifene \n\nand placebo. The incidence of abnormal, but not clinically significant, findings on breast palpation and \n\nmammography decreased in the ospemifene 60 mg population during the 1-year study (trial 3) from \n\n1.6% to 0.6% and from 11.8% to 8.1% respectively. In contrast, abnormal, not clinically significant, \n\nfindings on mammography increased in the placebo population from 6.5% to 8.3%. There were no \n\nabnormal breast palpation findings in the placebo group at baseline or at study end. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nospemifene in all subsets of the paediatric population in VVA (see section 4.2 for information on \n\npaediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nOspemifene is absorbed rapidly after oral administration, with a Tmax of approximately 3 - 4 hours \n\npost-dose in the fed state. The absolute bioavailability of ospemifene has not been established. Mean \n\nospemifene Cmax and AUC0-24hr were 785 ng/mL and 5,448 ng\u2022hr/mL, respectively, after repeat doses \nof 60 mg ospemifene once daily in the fed state.  \n\n \n\nWhen ospemifene is administered with a high fat meal, the Cmax and AUC are 2.5-fold and 1.9-fold \n\nhigher, respectively, with lower variability relative to the fasting state. A low fat meal resulted in \n\napproximately a two-fold increase in exposure of ospemifene and a high fat meal resulted in \n\napproximately a three-fold increase in exposure of ospemifene in two food effect studies with tablet \n\nformulations different from the commercial formulation. It is recommended that ospemifene should be \n\ntaken with food at the same time each day. \n\n \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nOspemifene and 4-hydroxyospemifene are highly (both >99%) bound to serum proteins. Plasma/blood \n\ncell partitioning of [\n14\n\nC]-Ospemifene (< 3%) and [\n14\n\nC]-4-hydroxyospemifene (< 2%) is low. The \n\napparent volume of distribution is 448 l. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nOspemifene and its major metabolite, 4-hydroxyospemifene, are metabolised by multiple metabolic \n\npathways, the main enzymes involved are UGT1A3, UGT2B7, UGT1A1 and UGT1A8, and CYP2C9, \n\n\n\n10 \n\nCYP3A4 and CYP2C19. The major metabolite, 4-hydroxyospemifene, was seen to undergo formation \n\nrate-limited elimination (with t1/2 similar to the parent compound) in a human mass balance study. The \n\nprincipal radioactive component in both plasma and faeces was ospemifene and the main metabolite 4-\n\nhydroxyospemifene. Ospemifene and 4-hydroxyospemifene accounted for approximately 20% and \n\n14% of the total radioactivity in serum, respectively. The apparent total body clearance is 9.16 l/hr \n\nusing a population approach.  \n\n \n\nIn vitro, ospemifene and 4-hydroxyospemifene did not inhibit or induce the activity of CYP450 \n\nenzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro, ospemifene and 4-hydroxyospemifene inhibited \n\nglucuronidation via UGT1A3 and UGT1A9 at clinically relevant concentrations. In in vitro studies \n\nospemifene is a weak inhibitor for CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2C8 and CYP2D6. \n\nFurthermore in vitro studies have shown that ospemifene is a weak inducer for CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. \n\nIn in vitro studies, ospemifene and 4-hydroxyospemifene did not inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast \n\ncancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporter polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, \n\nOCT2, organic anion transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, or bile salt export pump (BSEP) transporters at \nclinically relevant concentrations. It is unknown if ospemifene is a substrate for BCRP in the intestine. \n\nTherefore care should be taken if ospemifene is administered with a BCRP inhibitor. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nThe apparent terminal half-life of ospemifene in post-menopausal women is approximately 25 hours. \n\nFollowing oral administration of [\n3\n-H]-ospemifene in the fasted state, approximately 75% and 7% of \n\nthe dose was excreted in faeces and urine respectively. Less than 0.2% of the ospemifene dose was \n\nexcreted unchanged in urine. Following a single oral administration of 60 mg ospemifene in the fed \n\nstate, 17.9%, 10.0% and 1.4% of the administered dose was excreted in faeces as ospemifene, 4-\n\nhydroxyospemifene and 4\u2019-hydroxyospemifene, respectively. The fate of remaining fraction is \nunknown but can probably be explained by formation of glucuronide metabolites. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nOspemifene exhibits linear pharmacokinetics in the fed state within the dose range of 60 mg to 240 mg. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetics in subpopulations \n\n \n\nAge \n\nNo clinically meaningful differences in ospemifene pharmacokinetics have been observed over the age \n\nrange studied (40-80) years of age. No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nPharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with ospemifene in the paediatric population. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nRenal clearance of unchanged active substance is a minor pathway of elimination, less than 0.2% of \n\nthe ospemifene dose is excreted unchanged in urine. In patients with severe renal impairment the \n\nospemifene exposure was increased by approximately 20%, when compared to healthy matched \n\nsubjects. No clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between subjects with severe renal \n\nimpairment and healthy subjects were observed. This difference is not considered clinically relevant \n\nand no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nOspemifene is primarily metabolised by the liver. The pharmacokinetics of ospemifene is only mildly \n\naffected by mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh scores 5-9) when compared to healthy \n\nmatched controls. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment the exposure of ospemifene and \n\n4-hydroxyospemifene was approximately 30% and 70% higher. These changes in pharmacokinetics of \n\nospemifene by moderate hepatic impairment are not considered to be clinically significant in \n\nconsideration of inherent pharmacokinetic variability of ospemifene. No dose adjustment is necessary \n\n\n\n11 \n\nin patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of ospemifene has not \n\nbeen evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class score >9). \n\n \n\nOther special populations \n\n \n\nGender  \n\nSenshio is indicated for use only in postmenopausal women.  \n\n \n\nRace \n\nPharmacokinetic differences due to race have been studied in 1,091 postmenopausal women, including \n\n93.1% White, 3.9% Black, 1.8% Asian and 1.1% other in VVA trials. There were no discernible \n\ndifferences in ospemifene plasma concentrations among these groups; however, the influence of race \n\ncannot be conclusively determined. \n\n \n\nCYP2C9 poor metabolisers \n\n \n\nBoth CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 are involved in the metabolism of ospemifene. Co-administration of \n\nketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the AUC of ospemifene by 1.4-fold. In CYP2C9 \n\npoor metabolizers, co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase systemic concentration of \n\nospemifene to a larger extent. Therefore, co-administration of ospemifene with strong/moderate \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided in patients who are known, or suspected to be CYP2C9 poor \n\nmetabolizers based on genotyping or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nIn repeat dose toxicity studies in mouse, rat, dog and the cynomolgus monkey main target organs of \n\ntoxicity were the ovary, uterus and the liver. Ospemifene-related changes included ovarian follicular \n\ncysts, endometrial stromal atrophy and endometrial hypertrophy/hyperplasia which are consistent with \n\nthe pharmacologic activity of ospemifene in the intact, normally cycling animal. In the liver \n\nhepatocyte hypertrophy or increased glycogen storage, increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and \n\nalkaline phosphatase (ALP) were observed. Overall, these findings are characteristic for an induction \n\nof CYP isoenzymes and are regarded as adaptive responses without any histopathological signs of \n\nliver injury. No changes in blood biochemical parameters such as ALT or ALP were determined in \n\npostmenopausal women treated with Ospemifene in clinical studies. Taken together, the liver changes \n\nobserved in experimental animals in repeat dose toxicity studies are regarded as adaptive changes due \n\nto enzyme induction and given the lack of any clinical signs are unlikely to represent a safety concern \n\nfor humans. \n\n \n\nOspemifene was not mutagenic or clastogenic when evaluated in a standard battery of in vitro and in \n\nvivo tests. \n\n \n\nIn a 2-year carcinogenicity study in female mice, ospemifene caused treatment related increases in \n\nneoplastic findings in the adrenal gland and ovary. Systemic exposure (AUC) at these doses was 2.1-, \n\n4.0- and 4.7-times the AUC in postmenopausal woman administered 60 mg/day. In the adrenal gland, \n\nthere was an increased incidence of adrenal subcapsular cell and adrenal cortical tumours in animals \n\ndosed at high dose. In the ovary, there was an increase in sex-cord stromal tumours, tubulostromal \n\ntumours, granulosa cell tumours and luteomas in all treatment groups. \n\n \n\nIn a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, a clear increase in mostly benign thymic tumours was \n\nrecorded at all ospemifene dose levels. This effect was likely due to the anti-oestrogenic effect of \n\nospemifene in this target tissue, which was attenuating the physiological thymic involution (atrophy) \n\nprocess induced by oestrogens starting during puberty. In the liver, an increase in hepatocellular \n\ntumours were recorded at all ospemifene dose levels. Systemic exposure (AUC) at the administered \n\ndoses was 0.3-, 1.0- and 1.2-times the AUC in postmenopausal woman administered 60 mg/day. \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nOverall, tumour development in these studies is believed to be the result of rodent specific hormonal \n\nmechanisms when treated during their reproductive lives; these findings are unlikely to have any \n\nclinical relevance in postmenopausal women. \n\n \n\nOspemifene was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits. In a two-generation reproductive study on pre-and \n\npostnatal development ospemifene induced an increased post-implantation loss, an increased number \n\nof dead pups at birth as well as an increased incidence of postnatal loss of pups in the F1 generation. \n\nIn the F0 maternal generation, a significant prolonged gestation was observed. However, all exposures \n\nwere far below the intended human exposure. The reproductive effects observed are considered to be \n\nrelated to oestrogen receptor activity of ospemifene. Fertility studies were not conducted. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What you need to know before you take Senshio\n\n3. How to take Senshio\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\n5. How to store Senshio\n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Senshio is and what it is used for\n\nSenshio contains the active substance ospemifene. Ospemifene belongs to a group of medicines that \n\ndo not contain hormones called Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs).  \n\nSenshio is used to treat women with moderate to severe post-menopausal symptoms in and outside \n\nthe vagina, such as itching, dryness, burning and pain during sex (dyspareunia) if local oestrogen \n\ntherapy is not suitable. This is known as vulvar and vaginal atrophy. It is caused by a lowering in the \n\nlevels of the female hormone oestrogen in your body. When this happens, the vaginal walls can \n\nbecome thinner. This happens naturally after menopause (post-menopause). \n\nSenshio works in a similar way to some of the helpful effects of oestrogen, helping to improve these \n\nsymptoms and the underlying causes of vulvar and vaginal atrophy. \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Senshio\n\nDo not take Senshio \n\n- If you are allergic to ospemifene or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n- If you have or have ever had a blood clot in a vein (thrombosis), for example, in your legs (deep \n\nvein thrombosis), lungs (pulmonary embolism), or eyes (retinal thrombosis). \n\n- If you have unexplained vaginal bleeding.  \n\n- If your doctor thinks you might have breast cancer or you are being treated for breast cancer. \n\n- If your doctor thinks you might have or you are being treated for cancer which is sensitive to \n\noestrogens, such as cancer of the womb. \n\n- If you have excessive thickening of the womb lining, such as endometrial hyperplasia. \n\n\n\n24 \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nOnce you have started on Senshio you should see your doctor for regular check-ups (at least once a \n\nyear). At these check-ups, discuss with your doctor the benefits and risks of continuing with Senshio. \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Senshio if any of the following apply to you.  \n\n- Any of your close relatives has ever had a blood clot in the leg, lung or other organ. \n\n- You are seriously overweight (BMI >30 kg/m\n2\n). \n\n- You have an autoimmune condition called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  \n\n- If you have had a stroke (a cerebrovascular accident), or if your doctor has told you that you are at \n\nhigh risk of having one. \n\n- If you are suffering from any gynaecological illness other than vulvar and vaginal atrophy. \n\n- If you have had breast cancer.  \n\nWhile taking Senshio: \n\n- If you are unable to walk for a long time or are sitting for a long time in the same position because \n\nof major surgery, injury or illness, it may prevent good blood circulation and may temporarily \n\nincrease your risk of blood clots. You should therefore speak to your doctor immediately. Your \n\ndoctor may recommend that you stop treatment at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to major surgery or \n\nduring a long period of bed rest e.g. injury or illness. Treatment with Senshio can be restarted as \n\nsoon as you regain your mobility and in consultation with your doctor. \n\n- If any vaginal bleeding occurs while taking Senshio or soon after you have stopped taking it, you \n\nshould speak to your doctor. \n\n- If you experience signs of a blood clot, such as painful swelling and redness of the legs, sudden \n\nchest pain, difficulty in breathing or a stroke while taking Senshio, stop taking Senshio and see \n\na doctor immediately. \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nDo not give this medicine to children or adolescents. This medicine is only intended for use in post-\n\nmenopausal women. \n\nOther medicines and Senshio \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines.  \n\nDo not take Senshio with any of these medicines: \n\n\uf0b7 Oestrogens.\n\uf0b7 Any other medicine belonging to the group called SERMs, such as tamoxifen, toremifene,\n\nbazedoxifene and raloxifene.\n\nTalk to your doctor\n \nbefore taking Senshio with: \n\n\uf0b7 Fluconazole (an oral medicine used to treat fungal infections) as this may increase the amount\nof ospemifene in your blood. Your doctor may consider stopping treatment with Senshio while \n\nyou are taking fluconazole. \n\n\uf0b7 Any of the following medicines, which may lead to a reduced effect of Senshio:\no Rifampicin and rifabutin commonly used to treat tuberculosis.\n\no Carbamazepine and phenytoin used to treat convulsions/seizures (anticonvulsants).\n\no St John\u2019s wort, a herbal medicine sometimes used to treat depression.\no Orlistat sometimes used to treat obesity.\n\n\uf0b7 Any of the following medicines, as their concentrations may be increased while taking Senshio:\no Metformin used to treat Type II diabetes.\n\no Aciclovir used to treat cold sores and genital herpes.\n\no Ganciclovir used to treat infections caused by a virus called cytomegalovirus.\n\no Oxaliplatin, an anti-cancer medicine for advanced (metastatic) cancer of the large bowel\n\n(colon) or back passage (rectum).\n\n\n\n25 \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\nSenshio is for use only in postmenopausal women. It must not be taken by women who are pregnant, \n\nwho could still have a baby or are breast-feeding. This is because there are no data on the use of \n\nSenshio in pregnant or pre-menopausal women or those who are breast-feeding. \n\nTell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant while taking Senshio; treatment should be \n\nstopped immediately. \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nSenshio has no known or very little influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\nSenshio contains lactose \n\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \n\nbefore taking this medicine. \n\nSenshio contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n\n3. How to take Senshio\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\nThe recommended dose is one tablet taken orally at the same time each day. Senshio should be taken \n\nwith food. The tablets should be swallowed whole with food.  \n\nSenshio must be taken every day for as long as your doctor tells you to. \n\nPatients with liver disease \n\nThis medicine is not recommended if you have severely reduced liver function. \n\nIf you take more Senshio than you should \n\nIf you take more tablets than you should, tell your doctor or pharmacist. \n\nIf you forget to take Senshio \n\nIf you forget to take a tablet you should take the missed tablet (with food) as soon as you remember \n\nwithin the same day. Do not take two tablets in one day to make up for a forgotten tablet. \n\nIf you stop using Senshio \n\nYou will not benefit from the effects of Senshio if you stop using it without talking to your doctor. \n\nYour doctor will explain the effects of stopping treatment and will also discuss other possibilities for \n\ntreatment with you. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\n- An infection of the genitals caused by a fungus (thrush) \n\n- Hot flushes \n\n- Muscle cramps \n\n- Vaginal or genital discharge \n\n- Rash \n\n\n\n26 \n\n- Headache \n\n- Vaginal bleeding \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\n- Thickening of the womb lining (endometrium) as seen on ultrasound scan (endometrial \n\nhypertrophy). \n\n- An allergic reaction.

that do not contain hormones called selective estrogen receptor modulators (serms). senshio is used to treat women with moderate to severe post-menopausal symptoms in and outside the vagina, such as itching, dryness, burning and pain during sex (dyspareunia) if local oestrogen therapy is not suitable. this is known as vulvar and vaginal atrophy. it is caused by a lowering in the levels of the female hormone oestrogen in your body. when this happens, the vaginal walls can become thinner. this happens naturally after menopause (post-menopause). senshio works in a similar way to some of the helpful effects of oestrogen, helping to improve these symptoms and the underlying causes of vulvar and vaginal atrophy.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "senshio", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME",
