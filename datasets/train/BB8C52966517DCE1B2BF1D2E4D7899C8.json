This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nIMFINZI 50 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion.\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach mL of concentrate for solution for infusion contains 50 mg of durvalumab.\nOne vial of 2.4 mL of concentrate contains 120 mg of durvalumab.\nOne vial of 10 mL of concentrate contains 500 mg of durvalumab.\n\nDurvalumab is produced in mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells by recombinant DNA \ntechnology.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate).\n\nClear to opalescent, colourless to slightly yellow solution, free from visible particles. The solution has \na pH of approximately 6.0 and an osmolality of approximately 400 mOsm/kg.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nIMFINZI as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced, unresectable non-small \ncell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 on \u2265 1% of tumour cells and whose \ndisease has not progressed following platinum-based chemoradiation therapy (see section 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment must be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the treatment of cancer. \n\nPD-L1 testing for patients with locally advanced NSCLC\nPatients with locally advanced NSCLC should be evaluated for treatment based on the tumour \nexpression of PD-L1 confirmed by a validated test (section 5.1).\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose of IMFINZI is 10 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over \n60 minutes every 2 weeks, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 12 \nmonths.\n\nIt is recommended to continue treatment for clinically stable patients with initial evidence of disease \nprogression until disease progression is confirmed.\n\nDose escalation or reduction is not recommended. Dose withholding or discontinuation may be \nrequired based on individual safety and tolerability.\n\n\n\n3\n\nGuidelines for management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are described in Table 1 (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nTable 1.

ALT: alanine aminotransferase; AST: \n\naspartate aminotransferase; ULN: upper limit of normal.\nb   If no improvement within 3 to 5 days despite corticosteroids, promptly start additional immunosuppressive \n\ntherapy. Upon resolution (Grade 0), corticosteroid taper should be initiated and continued over at least 1 \n\nmonth, after which IMFINZI can be resumed based on clinical judgment.\nc   Permanently discontinue IMFINZI if adverse reaction does not resolve to \u2264 Grade 1 within 30 days or if there \n\nare signs of respiratory insufficiency.\nd   For myasthenia gravis, if there are signs of muscular weakness or respiratory insufficiency, IMFINZI should \n\nbe permanently discontinued. \n\nFor suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, adequate evaluation should be performed to \nconfirm etiology or exclude alternate etiologies. Consider increasing dose of corticosteroids and/or \nusing additional systemic immunosuppressants if there is worsening or no improvement. Upon \nimprovement to \u2264 Grade 1, corticosteroid taper should be initiated and continued over at least 1 month.\nAfter withhold, IMFINZI can be resumed within 12 weeks if the adverse reactions improved to \n\u2264 Grade 1 and the corticosteroid dose has been reduced to \u2264 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day.\nIMFINZI should be permanently discontinued for recurrent Grade 3 or 4 (severe or life-threatening) \nimmune-mediated adverse reactions.\n\nFor non-immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider withholding IMFINZI for Grade 2 and 3 \nadverse reactions until \u2264 Grade 1 or baseline. IMFINZI should be discontinued for Grade 4 adverse \nreactions (with the exception of Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities, about which the decision to \ndiscontinue should be based on accompanying clinical signs/symptoms and clinical judgment).\n\nSpecial populations\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of IMFINZI in children and adolescents aged below 18 years of age have not \nbeen established. No data are available.\n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (\u2265 65 years of age) (see section 5.1). Data on \npatients aged 75 years of age or older are limited.\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment of IMFINZI is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. \nData from patients with severe renal impairment are too limited to draw conclusions on this population\n(see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nData from patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment are limited. Due to minor \ninvolvement of hepatic processes in the clearance of durvalumab no dose adjustment of IMFINZI is \nrecommended for patients with hepatic impairment as no difference in exposure is expected (see \nsection 5.2).\n\nMethod of administration\nIMFINZI is for intravenous use. It is to be administered as an intravenous infusion solution over 60 \nminutes (see section 6.6).\n\n\n\n6\n\nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nImmune-mediated pneumonitis\nImmune-mediated pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease, defined as requiring use of systemic \ncorticosteroids and with no clear alternate etiology, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI. \n\nRadiation pneumonitis is frequently observed in patients receiving radiation therapy to the lung and \nthe clinical presentation of pneumonitis and radiation pneumonitis is very similar. In the PACIFIC \nStudy, in patients who had completed treatment with at least 2 cycles of concurrent chemoradiation \nwithin 1 to 42 days prior to initiation of the trial, pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis occurred in 161 \n(33.9%) patients in the IMFINZI-treated group and 58 (24.8%) in the placebo group, including Grade \n3 (3.4% vs 3.0%) and Grade 5 (1.1% vs 1.7%) (see section 4.8).\n\nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis. \nSuspected pneumonitis should be confirmed with radiographic imaging and other infectious and \ndisease-related aetiologies excluded, and managed as recommended in section 4.2.\n\nImmune-mediated hepatitis\nImmune-mediated hepatitis, defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids and with no clear \nalternate etiology, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI (see section 4.8). Patients should be \nmonitored for abnormal liver tests prior to and periodically during treatment with IMFINZI, and as \nindicated based on clinical evaluation. Immune-mediated hepatitis should be managed as\nrecommended in section 4.2.\n\nImmune-mediated colitis\nImmune-mediated colitis or diarrhoea, defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids and with no \nclear alternate etiology, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI (see section 4.8). Patients should be \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of colitis or diarrhoea and managed as recommended in section 4.2.\n\nImmune-mediated endocrinopathies\nHypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism\nImmune-mediated hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (including thyroiditis) occurred in patients \nreceiving IMFINZI, and hypothyroidism may follow hyperthyroidism (see section 4.8). Patients \nshould be monitored for abnormal thyroid function tests prior to and periodically during treatment and\nas indicated based on clinical evaluation. Immune-mediated hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism \n(including thyroiditis) should be managed as recommended in section 4.2.\n\nAdrenal insufficiency\nImmune-mediated adrenal insufficiency occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI (see section 4.8). \nPatients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. For \nsymptomatic adrenal insufficiency, patients should be managed as recommended in section 4.2.\n\nType 1 diabetes mellitus\nImmune-mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI (see section 4.8). \nPatients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes mellitus. For \nsymptomatic type 1 diabetes mellitus, patients should be managed as recommended in section 4.2.\n\n\n\n7\n\nHypophysitis/hypopituitarism\nImmune-mediated hypophysitis or hypopituitarism occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI (see \nsection 4.8). Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of hypophysitis or \nhypopituitarism. For symptomatic hypophysitis or hypopituitarism, patients should be managed as \nrecommended in section 4.2.\n\nImmune-mediated nephritis\nImmune-mediated nephritis, defined as requiring use of systemic corticosteroids and with no clear \nalternate etiology, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI (see section 4.8). Patients should be \nmonitored for abnormal renal function tests prior to and periodically during treatment with IMFINZI\nand managed as recommended in section 4.2.\n\nImmune-mediated rash\nImmune-mediated rash or dermatitis (including pemphigoid), defined as requiring use of systemic \ncorticosteroids and with no clear alternate etiology, occurred in patients receiving IMFINZI (see \nsection 4.8). Events of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in \npatients treated with PD-1 inhibitors. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of rash or \ndermatitis and managed as recommended in section 4.2.\n\nOther immune-mediated adverse reactions\nGiven the mechanism of action of IMFINZI, other potential immune-mediated adverse reactions may \noccur. The following immune-related adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients \ntreated with IMFINZI monotherapy in clinical trials (n = 1889): Myasthenia gravis, myocarditis, \nmyositis, polymyositis. The following immune-related adverse reactions have been observed in \npatients treated with IMFINZI monotherapy: meningitis, encephalitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome. \nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms and managed as recommended in section 4.2.\nEvents of pancreatitis have been reported in patients in the clinical study programme. Patients should \nbe monitored for signs and symptoms and managed as recommended for other immune-mediated \nadverse reactions, in section 4.2.\n\nInfusion related reactions\nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infusion related reactions. Severe infusion \nrelated reactions have been reported in patients receiving IMFINZI (see section 4.8). Infusion related \nreactions should be managed as recommended in section 4.2\n\nPatients excluded from clinical trials\nPatients with the following were excluded from the PACIFIC Study: a baseline ECOG performance \nscore \u2265 2; active or prior documented autoimmune disease within 2 years of initiation of the study; a \nhistory of immunodeficiency; a history of severe immune-mediated adverse reactions; medical \nconditions that required systemic immunosuppression, except physiological dose of systemic \ncorticosteroids (\u2264 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent); active tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or HIV \ninfection or patients receiving live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before or after the start of \nIMFINZI. In the absence of data, durvalumab should be used with caution in these populations after \ncareful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nThe use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting durvalumab, except \nphysiological dose of systemic corticosteroids (\u2264 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), is not \nrecommended because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy \nof durvalumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after\nstarting durvalumab to treat immune-related adverse reactions (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n8\n\nNo formal pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with durvalumab.\nSince the primary elimination pathways of durvalumab are protein catabolism via reticuloendothelial \nsystem or target-mediated disposition, no metabolic drug-drug interactions are expected.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with\ndurvalumab and for at least 3 months after the last dose of durvalumab.\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no data on the use of durvalumab in pregnant women. Based on its mechanism of action, \ndurvalumab has the potential to impact maintenance of pregnancy, and in a mouse allogeneic \npregnancy model, disruption of PD-L1 signaling was shown to result in an increase in foetal loss. \nAnimal studies with durvalumab are not indicative of reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Human \nIgG1 is known to cross the placental barrier and placental transfer of durvalumab was confirmed in \nanimal studies. Durvalumab may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman and is not \nrecommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective \ncontraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether durvalumab is secreted in human breast milk. Available toxicological data in \ncynomolgus monkeys have shown low levels of durvalumab in breast milk on Day 28 after birth (see \nsection 5.3). In humans, antibodies may be transferred to breast milk, but the potential for absorption \nand harm to the newborn is unknown. However, a potential risk to the breast-fed child cannot be \nexcluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast feeding or to discontinue or abstain\nfrom durvalumab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit \nof therapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\nThere are no data on the potential effects of durvalumab on fertility in humans or animals. \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nDurvalumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe safety of IMFINZI (10 mg/kg) has been evaluated in the PACIFIC Study (n = 475) in patients \nwith locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC who had completed treatment with at least 2 cycles of \nconcurrent chemoradiation within 1 to 42 days prior to initiation of the study. In this patient \npopulation, the most frequent adverse reactions were cough (40.2% vs 30.3% in placebo), upper \nrespiratory tract infections (26.1% vs 11.5% in placebo) and rash (21.7% vs 12.0% in placebo). The \nmost frequent Grade 3-4 adverse reaction was pneumonia (6.5% vs 5.6% in placebo). The overall \nincidence of Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions was 12.8% in the IMFINZI arm vs 9.8% in placebo.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nTable 2 lists the incidence of adverse reactions in patients with locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC \nin the PACIFIC Study, based on the frequency of that adverse reaction type regardless of investigator \nassessed causality. Adverse drug reactions are listed according to system organ class in MedDRA. \nWithin each system organ class, the adverse drug reactions are presented in decreasing frequency. The \ncorresponding frequency category for each ADR is defined as: very common (\u2265 1/10); common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1000); very rare \n\n\n\n9\n\n(< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available data). Within each frequency grouping, \nadverse drug reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 2.

Most of these, \nincluding severe reactions, resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy or withdrawal \nof IMFINZI. The data for the following immune-mediated adverse reactions reflect the combined \nsafety database of 1889 patients which includes the PACIFIC Study and two additional studies (a \nmulti-cohort, open-label clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumours, and an open-label study \nin patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC). Across all studies, IMFINZI was \nadministered at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. The management guidelines for these adverse \nreactions are described in section 4.4.\n\nImmune-mediated pneumonitis\nIn the combined safety database with IMFINZI monotherapy, (n = 1889 multiple tumour types), \nimmune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 79 (4.2%) patients, including Grade 3 in 12 (0.6%) \n\n\n\n11\n\npatients, Grade 4 in 1 (< 0.1%) patient, and Grade 5 in 5 (0.3%) patients. The median time to onset \nwas 53 days (range: 1-341 days). Forty-five of the 79 patients received high-dose corticosteroid \ntreatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day), and 2 patients also received infliximab. \nIMFINZI was discontinued in 26 patients. Resolution occurred in 42 patients. \n\nImmune-mediated pneumonitis occurred more frequently in patients in the PACIFIC Study who had \ncompleted treatment with concurrent chemoradiation within 1 to 42 days prior to initiation of the study \n(10.7%), than in the other patients in the combined safety database (2.0%).\n\nIn the PACIFIC Study, (n = 475 in the IMFINZI arm, and n = 234 in the placebo arm) \nimmune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 51 (10.7%) patients in the IMFINZI-treated group and 16 \n(6.8%) patients in the placebo group, including Grade 3 in 8 (1.7%) patients on IMFINZI vs. 6 (2.6%) \npatients on placebo and Grade 5 (fatal) in 4 (0.8%) patients on IMFINZI vs. 3 (1.3%) patients on \nplacebo. The median time to onset in the IMFINZI-treated group was 53 days (range: 1-341 days) vs. \n55.5 days (range: 0-231 days) in the placebo group. In the IMFINZI-treated group, 44 of the 51 \npatients received systemic corticosteroids, including 28 patients who received high-dose corticosteroid \ntreatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day), and 2 patients also received infliximab. In \nthe placebo group, 11 of the 16 patients received systemic corticosteroids, including 9 patients who \nreceived high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). \nResolution occurred for 27 patients in the IMFINZI treated group vs 6 in placebo.\n\nImmune-mediated hepatitis\nIn the combined safety database with IMFINZI monotherapy, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in \n19 (1.0%) patients, including Grade 3 in 11 (0.6%) patients and Grade 5 (fatal) in 1 (< 0.1%) patient. \nThe median time to onset was 70 days (range: 15-312 days). Thirteen of the 19 patients received \nhigh-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). One patient also \nreceived mycophenolate treatment. IMFINZI was discontinued in 4 patients. Resolution occurred in 13 \npatients.\n\nImmune-mediated colitis\nIn the combined safety database with IMFINZI monotherapy, immune-mediated colitis or diarrhoea\noccurred in 31 (1.6%) patients, including Grade 3 in 6 (0.3%) patients and Grade 4 in 1 (<0.1%) \npatient. The median time to onset was 74 days (range: 1-365 days). Sixteen of the 31 patients received \nhigh-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). One patient also \nreceived infliximab treatment. IMFINZI was discontinued in 8 patients. Resolution occurred in 23 \npatients.\n\nImmune-mediated endocrinopathies\nHypothyroidism\nIn the combined safety database with IMFINZI monotherapy, immune-mediated hypothyroidism \noccurred in 137 (7.3%) patients, including Grade 3 in 1 (< 0.1%) patient. The median time to onset \nwas 85 days (range: 9-378 days). Of the 137 patients, 134 patients received hormone replacement \ntherapy and two patients received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent \nper day) for hypothyroidism followed by hormone replacement. IMFINZI was not discontinued in any \npatient due to hypothyroidism. \n\nHyperthyroidism\nIn the combined safety database with IMFINZI monotherapy, immune-mediated hyperthyroidism \noccurred in 34 (1.8%) patients, there were no Grade 3 or 4 cases. The median time to onset was 41 \ndays (range: 14-195 days). Twenty-six of the 34 patients received medical therapy (thiamazole, \ncarbimazole, propylthiouracil or beta-blocker), 12 patients received thyroxine when hyperthyroidism \ntransitioned to hypothyroidism, 12 patients received systemic corticosteroids and 3 of the 12 patients \nreceived high-dose systemic corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). \nIMFINZI was not discontinued in any patient due to hyperthyroidism. Eight patients experienced \nhypothyroidism following hyperthyroidism.\n\n\n\n12\n\nAdrenal insufficiency\nIn the combined safety database with IMFINZI monotherapy, immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency \noccurred in 7 (0.4%) patients, including Grade 3 in 1 (< 0.1%) patient. The median time to onset was \n141 days (range: 70-265 days). All 7 patients received systemic corticosteroids; 2 of the 7 patients \nreceived high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). \nIMFINZI was not discontinued in any patient due to adrenal insufficiency. Resolution occurred in 1 \npatient.\n\nType 1 diabetes mellitus\nIn the combined safety database with IMFINZI monotherapy, immune-mediated type 1 diabetes \nmellitus occurred in 1 (< 0.1%) patient (Grade 3). IMFINZI was discontinued due to type 1 diabetes \nmellitus. The time to onset was 42 days. This 1 patient received insulin.\n\nHypophysitis/Hypopituitarism\nIn the combined safety database with IMFINZI monotherapy, immune-mediated hypopituitarism \noccurred in 1 (< 0.1%) patient (Grade 3). This 1 patient received high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at \nleast 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) and IMFINZI was not discontinued.\n\nImmune-mediated nephritis \nIn the combined safety database with IMFINZI monotherapy, immune-mediated nephritis occurred in \n3 (0.2%) patients, including Grade 3 in 1 (< 0.1%) patient. The median time to onset was 95 days \n(range: 28-239 days). Two (0.1%) patients received high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg \nprednisone or equivalent per day). IMFINZI was discontinued in all 3 patients. Resolution occurred in \n2 patients.\n\nImmune-mediated rash\nIn the combined safety database with IMFINZI monotherapy, immune-mediated rash or dermatitis\n(including pemphigoid) occurred in 30 (1.6%) patients, including Grade 3 in 7 (0.4%) patients. The \nmedian time to onset was 74 days (range: 1-365 days). Eleven of the 30 patients received high-dose \ncorticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). IMFINZI was discontinued \nin 2 patients. Resolution occurred in 18 patients.\n\nInfusion related reactions\nIn the combined safety database with IMFINZI monotherapy, infusion related reactions occurred in 35 \n(1.9%) patients, including Grade 3 in 5 (0.3%) patients. \n\nLaboratory abnormalities\nIn patients treated with durvalumab in the PACIFIC Study, the proportion of patients who experienced \na laboratory abnormality worsening from baseline was as follows: 38.5% (all Grades), 2.3% (Grades \n3-4) for alanine aminotransferase increased, 36.0% (all Grades), 2.8% (Grade 3-4) for aspartate \naminotransferase increased, 16.3% (all Grades) for creatinine increased, 26.5% (all Grades) for TSH \nelevated > ULN and above baseline, 31.9% (all Grades) for TSH decreased < LLN and below \nbaseline.\n\nImmunogenicity \nOf the 1570 patients who were treated with IMFINZI 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks and evaluable for the \npresence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), 2.9% (45/1570) of patients tested positive for \ntreatment-emergent ADAs. Neutralising antibodies (nAbs) against durvalumab were detected in 0.5% \n(8/1570) of patients. The presence of ADAs did not have a clinically relevant effect on safety. There \nare insufficient number of patients to determine ADA impact on efficacy. Based on population PK \nanalysis, slightly lower exposure are expected in ADA-positive patients however, the reduction of PK \nexposure is less than 30% compared to a typical patient and is not considered clinically relevant.\n\nElderly\nNo overall differences in safety were reported between elderly (\u2265 65 years) and younger patients. Data \nfrom NSCLC patients 75 years of age or older are limited.\n\n\n\n13\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no information on overdose with durvalumab. In case of overdose, patients should be closely \nmonitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment \ninstituted immediately.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies. ATC code: L01XC28\n\nMechanism of action\nExpression of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) protein is an adaptive immune response that \nhelps tumours evade detection and elimination by the immune system. PD-L1 can be induced by \ninflammatory signals (e.g., IFN-gamma) and can be expressed on both tumour cells and \ntumour-associated immune cells in tumour microenvironment. PD-L1 blocks T-cell function and \nactivation through interaction with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). By binding to its receptors, PD-L1 reduces \ncytotoxic T-cell activity, proliferation and cytokine production.\n\nDurvalumab is a fully human, immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1\u03ba) monoclonal antibody that \nselectively blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). Durvalumab does not induce \nantibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Selective blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 and \nPD-L1/CD80 interactions enhances antitumour immune responses and increases T-cell activation. \n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nThe efficacy of IMFINZI was evaluated in the PACIFIC Study, a randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled, multicentre study in 713 patients with locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC. \nPatients had completed at least 2 cycles of definitive platinum-based chemotherapy with radiation \ntherapy within 1 to 42 days prior to initiation of the study and had a ECOG performance status of 0 or \n1. Ninety-two percent of patients had received a total dose of 54 to 66 Gy of radiation. The study \nexcluded patients who had progressed following chemoradiation therapy, patients with prior exposure \nto any anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody, patients with active or prior documented autoimmune \ndisease within 2 years of initiation of the study; a history of immunodeficiency; a history of severe \nimmune-mediated adverse reactions; medical conditions that required systemic immunosuppression, \nexcept physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids; active tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or HIV \ninfection or patients receiving live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before or after the start of \nIMFINZI. Patients were randomised 2:1 to receive 10 mg/kg IMFINZI (n = 476) or 10 mg/kg placebo \n(n = 237) via intravenous infusion every 2 weeks for up to 12 months or until unacceptable toxicity or \nconfirmed disease progression. Randomisation was stratified by gender, age (< 65 years vs. \u2265 65 \nyears) and smoking status (smoker vs. non-smoker). Patients with disease control at 12 months were \ngiven the option to be re-treated upon disease progression. Tumour assessments were conducted every \n8 weeks for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks thereafter.\n\nPatients were enrolled regardless of their tumour PD-L1 expression level. Where available, archival \ntumour tissue specimens taken prior to chemoradiation therapy were retrospectively tested for PD-L1 \nexpression on tumour cells (TC) using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) IHC assay. Of the 713 patients \nrandomised, 63% of patients provided a tissue sample of sufficient quality and quantity to determine \nPD-L1 expression and 37% were unknown.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n14\n\nThe demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced between study arms. \nBaseline demographics of the overall study population were as follows: male (70%), age \u2265 65 years \n(45%), age \u2265 75 years (8%), White (69%), Asian (27%), other (4%), current smoker (16%), \npast-smoker (75%), never smoker (9%), ECOG Performance Status 0 (49%), ECOG Performance \nStatus 1 (51%). Disease characteristics were as follows: Stage IIIA (53%), Stage IIIB (45%), \nhistological sub-groups of squamous (46%), non-squamous (54%). Of 451 patients with PD L1 \nexpression available, 67% were TC \u2265 1% [PD-L1 TC 1-24% (32%), PD L1 TC \u2265 25% (35%)] and \n33% were TC < 1%.\n\nThe two primary endpoints of the study were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) \nof IMFINZI vs. placebo. Secondary efficacy endpoints included PFS at 12 months (PFS 12) and 18 \nmonths (PFS 18) from randomisation and Time from Randomisation to Second Progression (PFS2). \nPFS was assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1.\n\nThe study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the IMFINZI-treated group \ncompared with the placebo group [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.52 (95% CI: 0.42, 0.65), p < 0.0001]. The \nstudy demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS in the IMFINZI-treated group\ncompared with the placebo group [HR = 0.68 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.87), p = 0.00251].

The LC13 and C30 were \nassessed at baseline, every 4 weeks for the first 8 weeks, followed by every 8 weeks until completion \nof the treatment period or discontinuation of IMFINZI due to toxicity or disease progression. \nCompliance was similar between the IMFINZI and placebo treatment groups (83% vs 85.1% overall of \nevaluable forms completed).\n\nAt baseline, no differences in patient reported symptoms, function and HRQoL were observed between \nIMFINZI and placebo groups. Throughout the duration of the study to Week 48, there was no \nclinically meaningful difference between IMFINZI and placebo groups in symptoms, functioning and \nHRQoL (as assessed by a difference of greater than or equal to 10 points).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \ndurvalumab in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of malignant neoplasms (except \ncentral nervous system tumours, haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue neoplasms) (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe PK of durvalumab was studied in 1902 patients with solid tumours with doses ranging from 0.1 to \n20 mg/kg administered intravenously once every two, three or four weeks. PK exposure increased \nmore than dose-proportionally (non-linear PK) at doses < 3 mg/kg, and dose proportionally (linear PK) \nat doses \u2265 3 mg/kg. Steady state was achieved at approximately 16 weeks. Based on population PK \nanalysis that included 1878 patients in the dose range of  \u2265 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, the geometric \nmean steady state volume of distribution (Vss) was 5.64 L. Durvalumab clearance (CL) decreased over \ntime resulting in a geometric mean steady state clearance (CLss) of 8.16 mL/h at Day 365; the decrease \nin CLss was not considered clinically relevant. The terminal half-life (t1/2), based on baseline CL, was \napproximately 18 days. The primary elimination pathways of durvalumab are protein catabolism via \nreticuloendothelial system or target mediated disposition.\n\nSpecial populations\nAge (19\u201396 years), body weight (34-149 kg), gender, positive anti-drug antibody (ADA) status, \nalbumin levels, LDH levels, creatinine levels, soluble PD-L1, tumour type, race or ECOG status had \nno clinically significant effect on the PK of durvalumab.\n\nPatients with renal impairment\nMild (creatinine clearance (CrCL) 60 to 89 mL/min) and moderate renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance (CrCL) 30 to 59 mL/min) had no clinically significant effect on the PK of durvalumab.The \neffect of severe renal impairment (CrCL 15 to 29 mL/min) on the PK of durvalumab is unknown.\n\nPatients with hepatic impairment\nMild hepatic impairment (bilirubin \u2264 ULN and AST > ULN or bilirubin > 1.0 to 1.5 \u00d7 ULN and any \nAST) had no clinically significant effect on the PK of durvalumab. The effect of moderate hepatic \nimpairment (bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 x ULN and any AST) or severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin \n> 3.0 x ULN and any AST) on the pharmacokinetics of durvalumab is unknown; however, as IgG \nmonoclonal antibodies are not primarily cleared via hepatic pathways, a change in hepatic function is \nnot expected to influence durvalumab exposure.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nCarcinogenicity and mutagenicity\nThe carcinogenic and genotoxic potential of durvalumab has not been evaluated.\n\nReproductive toxicology\n\n\n\n19\n\nAs reported in the literature, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a central role in preserving pregnancy by \nmaintaining maternal immune tolerance to the foetus, and in mouse allogeneic pregnancy models \ndisruption of PD-L1 signalling was shown to result in an increase in foetal loss. In animal reproduction \nstudies, administration of durvalumab to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys from the confirmation of \npregnancy through delivery, at exposure levels approximately 18 times higher than those observed at \nthe clinical dose of 10 mg/kg of durvalumab (based on AUC), was associated with placental transfer \nbut not with maternal toxicity or effects on embryofoetal development, pregnancy outcome or \npostnatal development. Negligible levels of durvalumab was found in milk of cynomolgous monkey \non Day 28 after birth.\n\n6.

The concentrate is a clear to opalescent, colourless to \nslightly yellow solution, free from visible particles. Discard the vial if the solution is cloudy, \ndiscoloured or visible particles are observed.\n\n\u2022 Do not shake the vial.\n\u2022 Withdraw the required volume of concentrate from the vial(s) and transfer into an intravenous \n\nbag containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose 50 mg/mL\n(5%) solution for injection, to prepare a diluted solution with a final concentration ranging from \n1 to 15 mg/mL. Mix diluted solution by gentle inversion.\n\n\n\n36\n\n\u2022 The medicinal product, once diluted, should be used immediately. The diluted solution must not \nbe frozen. If not used immediately, the total time from vial puncture to start of the \nadministration should not exceed 24 hours at 2 \u00baC to 8 \u00baC or 12 hours at room temperature (up to \n25 \u00baC). If refrigerated, intravenous bags must be allowed to come to room temperature prior to \nuse. Administer the infusion solution intravenously over 60 minutes using a sterile, low-protein \nbinding 0.2 or 0.22 micron in-line filter.\n\n\u2022 Do not co-administer other medicinal products through the same infusion line.\n\n\u2022 IMFINZI is single-dose. Discard any unused portion left in the vial.\n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements.\n\n\n\n37\n\nANNEX IV\n\nSCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS \n\nOF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S) \n\n\n\n38\n\nScientific conclusions\n\nTaking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for durvalumab, the scientific \n\nconclusions of CHMP are as follows: \n\nFurther to a PRAC request, the MAH submitted a cumulative safety review and analysis of \n\nneurological immune-mediated adverse events reported with durvalumab from all sources. In view of \n\nthe available data and considering the safety profile of other medicinal products of the same class, the \n\nPRAC concluded that the product information of durvalumab should be amended. \n\nSections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC are updated to reflect that cases of meningitis, encephalitis and \n\nGuillain-Barre syndrome have been reported with durvalumab in ongoing and completed trials. The \n\nPackage leaflet has been updated accordingly.\n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.\n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)\n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for durvalumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the \n\nbenefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing durvalumab is unchanged subject to the \n\nproposed changes to the product information.\n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
