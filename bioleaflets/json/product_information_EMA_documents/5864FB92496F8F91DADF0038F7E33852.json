NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nCelvapan suspension for injection \nInfluenza vaccine (H1N1)v (whole virion, Vero cell derived, inactivated) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nWhole virion influenza vaccine, inactivated containing antigen of strain *: \n \nA/California/07/2009 (H1N1)v 7.5 micrograms** \nper 0.5 ml dose \n \n* propagated in Vero cells (continuous cell line of mammalian origin) \n** expressed in micrograms haemagglutinin. \n \nThis is a multidose container. See section 6.5 for the number of doses per vial. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \n \nThe vaccine is a clear to opalescent, translucent suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza caused by A(H1N1)v 2009 virus (See section 4.4). \n \nCelvapan should be used in accordance with Official Guidance \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe dose recommendations take into account available data from clinical studies in healthy subjects \nwho received two doses of Celvapan (H1N1)v. \n \nFrom clinical studies limited immunogenicity and safety data are available for Celvapan (H1N1)v in \nhealthy adult and older subjects and in children (see section 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1). \n \nAdults and older people \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks. \n \nChildren and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks. \n \nChildren aged 6 to 35 months \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \nChildren aged less than 6 months \nVaccination is not currently recommended in this age group. \n \nFor further information, see sections 4.8 and 5.1. \n \nIt is recommended that subjects who receive a first dose of Celvapan, complete the vaccination course \nwith Celvapan (see section 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection preferably into the deltoid muscle or \nanterolateral thigh, depending on the muscle mass. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues \n(e.g. formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose) of this vaccine. \n \nSee section 4.4 for Special warnings and special precautions for use. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe vaccine can only be expected to protect against influenza caused by \nA/California/07/2009 (H1N1)v-like strains. \n \nCaution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity \n(other than anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance(s), to any of the excipients and to trace \nresidues e.g. formaldehyde, benzonase, or sucrose. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following CELVAPAN \nvaccination (see section 4.8). Such reactions have occurred both in patients with a history of multiple \nallergies and in patients with no known allergy. \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nImmunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile illness or acute infection. \n \nCelvapan should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \n \nThere are no data with Celvapan using the subcutaneous route. Therefore, healthcare providers need to \nassess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with \nthrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless \nthe potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings. \n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \nA protective response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). \n \nThere are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of Celvapan with \nother (H1N1)v vaccines. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThere are no data on co-administration of Celvapan with other vaccines. However, if \nco-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on \nseparate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant \ntreatment. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA \nmethod for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus, and especially, \nHTLV-1. In such cases, the Western Blot method is negative. These transitory false-positive results \nmay be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nThe safety of Celvapan in pregnancy and lactation has been assessed in a limited number of pregnant \nwomen. \n \nData from pregnant women vaccinated with different inactivated non-adjuvanted seasonal vaccines do \nnot suggest malformations or fetal or neonatal toxicity. \n \nAnimal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies with H5N1 strain vaccines \n(A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005) do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects \nwith respect to female fertility, pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or post-natal \ndevelopment (see section 5.3). \n \nThe use of Celvapan may be considered during pregnancy if this is thought to be necessary, taking into \naccount official recommendations. \n \nCelvapan may be used in lactating women. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome undesirable effects mentioned under section 4.8 “Undesirable effects” may affect the ability to \ndrive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n Clinical trials with Celvapan (H1N1)v \n \nAdults and Older People \n \nIn a clinical study the 7.5 µg dose of Celvapan (H1N1)v was administered to adults \naged 18 to 59 years (N = 101) and older people over 60 years of age (N = 101). Safety data after the \nfirst and second vaccination suggest a similar safety profile to that reported for the influenza vaccines \nusing a H5N1 strain. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nAdverse reactions from clinical trials with Celvapan (H1N1)v in a healthy adult and older people are \nlisted in the table below. \n \n\nClinical Adverse Reactions (H1N1)v Studies \nSystem Organ Class (SOC) Preferred MedDRA Term Frequency1 \n\nINFECTIONS AND INFESTATIONS Nasopharyngitis Common \nPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS Insomnia Common \nNERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS Headache \n\nDizziness \nVery Common \nCommon \n\nEYE DISORDERS Eye irritation Common \nRESPIRATORY, THORACIC AND \nMEDIASTINAL DISORDERS \n\nPharyngolaryngeal pain Common \n\nGASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS Abdominal pain Common \nSKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS \nTISSUE DISORDERS \n\nHyperhidrosis \nRash \nUrticaria \n\nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \n\nMUSCULOSKELETAL AND \nCONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDERS \n\nArthralgia \nMyalgia \n\nCommon \nCommon \n\nGENERAL DISORDERS AND \nADMINISTRATION SITE \nCONDITIONS \n\nFatigue \nPyrexia \nChills \nMalaise \nInjection site reactions \n Injection site pain \n Injection site induration \n Injection site erythema \n Injection site swelling \n Injection site movement impairment \n\nVery Common \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \n \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \nCommon \n\nADR frequency is based upon the following scale: Very Common (≥ 1/10); Common (≥ 1/100 - \n< 1/10), Uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 - < 1/100), Rare (≥ 1/10,000 - < 1/1,000), Very Rare (< 1/10,000) \n \nChildren and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age \n \nIn a clinical trial 51 children and adolescents aged 9 to 17 years and 51 children aged 3 to 8 years were \nadministered the 7.5 µg dose of Celvapan (H1N1)v.

Younger children 6 months to 9 years \nreceived Celvapan, while older children from 9 to 18 years of age received an adjuvanted split \npandemic vaccine. There were no reported vaccine failures in either of these paediatric age groups. \nCrude vaccine effectiveness of one dose of pandemic vaccine among children was 100% (95% \nCI: 70-100%). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-Clinical data obtained with Celvapan containing a H5N1 vaccine strain demonstrated alterations \nin liver enzymes and calcium levels in repeat dose toxicity studies in rats.

What Celvapan is and what it is used for \n \nCelvapan is a vaccine to prevent influenza (flu) caused by A(H1N1)v 2009 virus \n \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defense system) will \nproduce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can \ncause flu. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive Celvapan \n \nYou should not receive Celvapan: \n \n if you previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of Celvapan \n\nor to any of the substances that may be present in trace amounts as follows: formaldehyde, \nbenzonase, sucrose. \n- Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling \n\nof the face or tongue. \n \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine. \n\n \nTake special care with Celvapan: \n \nCheck with your doctor or nurse before you are given Celvapan if \n \n you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any \n\ningredient contained in the vaccine, to formaldehyde, benzonase, or to sucrose. (see section 6. \nFurther information). \n\n you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38 °C). If this applies to you then \nyour vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such \nas a cold should not be problem, but your doctor or nurse should advise whether you could still \nbe vaccinated with Celvapan. \n\n you have problems with your immune system, since your response to the vaccine may then \nbe poor. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\n you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first few \nweeks after vaccination with Celvapan the results of these tests may not be correct. Tell the \ndoctor requesting these tests that you have recently been given Celvapan. \n\n you have a bleeding condition or a bleeding problem or you bruise easily. \n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before having \nCelvapan. This is because the vaccination may not be recommended, or may need to be delayed. \n \nOther medicines and Celvapan \n \nPlease tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription or have recently been given any other vaccine. \n \nThere is no information on administration of the vaccine Celvapan with other vaccines. However, if \nthis cannot be avoided, the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs. In such cases, you should \nbe aware that the side effects may be more intense. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby. Your \ndoctor will discuss with you whether you should be given Celvapan. \n \nThe vaccine may be used during breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nSome effects mentioned under section 4. “Possible side effects” may affect your ability to drive or use \nmachines. \n \n \n3. How Celvapan is given \n \nYour doctor or nurse will administer the vaccine in accordance with official recommendations. \nThe vaccine will be injected into a muscle (usually in the upper arm). The vaccine should never be \ngiven into a vein. \n \nAdults and older people: \n \nA dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine will be given. \nA second dose of the vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks. \n \nChildren and adolescents aged 6 months to 17 years of age: \n \nA dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine will be given. \nA second dose of the vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks. \n \nChildren aged less than 6 months: \n \nVaccination is not currently recommended in this age group. \n \nWhen Celvapan is given for the first dose, it is recommended that Celvapan (and not another vaccine \nagainst (H1N1)v) be given for the complete vaccination course. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Celvapan can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\n \nAllergic reactions may occur following vaccination, in rare cases leading to shock. Doctors are aware \nof this possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases. \n \nSide effects from clinical studies in adults and older people \n \nThe side effects listed below have occurred with Celvapan (H1N1)v in clinical studies in adults, \nincluding older people. In the clinical studies, most side effects were mild in nature and short term. \n \nVery common: \n \n Headache \n Feeling tired \n \nCommon: \n \n Runny nose and sore throat \n Insomnia (difficulty sleeping) \n Dizziness \n Eye irritation \n Stomach pain \n Increased sweating \n Rash, hives \n Joint and muscle pain \n Fever, shivering, generally feeling unwell \n Pain, redness, swelling or a hard lump where the injection was given, reduced movement in the \n\narm injected \n \nSide effects from clinical studies in children \n \nChildren and adolescents 6 months to 17 years of age \n \nIn a clinical study the frequency and type of side effects after the first and second injection were \nbasically similar to that seen in the adult and older population using Celvapan.
