NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nPravafenix 40 mg/160 mg hard capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach hard capsule contains 40 mg pravastatin sodium and 160 mg fenofibrate. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect:  \nEach hard capsule contains 19 mg of lactose monohydrate.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule. \n \nHard capsule, with light green body and olive cap, containing a waxy white beige mass and a tablet. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPravafenix is indicated as an adjunct to diet and other non-pharmacological treatment (e.g. exercise, \nweight reduction) for the treatment of mixed hyperlipidaemia in adult patients at high cardiovascular \nrisk to reduce triglycerides and increase HDL-C when LDL-C levels are adequately controlled while \non a treatment with pravastatin 40 mg monotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPrior to initiating Pravafenix, secondary causes of combined dyslipidaemia should be excluded and \npatients should be placed on a standard cholesterol and triglycerides-lowering diet which should be \ncontinued during treatment. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose is one capsule per day. Dietary restrictions instituted before therapy should be \ncontinued. \n \nResponse to therapy should be monitored by determination of serum lipid values. Rapid reduction of \nserum lipid levels usually follows Pravafenix treatment, but treatment should be discontinued if an \nadequate response has not been achieved within three months. \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly patients (\u2265 65 years old) \nTreatment initiation with Pravafenix should be decided after renal function has been evaluated (see \nsection 4.4 Renal and urinary disorders). Limited safety data on Pravafenix is available in patients >75 \nyears of age and care should be exercised.  \n \nRenal impairment \n \nPravafenix is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a \ncreatinine clearance < 60 ml/min) (see section 4.3.) \nNo modification of posology should be necessary in patients with mild renal impairment. \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n \nHepatic impairment \nPravafenix is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and is contraindicated in \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3.). No posology adjustment is required in \npatients with mild hepatic impairment. \n \nPaediatric population (< 18 years old) \nThere is no relevant use of Pravafenix in the paediatric population (< 18 years old) for the indication \nof mixed dyslipidaemia (see section 4.3). \n \nMethod of administration \nOral use. \nThe recommended dose is one capsule taken daily during the evening meal. Since it is less well \nabsorbed from an empty stomach, Pravafenix should always be taken with food (see sections 4.5. and \n5.2).  \n \n4.3 Contraindications  \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Severe hepatic impairment including biliary cirrhosis or active liver disease including unexplained \n\npersistent elevations in liver function tests (including serum transaminase elevation) exceeding 3 \nfold the upper limit of normal (ULN) (see section 4.4). \n\n- Children and adolescents (age below 18 years). \n- Moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as an estimated creatinine clearance < 60 ml/min).  \n- Known photo allergy or photo toxic reaction during treatment with fibrates or ketoprofen. \n- Gallbladder disease (see section 4.4). \n- Chronic or acute pancreatitis with the exception of acute pancreatitis due to severe \n\nhypertriglyceridaemia (see section 4.4). \n- Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n- Personal history of myopathy and/or rhabdomyolysis with statins and/or fibrates or confirmed \n\ncreatine phosphokinase (CK) elevation above 5 times the ULN under previous statin treatment \n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe pharmacokinetics properties of Pravafenix are not completely identical to the co-administration of \nthe existing monotherapies when taken with fat-meal or in fasting state. Patients should not be \nswitched from a free co-administration of fenofibrate and pravastatin preparation to Pravafenix (see \nsection 5.2.). \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders  \nAs with other lipid lowering substances, pravastatin or fenofibrate have been associated with the onset \nof myalgia, myopathy and very rarely rhabdomyolysis with or without secondary renal insufficiency. \nRhabdomyolysis is an acute potentially fatal condition of skeletal muscle, which may develop at any \ntime during treatment and is characterised by massive muscle destruction associated with major \nincrease in CK (usually > 30 or 40 times the ULN) leading to myoglobinuria.  \n \nThe risk of muscle toxicity is increased when a fibrate and a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-\nCoenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor are administered together. Myopathy must be \nconsidered in any patient presenting with unexplained muscle symptoms such as pain or tenderness, \nmuscle weakness, or muscle cramps. In such cases CK levels should be measured (see below).  \n \nConsequently, the potential benefit/risk ratio of Pravafenix should be closely assessed before treatment \ninitiation and patients should be monitored for any signs of muscle toxicity. Certain predisposing \nfactors such as age > 70, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, hypothyroidism, personal history of \nmuscular toxicity with a statin or fibrate, personal or familial history of hereditary muscular disorders \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nor alcohol abuse may increase the risk of muscular toxicity and therefore CK measurement is indicated \nbefore starting the combination therapy in these patients (see below). \n \nStatins including pravastatin must not be co-administered with systemic formulations of fusidic acid or \nwithin 7 days of stopping fusidic acid treatment. In patients where the use of systemic fusidic acid is \nconsidered essential, statin treatment should be discontinued throughout the duration of fusidic acid \ntreatment. There have been reports of rhabdomyolysis (including some fatalities) in patients receiving \nfusidic acid and statins in combination (see section 4.5). The patient should be advised to seek medical \nadvice immediately if they experience any symptoms of muscle weakness, pain or tenderness.  \nStatin therapy may be re-introduced seven days after the last dose of fusidic acid.  \nIn exceptional circumstances, where prolonged systemic fusidic acid is needed, e.g., for the treatment \nof severe infections, the need for co-administration of Pravafenix and fusidic acid should only be \nconsidered on a case by case basis and under close medical supervision.  \nBefore treatment initiation  \nCK levels should be measured prior to initiation of therapy. The baseline CK levels may also be useful \nas a reference in the event of a later increase during the combination therapy. When measured, CK \nlevels should be interpreted in the context of other potential factors that can cause transient muscle \ndamage, such as strenuous exercise or muscle trauma and repeated if necessary.  \n \nIf CK levels are significantly elevated > 5 times the ULN at baseline, the results should be controlled \nafter 5-7 days. If confirmed, the treatment should definitively not be initiated (see section 4.3).  \n \nDuring treatment \nRoutine monitoring of CK is systematically recommended every 3 months during the first 12 months \nof the combination therapy and let to the appreciation of the clinician beyond this initial period.  \nPatients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, weakness or \ncramps. In these cases, CK levels should be measured.  \n \nIf a markedly elevated (> 5 times the ULN) CK level is detected and confirmed, Pravafenix therapy \nmust be discontinued. Treatment discontinuation should also be considered if the muscular symptoms \nare severe and cause daily discomfort (whatever CK levels). If a hereditary muscular disease is \nsuspected in such patients, restarting Pravafenix therapy is not recommended. \n \nThere have been very rare reports of an immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) during or \nafter treatment with some statins. IMNM is clinically characterized by persistent proximal muscle \nweakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment. \n \nHepatobiliary disorders  \nAs with other lipid lowering medicinal products, moderate increases in transaminase levels have been \nreported in some patients treated with pravastatin or fenofibrate. In the majority of cases, liver \ntransaminase levels have returned to their baseline value without the need for treatment \ndiscontinuation.  \nIt is recommended that transaminase levels be monitored every 3 months during the first 12 months of \ntreatment and let to the appreciation of the clinician beyond this initial period.  \nSpecial attention should be paid to patients who develop increase in transaminase levels and therapy \nshould be discontinued if increases in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase \n(ALT) exceed 3 times the ULN and persist. \nCaution should be exercised when Pravafenix is administered to patients with a history of liver disease \nor heavy alcohol ingestion. \n \nPancreatitis \nPancreatitis has been reported in patients taking fenofibrate or pravastatin (see sections 4.3). This \noccurrence may represent a failure of efficacy in patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia, a direct \nmedicinal product effect, or a secondary phenomenon mediated through biliary tract stone or sludge \nformation, resulting in the obstruction of the common bile duct. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \nPravafenix is contraindicated in moderate to severe renal impairment (section 4.3). \nIt is recommended to systematically assess the estimated creatinine clearance at the initiation of the \ntreatment and every 3 months during the first 12 months of the combination therapy then let to the \nappreciation of the clinician beyond this period.  \n \nTreatment should be discontinued in case of an estimated creatinine clearance < 60 ml/min. \n \nInterstitial lung disease \nExceptional cases of interstitial lung disease have been reported with some statins, especially with \nlong term therapy (see section 4.8). Presenting features can include dyspnoea, non-productive cough \nand deterioration in general health (fatigue, weight loss and fever). If it is suspected a patient has \ndeveloped interstitial lung disease, Pravafenix therapy should be discontinued. \n \nCholelithiasis \nFenofibrate may increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, potentially leading to cholelithiasis. If \ncholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated. Pravafenix should be discontinued if \ngallstones are found.  \n \nVenothromboembolic events \nIn the FIELD study, a statistically significant increase was reported in the incidence of pulmonary \nembolism (0.7% in the placebo group versus 1.1% in the fenofibrate group; p=0.022) and a \nstatistically non significant increase in deep vein thrombosis (placebo 1.0% 48/4,900 patients) versus \nfenofibrate 1.4% (67/4,895); p=0.074. The increased risk of venous thrombotic events may be related \nto the increased homocysteine level, a risk factor for thrombosis and other unidentified factors. The \nclinical significance of this is not clear. Therefore, caution should be exercised in patients with history \nof pulmonary embolism.   \n \nDiabetes Mellitus \nSome evidence suggests that statins as a class raise blood glucose and in some patients, at high risk of \nfuture diabetes, may produce a level of hyperglycaemia where formal diabetes care is appropriate. \nThis risk, however, is outweighed by the reduction in vascular risk with statins and therefore should \nnot be a reason for stopping statin treatment. Patients at risk (fasting glucose 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L, \nBMI>30kg/m 2, raised triglycerides, hypertension) should be monitored both clinically and \nbiochemically according to national guidelines. \n \nConcomitant use with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir \nThe use of Pravafenix is not recommended in patients treated with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir. \nConcomitant use of pravastatin and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir may increase the plasma concentration of \npravastatin and may lead to an increase of dose-dependent adverse events including myopathy risk. \nPatients treated with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir should not exceed 20 mg per day of pravastatin. \n \nLactose \nThis medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThere have been no formal interaction studies for Pravafenix; however the concomitant use of the \nactive substances in patients in clinical studies has not resulted in any unexpected interactions. The \nfollowing statements reflect the information available on the individual active substances (fenofibrate \nand pravastatin). \n \nInteractions relevant to pravastatin  \nColestyramine/Colestipol \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nConcomitant administration resulted in approximately 40 to 50% decrease in the bioavailability of \npravastatin. There was no clinically significant decrease in bioavailability or therapeutic effect when \npravastatin was administered one hour before or four hours after colestyramine or one hour before \ncolestipol.  \n \nCiclosporin \nConcomitant administration of pravastatin and ciclosporin leads to an approximately 4 fold increase in \npravastatin systemic exposure. In some patients, however, the increase in pravastatin exposure may be \nlarger. Clinical and biochemical monitoring of patients receiving this combination is recommended. \n \nMedicinal products metabolised by cytochrome P450 \nPravastatin is not metabolised to a clinically significant extent by the cytochrome P450 system. This is \nwhy medicinal products that are metabolised by, or are inhibitors of, the cytochrome P450 system can \nbe added to a stable regimen of pravastatin without causing significant changes in the plasma levels of \npravastatin, as have been seen with other statins. The absence of a significant pharmacokinetic \ninteraction with pravastatin has been specifically demonstrated for several medicinal products, \nparticularly those that are substrates/inhibitors of CYP3A4 e.g. diltiazem, verapamil, itraconazole, \nketoconazole, protease inhibitors, grapefruit juice and CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g. fluconazole).  \n \nIn one of two interaction studies with pravastatin and erythromycin a statistically significant increase \nin the area under the curve (AUC) (70%) and Cmax (121%) of pravastatin was observed. In a similar \nstudy with clarithromycin a statistically significant increase in AUC (110%) and Cmax (127%) was \nobserved. Although these changes were minor, caution should be exercised when associating \npravastatin with erythromycin or clarithromycin.  \n \nFusidic acid \nThe risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis may be increased by the concomitant administration \nof systemic fusidic acid with statins. The mechanism of this interaction (whether it is \npharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic, or both) is yet unknown. There have been reports of \nrhabdomyolysis (including some fatalities) in patients receiving this combination.  \nIf treatment with systemic fusidic acid is necessary, pravastatin treatment should be discontinued \nthroughout the duration of the fusidic acid treatment. Also see section 4.4.  \nGlecaprevir/pibrentasvir \nConcomitant use of pravastatin and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir may increase the plasma concentration of \npravastatin and may lead to an increase of dose-dependent adverse events including myopathy risk. \nPatients treated with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir should not exceed 20 mg per day of pravastatin. \nTherefore Pravafenix is not recommended in those patients. \n \nOther medicinal products \nIn interaction studies, no statistically significant differences in bioavailability were observed when \npravastatin was administered with acetylsalicylic acid, antacids (when given one hour prior to \npravastatin), nicotinic acid or probucol. \n \nInteractions relevant to fenofibrate \nBile acid resin \nBile acid binding resins frequently reduce the absorption of medicinal products and when resins are \nbeing co-administered, fenofibrate should be taken 1 hour before, or 4 to 6 hours after, the resin so as \nnot to impede the absorption of fenofibrate. \n \nOral anticoagulants \nFenofibrate enhances oral anticoagulant effect and may increase risk of bleeding. It is recommended \nthat the dose of anticoagulants is reduced by about one third at the start of treatment and then \ngradually adjusted if necessary according to INR (International Normalised Ratio) monitoring. This \ncombination is, therefore, not recommended.  \n \nCiclosporin \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nSome severe cases of reversible renal function impairment have been reported during concomitant \nadministration of fenofibrate and ciclosporin. The renal function of these patients must therefore be \nclosely monitored and the treatment with fenofibrate stopped in the case of severe alteration of \nlaboratory parameters. \n \nFood interaction \nPravafenix must be taken with food, as food enhances the bioavailability of fenofibrate (see sections \n4.2 and 5.2). \n \nIn all clinical trials, patients were instructed to take Pravafenix daily during the evening meal and \ndietary restrictions instituted before therapy should be continued. Since current safety and efficacy \ndata are based upon administration with food and with dietary restrictions, it is recommended that \nPravafenix is administered with food. (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nPravafenix \nThere are no data from the combined use of pravastatin and fenofibrate in pregnant women. The \ncombination has not been tested in reproductive toxicity studies. The potential risk for humans is \nunknown. Therefore, as far as pravastatin is contra indicated (see below), Pravafenix is contraindicated \nduring pregnancy (see section 4.3). \n \nPravastatin sodium \nPravastatin is contraindicated during pregnancy and should be administered to women of childbearing \npotential only when such patients are unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential \nrisk. Special caution is recommended in women of childbearing potential to ensure proper \nunderstanding of the potential risk associated with pravastatin therapy during pregnancy. If a patient \nplans to become pregnant or becomes pregnant, the physician has to be informed immediately and \npravastatin should be discontinued because of the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nFenofibrate \nThere are no data from the use of fenofibrate in pregnant women. Animal studies have not \ndemonstrated any teratogenic effects. Embryotoxic effects have been shown at doses in the range of \nmaternal toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n \nBreastfeeding \nPravafenix \nNo studies in lactating animals have been conducted with Pravafenix. Therefore, taking into account \nthe contra indication of pravastatin during lactation, Pravafenix is contraindicated during breastfeeding \n(see section 4.3). \n \nPravastatin sodium \nA small amount of pravastatin is excreted in human breast milk; therefore pravastatin is \ncontraindicated during breastfeeding (see section 4.3). \n \nFenofibrate \n\nFenofibrate is excreted in milk of female rat. \nThere are no data on the excretion of fenofibrate and/or its metabolites into human breast milk. \n \nFertility \n\nNo effect on fertility in reproductive toxicity studies have been observed with both fenofibrate and \npravastatin (see section 5.3) \nThere are no data on fertility from the combined use of fenofibrate and pravastatin  \n \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPravafenix has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, when \ndriving vehicles or using machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness and visual \ndisturbances may occur during treatment. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions (ADRs) during Pravafenix therapy are increased \ntransaminase and gastrointestinal disorders. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nIn clinical trials, over 1,566 patients received Pravafenix.

In the same study, a statistically significant increase was reported in the incidence of \npulmonary embolism (0.7% in the placebo group versus 1.1% in the fenofibrate group; p = 0.022) and \na statistically non-significant increase in deep vein thromboses (placebo: 1.0 % [48/4,900 patients] \nversus fenofibrate 1.4% [67/4,895 patients]; p = 0.074). \n \nThe following adverse events have been reported with some statins: \n- Nightmares \n- Memory loss \n- Depression \n- Exceptional cases of interstitial lung disease, especially with long term therapy (see section 4.4). \n- Diabetes Mellitus: Frequency will depend on the presence or absence of risk factors (fasting blood \n\nglucose \u2265 5.6 mmol/L, BMI>30kg/m2, raised triglycerides, history of hypertension). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn the event of an overdose, symptomatic and supportive measures should be employed. \n \nPravastatin \nReported cases of overdose were asymptomatic and did not give rise to abnormal laboratory tests. No \nspecific antidote is known. If overdose is suspected, treat symptomatically and institute appropriate \nsupportive measures as required.  \n \nFenofibrate \nNo specific antidote is known. If an overdose is suspected, treat symptomatically and institute \nappropriate supportive measures as required. Fenofibrate cannot be eliminated by haemodialysis.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Lipid modifying agents, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors in combination \nwith other lipid modifying agents, ATC code: C10BA03 \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nPravafenix contains fenofibrate and pravastatin, which have different modes of action and show \nadditive effects in terms of reduction of serum lipid. The following statements reflect the \npharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic properties of the individual active substances of Pravafenix. \n \nFenofibrate \nFenofibrate is a fibric acid derivative whose lipid modifying effects reported in humans are mediated \nvia activation of Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor type alpha (PPAR\u03b1). Studies with \nfenofibrate on lipoprotein fractions show decreases in levels of LDL and VLDL cholesterol. HDL \ncholesterol levels are frequently increased. LDL and VLDL triglycerides are reduced. The overall \neffect is a decrease in the ratio of low and very low-density lipoproteins to high-density lipoproteins. \n \nThe lipid-lowering properties of fenofibrate seen in clinical practice have been explained in vivo in \ntransgenic mice and in human hepatocyte cultures by activation of Peroxisome Proliferator Activated \nReceptor type \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1). Through this mechanism, fenofibrate increases lipolysis and elimination of \ntriglyceride rich particles from plasma by activating lipoprotein lipase and reducing production of \nApoprotein C-III. Activation of PPAR\u03b1 also induces an increase in the synthesis of Apoproteins A-I, \nA-II and of HDL cholesterol.  \n \nThere is evidence that treatment with fibrates may reduce coronary heart disease events but they have \nnot been shown to decrease all cause mortality in the primary or secondary prevention of \ncardiovascular disease.  \n \nThe Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) lipid trial was a randomized \nplacebo-controlled study of 5,518 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with fenofibrate in \naddition to simvastatin. Fenofibrate plus simvastatin therapy did not show any significant differences \ncompared to simvastatin monotherapy in the composite primary outcome of non-fatal myocardial \ninfarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.79-1.08, p = \n0.32 ; absolute risk reduction: 0.74%). In the pre-specified subgroup of dyslipidaemic patients, defined \nas those in the lowest tertile of HDL-C (\u226434 mg/dl or 0.88 mmol/L) and highest tertile of TG (\u2265204 \nmg/dl or 2.3 mmol/L) at baseline, fenofibrate plus simvastatin therapy demonstrated a 31% relative \nreduction compared to simvastatin monotherapy for the composite primary outcome (hazard ratio \n[HR] 0.69, 95% CI 0.49-0.97, p = 0.03 ; absolute risk reduction: 4.95%). Another prespecified \nsubgroup analysis identified a statistically significant treatment-by-gender interaction (p = 0.01) \nindicating a possible treatment benefit of combination therapy in men (p=0.037) but a potentially \nhigher risk for the primary outcome in women treated with combination therapy compared to \nsimvastatin monotherapy (p=0.069). This was not observed in the aforementioned subgroup of patients \nwith dyslipidaemia but there was also no clear evidence of benefit in dyslipidaemic women treated \nwith fenofibrate plus simvastatin, and a possible harmful effect in this subgroup could not be \nexcluded. \n \nPlasma uric acid levels are increased in approximately 20% of hyperlipidaemic patients, particularly in \nthose with type IV disease. Fenofibrate has a uricosuric effect and is therefore of additional benefit in \nsuch patients.  \n \nPravastatin \nPravastatin is a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) \nreductase, the enzyme catalysing the early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis, and produces \nits lipid-lowering effect in two ways. Firstly, with the reversible and specific competitive inhibition of \nHMG-CoA reductase, it effects modest reduction in the synthesis of intracellular cholesterol. This \nresults in an increase in the number of LDL-receptors on cell surfaces and enhanced receptor-mediated \ncatabolism and clearance of circulating LDL-cholesterol. \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n \nSecondly, pravastatin inhibits LDL production by inhibiting the hepatic synthesis of VLDL-\ncholesterol, the LDL-cholesterol precursor. \n \nIn both healthy subjects and patients with hypercholesterolaemia, pravastatin lowers the following \nlipid values: total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, VLDL-cholesterol and triglycerides; \nwhile HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A are elevated. \n \nPravafenix \nThe respective effects of pravastatin and fenofibrate are complementary. Pravastatin is more effective \nin reducing LDL-C and total cholesterol but presents only modest effects on TG and HDL-C while \nfenofibrate is very effective in decreasing TG and increasing HDL-C, but with few effects on LDL-C.  \n Additionally, fibrates have the properties to modify the size and density of LDL-C particles to make \nthem less atherogenic. \nFibrates and statins in combination have also been shown to synergistically increase the transcriptional \nactivities of PPAR\u03b1 receptors. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety  \n \nFour multicenter studies with either Pravafenix 40 mg/160 mg or Pravastatin 40 mg or Simvastatin \n20 mg were conducted: 3 studies included a 12 week randomized, double-blind, active controlled \nperiod with an open-label extension phase and one was a 24-week open-label study.  \nIn total, these studies enrolled 1,637 patients who have not had an adequate response to treatment with \npravastatin 40 mg monotherapy or simvastatin 20 mg in Europe and in the USA.  \n \nIn the pivotal European multicenter 64-week clinical trial including 12 week randomised, double-\nblind, double-dummy, 2-arm, parallel study period, 248 high vascular risk patients with mixed \ndyslipidaemia were randomised to one of the two treatment groups: Pravafenix 40 mg/160 mg or \npravastatin 40 mg. Only patients who had not met their NCEP ATP III target LDL-C and Triglyceride \ngoals (LDL >100 mg/dl and TG >150 mg/dl) after 8 weeks on pravastatin 40 mg (1 tablet, once daily) \nwere randomized. Patients receiving Pravafenix 40 mg/160 mg were compared to those receiving \npravastatin 40 mg: Pravafenix significantly lowered non-HDL-C, LDL-C, TG and significantly \nincreased HDL-C to a greater extent than pravastatin 40 mg (table). \n \n\nMean percent changes from baseline to week 12 \nfor patients treated with Pravafenix  40 mg/160 mg or Pravastatin 40 mg once daily \n\n \n\n \n\nPravafenix  \n40 mg/160 mg \n\nNa = 120 \nPRAVASTATIN 40 mg \n\nNa = 119 \nPravafenix  versus \nPRAVASTATIN \n\nMean (%)\u00b1 SEb Mean (%)\u00b1 SEb p-valuec \nNon-HDL-C \n(mg/dl) -14.1 \u00b1 1.78 -6.1 \u00b1 1.79 0.0018 \n\nLDL-C (mg/dl) -11.7 \u00b1 1.75 -5.9 \u00b1 1.76 0.019 \nHDL-C (mg/dl) +6.5 \u00b1 1.12 +2.3 \u00b1 1.13 0.0089 \nTG (mg/dl) -22.6 \u00b1 4.37 -2.0 \u00b1 4.39 0.0010 \nTC (mg/dl) -9.9 \u00b1 1.37 -4.4 \u00b1 1.38 0.006 \nApo A1 (g/L) +5.5 \u00b1 0.99 +2.8 \u00b1 0.97 0.058 \nApo B (g/L) -12.6 \u00b1 1.57 -3.8 \u00b1 1.53 <0.0001 \nApo B/Apo A1 -16.3 \u00b1 1.66 -6.0 \u00b1 1.61 <0.0001 \nFibrinogen (g/L) -8.8 \u00b1 1.80 +1.4 \u00b1 1.75 <0.0001 \nHs-CRP (mg/L) -1.1 \u00b1 0.61 +0.6 \u00b1 0.70 0.003 \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\na Number of patients \nb Mean percent change (least square mean \u00b1 standard error) between baseline measured after 8 \nweeks on Pravastatin 40 mg and 12 additional weeks with Pravafenix  40 mg/160 mg or \nPravastatin 40 mg \nc Pairwise p-value is significant if <0.05 \n \nThe effects of Pravafenix 40 mg/160 mg were confirmed in a similar multicenter, 64-week trial \nincluding a 12 week randomized, double-blind phase in a study performed in the USA and comparing \nPravafenix 40 mg/160 mg to Fenofibrate 160 mg monotherapy and Pravastatin 40 mg monotherapy in \npatients with mixed dyslipidaemia. The incremental benefit of Pravafenix 40 mg/160 mg on main lipid \nparameters versus Pravastatin 40 mg and Fenofibrate 160 mg monotherapy was also established. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nPravafenix in all subsets of the paediatric population in disorders of lipoprotein metabolism and other \nhyperlipidaemias (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction was seen when fenofibrate was coadministered \nwith pravastatin. \n \nAbsorption \n \nPravafenix is bioequivalent to coadministered fenofibrate and pravastatin in a single dose study. \nHowever in a multiple dose study, the results showed that the product is not bioequivalent because its \nbioavailability after multiple dosing is a 20% lower for the fenofibrate component of the combination. \nThis is due to the fat content of the meal.  \nTherefore the fixed dose combination (Pravafenix) could not be considered interchangeable with the \nfree co-administration of fenofibrate and pravastatin mono-component drug products. \n \nA pharmacokinetic study after a single dose administration of Pravafenix has been performed in fed \nand fasting condition. The results of this study show that food has effect on the rate and extent of \nabsorption in the fixed dose combination. The bioavailability of fenofibric acid is lower in fasting \nconditions after a single dose administration of the Fenofibrate-Pravastatin 160/40 mg combination. \nThe decreased in AUCt, AUC\u221e and Cmax of fenofibric acid (point estimate) is of 30.94%, 10.9% and \n68.71% respectively.  \n\nThe bioavailability of pravastatin is higher after a single dose administration of the test product \nFenofibrate/Pravastatin 160/40 mg in fasting conditions than after a single dose of the product in fed \nconditions. The increase in AUC\u221e, AUCt, and Cmax is of 111.88%, 114.06%, and 115.28% \nrespectively. In line with several formulations for fenofibrate, the fixed combination is recommended \nto be taken with food because the bioavailability of fenofibrate is increased when administered with \nfood and the lipid-lowering efficacy of pravastatin is not altered.  \n\n \nPravastatin  \n \nPravastatin is administered orally in the active form. It is rapidly absorbed; peak serum levels are \nachieved 1 to 1.5 hours after ingestion. On average, 34% of the orally administered dose is absorbed, \nwith an absolute bioavailability of 17%.  \n \nThe presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract leads to a reduction in the bioavailability, but the \ncholesterol-lowering effect of pravastatin is identical whether taken with or without food. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\nAfter absorption, 66% of pravastatin undergoes a first-pass extraction through the liver, which is the \nprimary site of its action and the primary site of cholesterol synthesis and clearance of LDL-\ncholesterol. In vitro studies demonstrated that pravastatin is transported into hepatocytes and with \nsubstantially less intake in other cells. In view of this substantial first pass through the liver, plasma \nconcentrations of pravastatin have only a limited value in predicting the lipid-lowering effect. \nThe plasma concentrations are proportional to the doses administered. \n \nFenofibrate \n \nMaximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) occur within 4 to 5 hours after oral administration. Plasma \nconcentrations are stable during continuous treatment in any given individual. \nThe absorption of fenofibrate is increased when administered with food. The food effect increases with \nthe fat content: the larger the lipid content the larger the bioavailability of fenofibrate. \n \nDistribution \n \nPravastatin  \nAbout 50% of circulating pravastatin is bound to plasma proteins. The volume of distribution is about \n0.5 l/kg. A small quantity of pravastatin passes into the human breast milk. \n \nFenofibrate \nFenofibric acid is strongly bound to plasma albumin (more than 99%). \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \n \nPravastatin \nPravastatin is not significantly metabolised by cytochrome P450 nor does it appear to be a substrate or \nan inhibitor of P-glycoprotein but rather a substrate of other transport proteins. \nFollowing oral administration, 20% of the initial dose is eliminated in the urine and 70% in the faeces. \nPlasma elimination half-life of oral pravastatin is 1.5 to 2 hours. \nAfter intravenous administration, 47% of the dose is eliminated by the renal excretion and 53% by \nbiliary excretion and biotransformation. The major degradation product of pravastatin is the 3-\u03b1-\nhydroxy isomeric metabolite. This metabolite has one-tenth to one-fortieth the HMG-CoA reductase \ninhibitor activity of the parent compound. \nThe systemic clearance of pravastatin is 0.81 l/h/kg and the renal clearance is 0.38 l/h/kg indicating \ntubular secretion. \n \nFenofibrate \nNo unchanged fenofibrate can be detected in the plasma where the principal metabolite is fenofibric \nacid. The drug is excreted mainly in the urine. Practically all the drug is eliminated within 6 days. \nFenofibrate is mainly excreted in the form of fenofibric acid and its glucuronide conjugate. In elderly \npatients, the fenofibric acid apparent total plasma clearance is not modified. The plasma elimination \nhalf-life of fenofibric acid is approximately 20 hours. \n \nKinetic studies following the administration of a single dose and continuous treatment have \ndemonstrated that the drug does not accumulate. Fenofibric acid is not eliminated by haemodialysis. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe safety of concomitant administration of pravastatin and fenofibrate was assessed in rats. \nToxicological findings in these co-administration studies were consistent with those seen with \npravastatin and fenofibrate administered individually.  \n \nPravastatin \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nBased on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and toxicity on \nreproduction, there are no other risks for the patient than those expected due to the pharmacological \nmechanism of action.  \nRepeated dose studies indicate that pravastatin may induce varying degrees of hepatotoxicity and \nmyopathy; in general, substantive effects on these tissues were only evident at doses 50 or more times \nthe maximum human mg/kg dose. In vitro and in vivo genetic toxicology studies have shown no \nevidence of mutagenic potential. In mice, a 2-year carcinogenicity study with pravastatin demonstrates \nat doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg/day (> 310 times the maximum human mg/kg dose), statistically \nsignificant increases in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in males and females, and lung \nadenomas in females only. In rats a 2-year carcinogenicity study demonstrates at a dose of \n100 mg/kg/day (125 times the maximum human mg/kg/dose) a statistically significant increase in the \nincidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in males only. \n \nFenofibrate \nChronic toxicity studies have yielded no relevant information about specific toxicity of fenofibrate.  \nStudies on mutagenicity of fenofibrate have been negative.  In rats and mice, liver tumours have been \nfound at high dosages, which are attributable to peroxisome proliferation. These changes are specific \nto small rodents and have not been observed in other animal species. This is of no relevance to \ntherapeutic use in man.  \nStudies in mice, rats and rabbits did not reveal any teratogenic effect. Embryotoxic effects were \nobserved at doses in the range of maternal toxicity. Prolongation of the gestation period and \ndifficulties during delivery were observed at high doses. No sign of any effect on fertility has been \ndetected. \n \n \n6.

What Pravafenix is and what it is used for \n \nPravafenix contains two active substances: pravastatin and fenofibrate. Both are cholesterol/lipid \nmodifying medicines.  \n \nPravafenix is used in addition to low fat diet in adults \n- To lower the level of your \u2018bad\u2019 cholesterol (LDL cholesterol). It does this by lowering the level \n\nof total cholesterol, and fatty substances called triglycerides in the blood.  \n- To raise the level of your \u2018good\u2019 cholesterol (HDL cholesterol). \n \nWhat should I know about cholesterol and triglycerides? \nCholesterol is one of several fats found in your blood. Your total cholesterol is made up mainly of \nLDL and HDL cholesterol.  \n \nLDL cholesterol is often called \u2018bad\u2019 cholesterol because it can build up in the walls of your arteries \nand form plaque. Over time, this plaque build-up can lead to a clogging of your arteries. This clogging \ncan slow or block blood flow to vital organs such as the heart and brain. When the blood flow is \nblocked, the result can be a heart attack or stroke.  \n \nHDL cholesterol is often called \u2018good\u2019 cholesterol because it helps keep the \u2018bad\u2019 cholesterol from \nbuilding up in the arteries and because it protects against heart disease.  \n \nTriglycerides are another fat in your blood. They may raise your risk of having heart problems.  \n \nIn most people, there are no signs of cholesterol problems at first. Your doctor can measure your \ncholesterol with a simple blood test. Visit your doctor regularly to keep track of your cholesterol level.  \n \nPravafenix is used if you are an adult with an elevated risk for heart disease and need to improve \ncholesterol and triglycerides fat levels in your blood when your \u2018bad\u2019 cholesterol levels are being \nadequately controlled with pravastatin alone (a statin, a cholesterol-lowering medicine). \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Pravafenix \n \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\nDo not take Pravafenix \n- if you are allergic to fenofibrate, pravastatin, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n- if you suffer from liver disease.  \n- if you are under 18 years old. \n- if you suffer from kidney disease. \n- if you have had photoallergy (allergic reaction caused by sunlight or exposure to UV light) or \n\nphototoxic reactions (damage to skin caused by exposure to sunlight or UV light) during treatment \nwith fibrates (lipid-modifying medicines) or ketoprofen (an anti-inflammatory medicine that can \nbe used orally or on the skin for muscle and bone disorders, and orally for gout or period pain) \n\n- if you suffer from gallbladder disease. \n- if you suffer from pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas leading to abdominal pain) \n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n- if you have a history of muscle problems (e.g. myopathy or rhabdomyolysis) during treatment \n\nwith cholesterol-controlling medicines called \u2018statins\u2019 (such as simvastatin, atorvastatin, \npravastatin or rosuvastatin) or fibrates (such as fenofibrate and bezafibrate). \n \n\n \nDo not take Pravafenix if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking Pravafenix. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Pravafenix. \n \nBefore you take Pravafenix you should tell your doctor if you have or have had any medical problems. \n- Tell your doctor about all your medical conditions including allergies. \n- Tell your doctor if you drink large amounts of alcohol (if you drink more than the recommended \n\ndaily amount; ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure)  or have ever had liver disease. See \nalso below section \u201cTaking Pravafenix with food and drink\u201d. \n\n- Your doctor should do a blood test before you start taking Pravafenix. This is to check how well \nyour liver and your kidneys are working. \n\n- Your doctor may also want you to have blood tests to check how well your liver is working after \nyou start taking Pravafenix. \n\n \nContact your doctor immediately if you experience unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. \nThis is because, on rare occasions, muscle problems can be serious, including muscle breakdown \nresulting in kidney damage, and very rarely deaths have occurred. \n \nAlso tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have a muscle weakness that is constant.  \nAdditional tests and medicines may be needed to diagnose and treat this. \n \nThe risk of muscle breakdown is greater in certain patients. Tell your doctor if any of the following \napplies to you: \n- Liver or kidney problems \n- Thyroid problems \n- You are more than 70 years old \n- You have ever had muscle problems during a treatment with cholesterol-lowering medicines such     \n\nas a statin or fibrate \n- You are taking or have taken in the last 7 days a medicine called fusidic acid, (a medicine for \n\nbacterial infection) orally or by injection. The combination of fusidic acid and Pravafenix can lead \nto serious muscle problems (rhabdomyolysis).  \n\n- You or your close family members have a hereditary muscle disorder \n- You have alcohol problems (regularly drinking large amounts of alcohol) \n \nCheck with your doctor or pharmacist before taking Pravafenix if you have severe respiratory failure, \ne.g. you have breathing problems including, persistent non-productive cough, deterioration in general \nhealth like fatigue (tiredness), weight loss and/or shortness of breath or fever. \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\nIf you feel any of these symptoms you should stop taking Pravafenix and inform your doctor. \n \nWhile you are on this medicine your doctor will monitor you closely if you have diabetes or are at risk \nof developing diabetes. You are likely to be at risk of developing diabetes if you have high levels of \nsugars and fats in your blood, are overweight and have high blood pressure. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not take Pravafenix if you are under 18 years old \n \nOther medicines and Pravafenix \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. It is important that you inform your doctor if you are already being treated with any of the \nfollowing: \n- Bile acid resins such as colestyramine/colestipol (a medicine for lowering cholesterol), because it \n\naffects the way Pravafenix works. \n- Ciclosporin (a medicine often used in organ transplant patients). \n- Medicines to prevent blood clots, such as warfarin, fluindione, phenprocoumon or acenocoumarol \n\n(anticoagulants)  \n- An antibiotic such as erythromycin, clarithromycin to treat infections caused by bacteria. \n- Fusidic acid: If you need to take oral fusidic acid to treat a bacterial infection you will need to \n\ntemporarily stop using this medicine. Your doctor will tell you when it is safe to restart \nPravafenix. Taking Pravafenix with fusidic acid may rarely lead to muscle weakness, tenderness \nor pain (rhabdomyolysis). See more information regarding rhabdomyolysis in section 4.  \n\n- Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (used to treat hepatitis C virus infection) because it can increase some \nadverse events including muscle problems.  \n\n \nPravafenix with food, drink and alcohol \n- Always take Pravafenix with food as Pravafenix is less well absorbed from an empty stomach. \n- You should always keep your alcohol intake to a minimum. If you are concerned about how much \n\nalcohol you can drink while you are taking this medicine, you should discuss this with your \ndoctor.  \n\nIf you are not sure about this, please follow your doctor\u2019s advice. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not take Pravafenix if you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant or think you may be pregnant. \nIf you plan to become pregnant or become pregnant, inform your doctor immediately. The medicine \nmust be discontinued because of the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nDo not take Pravafenix if you are breast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \nPravafenix does not usually affect your ability to drive or use machines. If you experience any \ndizziness, blurred or double vision during treatment, make sure you are fit to drive and use machines \nbefore attempting to do so. \n \nPravafenix contains lactose \nPravafenix contains a sugar called lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have \nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Pravafenix \n \nAlways take Pravafenix exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n- Before starting taking Pravafenix, you should be on a diet to lower your cholesterol. \n- You should keep to this diet while taking Pravafenix \n \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\nThe usual dose is one capsule taken daily during the evening meal. Swallow the capsule with water. It \nis important to take the capsule with food, as it won\u2019t work as well if your stomach is empty. \n \nWhen your doctor has prescribed Pravafenix along with colestyramine or any other bile acid binding \nresins (medicines for lowering cholesterol), take Pravafenix 1 hour before, or 4 to 6 hours after the \nresin. This is because colestyramine or other bile acid binding resins frequently reduce the absorption \nof medicines when taken too closely together and so may impede the absorption of Pravafenix. If you \ntake indigestion remedies (used to neutralise acid in your stomach), take Pravafenix 1 hour after. \n \nIf you take more Pravafenix than you should \nPlease contact your doctor or pharmacist \n \nIf you forget to take Pravafenix \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, just take your normal amount of Pravafenix \nat the usual time the next day. \n \nIf you stop taking Pravafenix \nDo not stop taking Pravafenix without first discussing it with your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nThe following two side effects are important and will require immediate action.  \nTell your doctor straight away if you have any unexplained muscular pain or cramps, tenderness, or \nweakness. This is because on very rare occasions (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people), muscle \nproblems can be serious, including muscle breakdown resulting in kidney damage, and very rarely \ndeaths have occurred. \nSudden severe allergic reactions including swelling of the face, lip, tongue or wind pipe which can \ncause great difficulty in breathing. This is a very rare reaction which can be serious if it occurs. You \nshould tell your doctor immediately if it happens. \n \nOther Side effects \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\u2022 Digestive effects: gastric or intestinal disorders (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and \n\nflatulence, constipation, dry mouth, upper abdominal pain with bloating (dyspepsia), burping \n(eructation)). \n\n\u2022 Effects on liver: raised serum transaminases. \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\u2022 Abnormal heartbeat (palpitations), formation of blood clots in veins (deep vein thrombosis) and \n\nblockage of the lung arteries by blood clots (pulmonary embolism) \n\u2022 Rashes, skin rash, itching, hives or reactions to sunlight or exposure to UV light (photosensitivity \n\nreactions), scalp/hair abnormality (including hair loss) \n\u2022 Effects on nervous system: dizziness (sensation of unsteadiness), headache, sleep disturbances \n\n(including difficulty sleeping and nightmares), pins and needles sensation (paresthesia). \n\u2022 Muscle and joint pain (myalgia, arthralgia), back pain, alterations in some laboratory blood tests \n\nfor muscle function. \n\u2022 Problems with sight such as blurred or double vision. \n\u2022 Kidney problems (increased or decreased levels of certain enzymes within the body seen in a test) \n\nbladder problems (painful or frequent urination, having to pass water at night), sexual dysfunction. \n\u2022 Tiredness, weakness, influenza-like illness. \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\n\u2022 Hypersensitivity. \n\u2022 Increased blood cholesterol, increased blood triglycerides, increased LDL, increased gamma-\n\nglutamyl transferase (various liver enzymes), liver pain (upper right abdominal pain with or \nwithout pain in the back), increased weight. \n\n\u2022 Obesity. \n\u2022 Muscle inflammation (myositis), muscular cramps and weakness. \n \nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \n\u2022 Decrease in haemoglobin (oxygen-carrying pigment in blood) and leukocytes (white blood cells). \n \nVery rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) \n\u2022 Inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), symptoms of which may be mild yellowing of the skin and \n\nwhites of the eyes (jaundice), abdominal pain and itching. \n\u2022 Muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), some cases of tendon problems, sometimes complicated by \n\nrupture. \n\u2022 A condition characterised by an inflammation of the muscles and the skin (dermatomyositis). \n\u2022 Skin rash, possibly with pain in the joints (Erythematous lupus like syndrome). \n\u2022 Tingling and numbness (peripheral polyneuropathy). \n \nSide effects of unknown frequency (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\u2022 Muscle weakness that is constant \n\u2022 Skin rash (lichenoid eruption) \n \nPossible side effects reported with some statins (same type of cholesterol-lowering medicines as \npravastatin) \n\u2022 Memory loss \n\u2022 Depression \n\u2022 Breathing problems including persistent cough/or shortness of breath or fever. \n\u2022 Diabetes.

to fenofibrate, pravastatin, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). - if you suffer from liver disease. - if you are under 18 years old. - if you suffer from kidney disease. - if you have had photoallergy (allergic reaction caused by sunlight or exposure to uv light) or phototoxic reactions (damage to skin caused by exposure to sunlight or uv light) during treatment with fibrates (lipid-modifying medicines) or ketoprofen (an anti-inflammatory medicine that can be used orally or on the skin for muscle and bone disorders, and orally for gout or period pain) - if you suffer from gallbladder disease. - if you suffer from pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas leading to abdominal pain) - if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. - if you have a history of muscle problems (e.g. myopathy or rhabdomyolysis) during treatment with cholesterol-controlling medicines called 'statins' (such as simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin or rosuvastatin) or fibrates (such as fenofibrate and bezafibrate). do not take pravafenix if any of the above applies to you. if you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking pravafenix. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking pravafenix. before you take pravafenix you should tell your doctor if you have or have had any medical problems. - tell your doctor about all your medical conditions including allergies. - tell your doctor if you drink large amounts of alcohol (if you drink more than the recommended daily amount; ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure) or have ever had liver disease. see also below section \"taking pravafenix with food and drink\". - your doctor should do a blood test before you start taking pravafenix. this is to check how well your liver and your kidneys are working. - your doctor may also want you to have blood tests to check how well your liver is working after you start taking pravafenix. contact your doctor immediately if you experience unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. this is because, on rare occasions, muscle problems can be serious, including muscle breakdown resulting in kidney damage, and very rarely deaths have occurred. also tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have a muscle weakness that is constant. additional tests and medicines may be needed to diagnose and treat this. the risk of muscle breakdown is greater in certain patients. tell your doctor if any of the following applies to you: - liver or kidney problems - thyroid problems - you are more than 70 years old - you have ever had muscle problems during a treatment with cholesterol-lowering medicines such as a statin or fibrate - you are taking or have taken in the last 7 days a medicine called fusidic acid, (a medicine for bacterial infection) orally or by injection. the combination of fusidic acid and pravafenix can lead to serious muscle problems (rhabdomyolysis). - you or your close family members have a hereditary muscle disorder - you have alcohol problems (regularly drinking large amounts of alcohol) check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking pravafenix if you have severe respiratory failure, e.g. you have breathing problems including, persistent non-productive cough, deterioration in general health like fatigue (tiredness), weight loss and/or shortness of breath or fever. if you feel any of these symptoms you should stop taking pravafenix and inform your doctor. while you are on this medicine your doctor will monitor you closely if you have diabetes or are at risk of developing diabetes. you are likely to be at risk of developing diabetes if you have high levels of sugars and fats in your blood, are overweight and have high blood pressure. children and adolescents do not take pravafenix if you are under 18 years old other medicines and pravafenix tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. it is important that you inform your doctor if you are already being treated with any of the following: - bile acid resins such as colestyramine/colestipol (a medicine for lowering cholesterol), because it affects the way pravafenix works. - ciclosporin (a medicine often used in organ transplant patients). - medicines to prevent blood clots, such as warfarin, fluindione, phenprocoumon or acenocoumarol (anticoagulants) - an antibiotic such as erythromycin, clarithromycin to treat infections caused by bacteria. - fusidic acid: if you need to take oral fusidic acid to treat a bacterial infection you will need to temporarily stop using this medicine. your doctor will tell you when it is safe to restart pravafenix. taking pravafenix with fusidic acid may rarely lead to muscle weakness, tenderness or pain (rhabdomyolysis). see more information regarding rhabdomyolysis in section 4. - glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (used to treat hepatitis c virus infection) because it can increase some adverse events including muscle problems. pravafenix with food, drink and alcohol - always take pravafenix with food as pravafenix is less well absorbed from an empty stomach. - you should always keep your alcohol intake to a minimum. if you are concerned about how much alcohol you can drink while you are taking this medicine, you should discuss this with your doctor. if you are not sure about this, please follow your doctor's advice. pregnancy and breast-feeding do not take pravafenix if you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant or think you may be pregnant. if you plan to become pregnant or become pregnant, inform your doctor immediately. the medicine must be discontinued because of the potential risk to the foetus. do not take pravafenix if you are breast-feeding. driving and using machines pravafenix does not usually affect your ability to drive or use machines. if you experience any dizziness, blurred or double vision during treatment, make sure you are fit to drive and use machines before attempting to do so. pravafenix contains lactose pravafenix contains a sugar called lactose. if you have been told by your doctor that you have intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "pravafenix", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 13, "BeginOffset": 12,

it won't work as well if your stomach is empty. when your doctor has prescribed pravafenix along with colestyramine or any other bile acid binding resins (medicines for lowering cholesterol), take pravafenix 1 hour before, or 4 to 6 hours after the resin. this is because colestyramine or other bile acid binding resins frequently reduce the absorption of medicines when taken too closely together and so may impede the absorption of pravafenix. if you take indigestion remedies (used to neutralise acid in your stomach), take pravafenix 1 hour after. if you take more pravafenix than you should please contact your doctor or pharmacist if you forget to take pravafenix do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, just take your normal amount of pravafenix at the usual time the next day. if you stop taking pravafenix do not stop taking pravafenix without first discussing it with your doctor. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or
