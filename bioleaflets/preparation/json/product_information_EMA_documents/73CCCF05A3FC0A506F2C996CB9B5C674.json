NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nACOMPLIA 20 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 20 mg rimonabant. \nExcipients: \nThe tablets contain approx. 115 mg lactose. \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet \nBiconvex, teardrop-shaped, white tablets debossed with “20” on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAs an adjunct to diet and exercise for the treatment of obese patients (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2), or overweight \npatients (BMI > 27 kg/m2) with associated risk factor(s), such as type 2 diabetes or dyslipidaemia (see \nsection 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nIn adults, the recommended dosage is one 20 mg tablet daily to be taken in the morning before \nbreakfast. \n \nThe treatment should be introduced with a mildly reduced calorie diet. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of rimonabant have not been evaluated beyond 2 years.  \n \n• Special Populations \n \nElderly: \nNo dosage adjustment is required in elderly (see section 5.2). ACOMPLIA should be used with \ncaution in patients over 75 years of age (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients with hepatic insufficiency: \nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. ACOMPLIA \nshould be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. ACOMPLIA should not be \nused in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPatients with renal impairment: \nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (see section \n5.2). ACOMPLIA should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.4 and \n5.2). \n \nPaediatrics: \nACOMPLIA is not recommended for use in children below age 18 due to a lack of data on efficacy \nand safety. \n \n\n2 \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients \nLactation. \nOngoing major depressive illness and/or ongoing antidepressive treatment (see section 4.4) \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n• Depressive disorders \nDepressive disorders or mood alterations with depressive symptoms have been reported in up to 10%, \nand suicidal ideation in up to 1%, of patients receiving rimonabant (see section 4.8). In patients with \ncurrent suicidal ideations and/or with a history of suicidal ideation and depressive disorder rimonabant \nshould not be used unless the benefits of treatment are considered to outweigh these risks in an \nindividual patient. (See section 4.3 and 4.8). Obesity is a condition that can be associated with \ndepressive disorders. Depressive disorders can be associated with an increased risk of suicidal \nthoughts, self harm and suicide.  \n \nThe prescriber should carefully investigate if the patient has had a depressive disorder in the past in \norder to evaluate the potential risks with rimonabant treatment.  \n \nDepressive reactions may occur in patients who have no obvious risk factors, apart from obesity itself. \nIn postmarketing experience, more than half of the patients who develop such reactions appear to do \nso within 1 month of starting treatment, approximately 80% appear to do so within 3 months.  \nPatients should be actively monitored for signs and symptoms of psychiatric disorders, particularly \ndepression following the start of treatment. If depression is diagnosed during rimonabant therapy, \nrimonabant treatment must be stopped. The patient should be monitored and treated appropriately. \n \nPatients, especially those with a history of depressive disorders/mood alterations, (and relatives or \nother relevant persons) should be alerted about the need to monitor for the emergence of such \nsymptoms and to seek medical advice immediately if these occur.  \n \n• Other psychiatric conditions \nTherapy with rimonabant is not recommended in patients with uncontrolled psychiatric illness.  \nIf psychiatric illness is diagnosed during rimonabant therapy, treatment must be stopped.  \n \n• Seizures \nRimonabant has not been studied in patients being treated for epilepsy. In clinical trials no difference \nin the incidence of seizures was seen in patients receiving rimonabant or placebo. Rimonabant, \nhowever, should be used with caution in these patients, see also section 5.3. \n \n• Hepatic impairment \nRimonabant is metabolised by the liver, thus caution is advised in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment. The pharmacokinetics and safety of rimonabant have not been studied in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment; its use in these patients is not recommended. \n \n• Renal impairment \nThere are limited data in patients with moderate renal impairment and no data in patients with severe \nrenal impairment. Rimonabant should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (see section \n4.2 and 5.2). \n \n• Elderly \nThe efficacy and safety of rimonabant treatment in patients over 75 years of age has not sufficiently \nbeen established. Rimonabant should be used with caution in this population (see section 5.2). \n \n\n3 \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n• Race \nThe clinical effect (weight loss) of rimonabant in Black patients was lower than in Caucasians. This \ncould be caused by a higher rimonabant clearance than in Caucasians resulting in a lower exposure \n(see section 5.2). \n \n• Diabetic patients \n \nDue to the effect of rimonabant on the blood glucose level, when rimonabant is administered in \ndiabetic patients, hypoglyceamia can occur (see section 4.8). Monitoring of blood glucose level is \nrecommended in these patients. \n \n• Drug Interaction \nRimonabant should be used with caution in combination with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. \nketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, telithromycin, clarithromycin, nefazodone)(see section 4.5). \n \n• Lactose \nSince ACOMPLIA tablets contain lactose, patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption, should not take this \nmedicine. \n \nPatients should be instructed not to increase their dose of ACOMPLIA. \n \nPatients who had a cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, stroke, etc.) less than 6 months ago \nwere excluded in the studies for rimonabant. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nRimonabant is metabolized by both CYP3A and amidohydrolase (predominantly hepatic) pathways in \nvitro. Concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors will lead to increased exposure of \nrimonabant. Concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers is expected to reduce the exposure of \nrimonabant. \n \nPotential for other medicinal products to affect rimonabant:  \nConcomitant administration of ketoconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased rimonabant AUC \nby 104% (95% prediction interval: 40% - 197%). A similar increase in exposure is expected with other \npotent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Caution is advised during concomitant use of ACOMPLIA and potent \nCYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, telithromycin, clarithromycin, \nnefazodone). \nAlthough concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, \ncarbamazepine, St John’s wort) has not been studied, it is expected that concomitant administration of \npotent CYP3A4 inducers may reduce the plasma concentration of rimonabant and may result in loss of \nefficacy. \n \nConcomitant administration of orlistat, ethanol or lorazepam had no significant effect on the plasma \nlevels of rimonabant.  \n \nPotential for rimonabant to affect other medicinal products:  \nThe in vivo inhibitory effect on CYP2C8 has not been studied. However, in vitro, rimonabant had a \nmild inhibitory effect on CYP2C8. The potential for inhibition of CYP2C8 in vivo appears to be low. \nRimonabant does not inhibit or induce other CYP enzymes or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in vitro. This was \nconfirmed clinically with specific probe studies using midazolam (CYP 3A4 substrate) and warfarin \n(CYP 2C9 substrate) and digoxin (a P-gp substrate). \n \nThe steady-state pharmacokinetics of an ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel combination oral \ncontraceptive were not significantly altered by concomitant administration of rimonabant. \n \n\n4 \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nThere are no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal data are inconclusive but \nsuggest possible deleterious effects on embryonal/foetal development (see section 5.3). The potential \nrisk for humans is unknown. Use in pregnancy is, therefore, not recommended. Patients should notify \ntheir physician if they become pregnant during treatment with ACOMPLIA. \n \nRimonabant has been detected in the milk of lactating rats and rimonabant may inhibit the suckling \nreflex. It is not known if rimonabant is excreted in human milk. ACOMPLIA is contraindicated during \nbreast-feeding (see section 4.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  \nCognitive investigations in clinical pharmacology studies demonstrated that rimonabant is devoid of \nany significant cognitive or sedative effect. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nACOMPLIA 20 mg has been evaluated for safety in approximately 2500 patients enrolled in studies \nthat examined the metabolic and weight loss effects in overweight and obese patients and in \napproximately 3800 patients in other indications. In placebo-controlled studies, the discontinuation \nrate due to adverse reactions was 15.7% for patients receiving rimonabant. The most common adverse \nreactions resulting in discontinuation were: nausea, mood alteration with depressive symptoms, \ndepressive disorders, anxiety and dizziness. \n \nDepressive disorders were reported in 3.2% of obese patients, or overweight patients with associated \nrisk factor(s) treated with rimonabant 20 mg. These were usually mild or moderate in severity and \nresulted in recovery in all cases either after corrective treatment or discontinuation of rimonabant and \ndid not exhibit any differentiating characteristics compared to cases reported in the control groups. \n \nThe following table (table 1) shows all treatment-emergent adverse reactions from placebo-controlled \nstudies in patients treated for weight loss and related metabolic disorders when these incidences were \nstatistically significantly greater than the corresponding placebo rate (for events ≥ 1%) or considered \nclinically relevant (for events < 1%). \n \nClassification of expected frequencies of undesirable effects: \nVery common (≥10%); Common (≥1, <10%); Uncommon (≥0.1, <1%); Rare (≥0.01, <0.1%); Very \nrare (<0.01%), Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n\n5 \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery common \n \n \n\nCommon  \n \n\nUncommon  Rare  \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nUpper respiratory \ntract infection \n\nGastroenteritis \n \n\n  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\n  Hypoglycaemia*  \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n Depressive \ndisorders \nMood alterations \nwith depressive \nsymptoms \nAnxiety \nIrritability \nNervousness \nSleep disorders \nInsomnia \nParasomnias \n\nPanic symptoms \nAnger \nDysphoria \nEmotional \ndisorder \nSuicidal ideation \nAggressiveness \nAggressive \nbehaviour \n\nHallucinations \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n Memory loss \nDizziness \nHypoaesthesia \nSciatica  \nParesthesia \n\nLethargy \nTremor \n\n \n\nVascular disorders  Hot flush   \nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n  Hiccups  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea Diarrhoea \nVomiting \n\n  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n Pruritus \nHyperhidrosis  \n \n\nNight sweats  \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand \nconnective \ntissue disorders \n\n Tendonitis \nMuscle cramp \nMuscle spasms \n\n  \n\nGeneral disorders  Asthenia/fatigue \nInfluenza \n\n  \n\nInjury, Poisoning \nand procedural \ncomplications \n\n Fall \nContusion \nJoint sprain \n\n  \n\n*frequency is based only on reports in obese or overweight diabetic patients. \n \nIn clinical studies for other indications, the following additional adverse reactions were commonly \nreported: \n− infections and infestations: sinusitis \n− metabolism and nutrition disorders: anorexia, decreased appetite,  \n− gastrointestinal disorders: stomach discomfort, dry mouth. \n \n\n6 \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\nPost-Marketing \nIn addition the following adverse reactions were reported during postmarketing (frequency not \nknown): \n− Psychiatric disorder: psychotic disorders including hallucinations, delusion and paranoia. \n− Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: rash. \n− Nervous disorders: convulsions, disturbance in attention, headache. \n− gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal pain. \n \nLaboratory adverse events \nACOMPLIA has not been shown to alter laboratory test values. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nExperience with rimonabant in overdosage is limited. In a single-dose tolerability study, doses up to \n300 mg were administered to a limited number of subjects with only minor symptoms reported. These \nincluded headache, euphoria, fatigue and insomnia. The pharmacokinetic profile demonstrates that a \nplateau in exposures is reached at 180 mg. There is no specific antidote for rimonabant; therefore, \nappropriate supportive measures should be initiated in case of overdose. Treatment should consist of \nthe general measures employed in the management of overdoses, such as keeping airways \nunobstructed, monitoring cardiovascular function and general symptomatic and supportive measures. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmaco-therapeutic group: Anti obesity agent \nATC code: A08AX01  \n \nRimonabant is a selective cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1) antagonist that inhibits the pharmacological \neffects of cannabinoid agonists in vitro and in vivo. \nThe endocannabinoid system is a physiological system present in brain and peripheral tissues \n(including adipocytes) that affects energy balance, glucose and lipid metabolism and body weight, and \nin neurons of the mesolimbic system modulates the intake of highly palatable, sweet or fatty foods. \n \nClinical study results \n \nWeight Management \n \nIn total more than 6800 patients were included in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies. The patients \nincluded in the phase 3 trials followed a restrictive diet during the trial prescribed by a dietician and \nthey were advised to increase their physical activity. Patients had a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or BMI \n> 27 kg/m² with hypertension and/or dyslipidemia at inclusion. Approximately 80% of the population \nwere women, 87% Caucasian and 9% Black. Experience in patients over 75 years and \nOrientals/Asians was limited. \n \nSignificant mean weight reductions from baseline to one year for ACOMPLIA 20 mg versus placebo \nwere demonstrated in three studies conducted in non-diabetic patients. A mean weight loss of 6.5 kg \nfrom baseline to one year was shown for ACOMPLIA 20 mg versus a mean weight loss of 1.6 kg for \nplacebo (Difference -4.9 kg CI95% -5.3;-4.4, p< 0.001).  \nThe percentage of patients who lost 5% and 10% of their baseline body weight after 1 year of \ntreatment are given in table 2: \n \n\n7 \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\nTable 2: \n Non-diabetic studies Diabetic study \n\n Placebo  \nACOMPLIA  \n20 mg \n\nPlacebo \n \n\nACOMPLIA \n20 mg \n\nnITT 1254 2164 348 339 \n \n\nWeight at baseline \n(kg)  \n\n101 101 96 95 \n \n\nSubjects with a 5% \nweight reduction  \n\n19.7% 50.8% 14.5% 49.4% \n\n     \nDifference (CI 95%) 31.1% (28%; 34%) 34.9% (28%; 41%) \n\n \nSubjects with a 10% \nweight reduction  \n\n7.8% 27.0% 2.0% 16.2% \n\nDifference (CI 95%) 19.2%  (17%; 22%) 14.2%  (10%; 19%) \n \n\n \nMost of the observed weight reduction was obtained within the first nine months of treatment. \nACOMPLIA 20 mg was effective in maintaining weight loss up to two years. Weight loss at two years \nwas 5.1 kg for patients who received ACOMPLIA 20 mg and 1.2 kg for placebo (Difference -3.8 kg; \nCI95% -4.4, -3.3; p< 0.001). \n \nRimonabant 20 mg reduced the risk of weight regain. Patients who received ACOMPLIA 20 mg for \none year were re-randomized to ACOMPLIA 20 mg or placebo. At two years, patients continuing on \nrimonabant had  a mean  total weight loss of 7.5 kg over 2 years whereas patients re-randomized to \nplacebo group during the second year had a mean total weight loss of 3.1 kg over 2 years. At two \nyears, the difference in total weight loss between ACOMPLIA and placebo was -4.2 kg (CI95% -5.0;-\n3.4, p< 0.001). \n \nTreatment with rimonabant was associated with significant reductions in waist circumference, a \nknown marker of intra-abdominal fat. \n \nThe effects on body weight appeared to be consistent among men and women. In the limited number \nof Black patients weight loss was less pronounced (mean difference to placebo -2.9 kg). No \nconclusions can be drawn with regard to effects in patients over 75 years or in Asian/Oriental patients \ndue to the low number of patients. \n \nWeight management and additional risk factors \nIn the non-diabetic studies including a mixed population of subjects with/without (treated) \ndyslipidemia, an increase in HDL-C and decrease in triglycerides (at one year) was observed. For \nHDL-C an average increase of 16.4% was seen under rimonabant 20 mg (baseline HDL-C \n1.24 mmol/l) compared to an increase of 8.9% for placebo (baseline HDL-C 1.21 mmol/l). The \ndifference was statistically significant (Difference 7.9% CI95% 6.6%; 9.2%, p< 0.001). For the \ntriglycerides an average decrease of 6.9% was seen under rimonabant 20 mg (baseline TG \n1.62 mmol/l) compared to an increase of 5.8% for placebo (baseline TG 1.65 mmol/l). The difference \nwas statistically significant (Difference -13.3% CI95% -16.5; -10.2% p< 0.001). It is estimated that \napproximately half of the observed improvement in HDL-C and triglycerides in patients who received \nrimonabant 20 mg was beyond that expected from weight loss alone. \nGenerally ACOMPLIA 20 mg had no significant effect on Total-C or LDL-C levels. \n \nIn the trial in type 2 diabetic patients (RIO-Diabetes) who were overweight or obese treated with \nmetformin or sulfonylurea improvements in HbA1c and body weight were observed. The absolute \nchange in HbA1c at one year was -0.6 for rimonabant 20 mg (baseline 7.3%) and +0.1 on placebo \n(baseline 7.2%). Differences were statistically significant (Difference -0.7%, CI95% -0.80;-0.5, \np<0.001).  \n\n8 \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\nAt one year a mean weight loss of 5.3 kg was shown for ACOMPLIA 20 mg versus a loss on placebo \nof 1.4 kg (Difference –3.9 kg CI95% -4.6;-3.3 p<0.001). The percentage of patients who lost 5% and \n10% of their baseline body weight after 1 year of treatment are given in the table 2. \nIn a second trial in treatment naïve type 2 diabetic obese patients (Serenade), the absolute change in \nHbA1c (with a baseline of 7.9% for both groups) at six months was -0.8 for rimonabant 20 mg and      \n-0.3 under placebo (Difference -0.51 CI95% -0.78, -0.24 p< 0.001). The percentage of patients reaching \nHbA1c < 7% was 51% in the rimonabant group and 35% in the placebo group. The difference in mean \nbody weight change between the 20 mg and placebo groups was 3.8 kg (CI95% -5.0, -2.6 p< 0.001). \nChanges in HDL-C and TG in this population were similar to that of the non-diabetic population. It is \nestimated that approximately half of the mean improvement in HbA1c in patients receiving \nrimonabant 20 mg was beyond that expected from weight loss alone. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nRimonabant pharmacokinetics are fairly dose proportional up to about 20 mg. AUC increased less than \nin proportion to dose above 20 mg. \n \nAbsorption: \nRimonabant displays high in vitro permeability and is not a substrate of P-glycoprotein. The absolute \nbioavailability of rimonabant has not been determined. Following multiple once-daily doses of 20 mg \nto healthy subjects in the fasted state, maximum plasma concentrations of rimonabant are achieved in \napproximately 2 hours with steady state plasma levels achieved within 13 days (Cmax = 196 ± \n28.1 ng/ml; Ctrough = 91.6 ± 14.1 ng/ml; AUC0-24 = 2960 ± 268 ng.h/ml). Steady state rimonabant \nexposures are 3.3-fold higher than those observed after the first dose. Population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis demonstrated less fluctuation in peak to trough plasma concentration but no differences in \nsteady state AUC as weight increases. As weight increases from 65 to 200 kg, Cmax is expected to \ndecrease 24% and Ctrough is expected to increase by 5%. Time to steady state is longer in obese patients \n(25 days) as a consequence of the higher volume of distribution in these patients. Population \npharmacokinetic analysis indicated that rimonabant pharmacokinetics are similar between healthy \nnon-smoking subjects and patients who smoke. \n \nEffect of food: \nAdministration of rimonabant to healthy subjects in the fasted state or with a high fat meal \ndemonstrated that Cmax and AUC were increased 67% and 48% respectively, under fed conditions. In \nclinical studies, ACOMPLIA 20 mg was taken in the morning usually before breakfast.  \n \nDistribution: \nThe in vitro human plasma protein binding of rimonabant is high (> 99.9%) and non-saturable over a \nwide concentration range. The apparent peripheral volume of distribution of rimonabant appears to be \nrelated to body weight, with obese patients having a higher volume of distribution than normal-weight \nsubjects. \n \nBiotransformation: \nRimonabant is metabolized by both CYP3A and amidohydrolase (predominantly hepatic) pathways in \nvitro. Circulating metabolites do not contribute to its pharmacologic activity. \n \nElimination: \nRimonabant is mainly eliminated by metabolism and subsequent biliary excretion of metabolites. Only \nan approximate 3% of the dose of rimonabant is eliminated in the urine, while approximately 86% of \nthe dose is excreted in the faeces as unchanged drug and metabolites. In obese patients, the elimination \nhalf-life is longer (about 16 days) than in non-obese patients (about 9 days) due to a larger volume of \ndistribution. \n \n\n9 \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\nSpecial Populations \nRace: \nIn single- and repeat-dose studies, the Cmax and AUC of rimonabant were similar in healthy Japanese \nand Caucasian subjects, whereas elimination half-life was shorter in Japanese subjects (3-4 days) \ncompared to Caucasian subjects (about 9 days). The difference in half-life was due to differences in \nperipheral volume of distribution as a consequence of lower weight in Japanese subjects. \nBlack patients may have up to a 31% lower Cmax and a 43% lower AUC than patients of other races.  \n \nGender: \nThe pharmacokinetics of rimonabant are similar in female and male patients.  \n \nElderly: \nElderly patients have slightly higher exposure than young patients. Based on a population \npharmacokinetic analysis (age range 18 - 81 years) a 75 year old patient is estimated to have a 21% \nhigher Cmax and a 27% higher AUC than a 40 year old patient. \n \nPatients with hepatic insufficiency: \nMild hepatic impairment does not alter rimonabant exposure. Data are insufficient to draw conclusions \nregarding pharmacokinetics in moderate hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment \nwere not evaluated. \n \nPatients with renal impairment: \nThe effect of renal function on the pharmacokinetics of rimonabant has not been studied specifically. \nBased on data from population pharmacokinetic studies, mild renal impairment do not seem to affect \nthe pharmacokinetics of rimonabant. Limited data suggest an increased exposure in patients with \nmoderate renal impairment (40% increase in AUC). There are no data in severe renal impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to \nclinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: \nConvulsions were observed sporadically in studies in rodents and macaques. No convulsions were \nobserved in dogs during a 3 month study. In some, but not all cases, initiation of convulsions appeared \nto be associated with procedural stress such as handling of the animals. A proconvulsant activity of \nrimonabant was found in one of two safety pharmacology studies. No adverse effect of rimonabant \ntreatment was observed on EEG patterns in rats. \n \nIncreased incidence and/or severity of clinical signs suggestive of increased tactile hyperesthesia were \nobserved in rodent studies. A direct effect of rimonabant cannot be ruled out. \n \nLiver steatosis and a dose-related increase in centrilobular necrosis were observed in long-term studies \nin the rat. A direct effect of rimonabant cannot be ruled out. \n \nIn standard fertility studies in female rats (dosing for 2 weeks prior to mating) there was abnormal \noestrous cyclicity and a decrease in corpora lutea and fertility index at doses of rimonabant that \ninduced maternal toxicity (30 and 60 mg/kg/day). Following dosing for a longer treatment duration \nprior to mating (9 weeks) that permitted recovery from the initial effects of rimonabant, no adverse \neffects were seen on fertility or oestrous cyclicity. Regarding reproductive parameters, at 30 mg/kg no \ndifferences were observed between treated animals and controls, at 60 mg/kg effects were still \nobserved (decreased number of corpora lutea, implantations, total and viable fetuses). \n \nSporadic malformations (anencephaly, micro-ophthalmia, widened brain ventricles and omphalocele) \nwere observed in the rabbit embryofetal toxicity studies at doses resulting in exposures comparable \nwith the clinical exposures. Although maternal toxicity was observed at these doses, a relation to \ntreatment cannot be excluded. No treatment-related malformations were seen in the rat. \n \n\n10 \n\n\n\nM\ned\n\nici\nna\n\nl p\nro\n\ndu\nct \n\nno\n lo\n\nng\ner\n\n a\nut\n\nho\nris\n\ned\n\nEffects of rimonabant on pre- and post-natal development were assessed in the rat at doses up to \n10 mg/kg/day. There was a treatment related increase in pup mortality in the pre-weaning period. The \nincreased pup mortality might be attributable to a failure of the dam to nurse or ingestion of \nrimonabant in milk and/or inhibition of the suckling reflex that is reported in the literature to be \ninitiated in neonatal mice by endocannabinoid signalling via CB1 receptors. There are reports in the \nliterature that, in both rodents and humans, the spatial distribution and density of CB1 receptors in the \nbrain changes during development. The potential relevance of this to administration of a CB1 \nantagonist is unknown. In the pre- and post-natal development study in rats, exposure to rimonabant in \nutero and via lactation produced no alterations on learning or memory, but equivocal effects on motor \nactivity and auditory startle response were observed in the pups as a result of rimonabant exposure. \n \n \n6.
