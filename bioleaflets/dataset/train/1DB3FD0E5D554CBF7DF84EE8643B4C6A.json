This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nQuinsair 240 mg nebuliser solution\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach mL of nebuliser solution contains levofloxacin hemihydrate equivalent to 100 mg of \nlevofloxacin. Each ampoule contains 240 mg of levofloxacin.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nNebuliser solution. \n\nClear, pale yellow solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nQuinsair is indicated for the management of chronic pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas \naeruginosa in adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF, see section 5.1).\n\nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial medicinal \nproducts.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended dosage is 240 mg (one ampoule) administered by inhalation twice daily (see \nsection 5.2). The doses should be inhaled as close as possible to 12 hours apart.\n\nQuinsair is taken in alternating cycles of 28 days on treatment followed by 28 days off treatment. \nCyclical therapy may be continued for as long as the physician considers that the patient is obtaining \nclinical benefit.\n\nIf a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers providing that at least an 8-\nhour interval is allowed before inhaling the next dose. Patients should not inhale the contents of more \nthan one ampoule to compensate for the missed dose.\n\nIf acute symptomatic bronchospasm occurs after receiving Quinsair, patients may benefit from the use \nof a short-acting inhaled bronchodilator at least 15 minutes to 4 hours prior to subsequent doses (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.8).\n\nElderly patients (\u2265 65 years old)\nThe safety and efficacy of Quinsair in elderly patients with CF have not been established.\n\n\n\n3\n\nRenal impairment\nDoses do not need to be adjusted in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment . Quinsair is not \nrecommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Quinsair in children aged \u02c2 18 years old have not yet been established. \nCurrently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. \n\nMethod of administration\n\nInhalation use.\n\nOnce an ampoule is opened, the contents should be used immediately (see section 6.6).\n\nFor patients taking multiple inhaled therapies, the recommended order of administration is as follows:\n1. Bronchodilators;\n2. Dornase alfa;\n3. Airway clearance techniques;\n4. Quinsair; \n5. Inhaled steroids.\n\nQuinsair should only be used with the Zirela Nebuliser Handset (including a Zirela Aerosol Head) \nprovided in the pack connected to an eBase Controller or an eFlow rapid Control Unit (see \nsection 6.6). The Manufacturer\u2019s Instructions for Use of the Zirela Nebuliser System should be \nreviewed prior to the first use of Quinsair.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to the active substance, other quinolones or to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1;\n\n\uf0b7 History of tendon disorders related to fluoroquinolone administration;\n\uf0b7 Epilepsy;\n\uf0b7 Pregnancy;\n\uf0b7 Breast-feeding.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nThe use of levofloxacin should be avoided in patients who have experienced serious adverse reactions \nin the past when using quinolone or fluoroquinolone containing products (see section 4.8). Treatment \nof these patients with levofloxacin should only be initiated in the absence of alternative treatment \noptions and after careful benefit/risk assessment (see also section 4.3).\n\nHypersensitivity reactions\n\nLevofloxacin can cause serious, potentially fatal hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. including angioedema \nand anaphylactic shock). \n\nSevere bullous reactions\n\nCases of severe bullous skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis have been reported with systemic administration of levofloxacin (see section 4.8). \n\n\n\n4\n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nCases of hepatic necrosis up to fatal hepatic failure have been reported with systemically administered \nlevofloxacin, primarily in patients with severe underlying diseases (e.g. sepsis, see section 4.8). \nPatients should be advised to stop treatment and contact their doctor if signs and symptoms of hepatic \ndisease develop such as anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, pruritus or tender abdomen.\n\nQT interval prolongation\n\nCaution should be taken when using fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, in patients with known \nrisk factors for prolongation of the QT interval (see sections 4.5, 4.8 and 4.9) such as, for example: \n\uf0b7 Congenital long QT syndrome.\n\uf0b7 Concomitant use of active substances that are known to prolong the QT interval (e.g. Class IA \n\nand III antiarrhythmics, tricyclic antidepressants, macrolides, antipsychotics). \n\uf0b7 Uncorrected electrolyte imbalance (e.g. hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia).\n\uf0b7 Cardiac disease (e.g. heart failure, myocardial infarction, bradycardia). \nElderly patients and women may be more sensitive to QTc-prolonging medicinal products. Therefore, \ncaution should be taken when using fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, in these populations. \n\nPatients predisposed to seizures\n\nQuinolones may lower the seizure threshold and may trigger seizures (see section 4.8). Levofloxacin is \ncontraindicated in patients with a history of epilepsy (see section 4.3) and, as with other quinolones, \nshould be used with extreme caution in patients predisposed to seizures or on concomitant treatment \nwith active substances that lower the cerebral seizure threshold, such as theophylline (see section 4.5). \n\nPsychotic reactions\n\nPsychotic reactions have been reported in patients receiving quinolones, including levofloxacin. In \nvery rare cases, these have progressed to suicidal thoughts and self-endangering behaviour - \nsometimes after only a single dose of levofloxacin (see section 4.8). Caution is recommended if \nlevofloxacin is used in psychotic patients or in patients with a history of psychiatric disease. \n\nPeripheral neuropathy\n\nCases of sensory or sensorimotor polyneuropathy resulting in paraesthesia, hypaesthesia, dysesthesia, \nor weakness have been reported in patients receiving quinolones and fluoroquinolones. Patients under \ntreatment with levofloxacin should be advised to inform their doctor prior to continuing treatment if \nsymptoms of neuropathy such as pain, burning, tingling, numbness, or weakness develop in order to \nprevent the development of potentially irreversible condition (see section 4.8).\n\nExacerbation of myasthenia gravis\n\nFluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate \nmuscle weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. Post-marketing serious adverse reactions, \nincluding deaths and the requirements for respiratory support, have been associated with \nfluoroquinolone use in patients with myasthenia gravis. Levofloxacin is not recommended in patients \nwith a known history of myasthenia gravis. \n\nTendinitis and tendon rupture\n\nTendinitis and tendon rupture (especially, but not limited to Achilles tendon), sometimes bilateral, \nmay occur as early as within 48 hours of starting treatment with quinolones and fluoroquinolones and \nhave been reported to occur even up to several months after discontinuation of treatment. The risk of \ntendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in older patients, patients with renal impairment, patients \nwith solid organ transplants, patients receiving daily doses of 1,000 mg levofloxacin, and those treated \nconcurrently with corticosteroids. Therefore, concomitant use of corticosteroids should be avoided.\n\n\n\n5\n\nAt the first sign of tendinitis (e.g. painful swelling, inflammation) the treatment with levofloxacin \nshould be discontinued and alternative treatment should be considered. The affected limb(s) should be \nappropriately treated (e.g. immobilisation). Corticosteroids should not be used if signs of tendinopathy \noccur.\n\nTendinitis was reported in patients with CF receiving Quinsair as an uncommon adverse reaction \nduring clinical trials (see section 4.8).\n\nBronchospasm\n\nBronchospasm is a complication associated with inhaled therapies including Quinsair (see section 4.8). \nIf acute, symptomatic bronchospasm occurs after receiving treatment, patients may benefit from the \nuse of a short-acting inhaled bronchodilator prior to subsequent doses (see section 4.2).\n\nHaemoptysis\n\nThe use of inhaled medicinal products may induce a cough reflex. Administration of Quinsair in \npatients with clinically significant haemoptysis should be undertaken only if the benefits of treatment \nare considered to outweigh the risks of inducing further haemorrhage.\n\nPatients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency \n\nPatients with latent or actual defects in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity may be prone to \nhaemolytic reactions when treated with quinolone medicinal products. Therefore, if levofloxacin has \nto be used in these patients, potential occurrence of haemolysis should be monitored. \n\nPatients treated with vitamin K antagonists\n\nDue to possible increases in coagulation tests (PT/INR) and/or bleeding in patients treated with \nlevofloxacin in combination with a vitamin K antagonist (e.g. warfarin), coagulation tests should be \nmonitored when these active substances are given concomitantly (see section 4.5).\n\nDysglycaemia\n\nDisturbances in blood glucose, including both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia have been reported, \nusually in diabetic patients receiving concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycaemic medicinal \nproduct (e.g. glibenclamide) or with insulin. In diabetic patients, careful monitoring of blood glucose \nis recommended (see section 4.8). \n\nClostridium difficile-associated disease\n\nDiarrhoea, particularly if severe, persistent and/or bloody, during or after treatment with levofloxacin \n(including several weeks after treatment), may be symptomatic of Clostridium difficile-associated \ndisease (CDAD). CDAD may range in severity from mild to life-threatening, the most severe form of \nwhich is pseudomembranous colitis.\n\nResistance to levofloxacin, other antibacterial medicinal products and treatment-emergent \nmicroorganisms\n\nThe development of fluoroquinolone-resistant P. aeruginosa and superinfection with \nfluoroquinolone-insusceptible microorganisms represent potential risks associated with the use of \nQuinsair. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. \n\nVision disorders\n\nIf vision becomes impaired or any effects on the eyes are experienced, an eye specialist should be \nconsulted immediately (see sections 4.7 and 4.8).\n\n\n\n6\n\nPrevention of photosensitisation\n\nPhotosensitisation has been reported with levofloxacin (see section 4.8). It is recommended that \npatients should not expose themselves unnecessarily to strong sunlight or to artificial UV rays (e.g. \nsunray lamp, solarium) during treatment and for 48 hours following treatment discontinuation in order \nto prevent photosensitisation. \n\nInterference with laboratory tests\n\nIn patients treated with levofloxacin, determination of opiates in urine may give false-positive results. \nIt may be necessary to confirm positive opiate screens by more specific methods.\n\nLevofloxacin may inhibit the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and, therefore, may give \nfalse-negative results in the bacteriological diagnosis of tuberculosis. \n\nEpidemiologic studies report an increased risk of aortic aneurysm and dissection after intake of \nfluoroquinolones, particularly in the older population.\n\nTherefore, fluoroquinolones should only be used after careful benefit-risk assessment and after \nconsideration of other therapeutic options in patients with positive family history of aneurysm disease, \nor in patients diagnosed with pre-existing aortic aneurysm and/or aortic dissection, or in presence of \nother risk factors or conditions predisposing for aortic aneurysm and dissection (e.g. Marfan \nsyndrome, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis, Behcet\u2019s disease, \nhypertension, known atherosclerosis).\nIn case of sudden abdominal, chest or back pain, patients should be advised to immediately consult a \nphysician in an emergency department.\n\nProlonged, disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse drug reactions\n\nVery rare cases of prolonged (continuing months or years), disabling and potentially irreversible \nserious adverse drug reactions affecting different, sometimes multiple, body systems (musculoskeletal, \nnervous, psychiatric and senses) have been reported in patients receiving quinolones and \nfluoroquinolones irrespective of their age and pre-existing risk factors. Levofloxacin should be \ndiscontinued immediately at the first signs or symptoms of any serious adverse reaction and patients \nshould be advised to contact their prescriber for advice.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nEffect of other medicinal products on levofloxacin\n\nLevofloxacin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine and metabolism is minimal (see \nsection 5.2). Interactions with CYP inhibitors or inducers are thus not expected.\n\nTheophylline, fenbufen or similar non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\nNo pharmacokinetic interactions of levofloxacin were found with theophylline in a clinical study. \nHowever, a pronounced lowering of the cerebral seizure threshold may occur when quinolones are \ngiven concurrently with theophylline, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or other substances \nwhich lower the seizure threshold. Levofloxacin concentrations were about 13% higher in the presence \nof fenbufen than when administered alone. \n\nProbenecid and cimetidine\nThe renal clearance of levofloxacin was reduced by cimetidine (24%) and probenecid (34%). This is \nbecause both active substances are capable of blocking the renal tubular secretion of levofloxacin. \nHowever, at the tested doses in the study, the statistically significant kinetic differences are unlikely to \nbe of clinical relevance. Caution should be exercised when levofloxacin is coadministered with active \n\n\n\n7\n\nsubstances that affect the tubular renal secretion such as probenecid and cimetidine, especially in \npatients with renal impairment.\n\nOther relevant information\nClinical pharmacology studies have shown that the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin were not affected \nto any clinically relevant extent when levofloxacin was administered together with the following \nactive substances: calcium carbonate, digoxin, glibenclamide and ranitidine.\n\nEffect of levofloxacin on other medicinal products \n\nCYP1A2 substrates\nIn a pharmacokinetic interaction study, levofloxacin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of \ntheophylline (which is a probe substrate for CYP1A2) indicating that levofloxacin is not a CYP1A2 \ninhibitor. \n\nCYP2C9 substrates\nAn in vitro study indicated a low potential for interaction between levofloxacin and CYP2C9 \nsubstrates. \n\nInteractions mediated by effects on transporters\nIn vitro studies demonstrated that inhibition of the key transporters associated with drug disposition in \nthe kidney (organic anion-transporting polypeptide-1B1 (OATP1B1), OATP1B3, organic anion \ntransporter-1 (OAT1), OAT3 and organic cationic transporter-2 (OCT2)) at exposures following \ninhalation of 240 mg levofloxacin twice daily is low. \n\nFurthermore, clinical data do not suggest interaction with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates such as \ndigoxin.\n\nCiclosporin\nThe half-life of ciclosporin was increased by 33% when coadministered with levofloxacin.\n\nVitamin K antagonists\nIncreased coagulation tests (PT/INR) and/or bleeding, which may be severe, have been reported in \npatients treated with levofloxacin in combination with a vitamin K antagonist (e.g. warfarin). \nCoagulation tests, therefore, should be monitored in patients treated with vitamin K antagonists (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nActive substances known to prolong the QT interval\nLevofloxacin should be used with caution in patients receiving active substances known to prolong the \nQT interval (e.g. Class IA and III antiarrhythmics, tricyclic antidepressants, macrolides, \nantipsychotics).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere is a limited amount of data from the use of levofloxacin in pregnant women. Animal studies \nwith levofloxacin do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3).\n\nHowever, in the absence of human data and findings in non-clinical studies suggesting a risk of \ndamage by fluoroquinolones to the weight-bearing cartilage of the growing organism, use of Quinsair \nis contraindicated during pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 5.3). \n\n\n\n8\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nThere is insufficient information on the excretion of levofloxacin/metabolites in human milk; \nhowever, other fluoroquinolones are excreted in breast milk.\n\nIn the absence of human data and findings in non-clinical studies suggesting a risk of damage by \nfluoroquinolones to the weight-bearing cartilage of the growing organism, use of Quinsair is \ncontraindicated in breast-feeding women (see sections 4.3 and 5.3). \n\nFertility\n\nLevofloxacin caused no impairment of fertility or reproductive performance in rats (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nQuinsair has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Some adverse reactions (e.g. \nfatigue, asthenia, visual disturbances, dizziness) may impair patient\u2019s ability to concentrate and react. \nPatients who experience such symptoms should be advised not to drive or use machines. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were cough/productive cough (54%), dysgeusia (30%) \nand fatigue/asthenia (25%).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions reported with Quinsair \n\nThe adverse reactions with at least a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship with Quinsair  are \npresented according to the MedDRA System Organ Classification. The adverse drug reactions are \nranked by frequency with the most frequent reactions first. The frequency categories are defined using \nthe following convention: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 \nto < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); and not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data).\n\nSystem organ class Very common Common Uncommon \nInfections and \ninfestations\n\nVulvovaginal mycotic \ninfection\n\nOral fungal infection\n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders\n\nAnaemia*,\nNeutropenia*\n\nImmune system \ndisorders\n\nHypersensitivity*\n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders\n\nAnorexia*\n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders1\n\nInsomnia* Anxiety*,\nDepression*\n\nNervous system \ndisorders1\n\nDysgeusia Headache,\nDizziness*\n\nHyposmia*, \nSomnolence*,\nPeripheral neuropathy\n\nEye disorders1 Visual disturbance*\nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders1\n\nTinnitus* Hearing loss*\n\nCardiac disorders Tachycardia*\n\n\n\n9\n\nSystem organ class Very common Common Uncommon \nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders\n\nCough/productive \ncough, \nDyspnoea, \nChanges in bronchial \nsecretions (volume and \nviscosity)*, \nHaemoptysis*\n\nDysphonia Bronchospasm**,\nBronchial \nhyper-reactivity,\nObstructive airways \ndisorder\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nNausea, \nVomiting, \nAbdominal pain*,\nDiarrhoea*,\nConstipation*\n\nRetching, \nDyspepsia*, \nFlatulence*\n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders\n\nHepatitis*, \nHyperbilirubinaemia*\n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nRash Urticaria*, \nPruritus*\n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders1\n\nArthralgia, \nMyalgia*\n\nTendinitis,\nCostochondritis,\nJoint stiffness\n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders\n\nRenal failure*\n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions1\n\nFatigue/asthenia,\nExercise tolerance \ndecreased\n\nPyrexia\n\nInvestigations Forced expiratory \nvolume decreased*\n\nAlanine \naminotransferase \nincreased,\nAspartate \naminotransferase \nincreased,\nPulmonary function \ntest decreased*, \nBlood glucose \nincreased and \ndecreased*,\nBlood creatinine \nincreased*,\nBreath sounds \nabnormal*\n\nLiver function test \nabnormal, \nBlood alkaline \nphosphatase \nincreased*,\nElectrocardiogram QT \nprolonged*,\nEosinophil count \nincreased*, \nPlatelet count \ndecreased*\n\n1 Very rare cases of prolonged (up to months or years), disabling and potentially irreversible serious drug \nreactions affecting several, sometimes multiple, system organ classes and senses (including reactions such as \ntendonitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, pain in extremities, gait disturbance, depression, fatigue, memory \nimpairment, sleep disorders, and impairment of hearing, vision, taste and smell) have been reported in \nassociation with the use of quinolones and fluoroquinolones in some cases irrespective of pre-existing risk \nfactors (see section 4.4).\n* Adverse events with uncertain relatedness to Quinsair but which are known to be associated with systemic \nadministration of levofloxacin and/or are plausibly associated with Quinsair and were reported more \nfrequently than with placebo in clinical studies.\n** See paragraph below for further details.\n\nTabulated list of additional adverse reactions reported following systemic administration of \nlevofloxacin\n\nThe adverse reactions with at least a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship with levofloxacin \nare presented according to the MedDRA System Organ Classification.

Their frequency \ncannot be estimated from available data. \n\nPaediatric population\n\nIn clinical trials, 51 adolescents with CF (\u2265 12 to < 18 years old) received Quinsair 240 mg twice daily \nand 6 adolescents with CF received Quinsair 120 mg (n = 3) or 240 mg (n = 3) once daily. In addition, \n14 children with CF (\u2265 6 to < 12 years old) and 13 adolescents with CF (\u2265 12 to < 17 years old) \nreceived Quinsair 180 mg or 240 mg once daily for 14 days. Based on these limited data, there does \nnot appear to be any clinically relevant difference in the safety profile of Quinsair in these subsets of \nthe paediatric population compared to adults. However, two cases of arthralgia have been observed in \nchildren in clinical studies with Quinsair and long-term safety data are missing especially considering \nthe effects on cartilage observed in animals (see sections 4.2 and 5.3).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nIn the event of overdose, symptomatic treatment should be implemented. The patient should be \nobserved and appropriate hydration maintained. ECG monitoring should be undertaken because of the \npossibility of QT interval prolongation. Haemodialysis, including peritoneal dialysis and continuous \nambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), are not effective in removing levofloxacin from the body. No \nspecific antidote exists.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antibacterials for systemic use, fluoroquinolones ATC code: J01MA12 \n\n\n\n12\n\nMechanism of action\n\nThe mechanism of action of levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolone antimicrobials involves inhibition \nof bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV enzymes.\n\nPK/PD relationship \n\nThe parameters associated with the antibacterial effects of levofloxacin are the Cmax/MIC and \nAUC/MIC ratios (Cmax = maximum concentration at the site of infection, AUC = area under the curve \nand MIC = minimal inhibitory concentration). \n\nResistance\n\nResistance to levofloxacin is most often acquired through a stepwise process by target site mutations \nin DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Reduced susceptibility to levofloxacin can also result from \nacquisition of plasmids encoding proteins that protect these targets from inhibition. Reduced bacterial \npermeability (common in P. aeruginosa) and efflux mechanisms may also confer or contribute to \nresistance. \n\nCross-resistance between levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones is observed. \n\nBreakpoints\n\nEstablished susceptibility breakpoints for systemic (oral or intravenous) administration of levofloxacin \nare not applicable to delivery by inhalation.\n\nClinical efficacy\n\nClinical efficacy was demonstrated in two placebo-controlled studies and one active-comparator study \nin 448 patients randomised to receive Quinsair 240 mg twice daily. \n\nTwo randomised, double-blind, single-cycle, placebo-controlled clinical trials (Studies 204 and 207) in \npatients with CF chronically infected with P. aeruginosa were conducted. Adult and adolescent \n(\u2265 12 to < 18 years old and weighing \u2265 30 kg) patients who had a FEV1 percent predicted between \n25% and 85% were enrolled. All patients had also received a minimum of 3 courses of inhaled \nanti-pseudomonal antimicrobial therapy in the 12 months (Study 204) or 18 months (Study 207) prior \nto entry into the study, but none in the 28 days immediately preceding study entry. In addition to study \ndrug, patients remained on standard of care treatment for chronic pulmonary infection. A total of \n259 patients were randomised to Quinsair 240 mg twice daily for 28 days (\u2265 18 years, n = 226; \u2265 12 to \n< 18 years old, n = 33) and 147 were randomised to placebo (\u2265 18 years, n = 127; \u2265 12 to < 18 years \nold, n = 20).

A total of 88 patients received at least 1 dose of Quinsair in Study 209 (Extension Phase), \n32 of these had received TIS and 56 of these had received Quinsair in the Core Phase. During the \nExtension Phase, the LS Mean change for FEV1 percent predicted ranged between 4.83% to 1.46% \nacross the 3 additional treatment cycles. For the subgroup of patients who received TIS during the \nCore Phase and switched to Quinsair in the Extension Phase, the improvement in FEV1 percent \npredicted was more marked on Quinsair than on TIS (LS Mean change in FEV1 percent predicted on \nTIS ranged between 0.97% to 3.60% across Cycles 1 to 3 and between 4.00% to 6.91% across \nCycles 4 to 6 on Quinsair). For the subgroup of patients who received Quinsair throughout the Core \nand Extension Phases (i.e. Cycles 1 to 6), the LS Mean change in FEV1 percent predicted ranged \nbetween 3.6% to 4.6% except in Cycle 6, where it was close to baseline (-0.15%). The proportion of \npatients who received Quinsair throughout Study 209 Core and Extension Phases (with a highest \nlevofloxacin MIC P. aeruginosa isolate exceeding 1 \u00b5g/mL) was similar at the end of treatment during \nCycles 1 and 3 in the Core Phase (76.6% to 83.3%) and at the end of treatment during Cycles 4 to 6 in \nthe Extension Phase (77.8% to 87.5%). \n\nIn the clinical studies described above, the Zirela Nebuliser System was used to administer Quinsair. \nIn vitro studies using the Zirela Nebuliser System with Quinsair have demonstrated the following drug \n\n\n\n15\n\ndelivery characteristics: mass median aerodynamic diameter (droplet size distribution): \n3.56 micrometres (1.51 geometric standard deviation); drug delivery rate: 24.86 mg/minute \n(4.05 standard deviation, SD) and total drug delivered: 236.1 mg (7.1 SD). \n\nPaediatric population\n\nIn Studies 204, 207 and 209, the relative change in FEV1 percent predicted from baseline to the end of \ntreatment in Cycle 1 was of similar magnitude in the 51 adolescents with CF (\u2265 12 to < 18 years old \nand weighing \u2265 30 kg) receiving Quinsair 240 mg twice daily to that in adults. Efficacy was not \nevaluated in the 14 children with CF (\u2265 6 to < 12 years old) and 13 adolescents with CF \n(\u2265 12 to < 17 years old) who participated in Study 206.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nQuinsair in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in cystic fibrosis patients with \nP. aeruginosa pulmonary infection/colonisation (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\nThe maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) of levofloxacin following administration by inhalation \noccurred at approximately 0.5-1 hour post-dose. \n\nMultiple dose administration of Quinsair 240 mg twice daily by inhalation results in levofloxacin \nsystemic exposure approximately 50% lower than that observed following systemic administration of \ncomparable doses (see Table 3). However, there is variability in the systemic exposures observed \nwhich means that serum levels of levofloxacin following inhalation of Quinsair may sometimes fall \nwithin the range of levels observed following systemic administration of comparable doses.\n\nTable 3: Comparison of mean (SD) multiple dose levofloxacin pharmacokinetic parameters \nfollowing Quinsair administration by inhalation to patients with CF and following oral and \nintravenous administration of levofloxacin to healthy adult volunteers\n\nQuinsair Systemic levofloxacin\nPharmacokinetic \nparameter 240 mg Inhalation\n\nBID\n500 mg Oral\n\nQD*\n500 mg IV\n\nQD*\nCmax (\u03bcg/mL) 2.4 (1.0) 5.7 (1.4) 6.4 (0.8)\nAUC(0-24) (\u00b5g\u2022h/mL) 20.9 (12.5) 47.5 (6.7) 54.6 (11.1)\nIV = intravenous; QD = quaque die (once a day); BID = bis in die (twice a day)\n* Predicted value from population PK analysis in CF patients\n** Healthy males 18-53 years old\n\nHigh levofloxacin concentrations were observed in sputum following Quinsair 240 mg twice daily \ndosing in patients with CF. The mean post-dose sputum concentrations were approximately \n500-1,900 \u00b5g/mL and were approximately 400-1,700 times higher than those observed in serum.\n\nDistribution\n\nApproximately 30 to 40% of levofloxacin is bound to serum protein. The mean apparent volume of \ndistribution of levofloxacin in serum is approximately 250 L following inhalation of Quinsair 240 mg \ntwice daily. \n\n\n\n16\n\nBiotransformation\n\nLevofloxacin is metabolised to a very small extent, the metabolites being desmethyl-levofloxacin and \nlevofloxacin N-oxide. These metabolites account for \u02c2 5% of the dose following systemic \nadministration and are excreted in urine. Levofloxacin is stereochemically stable and does not undergo \nchiral inversion.\n\nElimination\n\nLevofloxacin is systemically absorbed following inhalation of Quinsair and eliminated similarly to \nlevofloxacin following systemic administration. Following oral and intravenous administration, \nlevofloxacin is eliminated relatively slowly from the plasma (t\u00bd: 6 to 8 hours). The half-life of \nlevofloxacin following inhalation of Quinsair is approximately 5 to 7 hours. Elimination is primarily \nby the renal route (> 85% of the dose following oral or intravenous administration). The mean \napparent total body clearance of levofloxacin following systemic administration of a 500 mg single \ndose was 175 +/- 29.2 mL/min. The apparent clearance (CL/F) of levofloxacin following inhalation of \nQuinsair 240 mg twice daily is 31.8 +/- 22.4 L/hour.\n\nLinearity\n\nFollowing systemic administration, levofloxacin obeys linear pharmacokinetics over a range of \n50 to 1,000 mg.\n\nPatients with renal impairment\n\nThe effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin administered by inhalation \nhave not been studied. However, dose adjustments were not employed in clinical studies of Quinsair \nwhich allowed for the inclusion of patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (estimated \ncreatinine clearance \u2265 20 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula in adult patients and \n\u2265 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 using the Bedside Schwartz formula in patients < 18 years old). Studies using \nsystemic administration of levofloxacin show that the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin are affected \nby renal impairment; with decreasing renal function (estimated creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), \nrenal elimination and clearance are decreased, and elimination half-life increased. \n\nTherefore, doses of Quinsair do not need to be adjusted in patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment. However, Quinsair is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance \u02c2 20 ml/min, see section 4.2).\n\nPatients with hepatic impairment\n\nPharmacokinetic studies with Quinsair in patients with hepatic impairment have not been conducted. \nDue to the limited extent of levofloxacin metabolism in the liver, the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin \nare not expected to be affected by hepatic impairment.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Quinsair in children aged \u02c2 18 years old have not yet been established (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin following inhalation of Quinsair 240 mg twice daily were \ninvestigated in paediatric patients with CF aged 12 years and older and weighing \u2265 30 kg. A \npopulation PK model based on sparse sampling determined that levofloxacin serum concentrations \nwere comparable between paediatric and adult patients following 28 days of treatment. Higher sputum \nconcentrations were observed in adults compared to paediatric patients in Study 207; similar sputum \nconcentrations were observed in adult and paediatric patients in Study 209. \n\n\n\n17\n\nIn addition, the pharmacokinetics of weight-based doses of levofloxacin administered by inhalation \nonce daily for 14 days in paediatric patients with CF (\u2265 6 to < 12 years old, n = 14 and \n\u2265 12 to < 17 years old, n = 13) were evaluated in Study 206. Patients weighing 22 to 30 kg received \n180 mg levofloxacin/day and patients weighing \u02c3 30 kg received 240 mg levofloxacin/day. The \nweight-based dosing scheme resulted in consistent serum and sputum PK exposure across the range of \nages (7 to 16 years old) and weights (22 to 61 kg) observed in the study. Serum PK exposures were \nsimilar when comparing children receiving the weight-based regimen and adults receiving \nQuinsair 240 mg once daily. Sputum PK exposure in children aged 7 to 16 years old was \napproximately one-third of adult exposure. \n\nElderly patients (\u2265 65 years old) \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin administered by inhalation have not been studied in the elderly. \nFollowing systemic administration, there were no significant differences in levofloxacin \npharmacokinetics between young and elderly subjects except those associated with age-related \ndecreases in creatinine clearance. \n\nGender \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis results showed no differences in systemic exposure of \nlevofloxacin due to gender following administration of Quinsair.\n\nRace\n\nThe effects of race on the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin administered by inhalation have not been \nstudied. Following systemic administration, the effect of race on levofloxacin pharmacokinetics was \nexamined through a covariate analysis performed on data from 72 subjects: 48 white and \n24 non-white. The apparent total body clearance and apparent volume of distribution were not affected \nby the race of the subjects.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single dose \ntoxicity, repeated dose toxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to reproduction and development. \n\nFluoroquinolones have been shown to cause arthropathy in weight-bearing joints of immature animals. \nIn common with other fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin showed effects on cartilage (blistering and \ncavities) in rats and dogs. These findings were more marked in young animals.\n\nLevofloxacin did not induce gene mutations in bacterial or mammalian cells but did induce \nchromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster lung cells in vitro. These effects can be attributed to \ninhibition of topoisomerase II. In vivo tests (micronucleus, sister chromatid exchange, unscheduled \nDNA synthesis, dominant lethal tests) did not show any genotoxic potential. Studies in the mouse \nshowed levofloxacin to have phototoxic activity only at very high doses. Levofloxacin did not show \nany genotoxic potential in a photomutagenicity assay. It reduced tumour development in a \nphotocarcinogenicity study. \n\nLevofloxacin caused no impairment of fertility or reproductive performance in rats and its only effect \non foetuses was delayed maturation as a result of maternal toxicity.\n\nNon-clinical studies conducted with levofloxacin using the inhalation route revealed no special hazard \nfor humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology (respiratory), single dose toxicity \nand repeated dose toxicity.\n\n\n\n18\n\n6.

What you need to know before you use Quinsair\n3. How to use Quinsair\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Quinsair\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Quinsair is and what it is used for\n\nQuinsair contains an antibiotic medicine called levofloxacin. It belongs to the group of antibiotics \ncalled fluoroquinolones.\n\nQuinsair is used to treat lung infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in adults with cystic \nfibrosis. It is an antibiotic medicine that is breathed (inhaled) directly into the lungs where it kills the \nbacteria causing the infection. This helps to improve breathing in people with cystic fibrosis. \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Quinsair\n\nDo not use Quinsair:\n- if you are allergic to levofloxacin, to any other quinolone antibiotics, such as moxifloxacin, \n\nciprofloxacin or ofloxacin, or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6)\n\n- if you have ever had a problem with your tendons (inflammation of a tendon or a ruptured \ntendon) during treatment with a quinolone or fluoroquinolone antibiotic\n\n- if you suffer from epilepsy \n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding\n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nBefore taking this medicine\nYou should not take fluoroquinolone/quinolone antibacterial medicines, including Quinsair, if you \nhave experienced any serious adverse reaction in the past when taking a quinolone or fluoroquinolone. \nIn this situation, you should inform your doctor as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n33\n\nWhen taking this medicine\nPain and swelling in the joints and inflammation or rupture of tendons may occur rarely. Your risk is \nincreased if you are elderly (above 60 years of age), have received an organ transplant, have kidney \nproblems or if you are being treated with corticosteroids. Inflammation and ruptures of tendons may \noccur within the first 48 hours of treatment and even up to several months after stopping of Quinsair \ntherapy. At the first sign of pain or inflammation of a tendon (for example in your ankle, wrist, elbow, \nshoulder or knee), stop taking Quinsair, contact your doctor and rest the painful area. Avoid any \nunnecessary exercise as this might increase the risk of a tendon rupture.\n\nTell your doctor before using Quinsair \n\nif you have or have ever had any of the following:\n- Prolonged, disabling and potentially irreversible serious side effects\n\nFluoroquinolone/quinolone antibacterial medicines, including Quinsair, have been associated \nwith very rare but serious side effects, some of them being long lasting (continuing months or \nyears), disabling or potentially irreversible. This includes tendon, muscle and joint pain of the \nupper and lower limbs, difficulty walking, abnormal sensations such as pins and needles, \ntingling, tickling, numbness or burning (paraesthesia), sensory disorders including impairment \nof vision, taste and smell, and hearing, depression, memory impairment, severe fatigue, and \nsevere sleep disorders.\nIf you experience any of these side effects after taking Quinsair, contact your doctor \nimmediately prior to continuing treatment. You and your doctor will decide on continuing the \ntreatment considering also an antibiotic from another class.\n\n- Severe kidney problems.\n\n- A severe allergic reaction. Symptoms are listed in section 4.\n\n- Severe skin reactions\nIf you are treated with Quinsair, you may have a severe skin reaction such as blistering or \nlesions. Tell your doctor if you notice any skin reactions after using Quinsair.\n\n- Liver problems. Symptoms are listed in section 4.\n\n- Heart rhythm abnormalities\nQuinsair can cause changes to your heart rhythm, especially if you are taking any medicines to \ntreat heart problems or low levels of potassium or magnesium in the blood. Women who take \nthese types of medicines may be more likely to be affected. If you experience palpitations or an \nirregular heart beat whilst using Quinsair you should tell your doctor immediately.\n\n- Seizures and convulsions\nQuinolone antibiotics, including Quinsair, may cause seizures or convulsions (fits). If this \nhappens, stop using Quinsair and contact your doctor immediately.\n\n- Depression or mental health problems.\n\n- Nerve damage\nYou may rarely experience symptoms of nerve damage (neuropathy) such as pain, burning, \ntingling, numbness and/or weakness especially in the feet and legs or hands and arms. If this \nhappens, stop taking Quinsair and inform your doctor immediately in order to prevent the \ndevelopment of potentially irreversible condition.\n\n- A disease causing muscle weakness and fatigue called myasthenia gravis.\n\n- Inflammation of a tendon causing pain, stiffness and/or swelling in the joints (tendonitis).\n\n\n\n34\n\n- If you have experienced difficulty in breathing after receiving Quinsair, which can range from \nmild to severe (bronchospasm).\n\n- Coughing up blood or blood-stained mucus from the airways.\n\n- Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogensae deficiency\nQuinolone antibiotics, such as Quinsair, can cause patients with glucose-6-phosphate \ndehydrogenase deficiency (a rare hereditary disease) to be prone to blood complications leading \nto a sudden rise in body temperature, yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes, dark \ncoloured urine, paleness, tiredness, heavy, fast breathing and a weak, rapid pulse. Talk to your \ndoctor if you have any questions about this.\n\n- Diabetes\nQuinolone antibiotics, including Quinsair, may cause levels of glucose in the blood to be either \ntoo high or too low. If you are diabetic, you should monitor your blood glucose levels carefully.\n\n- Diarrhoea\nYou may develop diarrhoea during or after your treatment with Quinsair. If this becomes severe \nor persistent, or you notice blood in your stools, you should stop using Quinsair immediately \nand talk to your doctor. Do not take any medicines to treat your diarrhoea without first checking \nwith your doctor.\n\n- Resistance to antibiotics\nBacteria can become resistant to treatment with an antibiotic over time. This means that \nQuinsair should not be used to prevent lung infections. It should only be used to treat lung \ninfections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns or \nquestions about this.\n\n- Superinfections\nSometimes lengthy treatment with antibiotics can mean that you get another infection caused by \nother bacteria which are not affected by the antibiotic (superinfection). Talk to your doctor if \nyou have any concerns or questions about this and using Quinsair.\n\n- Vision problems\nIf you notice any changes in your eyesight or any other problems with your eyes whilst using \nQuinsair, contact an eye specialist immediately. \n\n- Photosensitivity\nQuinsair may make your skin become more sensitive to sunlight. You should avoid prolonged \nexposure to sunlight or strong sunlight and should not use sunbeds or any other UV lamps \nwhilst using Quinsair and for 48 hours after stopping treatment. \n\n- False test results\nCertain tests (e.g. to confirm tuberculosis or screening for strong painkillers) may give false \nresults whilst you are being treated with Quinsair.\n\nif you have been diagnosed with an enlargement or \"bulge\" of a large blood vessel (aortic aneurysm or \nlarge vessel peripheral aneurysm).\n\nif you have experienced a previous episode of aortic dissection (a tear in the aorta wall).\n\nif you have a family history of aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection or other risk factors or \npredisposing conditions (e.g. connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome, or vascular Ehlers-\nDanlos syndrome, or vascular disorders such as Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis, Behcet\u2019s \ndisease, high blood pressure, or known atherosclerosis).\n\n\n\n35\n\nif you feel sudden, severe pain in your abdomen, chest or back, go immediately to an emergency \nroom.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nQuinsair should not be given to children and adolescents less than 18 years old as there is not enough \ninformation about its use in this age group.\n\nOther medicines and Quinsair\nTell your doctor or a pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. These medicines may interfere with the effects of Quinsair.\n\nTell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines:\n- Vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin (used to prevent blood clots). Taking these medicines \n\nwith Quinsair may lead to an increase in bleeding. Your doctor may need to give you regular \nblood tests to check how well your blood can clot.\n\n- Theophylline (used to treat breathing problems) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines \n(NSAIDs) such as fenbufen, acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used \nto relieve pain and lower fever, as well as to prevent blood clotting) or ibuprofen. Taking \nQuinsair at the same time as these medicines could increase your risk of a fit (seizure). \n\n- Medicines such as probenecid (used to prevent gout) or cimetidine (used to treat ulcers). \nTaking Quinsair at the same time as these medicines could affect how your kidneys deal with \nthe medicine which is particularly important if you suffer from kidney problems.\n\n- Ciclosporin (used after organ transplants) or medicines that affect your heart beat (such as \nantiarrhythmics, tricyclic antidepressants, macrolide antibiotics or antipsychotics). Quinsair can \ninterfere with the effects of these medicines. Your doctor will explain more.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nQuinsair must not be used whilst pregnant or breast-feeding.

"Section_2": {"Title": "2. what you need to know before you use quinsair", "Section_Content": "do not use quinsair: - if you are allergic to levofloxacin, to any other quinolone antibiotics, such as moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin, or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) - if you have ever had a problem with your tendons (inflammation of a tendon or a ruptured tendon) during treatment with a quinolone or fluoroquinolone antibiotic - if you suffer from epilepsy - if you are pregnant or breast-feeding warnings and precautions before taking this medicine you should not take fluoroquinolone/quinolone antibacterial medicines, including quinsair, if you have experienced any serious adverse reaction in the past when taking a quinolone or fluoroquinolone. in this situation, you should inform your doctor as soon as possible. when taking this medicine pain and swelling in the joints and inflammation or rupture of tendons may occur rarely. your risk is increased if you are elderly (above 60 years of age), have received an organ transplant, have kidney problems or if you are being treated with corticosteroids. inflammation and ruptures of tendons may occur within the first 48 hours of treatment and even up to several months after stopping of quinsair therapy. at the first sign of pain or inflammation of a tendon (for example in your ankle, wrist, elbow, shoulder or knee), stop taking quinsair, contact your doctor and rest the painful area. avoid any unnecessary exercise as this might increase the risk of a tendon rupture. tell your doctor before using quinsair if you have or have ever had any of the following: - prolonged, disabling and potentially irreversible serious side effects fluoroquinolone/quinolone antibacterial medicines, including quinsair, have been associated with very rare but serious side effects, some of them being long lasting (continuing months or years), disabling or potentially irreversible. this includes tendon, muscle and joint pain of the upper and lower limbs, difficulty walking, abnormal sensations such as pins and needles, tingling, tickling, numbness or burning (paraesthesia), sensory disorders including impairment of vision, taste and smell, and hearing, depression, memory impairment, severe fatigue, and severe sleep disorders. if you experience any of these side effects after taking quinsair, contact your doctor immediately prior to continuing treatment. you and your doctor will decide on continuing the treatment considering also an antibiotic from another class. - severe kidney problems. - a severe allergic reaction. symptoms are listed in section 4. - severe skin reactions if you are treated with quinsair, you may have a severe skin reaction such as blistering or lesions. tell your doctor if you notice any skin reactions after using quinsair. - liver problems. symptoms are listed in section 4. - heart rhythm abnormalities quinsair can cause changes to your heart rhythm, especially if you are taking any medicines to treat heart problems or low levels of potassium or magnesium in the blood. women who take these types of medicines may be more likely to be affected. if you experience palpitations or an irregular heart beat whilst using quinsair you should tell your doctor immediately. - seizures and convulsions quinolone antibiotics, including quinsair, may cause seizures or convulsions (fits). if this happens, stop using quinsair and contact your doctor immediately. - depression or mental health problems. - nerve damage you may rarely experience symptoms of nerve damage (neuropathy) such as pain, burning, tingling, numbness and/or weakness especially in the feet and legs or hands and arms. if this happens, stop taking quinsair and inform your doctor immediately in order to prevent the development of potentially irreversible condition. - a disease causing muscle weakness and fatigue called myasthenia gravis. - inflammation of a tendon causing pain, stiffness and/or swelling in the joints (tendonitis). - if you have experienced difficulty in breathing after receiving quinsair, which can range from mild to severe (bronchospasm). - coughing up blood or blood-stained mucus from the airways. - glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogensae deficiency quinolone antibiotics, such as quinsair, can cause patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (a rare hereditary disease) to be prone to blood complications leading to a sudden rise in body temperature, yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes, dark coloured urine, paleness, tiredness, heavy, fast breathing and a weak, rapid pulse. talk to your doctor if you have any questions about this. - diabetes quinolone antibiotics, including quinsair, may cause levels of glucose in the blood to be either too high or too low. if you are diabetic, you should monitor your blood glucose levels carefully. - diarrhoea you may develop diarrhoea during or after your treatment with quinsair. if this becomes severe or persistent, or you notice blood in your stools, you should stop using quinsair immediately and talk to your doctor. do not take any medicines to treat your diarrhoea without first checking with your doctor. - resistance to antibiotics bacteria can become resistant to treatment with an antibiotic over time. this means that quinsair should not be used to prevent lung infections. it should only be used to treat lung infections caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa. talk to your doctor if you have any concerns or questions about this. - superinfections sometimes lengthy treatment with antibiotics can mean that you get another infection caused by other bacteria which are not affected by the antibiotic (superinfection). talk to your doctor if you have any concerns or questions about this and using quinsair. - vision problems if you notice any changes in your eyesight or any other problems with your eyes whilst using quinsair, contact an eye specialist immediately. - photosensitivity quinsair may make your skin become more sensitive to sunlight. you should avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight or strong sunlight and should not use sunbeds or any other uv lamps whilst using quinsair and for 48 hours after stopping treatment. - false test results certain tests (e.g. to confirm tuberculosis or screening for strong painkillers) may give false results whilst you are being treated with quinsair. if you have been diagnosed with an enlargement or \"bulge\" of a large blood vessel (aortic aneurysm or large vessel peripheral aneurysm). if you have experienced a previous episode of aortic dissection (a tear in the aorta wall). if you have a family history of aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection or other risk factors or predisposing conditions (e.g. connective tissue disorders such as marfan syndrome, or vascular ehlers- danlos syndrome, or vascular disorders such as takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis, behcet's disease, high blood pressure, or known atherosclerosis). if you feel sudden, severe pain in your abdomen, chest or back, go immediately to an emergency room. children and adolescents quinsair should not be given to children and adolescents less than 18 years old as there is not enough information about its use in this age group. other medicines and quinsair tell your doctor or a pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. these medicines may interfere with the effects of quinsair. tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - vitamin k antagonists such as warfarin (used to prevent blood clots). taking these medicines with quinsair may lead to an increase in bleeding. your doctor may need to give you regular blood tests to check how well your blood can clot. - theophylline (used to treat breathing problems) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (nsaids) such as fenbufen, acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain and lower fever, as well as to prevent blood clotting) or ibuprofen. taking quinsair at the same time as these medicines could increase your risk of a fit (seizure). - medicines such as probenecid (used to prevent gout) or cimetidine (used to treat ulcers). taking quinsair at the same time as these medicines could affect how your kidneys deal with the medicine which is particularly important if you suffer from kidney problems. - ciclosporin (used after organ transplants) or medicines that affect your heart beat (such as antiarrhythmics, tricyclic antidepressants, macrolide antibiotics or antipsychotics). quinsair can interfere with the effects of these medicines. your doctor will explain more. pregnancy and breast-feeding quinsair must not be used whilst pregnant or breast-feeding. if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. driving and using machines quinsair may make you feel dizzy, tired or weak, or cause problems with your eyesight. if this happens to you, do not drive or use any tools or machines.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "quinsair", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "allergic", "Type": "PROBLEM", "BeginOffset": 34, "EndOffset": 42}, {"Id":

use it for? you use quinsair every day for 28 days, then take a 28-day break, during which you do not inhale any quinsair. you then start another treatment course. it is important that you keep using the medicine twice a day during your 28 days on treatment and that you keep to the 28-days on, 28-days off cycle for as long as your doctor tells you to. if you experience breathing difficulties when you use quinsair what additional medicine may your doctor prescribe for you? if you experience breathing difficulties after using quinsair, your doctor may prescribe you an inhaler containing a bronchodilator medicine (e.g. salbutamol). inhale this medicine at least 15 minutes or up to 4 hours before your next dose of quinsair. what if i am using several different inhalers and other therapies for cystic fibrosis? if you are using several different inhaled treatments and other therapies for cystic fibrosis, it is recommended that you use your medicines in the following order: 1st bronchodilators 2nd dornase alfa 3rd airway clearance techniques 4th quinsair 5th inhaled steroids how to use it quinsair should be taken by inhalation using a zirela nebuliser handset (including a zirela aerosol head). this should be connected to either an ebase controller or an eflow rapid control unit. important information to know before you start - each ampoule is for single use only. once an ampoule is opened, the contents should be used immediately. - do not use quinsair if you notice that the sealed foil sachet or ampoules have been tampered with. - do not use quinsair if you notice that it is cloudy or there are particles in the solution. - do not mix quinsair with any other medicines in the zirela nebuliser handset. - do not put any medicines other than quinsair in the zirela nebuliser handset. - do not try to inhale quinsair using any other type of nebuliser handset. - check that your zirela nebuliser system works properly before starting your treatment. - do not swallow the liquid in the ampoule. carefully read the manufacturer's instructions for use, provided with your zirela nebuliser handset. how do i prepare my nebuliser system to inhale the medicine? keep the zirela instructions for use in a safe place as they give full details on assembling the device. 1) make sure that the zirela nebuliser handset is on a flat and stable surface. on quinsair use it twice a day for 28 days off quinsair do not use it for the next 28 days repeat cycle 37 2) squeeze all of the contents of one ampoule into the medicine reservoir of the zirela nebuliser handset (figure 1). ensure that you completely empty the ampoule, gently tapping it against the side of the reservoir if necessary. figure 1 3) close the medicine reservoir by aligning the tabs of the medicine cap with the slots of the reservoir (a). press down and turn the cap clockwise as far as it will go (b, figure 2). figure 2 how do i use the zirela nebuliser system? 1) when you start your treatment, sit in a relaxed, upright position. 2) hold the handset level, press and hold the on/off button on the controller for a few seconds. you will hear one 'beep' and the status light will turn green. 3) after a few seconds, an aerosol mist will begin to flow into the aerosol chamber of the zirela nebuliser handset. if aerosol mist does not begin to flow, please refer to the zirela manufacturer's instructions for use for help. 4) keeping the handset level, place the mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips around it (figure 3). figure 3 5) breathe normally (inhale and exhale) through the mouthpiece. try not to breathe through your nose. continue to inhale and exhale comfortably until the treatment is finished. it takes about 5 minutes to inhale the medicine using the nebuliser. 6) when all of the medicine has been delivered, you will hear two 'beeps', which means the treatment is complete. 7) once complete, open the medicine cap to ensure all of the medicine has been used. a few drops of medicine may remain at the bottom of the reservoir at the end of treatment. this is ok. however if there are more than a few drops left, replace the medicine cap and restart treatment, from step 1. 8) once treatment is complete, disconnect the controller and take apart the zirela nebuliser handset for cleaning and disinfecting. the manufacturer's instructions for use will give full details on cleaning and disinfecting. what if i need to stop my treatment before i've finished? if for any reason you must stop the treatment before it's finished, press and hold the controller's on/off button for one second. after it has completely turned itself off and when you are ready to restart, press and hold the on/off button for one second again. treatment will restart. you must inhale and exhale through the mouthpiece as before. how and when do i replace the zirela nebuliser handset? one nebuliser handset should be used for one 28-day treatment course. please refer to the manufacturer's instructions for use for cleaning and storage advice. if you use more quinsair than you should if you have used more quinsair than you should, tell your doctor as soon as possible. you may experience symptoms like irregular heart beat, which needs to be checked by your doctor. if the contents of the ampoule are swallowed, don't worry but tell your doctor as soon as possible. if you forget to use quinsair if you forget a dose, use it as soon as you remember as long as there is an 8-hour interval before inhaling the next dose. however if it is nearly the time for your next dose, skip the missed dose. do not inhale the contents of more than one ampoule to make up for a missed dose. if you stop using quinsair do not stop using quinsair without first talking to your doctor as your lung infection may worsen. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "quinsair", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset":
