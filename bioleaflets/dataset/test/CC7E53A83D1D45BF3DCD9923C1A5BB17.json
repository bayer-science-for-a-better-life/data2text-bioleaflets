This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nDelstrigo 100 mg/300 mg/245 mg film-coated tablets.\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 100 mg of doravirine, 300 mg of lamivudine, and 300 mg of tenofovir \ndisoproxil fumarate equivalent to 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil.\n\nExcipient with known effect\nEach film-coated tablet contains 8.6 mg lactose (as monohydrate).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet.\n\nYellow, oval-shaped, tablet of dimensions 21.59 mm x 11.30 mm, debossed with the corporate logo \nand 776 on one side and plain on the other side.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nDelstrigo is indicated for the treatment of adults infected with HIV-1 without past or present evidence \nof resistance to the NNRTI class, lamivudine, or tenofovir (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose of Delstrigo is one 100/300/245 mg tablet taken orally once daily with or \nwithout food.\n\nDose adjustment\nIf Delstrigo is co-administered with rifabutin, the doravirine dose should be increased to 100 mg twice \ndaily. This is achieved by adding one 100 mg tablet of doravirine (as a single agent), to be taken \napproximately 12 hours apart from the dose of Delstrigo (see section 4.5).\n\nCo-administration of doravirine with other moderate CYP3A inducers has not been evaluated, but\ndecreased doravirine concentrations are expected. If co-administration with oth,er moderate CYP3A \ninducers (e.g., dabrafenib, lesinurad, bosentan, thioridazine, nafcillin, modafinil, telotristat ethyl) \ncannot be avoided, one 100 mg tablet of doravirine should be taken daily, approximately 12 hours \nafter the dose of Delstrigo (see section 4.5).\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nMissed dose\nIf the patient misses a dose of Delstrigo within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient \nshould take Delstrigo as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule. If a patient misses a \ndose of Delstrigo by more than 12 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose and instead take \nthe next dose at the regularly scheduled time. The patient should not take 2 doses at one time.\n\nSpecial populations\nElderly\nThere are limited data available on the use of doravirine, lamivudine, and tenofovir disoproxil in \npatients aged 65 years and over. There is no evidence that elderly patients require a different dose than \nyounger adult patients (see section 5.2). Special care is advised in this age group due to age associated \nchanges such as decreases in renal function (see section 4.4).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment of Delstrigo is required in adults with estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) \n\u2265 50 mL/min.\n\nDelstrigo should not be initiated in patients with estimated CrCl < 50 mL/min (see sections 4.4 \nand 5.2). Delstrigo should be discontinued if estimated CrCl declines below 50 mL/min (see \nsection 4.4). Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment require a dose interval adjustment of \nlamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil that cannot be achieved with the combination tablet (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment of doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil is required in patients with mild \n(Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. Doravirine has not been \nstudied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). It is not known whether the \nexposure to doravirine will increase in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, caution is \nadvised when doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil is administered to patients with severe \nhepatic impairment (see section 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nSafety and efficacy of Delstrigo have not been established in patients younger than 18 years of age. No \ndata are available.\n\nMethod of administration\nDelstrigo must be taken orally, once daily with or without food and swallowed whole (see section 5.2).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nCo-administration with medicinal products that are strong cytochrome P450 CYP3A enzyme inducers \nis contraindicated as significant decreases in doravirine plasma concentrations are expected to occur, \nwhich may decrease the effectiveness of Delstrigo (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). These medicinal \nproducts include, but are not limited to the following:\n\uf0b7 carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin\n\uf0b7 rifampicin, rifapentine\n\uf0b7 St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum)\n\uf0b7 mitotane\n\uf0b7 enzalutamide\n\uf0b7 lumacaftor\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission of HIV-1, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines.\n\nNNRTI substitutions and use of doravirine\nDoravirine has not been evaluated in patients with previous virologic failure to any other antiretroviral \ntherapy. NNRTI-associated mutations detected at screening were part of exclusion criteria in the Phase \n2b/3-studies. A breakpoint for a reduction in susceptibility, yielded by various NNRTI substitutions,\nthat is associated with a reduction in clinical efficacy has not been established (see section 5.1). There \nis not sufficient clinical evidence to support the use of doravirine in patients infected with HIV-1 with \nevidence of resistance to the NNRTI class.\n\nSevere acute exacerbation of hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV\nAll patients with HIV-1 should be tested for the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) before initiating\nantiretroviral therapy.\n\nSevere acute exacerbations of hepatitis B (e.g., liver decompensated and liver failure) have been \nreported in patients who are co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, and have discontinued lamivudine or \ntenofovir disoproxil, two of the components of Delstrigo. Patients who are co-infected with HIV-1 and \nHBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several \nmonths after stopping treatment with Delstrigo. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy \nmay be warranted, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, since post-treatment \nexacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure.\n\nNew onset or worsening renal impairment\nRenal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury \nwith severe hypophosphataemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil, a component \nof Delstrigo.\n\nDelstrigo should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic medicinal products (e.g., \nhigh-dose or multiple nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products [NSAIDs]) (see section 4.5). \nCases of acute renal failure after initiation of high-dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in \nHIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir \ndisoproxil. Some patients required hospitalisation and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to \nNSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.\n\nPersistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures, and/or muscular pain or weakness \nmay be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal \nfunction in at risk patients.\n\nIt is recommended that estimated CrCl be assessed in all patients prior to initiating therapy and as \nclinically appropriate during therapy with Delstrigo. In patients at risk of renal dysfunction, including \npatients who have previously experienced renal events while receiving adefovir dipivoxil, it is \nrecommended that estimated CrCl, serum phosphorus, urine glucose, and urine protein be assessed \nprior to initiation of Delstrigo and more frequent renal function monitoring should be assessed as \nappropriate per the patient\u2019s medical condition during Delstrigo therapy.\n\nLamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil are primarily excreted by the kidney. Delstrigo should be \ndiscontinued if estimated CrCl declines below 50 mL/min as dose interval adjustment required for \nlamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil cannot be achieved with the fixed dose combination tablet (see \nsection 4.2).\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nBone loss and mineralisation defects\nBone mineral density\nIn clinical trials in HIV-1 infected adults, tenofovir disoproxil was associated with slightly greater \ndecreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism, \nsuggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and \n1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving tenofovir disoproxil. In other studies \n(prospective and cross-sectional), the most pronounced decreases in BMD were seen in patients \ntreated with tenofovir disoproxil as part of a regimen containing a boosted protease inhibitor.\n\nBone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) may be associated with proximal renal\ntubulopathy.\n\nThe effects of tenofovir disoproxil associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term \nbone health and future fracture risk are unknown. Assessment of BMD should be considered for \nHIV-1 infected adult patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for \nosteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and Vitamin D was \nnot studied, such supplementation may be beneficial in all patients. If bone abnormalities are \nsuspected, then appropriate consultation should be obtained.\n\nMineralisation defects\nCases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy, manifested as bone pain or pain in\nextremities and which may contribute to fractures, have been reported in association with the use of\ntenofovir disoproxil . Arthralgias and muscle pain or weakness have also been reported in cases of \nproximal renal tubulopathy. Hypophosphataemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal \ntubulopathy should be considered in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or \nworsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving products containing tenofovir disoproxil (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nCo-administration with other antiviral products\nDoravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil must not be co-administered with other medicinal products \ncontaining lamivudine, or with medicinal products containing tenofovir disoproxil, or tenofovir \nalafenamide, or with adefovir dipivoxil (see section 4.5). Doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil\nshould not be administered with doravirine unless needed for dose adjustment (e.g., with rifabutin) \n(see sections 4.2 and 4.5).\n\nUse with CYP3A inducers\nCaution should be given to prescribing doravirine with medicinal products that may reduce the \nexposure of doravirine (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).\n\nImmune reactivation syndrome\nImmune reactivation syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral\ntherapy. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune \nsystem responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic \ninfections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii\npneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.\n\nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease, autoimmune hepatitis, polymyositis, and Guillain-\nBarr\u00e9 syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the \ntime to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.\n\nLactose\nDelstrigo contains lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.\n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nDelstrigo is a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection; therefore, Delstrigo should not \nbe administered with other antiretroviral medicinal products. Information regarding potential \nmedicinal product interactions with other antiretroviral medicines is not provided. Interaction studies \nhave only been performed in adults.\n\nDelstrigo contains doravirine, lamivudine, and tenofovir disoproxil, therefore any interactions \nidentified for these individually are relevant to Delstrigo and are presented in Table 1.\n\nEffects of other medicinal products on doravirine, lamivudine, and tenofovir disoproxil\nDoravirine\nDoravirine is primarily metabolised by CYP3A, and medicinal products that induce or inhibit CYP3A \nare expected to affect the clearance of doravirine (see section 5.2). Doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir \ndisoproxil should not be co-administered with medicinal products that are strong CYP3A enzyme \ninducers as significant decreases in doravirine plasma concentrations are expected to occur, which \nmay decrease the effectiveness of doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil (see sections 4.3 \nand 5.2).\n\nCo-administration with the moderate CYP3A inducer rifabutin decreased doravirine concentrations \n(see Table 1). When Delstrigo is co-administered with rifabutin, a 100 mg dose of doravirine should \nbe given daily, approximately 12 hours after doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil dose (see \nsection 4.2).\n\nCo-administration of doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil with other moderate CYP3A inducers \nhas not been evaluated, but decreased doravirine concentrations are expected. If co-administration \nwith other moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g., debrafenib, lesinurad, bosentan, thioridazine, nafcillin, \nmodafinil, telotristat ethyl) cannot be avoided, a 100 mg dose of doravirine should be administered \ndaily, approximately 12 hours after the administration of doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil \ndose (see section 4.2).\n\nCo-administration of doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disproxil and medicinal products that are \ninhibitors of CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of doravirine. However, no dose \nadjustment is needed when doravirine is co-administered with CYP3A inhibitors.\n\nLamivudine\nBecause lamivudine is primarily eliminated by the kidneys through a combination of glomerular \nfiltration and active tubular secretion (see section 5.2), co-administration of \ndoravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil with medicinal products that reduce renal function or \ncompete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of lamivudine.\n\nTenofovir disoproxil\nBecause tenofovir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys through a combination of glomerular \nfiltration and active tubular secretion (see section 5.2), co-administration of \ndoravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil with medicinal products that reduce renal function or \ncompete for active tubular secretion via OAT1, OAT3 or MRP4 may increase serum concentrations of \ntenofovir.\n\nDue to the tenofovir disoproxil component of doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil, use of the \nproduct should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic medicinal products. Some \nexamples include, but are not limited to, acyclovir, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, \naminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), and high-dose or multiple NSAIDs (see section 4.4).\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\nEffects of doravirine, lamivudine, and tenofovir disoproxil on other medicinal products\nDoravirine\nDoravirine at a dose of 100 mg once daily is not likely to have a clinically relevant effect on the \nplasma concentrations of medicinal products that are dependent on transport proteins for absorption\nand/or elimination or that are metabolised by CYP enzymes.\n\nHowever, co-administration of doravirine and the sensitive CYP3A substrate midazolam resulted in a \n18 % decrease in midazolam exposure, suggesting that doravirine may be a weak CYP3A inducer. \nTherefore, caution should be used when co-administering doravirine with medicinal products that are \nsensitive CYP3A substrates that also have a narrow therapeutic window (e.g., tacrolimus and \nsirolimus).\n\nLamivudine\nLamivudine does not inhibit or induce CYP enzymes.\n\nTenofovir\nBased on the results of in vitro experiments and the known elimination pathway of tenofovir, the\npotential for CYP-mediated interactions involving tenofovir with other medicinal products is low.\n\nInteraction table\nTable 1 shows the established and other potential medicinal product interactions with the individual \ncomponents of Delstrigo but is not all inclusive (increase is indicated as \u2191, decrease is indicated as \uf0af, \nand no change as \uf0ab). For potential medicine product interactions with tenofovir disoproxil or \nlamivudine, (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nTable 1: Interactions between the individual components of Delstrigo and other medicinal \nproducts\n\nMedicinal Product by \nTherapeutic Area\n\nEffects on Medicinal Product \nLevels\nGeometric Mean Ratio (90 % CI)*\n\nRecommendation Concerning\nCo-administration with \ndoravirine/lamivudine/tenofo\nvir disoproxil\n\nAcid-Reducing Agents\n\nantacid (aluminium and \nmagnesium hydroxide oral \nsuspension)\n(20 mL SD,\ndoravirine 100 mg SD)\n\n\uf0ab doravirine\nAUC 1.01 (0.92, 1.11)\nCmax 0.86 (0.74, 1.01)\nC24 1.03 (0.94, 1.12)\n\nNo dose adjustment is required.\n\npantoprazole\n(40 mg QD,\ndoravirine 100 mg SD)\n\n\uf0af doravirine\nAUC 0.83 (0.76, 0.91)\nCmax 0.88 (0.76, 1.01)\nC24 0.84 (0.77, 0.92)\n\nNo dose adjustment is required.\n\nomeprazole\n\nInteraction not studied with \ndoravirine or \ndoravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir \ndisoproxil.\n\nExpected:\n\uf0ab doravirine\n\nNo dose adjustment is required.\n\n \n\n\n\n8\n\nMedicinal Product by \nTherapeutic Area\n\nEffects on Medicinal Product \nLevels\nGeometric Mean Ratio (90 % CI)*\n\nRecommendation Concerning\nCo-administration with \ndoravirine/lamivudine/tenofo\nvir disoproxil\n\nAngiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors\n\nlisinopril\n\nInteraction not studied with \ndoravirine or \ndoravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir \ndisoproxil.\n\nExpected:\n\uf0ab lisinopril\n\nNo dose adjustment is required.\n\nAntiandrogens\n\nenzalutamide\n\nInteraction not studied with \ndoravirine or \ndoravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir \ndisoproxil.\n\nExpected:\n\uf0af doravirine\n(Induction of CYP3A)\n\nCo-administration is \ncontraindicated.\n\nAntibiotics\n\nnafcillin\n\nInteraction not studied with \ndoravirine or \ndoravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir \ndisoproxil.\n\nExpected: \n\u2193 doravirine\n(Induction of CYP3A)\n\nCo-administration should be \navoided.

A large amount \nof data on pregnant women (more than 3,000 outcomes from first trimester) taking the individual \nactive component lamivudine in combination with other antiretrovirals indicates no malformative \ntoxicity. A moderate amount of data on pregnant women (between 300-1,000 pregnancy outcomes) \nindicate no malformations or foetal/neonatal toxicity associated with tenofovir disoproxil.\n\nAntiretroviral pregnancy registry\nTo monitor maternal-foetal outcomes in patients exposed to antiretroviral medicinal products while \npregnant, an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to \nregister patients in this registry.\n\nAnimal studies with doravirine do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\n\nAnimal studies with tenofovir disoproxil do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects of tenofovir \ndisoproxil with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).\n\nAnimal studies with lamivudine showed an increase in early embryonic deaths in rabbits but not in rats \n(see section 5.3). Placental transfer of lamivudine has been shown to occur in humans. Lamivudine \nmay inhibit cellular DNA replication (see section 5.3). The clinical relevance of this finding is \nunknown.\n\nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Delstrigo during pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether doravirine is excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of doravirine in milk (see \nsection 5.3).\n\nLamivudine has been identified in breast-fed newborns/infants of treated women. Based on more than \n200 mother/child pairs treated for HIV, serum concentrations of lamivudine in breast-fed infants of \nmothers treated for HIV are very low (< 4 % of maternal serum concentrations) and progressively \ndecrease to undetectable levels when breast-fed infants reach 24 weeks of age. There are no data \navailable on the safety of lamivudine when administered to babies less than three months old.\n\n \n\n\n\n17\n\nTenofovir is excreted in human milk. There is insufficient information on the effects of tenofovir in \nnewborns/infants.\n\nBecause of the potential for HIV-1 transmission and the potential for serious adverse reactions in \nbreast-feeding infants, mothers should be instructed not to breast-feed if they are receiving Delstrigo.\n\nFertility\nNo human data on the effect of Delstrigo on fertility are available. Animal studies do not indicate \nharmful effects of doravirine, lamivudine, or tenofovir disoproxil on fertility at exposure levels higher \nthan the exposure in humans at the recommended clinical dose (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nDelstrigo may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be \ninformed that fatigue, dizziness, and somnolence have been reported during treatment with Delstrigo\n(see section 4.8). This should be considered when assessing a patient's ability to drive or operate \nmachinery.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions considered possibly or probably related to doravirine\nwere nausea (4 %) and headache (3 %).\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\nThe adverse reactions with suspected (at least possible) relationship to treatment are listed below by \nbody system organ class and frequency.

Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).\n\nLactic acidosis\nCases of lactic acidosis have been reported with tenofovir disoproxil alone or in combination with \nother antiretrovirals. Patients with predisposing factors such as patients with decompensated liver \ndisease, or patients receiving concomitant medications known to induce lactic acidosis are at increased \nrisk of experiencing severe lactic acidosis during tenofovir disoproxil treatment, including fatal \noutcomes.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nDoravirine\nThere is no information on potential acute symptoms and signs of overdose with doravirine.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n20\n\nLamivudine\nBecause a negligible amount of lamivudine was removed via (4-hour) haemodialysis, continuous \nambulatory peritoneal dialysis, and automated peritoneal dialysis, it is not known if continuous \nhaemodialysis would provide clinical benefit in a lamivudine overdose event.\n\nTenofovir disoproxil\nTenofovir disoproxil is efficiently removed by haemodialysis with an extraction coefficient of \napproximately 54 %. Following a single 245 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil, a 4-hour haemodialysis\nsession removed approximately 10 % of the administered tenofovir dose.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, ATC code: J05AR24\n\nMechanism of action\nDoravirine\nDoravirine is a pyridinone non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor of HIV-1 and inhibits HIV-1 \nreplication by non-competitive inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Doravirine does not \ninhibit the human cellular DNA polymerases \u03b1, \u00df, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase \u03b3.\n\nLamivudine\nLamivudine is a nucleoside analogue. Intracellularly, lamivudine is phosphorylated to its active \n5\u00b4- triphosphate metabolite, lamivudine triphosphate (3TC-TP). The principal mode of action of \n3TC-TP is inhibition of RT via DNA chain termination after incorporation of the nucleotide analogue.\n\nTenofovir disoproxil \nTenofovir disoproxil is an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate diester analog of adenosine \nmonophosphate. Tenofovir disoproxil requires initial diester hydrolysis for conversion to tenofovir and \nsubsequent phosphorylations by cellular enzymes to form tenofovir diphosphate. Tenofovir \ndiphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV-1 RT by competing with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine \n5\u00b4-triphosphate and, after incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain termination. Tenofovir diphosphate \nis a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases \u03b1, \u03b2, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase \u03b3.\n\nAntiviral activity in cell culture\nDoravirine\nDoravirine exhibited an EC50 value of 12.0\u00b14.4 nM against wild-type laboratory strains of HIV-1 \nwhen tested in the presence of 100 % normal human serum using MT4-GFP reporter cells. Doravirine \ndemonstrated antiviral activity against a broad panel of primary HIV-1 isolates (A, A1, AE, AG, B, \nBF, C, D, G, H) with EC50 values ranging from 1.2 nM to 10.0 nM. The antiviral activity of doravirine \nwas not antagonistic when combined with lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil.\n\nLamivudine\nThe antiviral activity of lamivudine against HIV-1 was assessed in a number of cell lines including \nmonocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using standard susceptibility assays. \nEC50 values were in the range of 0.003 to 15 microM (1 microM = 0.23 micrograms per mL). The \nmedian EC50 values of lamivudine were 60 nM (range: 20 to 70 nM), 35 nM (range: 30 to 40 nM), \n30 nM (range: 20 to 90 nM), 20 nM (range: 3 to 40 nM), 30 nM (range: 1 to 60 nM), 30 nM (range: \n20 to 70 nM), 30 nM (range: 3 to 70 nM), and 30 nM (range: 20 to 90 nM) against HIV-1 clades A-G \nand group O viruses (n = 3 except n = 2 for clade B) respectively. Ribavirin (50 microM) used in the \ntreatment of chronic HCV infection decreased the anti-HIV-1 activity of lamivudine by 3.5-fold in \nMT-4 cells.\n\n \n\n\n\n21\n\nTenofovir disoproxil \nThe antiviral activity of tenofovir against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in \nT lymphoblastoid cell lines, primary monocyte/macrophage cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes. \nThe EC50 values for tenofovir were in the range of 0.04-8.5 microM. Tenofovir displayed antiviral \nactivity in cell culture against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and O (EC50 values ranged from \n0.5-2.2 microM).\n\nResistance\n\nIn cell culture\n\nDoravirine\nDoravirine-resistant strains were selected in cell culture starting from wild-type HIV-1 of different \norigins and subtypes, as well as NNRTI-resistant HIV-1. Observed emergent amino acid substitutions \nin RT included: V106A, V106M, V106I, V108I, F227L, F227C, F227V, H221Y, M230I, L234I, \nP236L, and Y318F. Common NNRTI-resistant mutations (K103N, Y181C) were not selected in the in \nvitro study. V106A (yielding a fold change of around 19) appeared as an initial substitution in subtype \nB virus, and V106A or M in subtype A and C virus. Subsequently F227(L/C/V) or L234I emerged in \naddition to V106 substitutions (double mutants yielding a fold change of > 100).\n\nLamivudine\nLamivudine-resistant variants of HIV-1 have been selected in cell culture and in subjects treated with \nlamivudine. Genotypic analysis showed that the resistance was due to a specific amino acid\nsubstitution in the HIV-1 RT at codon 184 changing the methionine to either isoleucine or valine \n(M184V/I).\n\nTenofovir disoproxil \nHIV-1 isolates selected by tenofovir expressed a K65R substitution in HIV-1 RT and showed a \n2-4 fold reduction in susceptibility to tenofovir. In addition, a K70E substitution in HIV-1 RT has been \nselected by tenofovir and results in low-level reduced susceptibility to abacavir, emtricitabine, \nlamivudine, and tenofovir.\n\nIn clinical trials\n\nTreatment-na\u00efve adult subjects\nDoravirine\nThe Phase 3 studies, DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD, included previously untreated \npatients (n = 747) where the following NNRTI substitutions were part of exclusion criteria: L100I, \nK101E, K101P, K103N, K103S, V106A, V106I, V106M, V108I, E138A, E138G, E138K, E138Q, \nE138R, V179L, Y181C, Y181I, Y181V, Y188C, Y188H, Y188L, G190A, G190S, H221Y, L234I, \nM230I, M230L, P225H, F227C, F227L, F227V.\n\nThe following de novo resistance was seen in the resistance analysis subset (subjects with HIV-1 RNA \ngreater than 400 copies per mL at virologic failure or at early study discontinuation and having \nresistance data).\n\n \n\n\n\n22\n\nTable 3: Resistance development up to week 96 in protocol defined virologic failure population +\nearly discontinuation population\n\nDRIVE-FORWARD DRIVE-AHEAD\nDOR + NRTIs*\n(383)\n\nDRV+r + NRTIs*\n(383)\n\nDOR/TDF/3TC\n(364)\n\nEFV/TDF/FTC \n(364)\n\nSuccessful genotype, n 15 18 32 33\n\nGenotypic resistance to\nDOR or control (DRV or EFV) 2 (DOR) 0 (DRV) 8 (DOR) 14 (EFV)\n\nNRTI backbone\nM184I/V only\nK65R only\nK65R + M184I/V\n\n2**\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n6\n4\n1\n1\n\n5\n4\n0\n1\n\n*NRTI in DOR arm: FTC/TDF (333) or ABC/3TC (50); NRTI in DRV+r arm: FTC/TDF (335) or ABC/3TC (48)\n**Subjects received FTC/TDF\nABC=abacavir; FTC=emtricitabine; DRV=darunavir; r=ritonavir\n\nEmergent doravirine associated resistance substitutions in RT included one or more of the following: \nA98G, V106I, V106A, V106M/T, Y188L, H221Y, P225H, F227C, F227C/R, and Y318Y/F.\n\nVirologically suppressed adult subjects\nThe DRIVE-SHIFT study included virologically suppressed patients (N=670) with no history of \ntreatment failure (see section, Clinical experience). A documented absence of genotypic resistance \n(prior to starting first therapy) to doravirine, lamivudine, and tenofovir was part of the inclusion \ncriteria for patients who switched from a PI- or INI-based regimen.  Exclusionary NNRTI \nsubstitutions were those listed above (DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD), with the exception \nof substitutions RT K103N, G190A and Y181C (accepted in DRIVE-SHIFT). Documentation of pre-\ntreatment resistance genotyping was not required for patients who switched from a NNRTI-based \nregimen.\n\nIn the DRIVE-SHIFT clinical trial, no subjects developed genotypic or phenotypic resistance to DOR, \n3TC, or TDF during the initial 48 weeks (immediate switch, N=447) or 24 weeks (delayed switch, \nN=209) of treatment with Delstrigo.  One subject developed RT M184M/I mutation and phenotypic \nresistance to 3TC and FTC during treatment with their baseline regimen.  None of the 24 subjects (11 \nin the immediate switch group, 13 in the delayed switch group) with baseline NNRTI mutations (RT \nK103N, G190A, or Y181C) experienced virologic failure through Week 48, or at time of \ndiscontinuation.\n\nCross-resistance\nNo significant cross-resistance has been demonstrated between doravirine-resistant HIV-1 variants and \nlamivudine/emtricitabine or tenofovir or between lamivudine- or tenofovir-resistant variants and \ndoravirine.\n\nDoravirine\nDoravirine has been evaluated in a limited number of patients with NNRTI resistance (K103N n = 7, \nG190A n = 1); all patients were suppressed to < 40 copies/mL at Week 48. A breakpoint for a \nreduction in susceptibility, yielded by various NNRTI substitutions, that is associated with a reduction \nin clinical efficacy has not been established.\n\nLaboratory strains of HIV-1 harbouring the common NNRTI-associated mutations K103N, Y181C, or \nK103N/Y181C substitutions in RT exhibit less than a 3-fold decrease in susceptibility to doravirine \ncompared to wild-type virus when evaluated in the presence of 100 % normal human serum. In in vitro\nstudies, doravirine was able to suppress the following NNRTI-associated substitutions; K103N, \nY181C, and G190A under clinically relevant concentrations.\n\n \n\n\n\n23\n\nA panel of 96 diverse clinical isolates containing NNRTI-associated mutations was evaluated for \nsusceptibility to doravirine in the presence of 10 % foetal bovine serum. Clinical isolates containing \nthe Y188L substitution or V106 substitutions in combination with A98G, H221Y, P225H, F227C or \nY318F showed a greater than 100-fold reduced susceptibility to doravirine. Other substitutions yielded \na fold change of 5-10 (G190S (5.7); K103N/P225H (7.9), V108I/Y181C (6.9), Y181V (5.1)). The \nclinical relevance of a 5-10 fold change reduction in susceptibility is unknown.\n\nTreatment emergent doravirine resistance associated substitutions may confer cross-resistance to \nefavirenz, rilpivirine, nevirapine, and etravirine. Of the 7 subjects who developed high level doravirine\nresistance in the pivotal studies, 6 had phenotypic resistance to EFV and nevirapine, 3 to rilpivirine, \nand 2 had partial resistance to etravirine based on the Monogram Phenosense assay.\n\nLamivudine\nCross-resistance has been observed among NRTIs. The M184I/V lamivudine resistance substitution \nconfers resistance to emtricitabine. Lamivudine-resistant HIV-1 mutants were also cross resistant to \ndidanosine (ddI). In some subjects treated with zidovudine plus didanosine, isolates resistant to \nmultiple RT inhibitors, including lamivudine, have emerged.\n\nTenofovir disoproxil \nCross-resistance has been observed among NRTIs. The K65R substitution in HIV-1 RT selected by \ntenofovir is also selected in some HIV-1 infected patients treated with abacavir or didanosine. HIV-1 \nisolates with the K65R substitution also showed reduced susceptibility to emtricitabine and \nlamivudine. Therefore, cross-resistance among these NRTIs may occur in patients whose virus \nharbours the K65R substitution. The K70E substitution selected clinically by tenofovir disoproxil\nresults in reduced susceptibility to abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, and tenofovir. \nHIV-1 isolates from patients (n = 20) whose HIV-1 expressed a mean of 3 zidovudine associated RT \namino acid substitutions (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, or K219Q/E/N) showed a 3.1-fold \ndecrease in the susceptibility to tenofovir. Subjects whose virus expressed an L74V RT substitution \nwithout zidovudine resistance-associated substitutions (n = 8) had reduced response to tenofovir \ndisoproxil. Limited data are available for patients whose virus expressed a Y115F substitution (n = 3), \nQ151M substitution (n = 2), or T69 insertion (n = 4) in HIV-1 RT, all of whom had a reduced \nresponse in clinical trials.\n\nClinical experience\n\nTreatment-na\u00efve adult subjects\nThe efficacy of doravirine is based on the analyses of 96-week data from two randomised, multicentre, \ndouble-blind, active controlled Phase 3 trials, (DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD) in \nantiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve, HIV-1 infected subjects (n = 1494). Refer to Resistance section for \nNNRTI substitutions that were part of exclusion criteria.\n\nIn DRIVE-FORWARD, 766 subjects were randomised and received at least 1 dose of either\ndoravirine 100 mg or darunavir + ritonavir 800+100 mg once daily, each in combination with \nemtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (FTC/TDF) or abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) selected by the \ninvestigator. At baseline, the median age of subjects was 33 years (range 18 to 69 years), 86 % had \nCD4+ T cell count greater than 200 cells per mm3, 84 % were male, 27 % were non-white, 4 % had \nhepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection, 10 % had a history of AIDS, 20 % had HIV-1 RNA greater \nthan 100,000 copies per mL, 13 % received ABC/3TC and 87 % received FTC/TDF; these \ncharacteristics were similar between treatment groups.\n\nIn DRIVE-AHEAD, 728 subjects were randomised and received at least 1 dose of either \ndoravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil 100/300/245 mg (DOR/3TC/TDF) or \nefavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (EFV/FTC/TDF) once daily. At baseline, the median age \nof subjects was 31 years (range 18-70 years), 85 % were male, 52 % were non-white, 3 % had \nhepatitis B or C co-infection, 14 % had a history of AIDS, 21 % had HIV-1 RNA > 100,000 copies per \nmL, and 12 % had CD4+ T cell count < 200 cells per mm3; these characteristics were similar between \ntreatment groups.\n\n \n\n\n\n24\n\nWeek 48 and 96 outcomes for DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD are provided in Table 4.

Subjects were randomised to either \nswitch to Delstrigo at baseline [N= 447, Immediate Switch Group (ISG)], or stay on their baseline \nregimen until Week 24, at which point they switched to Delstrigo [N= 223, Delayed Switch Group\n(DSG)].

See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nSingle-dose administration of one doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil tablet to healthy subjects \n(N = 24) under fasted conditions provided comparable exposures of doravirine, lamivudine, and \ntenofovir to administration of doravirine tablets (100 mg) plus lamivudine tablets (300 mg) plus \ntenofovir disoproxil tablets (245 mg). The administration of a single Delstrigo tablet with a high-fat \nmeal to healthy subjects resulted in a 26 % increase in doravirine C24, while AUC and Cmax were not \nsignificantly affected. Lamivudine Cmax decreased by 19 % with a high fat meal, while AUC was not \nsignificantly affected. Tenofovir Cmax decreased by 12 % and AUC increased by 27 % with a high fat\nmeal. These differences in pharmacokinetics are not clinically relevant.\n\nDoravirine\nThe pharmacokinetics of doravirine were studied in healthy subjects and HIV-1-infected subjects. \nDoravirine pharmacokinetics are similar in healthy subjects and HIV-1-infected subjects. Steady state\nwas generally achieved by Day 2 of once daily dosing, with accumulation ratios of 1.2 to 1.4 for \nAUC0-24, Cmax, and C24. Doravirine steady state pharmacokinetics following administration of 100 mg \nonce daily to HIV-1 infected subjects, based on a population pharmacokinetics analysis are provided \nbelow.\n\nParameter\nGM ( %CV)\n\nAUC0-24\n\u03bcM hr\n\nCmax\n\u03bcM\n\nC24\nnM\n\nDoravirine \n100 mg \nonce daily\n\n37.8 (29) 2.26 (19) 930 (63)\n\nGM: Geometric mean, %CV: Geometric coefficient of variation\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing oral dosing, peak plasma concentrations are achieved 2 hours after dosing. Doravirine has\nan estimated absolute bioavailability of approximately 64 % for the 100 mg tablet.\n\nDistribution\nBased on administration of an IV microdose, the volume of distribution of doravirine is 60.5 L.\nDoravirine is approximately 76 % bound to plasma proteins.\n\nBiotransformation\nBased on in vitro data, doravirine is primarily metabolised by CYP3A.\n\nElimination\nDoravirine\nDoravirine has a terminal half-life (t1/2) of approximately 15 hours. Doravirine is primarily eliminated \nvia oxidative metabolism mediated by CYP3A4. Biliary excretion of unchanged medicinal product\nmay contribute to the elimination of doravirine, but this elimination route is not expected to be \nsignificant. Excretion of unchanged medicinal product via urinary excretion is minor.\n\nLamivudine\nFollowing oral administration, lamivudine is rapidly absorbed and extensively distributed. After \nmultiple-dose oral administration of lamivudine 300 mg once daily for 7 days to 60 healthy subjects, \nsteady-state Cmax (Cmax,ss) was 2.04 \u00b1 0.54 microgram per mL (mean \u00b1 SD) and the 24-hour steady-\nstate AUC (AUC24,ss) was 8.87 \u00b1 1.83 mcg\u2022hour per mL. Binding to plasma protein is low. \nApproximately 71 % of an intravenous dose of lamivudine is recovered as unchanged medicinal \nproduct in the urine. Metabolism of lamivudine is a minor route of elimination. In humans, the only \nknown metabolite is the trans-sulphoxide metabolite (approximately 5 % of an oral dose after \n12 hours). In most single-dose trials in HIV-1 infected subjects, or healthy subjects with serum \n\n \n\n\n\n27\n\nsampling for 24 hours after dosing, the observed mean elimination half-life (t\u00bd) ranged from 5 to \n7 hours. In HIV-1\u2013infected subjects, total clearance was 398.5 \u00b1 69.1 mL/min (mean \u00b1 SD).\n\nTenofovir disoproxil\nFollowing oral administration of a single 245 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil to HIV-1-infected \nsubjects in the fasted state, Cmax was achieved in one hour. Cmax and AUC values were \n0.30 \u00b1 0.09 micrograms per mL and 2.29 \u00b1 0.69 \u00b5g\u2022hr per mL, respectively. The oral bioavailability \nof tenofovir from tenofovir disoproxil in fasted subjects is approximately 25 %. Less than 0.7 % of \ntenofovir binds to human plasma proteins in vitro over the range of 0.01 to 25 micrograms per mL. \nApproximately 70-80 % of the intravenous dose of tenofovir is recovered as unchanged medicinal \nproduct in the urine within 72 hours of dosing. Tenofovir is eliminated by a combination of glomerular \nfiltration and active tubular secretion with a renal clearance in adults with CrCl greater than 80 mL per \nminute of 243.5 \u00b1 33.3 mL per minute (mean \u00b1 SD). Following oral administration, the terminal half-\nlife of tenofovir is approximately 12 to 18 hours. In vitro studies have determined that neither \ntenofovir disoproxil nor tenofovir are substrates for the CYP450 enzymes.\n\nRenal impairment\nDoravirine\nRenal excretion of doravirine is minor. In a study comparing 8 subjects with severe renal impairment \nto 8 subjects without renal impairment, the single dose exposure of doravirine was 31 % higher in \nsubjects with severe renal impairment. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, which included \nsubjects with CrCl between 17 and 317 mL/min, renal function did not have a clinically relevant effect \non doravirine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate or \nsevere renal impairment. Doravirine has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease or in \npatients undergoing dialysis (see section 4.2).\n\nLamivudine\nStudies with lamivudine show that plasma concentrations (AUC) are increased in patients with renal\ndysfunction due to decreased clearance. Based on the lamivudine data, Delstrigo is not recommended \nfor patients with CrCl of < 50 mL/min.\n\nTenofovir disoproxil\nPharmacokinetic parameters of tenofovir were determined following administration of a single dose of\ntenofovir disoproxil 245 mg to 40 non-HIV infected adult subjects with varying degrees of renal\nimpairment defined according to baseline CrCl (normal renal function when CrCl > 80 mL/min; mild \nwith CrCl = 50-79 mL/min; moderate with CrCl = 30-49 mL/min and severe with CrCl = \n10-29 mL/min). Compared with subjects with normal renal function, the mean (% CV) tenofovir \nexposure increased from 2,185 (12 %) ng\u00b7h/mL in subjects with CrCl > 80 mL/min to respectively \n3,064 (30 %) ng\u00b7h/mL, 6,009 (42 %) ng\u00b7h/mL and 15,985 (45 %) ng\u00b7h/mL in subjects with mild, \nmoderate, and severe renal impairment.\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in non-haemodialysis adult subjects with CrCl < 10 mL/min and in \nsubjects with end-stage renal disease managed by peritoneal or other forms of dialysis have not been \nstudied.\n\nHepatic impairment\nDoravirine\nDoravirine is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver. There was no clinically relevant\ndifference in the pharmacokinetics of doravirine in a study comparing 8 subjects with moderate \nhepatic impairment (classified as Child-Pugh score B primarily due to increased encephalopathy and \nascites scores) to 8 subjects without hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is required in patients \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Doravirine has not been studied in subjects with severe \nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score C) (see section 4.2).\n\nLamivudine\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of lamivudine have been determined in subjects with moderate to \nsevere hepatic impairment. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not altered by diminishing hepatic \n\n \n\n\n\n28\n\nfunction. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established in the presence of \ndecompensated liver disease.\n\nTenofovir disoproxil\nThe pharmacokinetics of tenofovir following a 245 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil have been studied \nin healthy subjects with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. No clinically relevant differences in \ntenofovir pharmacokinetics were observed between subjects with hepatic impairment and healthy \nsubjects.\n\nElderly\nAlthough a limited number of subjects aged 65 years and over has been included (n = 36), no \nclinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of doravirine have been identified in subjects at \nleast 65 years of age compared to subjects less than 65 years of age in a Phase 1 trial or in a population \npharmacokinetic analysis. The pharmacokinetics of lamivudine and tenofovir have not been studied in\nsubjects older than 65 years. No dose adjustment is required.\n\nGender\nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between men and women for \ndoravirine, lamivudine, and tenofovir.\n\nRace\nDoravirine\nNo clinically relevant racial differences in the pharmacokinetics of doravirine have been identified \nbased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of doravirine in healthy and HIV-1-infected subjects.\n\nLamivudine\nThere are no significant or clinically relevant racial differences in pharmacokinetics of lamivudine.\n\nTenofovir disoproxil\nThere were insufficient numbers from racial and ethnic groups other than Caucasian to adequately \ndetermine potential pharmacokinetic differences among these populations following the administration \nof tenofovir disoproxil.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nReproductive toxicity\nDoravirine\nReproduction studies with orally administered doravirine have been performed in rats and rabbits at \nexposures approximately 9 times (rats) and 8 times (rabbits) the exposure in humans at the \nrecommended human dose (RHD) with no effects on embryo-foetal (rats and rabbits) or pre/postnatal \n(rats) development. Studies in pregnant rats and rabbits showed that doravirine is transferred to the \nfoetus through the placenta, with foetal plasma concentrations of up to 40 % (rabbits) and 52 % (rats) \nthat of maternal concentrations observed on gestation Day 20.\n\nDoravirine was excreted into the milk of lactating rats following oral administration, with milk \nconcentrations approximately 1.5 times that of maternal plasma concentrations.\n\nLamivudine\nLamivudine was not teratogenic in animal studies but there were indications of an increase in early \nembryonic deaths in rabbits at relatively low systemic exposures, comparable to those achieved in \nhumans. A similar effect was not seen in rats even at very high systemic exposure.\n\nTenofovir disoproxil\nReproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or\nfoetal parameters. However, tenofovir disoproxil reduced the viability index and weight of pups in a \nperi-postnatal toxicity study at maternally toxic doses.\n\n \n\n\n\n29\n\nCarcinogenesis\nDoravirine\nLong-term oral carcinogenicity studies of doravirine in mice and rats showed no evidence of \ncarcinogenic potential at estimated exposures up to 6 times (mice) and 7 times (rats) the human \nexposures at the RHD.\n\nLamivudine\nLong-term carcinogenicity studies with lamivudine in mice and rats showed no evidence of \ncarcinogenic potential at exposures up to 12 times (mice) and 57 times (rats) the human exposures at \nthe RHD.\n\nTenofovir disoproxil\nOral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice only revealed a low incidence of duodenal tumours at an \nextremely high-dose in mice. These tumours are unlikely to be of relevance to humans.\n\nMutagenesis\nDoravirine\nDoravirine was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays.\n\nLamivudine\nLamivudine was mutagenic in an L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay and clastogenic in a cytogenetic \nassay using cultured human lymphocytes. Lamivudine was not mutagenic in a microbial mutagenicity \nassay, in an in vitro cell transformation assay, in a rat micronucleus test, in a rat bone marrow \ncytogenetic assay, and in an assay for unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat liver.\n\nTenofovir disoproxil\nTenofovir disoproxil was mutagenic in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and negative in an in vitro\nbacterial mutagenicity test (Ames test). In an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, tenofovir disoproxil\nwas negative when administered to male mice.\n\nImpairment of fertility\nDoravirine\nThere were no effects on fertility, mating performance or early embryonic development when \ndoravirine was administered to rats at up to 7 times the exposure in humans at the RHD.\n\nLamivudine\nLamivudine did not affect male or female fertility in rats.\n\nTenofovir disoproxil\nReproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or \nfoetal parameters.\n\nRepeat dose toxicity\nDoravirine\nAdministration of doravirine in animal toxicity studies was not associated with toxicity.\n\nLamivudine\nAdministration of lamivudine in animal toxicity studies at high doses was not associated with any \nmajor organ toxicity. At the highest dosage levels, minor effects on indicators of liver and kidney\nfunction were seen together with occasional reductions in liver weight. The clinically relevant effects\nnoted were a reduction in red blood cell count and neutropenia.\n\nTenofovir disoproxil\nFindings in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats, dogs and monkeys at exposure levels greater than or \nequal to clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use included kidney and bone \nchanges and a decrease in serum phosphate concentration. Bone toxicity was diagnosed as \n\n \n\n\n\n30\n\nosteomalacia (monkeys) and reduced bone mineral density (BMD) (rats and dogs). The bone toxicity \nin young adult rats and dogs occurred at exposures \u2265 5-fold the exposure in paediatric or adult \npatients; bone toxicity occurred in juvenile infected monkeys at very high exposures following \nsubcutaneous dosing (\u2265 40-fold the exposure in patients). Findings in the rat and monkey studies \nindicated that there was a substance related decrease in intestinal absorption of phosphate with \npotential secondary reduction in BMD.\n\n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4\nfor how to report side effects.\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n\n\uf0b7 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n\uf0b7 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.\n\uf0b7 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n\uf0b7 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Delstrigo is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take Delstrigo\n3. How to take Delstrigo\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Delstrigo\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Delstrigo is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Delstrigo is\nDelstrigo is used to treat HIV (\u2018human immunodeficiency virus\u2019) infection. It belongs to a group of \nmedicines called \u2018antiretroviral medicines\u2019.\n\nDelstrigo contains the active substances:\n\uf0b7 Doravirine - a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)\n\uf0b7 Lamivudine - a nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)\n\uf0b7 Tenofovir disoproxil - a nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)\n\nWhat Delstrigo is used for\nDelstrigo is used to treat HIV infection in people 18 years of age and older. HIV is the virus that \ncauses AIDS (\u2018acquired immune deficiency syndrome\u2019). You should not take Delstrigo if your doctor \nhas told you that the virus causing your infection is resistant to any of the medicines in Delstrigo.\n\nHow Delstrigo works\nDelstrigo works by preventing HIV from making more viruses in your body. This will help by:\n\uf0b7 reducing the amount of HIV in your blood (this is called your \u2018viral load\u2019)\n\uf0b7 increasing the number of white blood cells called \u2018CD4+ T\u2019. This can make your immune \n\nsystem stronger. This may reduce your risk of early death or catching infections because your \nimmune system is weak.\n\n \n\n\n\n42\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Delstrigo\n\nDo not take Delstrigo:\n\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to doravirine, lamivudine or tenofovir disoproxil or any of the other \ningredients of this medicine listed in section 6.\n\n\uf0b7 if you are taking any of the following medicines:\n- carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (medicines for seizure)\n- rifampicin, rifapentine (medicines for tuberculosis)\n- St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum, a herbal remedy used for depression and anxiety) or\n\nproducts that contain it\n- mitotane (a medicine to treat cancer)\n- enzalutamide (a medicine to treat prostate cancer)\n- lumacaftor (a medicine to treat cystic fibrosis)\n\nDo not take Delstrigo if the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist,\nor nurse before taking Delstrigo. See also the list in section \u201cOther Medicines and Delstrigo\u201d.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before taking Delstrigo.\n\nPassing HIV to others\nHIV is spread by contact with blood or through sexual contact with a person with HIV. You can still\npass on HIV when taking Delstrigo, although effective therapy lowers the risk. Talk to your doctor \nabout what you can do to avoid infecting other people.\n\nWorsening of hepatitis B infection\nIf you have both HIV and hepatitis B virus infections, your hepatitis B may get worse if you stop \ntaking Delstrigo. You may require blood tests for several months after stopping treatment. Discuss \nyour hepatitis B therapy with your doctor.\n\nNew or worsening kidney problems, including kidney failure\nThis can happen in some people who take Delstrigo. Your doctor will do blood tests to check your \nkidney function before and during treatment with Delstrigo.\n\nBone problems\nThis can happen in some people who take Delstrigo. Bone problems include bone pain, and bone \nsoftening or thinning (which may lead to fractures). Joint or muscle pain or muscle weakness may also \noccur. Your doctor may need to do additional tests to check your bones.\n\nImmune reactivation syndrome\nThis can happen when you start taking any HIV medicine, including Delstrigo. Your immune system \nmay get stronger and begin to fight infections that have been hidden in your body for a long time. Tell \nyour doctor right away if you start having any new symptoms after starting your HIV medicine.\n\nAutoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) \nmay also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune \ndisorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection \nor other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up \ntowards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor \nimmediately to seek necessary treatment.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nDo not give this medicine to anybody aged less than 18 years. The use of Delstrigo in people aged \nless than 18 years has not yet been studied.\n\n \n\n\n\n43\n\nOther medicines and Delstrigo\nTell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other\nmedicines. This is because other medicines may affect how Delstrigo works, and Delstrigo might \naffect the way some other medicines work.\n\nThere are some medicines you must not take with Delstrigo. See list under \u201cDo not take Delstrigo\u201d \nsection.\n\nTalk to your doctor before taking the following medicines with Delstrigo as your doctor may need to \nchange the dose of your medicines:\n\n\uf0b7 bosentan (a medicine to treat lung disease)\n\uf0b7 dabrafenib (a medicine to treat skin cancer)\n\uf0b7 lesinurad (a medicine to treat gout)\n\uf0b7 modafinil (a medicine to treat excessive sleepiness)\n\uf0b7 nafcillin (a medicine to treat some bacterial infections)\n\uf0b7 rifabutin (a medicine to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis)\n\uf0b7 telotristat ethyl (a medicine to treat diarrhea in people with carcinoid syndrome)\n\uf0b7 thioridazine (a medicine to treat psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia)\n\nIf your doctor decides you should take these medicines with Delstrigo, your doctor will prescribe a\n100 mg tablet of doravirine to be taken daily, approximately 12 hours after your dose of Delstrigo.\n\nYour doctor may check your blood levels or monitor for side effects if you take the following \nmedicines with Delstrigo:\n\uf0b7 ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (medicines used to treat hepatitis C infection)\n\uf0b7 sirolimus (a medicine used to control your body\u2019s immune response after a transplant)\n\uf0b7 sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (medicines used to treat hepatitis C infection)\n\uf0b7 tacrolimus (a medicine used to control your body\u2019s immune response after a transplant)\n\uf0b7 medicines (usually liquids) containing sorbitol and other sugar alcohols (such as xylitol,\n\nmannitol, lactitol or maltitol), if taken regularly\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, talk to \nyour doctor about the risks and benefits of taking Delstrigo. It is preferable to avoid the use of \nDelstrigo during pregnancy. This is because it has not been studied in pregnancy and it is not known if \nDelstrigo will harm your baby while you are pregnant.\n\nWomen with HIV should not breastfeed because HIV can be passed on to babies through breast milk. \nTalk with your doctor about the best way to feed your baby.\n\nDriving and using machines\nUse with caution when driving, riding a bicycle, or operating machines if you feel tired, dizzy, or \nsleepy after taking this medicine\n\nDelstrigo tablets contains lactose\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to lactose, talk to your doctor before \ntaking this medicine.\n\n3. How to take Delstrigo\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are not sure. Delstrigo is a complete regimen taken as a single \ntablet for the treatment of HIV infection.\n\n \n\n\n\n44\n\nHow much to take\nThe recommended dose is 1 tablet once a day. If you take certain medicines your doctor may need to \nchange the amount of doravirine you take. See \u201cOther medicines and Delstrigo\u201d section for a list of \nmedicines.\n\nTaking this medicine\n\uf0b7 Swallow the tablet whole (do not crush or chew).\n\uf0b7 This medicine can be taken with food or between meals.\n\nIf you take more Delstrigo than you should\nDo not take more than the recommended dose. If you accidentally take more, contact your doctor.\n\nIf you forget to take Delstrigo\n\uf0b7 It is important that you do not miss or skip doses of Delstrigo.\n\uf0b7 If you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember. But if your next dose is due within \n\n12 hours, skip the dose you missed and take the next one at the usual time. Then continue your \ntreatment as before.\n\n\uf0b7 Do not take two doses of Delstrigo at the same time to make up for a missed dose.\n\uf0b7 If you are not sure what to do, call your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nIf you stop taking Delstrigo\nDo not run out of Delstrigo. Refill your prescription or talk to your doctor before your Delstrigo is all \ngone.\n\nIf you stop taking Delstrigo, your doctor will need to check your health often and do blood tests \nregularly for several months to check your HIV infection. If you have HIV infection and hepatitis B\ninfection, it is especially important not to stop your Delstrigo treatment without talking to your doctor \nfirst. Some patients have had blood tests or symptoms indicating that their hepatitis has worsened after \nstopping lamivudine or tenofovir disoproxil (two of the three active substances of Delstrigo). If \nDelstrigo is stopped your doctor may recommend that you resume hepatitis B treatment. You may \nneed blood tests to check how your liver is working for 4 months after stopping treatment.

infection. it belongs to a group of medicines called 'antiretroviral medicines'. delstrigo contains the active substances: doravirine - a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nnrti) lamivudine - a nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nrti) tenofovir disoproxil - a nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nrti) what delstrigo is used for delstrigo is used to treat hiv infection in people 18 years of age and older. hiv is the virus that causes aids ('acquired immune deficiency syndrome'). you should not take delstrigo if your doctor has told you that the virus causing your infection is resistant to any of the medicines in delstrigo. how delstrigo works delstrigo works by preventing hiv from making more viruses in your body. this will help by: reducing the amount of hiv in your blood (this is called your 'viral load') increasing the number of white blood cells called 'cd4+ t'. this can make your immune system stronger. this may reduce your risk of early death or catching infections because your immune system is weak.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "delstrigo", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text":

talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before taking delstrigo. passing hiv to others hiv is spread by contact with blood or through sexual contact with a person with hiv. you can still pass on hiv when taking delstrigo, although effective therapy lowers the risk. talk to your doctor about what you can do to avoid infecting other people. worsening of hepatitis b infection if you have both hiv and hepatitis b virus infections, your hepatitis b may get worse if you stop taking delstrigo. you may require blood tests for several months after stopping treatment. discuss your hepatitis b therapy with your doctor. new or worsening kidney problems, including kidney failure this can happen in some people who take delstrigo. your doctor will do blood tests to check your kidney function before and during treatment with delstrigo. bone problems this can happen in some people who take delstrigo. bone problems include bone pain, and bone softening or thinning (which may lead to fractures). joint or muscle pain or muscle weakness may also occur. your doctor may need to do additional tests to check your bones. immune reactivation syndrome this can happen when you start taking any hiv medicine, including delstrigo. your immune system may get stronger and begin to fight infections that have been hidden in your body for a long time. tell your doctor right away if you start having any new symptoms after starting your hiv medicine. autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your hiv infection. autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. if you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. children and adolescents do not give this medicine to anybody aged less than 18 years. the use of delstrigo in people aged less than 18 years has not yet been studied. other medicines and delstrigo tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. this is because other medicines may affect how delstrigo works, and delstrigo might affect the way some other medicines work. there are some medicines you must not take with delstrigo. see list under \"do not take delstrigo\" section. talk to your doctor before taking the following medicines with delstrigo as your doctor may need to change the dose of your medicines: bosentan (a medicine to treat lung disease) dabrafenib (a medicine to treat skin cancer) lesinurad (a medicine to treat gout) modafinil (a medicine to treat excessive sleepiness) nafcillin (a medicine to treat some bacterial infections) rifabutin (a medicine to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis) telotristat ethyl (a medicine to treat diarrhea in people with carcinoid syndrome) thioridazine (a medicine to treat psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia) if your doctor decides you should take these medicines with delstrigo, your doctor will prescribe a 100 mg tablet of doravirine to be taken daily, approximately 12 hours after your dose of delstrigo. your doctor may check your blood levels or monitor for side effects if you take the following medicines with delstrigo: ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (medicines used to treat hepatitis c infection) sirolimus (a medicine used to control your body's immune response after a transplant) sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (medicines used to treat hepatitis c infection) tacrolimus (a medicine used to control your body's immune response after a transplant) medicines (usually liquids) containing sorbitol and other sugar alcohols (such as xylitol, mannitol, lactitol or maltitol), if taken regularly pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking delstrigo. it is preferable to avoid the use of delstrigo during pregnancy. this is because it has not been studied in pregnancy and it is not known if delstrigo will harm your baby while you are pregnant. women with hiv should not breastfeed because hiv can be passed on to babies through breast milk. talk with your doctor about the best way to feed your baby. driving and using machines use with caution when driving, riding a bicycle, or operating machines

doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are not sure. delstrigo is a complete regimen taken as a single tablet for the treatment of hiv infection. how much to take the recommended dose is 1 tablet once a day. if you take certain medicines your doctor may need to change the amount of doravirine you take. see \"other medicines and delstrigo\" section for a list of medicines. taking this medicine swallow the tablet whole (do not crush or chew). this medicine can be taken with food or between meals. if you take more delstrigo than you should do not take more than the recommended dose. if you accidentally take more, contact your doctor. if you forget to take delstrigo it is important that you do not miss or skip doses of delstrigo. if you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember. but if your next dose is due within 12 hours, skip the dose you missed and take the next one at the usual time. then continue your treatment as before. do not take two doses of delstrigo at the same time to make up for a missed dose. if you are not sure what to do, call your doctor or pharmacist. if you stop taking delstrigo do not run out of delstrigo. refill your prescription or talk to your doctor before your delstrigo is all gone. if you stop taking delstrigo, your doctor will need to check your health often and do blood tests regularly for several months to check your hiv infection. if you have hiv infection and hepatitis b infection, it is especially important not to stop your delstrigo treatment without talking to your doctor first. some patients have had blood tests or symptoms indicating that their hepatitis has worsened after stopping lamivudine or tenofovir disoproxil (two of the three active substances of delstrigo). if delstrigo is stopped your doctor may recommend that you resume hepatitis b treatment. you may need blood tests to check how your liver is working for 4 months after stopping treatment. in some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not recommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "delstrigo", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "a complete regimen", "Type": "TREATMENT", "BeginOffset": 164, "EndOffset":
