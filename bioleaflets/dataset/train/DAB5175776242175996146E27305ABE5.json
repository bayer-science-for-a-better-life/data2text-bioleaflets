NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRenagel 400 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 400 mg sevelamer hydrochloride. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet) \nThe off-white, oval tablets are imprinted with \u201cRenagel 400\u201d on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRenagel is indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients receiving haemodialysis \nor peritoneal dialysis. Renagel should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, \nwhich could include calcium supplements, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues to \ncontrol the development of renal bone disease. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nStarting dose \nThe recommended starting dose of sevelamer hydrochloride is 2.4 g, 3.6 g or 4.8 g per day based on \nclinical needs and serum phosphorus level.  Renagel must be taken three times per day with meals. \n \nSerum phosphate level in patients not on \n\nphosphate binders \nStarting dose of Renagel 400 mg \n\ntablets \n1.76 \u2013 2.42 mmol/L (5.5-7.5 mg/dl) 2 tablets, 3 times per day \n\n2.42- 2.91 mmol/L (7.5-9 mg/dl) 3 tablets, 3 times per day \n> 2.91 mmol/L 4 tablets, 3 times per day \n\n \nFor patients previously on phosphate binders, Renagel should be given on a gram for gram basis with \nmonitoring of serum phosphorus levels to ensure optimal daily doses. \n \nTitration and maintenance \nSerum phosphate levels should be closely monitored and the dose of sevelamer hydrochloride titrated \nby 0.4 g or 0.8 g three times per day (1.2 g/day or 2.4 g/day) increments with the goal of lowering \nserum phosphate to 1.76 mmol/L (5.5mg/dl) or less. Serum phosphate should be tested every two to \nthree weeks until a stable serum phosphate level is reached and on a regular basis thereafter. \n \nThe dose range may vary between 1 and 10 tablets per meal.  The average actual daily dose used in \nthe chronic phase of a one year clinical study was 7 grams of sevelamer. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of this product have not been established in patients below the age of 18 \nyears.  \n \nRenal impairment \nThe safety and efficacy of this product have not been established in predialysis patients.  \n \nMethod of administration \nFor oral use. \nPatients should take Renagel with meals and adhere to their prescribed diets. The tablets must be \nswallowed whole. Do not crush, chew or break into pieces prior to administration. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to sevelamer or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\u2022 Hypophosphataemia \n\u2022 Bowel obstruction. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEfficacy and safety of Renagel has not been studied in patients with: \n\n\u2022 swallowing disorders \n\u2022 active inflammatory bowel disease \n\u2022 gastrointestinal motility disorders including untreated or severe gastroparesis, diverticulosis \n\nretention of gastric contents and abnormal or irregular bowel motion \n\u2022 patients with a history of major gastrointestinal surgery  \n\nTherefore caution should be exercised when Renagel is used in patients with these disorders. \n \nIntestinal obstruction and ileus/subileus \nIn very rare cases, intestinal obstruction and ileus/subileus have been observed in patients during \ntreatment with sevelamer hydrochloride. Constipation may be a preceding symptom. Patients who are \nconstipated should be monitored carefully while being treated with sevelamer hydrochloride. Renagel \ntreatment should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe constipation or other severe \ngastrointestinal symptoms. \n \nFat-soluble vitamins \nDepending on diet intake and the nature of end stage renal failure, dialysis patients may develop low \nvitamin A, D, E and K levels. It cannot be excluded that Renagel can bind fat-soluble vitamins \ncontained in ingested food. Therefore, in patients not taking these vitamins, monitoring vitamin A, D \nand E levels and assessing vitamin K status through the measurement of thromboplastin time should \nbe considered and the vitamins should be supplemented if necessary. Additional monitoring of \nvitamins and folic acid is recommended in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis, since in the clinical \nstudy, vitamin A, D, E and K levels were not measured in these patients. \n \nFolate deficiency \nThere is at present insufficient data to exclude the possibility of folate deficiency during long term \nRenagel treatment. \n \nHypocalcaemia/hypercalcaemia \nPatients with renal insufficiency may develop hypocalcaemia or hypercalcaemia. Renagel does not \ncontain calcium. Serum calcium levels should be monitored as is done in normal follow-up of a \ndialysis patient. Elemental calcium should be given as a supplement in case of hypocalcaemia.  \n \nMetabolic acidosis \nPatients with chronic renal failure are predisposed to developing metabolic acidosis. Worsening of \nacidosis has been reported upon switching from other phosphate binders to sevelamer in a number of \n\n\n\n4 \n\nstudies where lower bicarbonate levels in the sevelamer-treated patients compared to patients treated \nwith calcium-based binders were observed. Closer monitoring of serum bicarbonate levels is therefore \nrecommended. \n \nPeritonitis \nPatients receiving dialysis are subject to certain risks for infection specific to the dialysis modality. \nPeritonitis is a known complication in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) and in a clinical \nstudy with Renagel, a number of peritonitis cases were reported. Therefore, patients on PD should be \nclosely monitored to ensure the reliable use of appropriate aseptic technique with the prompt \nrecognition and management of any signs and symptoms associated with peritonitis. \n \nSwallowing and choking difficulties \nUncommon reports of difficulty swallowing the Renagel tablet have been reported. Many of these \ncases involved patients with co-morbid conditions including swallowing disorders or oesophageal \nabnormalities. Caution should be exercised when Renagel is used in patients with difficulty \nswallowing. \n \nHypothyroidism \nCloser monitoring of patients with hypothyroidism co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride and \nlevothyroxine is recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nLong term chronic treatment \nAs data on the chronic use of sevelamer for over one year are not yet available, potential absorption \nand accumulation of sevelamer during long-term chronic treatment cannot be totally excluded (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nHyperparathyroidism \nRenagel alone is not indicated for the control of hyperparathyroidism. In patients with secondary \nhyperparathyroidism Renagel should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, \nwhich could include calcium supplements, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues to \nlower the intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels. \n \nSerum chloride \nSerum chloride may increase during Renagel treatment as chloride may be exchanged for phosphorus \nin the intestinal lumen. Although no clinically significant serum chloride increase has been observed \nin the clinical studies, serum chloride should be monitored as is done in the routine follow-up of a \ndialysis patient. One gram of Renagel contains approximately 180 mg (5.1 mEq) chloride. \n \nInflammatory Gastrointestinal Disorders  \nCases of serious inflammatory disorders of different parts of the gastrointestinal tract (including \nserious complications such as haemorrhage, perforation, ulceration, necrosis, colitis and \ncolonic/caecal mass) associated with the presence of sevelamer crystals have been reported (see \nsection 4.8).  Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer discontinuation. Sevelamer \nhydrochloride treatment should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal \nsymptoms.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDialysis \nInteraction studies have not been conducted in patients on dialysis. \n \nCiprofloxacin \nIn interaction studies in healthy volunteers, sevelamer hydrochloride decreased the bioavailability of \nciprofloxacin by approximately 50% when co-administered with Renagel in a single dose study. \nConsequently, Renagel should not be taken simultaneously with ciprofloxacin. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nAnti-arrhythmics and anti-seizure medicinal products \nPatients taking anti-arrhythmic medicinal products for the control of arrhythmias and anti-seizure \nmedicinal products for the control of seizure disorders were excluded from clinical trials.  Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing sevelamer hydrochloride to patients also taking these medicinal \nproducts. \n \nLevothyroxine \nDuring post marketing experience, very rare cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) \nlevels have been reported in patients co-administered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine. \nCloser monitoring of TSH levels is therefore recommended in patients receiving both medicinal \nproducts. \n \nCiclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus in transplant patients \nReduced levels of ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus have been reported in transplant \npatients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (i.e \ngraft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded and a close monitoring of blood \nconcentrations of mycophenolate mofetil,  ciclosporin and tacrolimus should be considered during the \nuse of combination and after its withdrawal.  \n \nDigoxin, warfarin, enalapril or metoprolol  \nIn interaction studies in healthy volunteers, Renagel had no effect on the bioavailability of digoxin, \nwarfarin, enalapril or metoprolol. \n \nProton pump inhibitors \nDuring post-marketing experience, very rare cases of increased phosphate levels have been reported in \npatients taking proton pump inhibitors co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride.  \n \nBioavailability \nRenagel is not absorbed and may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products. When \nadministering any medicinal product where a reduction in the bioavailability could have a clinically \nsignificant effect on safety or efficacy, the medicinal product should be administered at least one hour \nbefore or three hours after Renagel, or the physician should consider monitoring blood levels. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThe safety of sevelamer hydrochloride has not been established in pregnant women. In animal studies \nthere was no evidence that sevelamer induced embryo-foetal toxicity. Renagel should only be given to \npregnant women if clearly needed and after a careful risk/benefit analysis has been conducted for both \nthe mother and the foetus (see section 5.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \nThe safety of sevelamer hydrochloride has not been established in breast-feeding women. Renagel \nshould only be given to breast-feeding women if clearly needed and after a careful risk/benefit \nanalysis has been conducted for both the mother and the infant (see section 5.3). \n \nFertility \nThere are no data from the effect of sevelamer on fertility in humans.  Studies in animals have shown \nthat sevelamer did not impair fertility in male or female rats at exposures at a human equivalent dose \n2 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g/day, based on a comparison of relative body surface \narea. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSevelamer has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequently occurring (\u22655% of patients) adverse reactions were all in the gastrointestinal \ndisorders system organ class.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nParallel design studies involving 244 haemodialysis patients with treatment duration of up to 54 \nweeks and 97 peritoneal dialysis patients with treatment duration of 12 weeks were conducted. \nAdverse reactions from these studies (299 patients),  from uncontrolled clinical trials (384 patients), \nand that were spontaneously reported from post-marketing experience  are listed by frequency in the \ntable below. The reporting rate is classified as very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nMedDRA \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery  \nCommon \n\nCommon Uncommon Very Rare Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n   Hypersensitivity*  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n  Acidosis, \nincreased \nserum \nchloride \nlevels \n\n  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea, \nvomiting \n\nDiarrhoea, \ndyspepsia, \nflatulence, \nupper \nabdominal \npain, \nconstipation \n\n  Abdominal pain, \nintestinal \nobstruction, \nileus/subileus, \ndiverticulitis, \nintestinal \nperforation1, \ngastrointestinal \nhemorrhage*1, \nintestinal \nulceration*1, \ngastrointestinal \nnecrosis*1,  \ncolitis*1, \nintestinal mass*1 \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n    Pruritus, rash \n\nInvestigations     Crystal deposit \nintestine*1 \n\n*post-marketing experience \n1 See inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders warning in section 4.4 \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nRenagel has been given to normal healthy volunteers in doses up to 14 grams, the equivalent of \nthirty five 400 mg tablets per day for eight days with no undesirable effects.  \n \n \n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Treatment of hyperphosphatemia. ATC code: V03AE02. \n \nRenagel contains sevelamer, a non-absorbed phosphate binding poly (allylamine hydrochloride) \npolymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the \npolymer backbone. These amines become partially protonated in the intestine and interact with \nphosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the \ngastrointestinal tract, sevelamer lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum. \n \nIn clinical trials, sevelamer has been shown to be effective in reducing serum phosphorus in patients \nreceiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. \n \nSevelamer decreases the incidence of hypercalcaemic episodes as compared to patients using calcium \nbased phosphate binders alone, probably because the product itself does not contain calcium. The \neffects on phosphate and calcium were proven to be maintained throughout a study with one year \nfollow-up. \n \nSevelamer has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Bile \nacid binding by ion exchange resins is a well-established method of lowering blood cholesterol. In \nclinical trials mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15-31%. This effect is observed after 2 \nweeks is maintained with long-term treatment. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and albumin did not \nchange.  \n \nIn the clinical studies in haemodialysis patients, sevelamer alone did not have a consistent and \nclinically significant effect on serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). In the 12 week study \ninvolving peritoneal dialysis patients however, similar iPTH reductions were seen compared with \npatients receiving calcium acetate. In patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism Renagel should be \nused within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium supplements, \n1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues to lower the iPTH levels. \n \nIn a clinical trial of one-year duration, Renagel had no adverse effect on bone turnover or \nmineralisation compared to calcium carbonate.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nRenagel is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract according to a single dose pharmacokinetic \nstudy in healthy volunteers. Pharmacokinetic studies have not been carried out in renal failure patients \n(see section 4.4).  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn preclinical studies in rats and dogs, Renagel at a dose of 10 times the maximum human doses \nreduced absorption of fat soluble vitamins D, E and K, and folic acid. \n \nIn a study in rats, administering sevelamer in 15-30 x the human dose, an increase in serum copper \nwas detected. This was not confirmed in a dog study or in clinical trials. \n\n\n\n8 \n\nCurrently, no formal carcinogenicity data are available. However, in vitro and in vivo studies have \nindicated that Renagel does not have genotoxic potential. Also the medicinal product is not absorbed \nin the gastrointestinal tract. \n \nIn reproduction studies there was no evidence that sevelamer induced embryolethality, foetotoxicity \nor teratogenicity at the doses tested (up to 1 g/kg/day in rabbits and up to 4.5 g/kg/day in rats). \nDeficits in skeletal ossification were observed in several locations in fetuses of female rats dosed with \nsevelamer at 8-20 times the maximum human dose of 200 mg/kg. The effects may be secondary to \nvitamin D and/or vitamin K depletion at these high doses. \n \n \n6.

In animal studies \nthere was no evidence that sevelamer induced embryo-foetal toxicity. Renagel should only be given to \npregnant women if clearly needed and after a careful risk/benefit analysis has been conducted for both \nthe mother and the foetus (see section 5.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \nThe safety of sevelamer hydrochloride has not been established in breast-feeding women. Renagel \nshould only be given to breast-feeding women if clearly needed and after a careful risk/benefit \nanalysis has been conducted for both the mother and the infant (see section 5.3). \n \nFertility \nThere are no data from the effect of sevelamer on fertility in humans.  Studies in animals have shown \nthat sevelamer did not impair fertility in male or female rats at exposures at a human equivalent dose \n2 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g/day, based on a comparison of relative body surface \narea. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSevelamer has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequently occurring (\u22655% of patients) adverse reactions were all in the gastrointestinal \ndisorders system organ class.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nIn parallel design studies involving 244 haemodialysis patients with treatment duration of up to 54 \nweeks and 97 peritoneal dialysis patients with treatment duration of 12 weeks were conducted. \nAdverse reactions from these studies (299 patients),  from uncontrolled clinical trials (384 patients), \nand that were spontaneously reported from post-marketing experience are listed by frequency in the \ntable below. The reporting rate is classified as very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated form the available data). \n \nMedDRA \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery  \nCommon \n\nCommon Uncommon Very Rare Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n   Hypersensitivity*  \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n  Acidosis, \nincreased \nserum \nchloride \nlevels \n\n  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea, \nvomiting \n\nDiarrhoea, \ndyspepsia, \nflatulence, \nupper \nabdominal \npain, \nconstipation \n\n  Abdominal pain, \nintestinal \nobstruction, \nileus/subileus, \ndiverticulitis, \nintestinal \nperforation1, \ngastrointestinal \nhemorrhage*1, \nintestinal \nulceration*1, \ngastrointestinal \nnecrosis*1,  \ncolitis*1, \nintestinal mass*1 \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n    Pruritus, rash \n\nInvestigations     Crystal deposit \nintestine*1 \n\n*post-marketing experience \n1 See inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders warning in section 4.4 \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n15 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nRenagel has been given to normal healthy volunteers in doses up to 14 grams, the equivalent of \nseventeen 800 mg tablets per day for eight days with no undesirable effects.  \n \n \n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Treatment of hyperphosphatemia. ATC code: V03AE02. \n \nRenagel contains sevelamer, a non-absorbed phosphate binding poly (allylamine hydrochloride) \npolymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the \npolymer backbone. These amines become partially protonated in the intestine and interact with \nphosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the \ngastrointestinal tract, sevelamer lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum. \n \nIn clinical trials, sevelamer has been shown to be effective in reducing serum phosphorus in patients \nreceiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. \n \nSevelamer decreases the incidence of hypercalcaemic episodes as compared to patients using calcium \nbased phosphate binders alone, probably because the product itself does not contain calcium. The \neffects on phosphate and calcium were proven to be maintained throughout a study with one year \nfollow-up. \n \nSevelamer has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models. Bile \nacid binding by ion exchange resins is a well-established method of lowering blood cholesterol. In \nclinical trials mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15-31%. This effect is observed after 2 \nweeks is maintained with long-term treatment. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and albumin did not \nchange.  \n \nIn the clinical studies in haemodialysis patients, sevelamer alone did not have a consistent and \nclinically significant effect on serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). In the 12 week study \ninvolving peritoneal dialysis patients however, similar iPTH reductions were seen compared with \npatients receiving calcium acetate. In patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism Renagel should be \nused within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium supplements, \n1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues to lower the iPTH levels. \n \nIn a clinical trial of one-year duration, Renagel had no adverse effect on bone turnover or \nmineralisation compared to calcium carbonate.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nRenagel is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract according to a single dose pharmacokinetic \nstudy in healthy volunteers. Pharmacokinetic studies have not been carried out in renal failure patients \n(see section 4.4).  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn preclinical studies in rats and dogs, Renagel at a dose of 10 times the maximum human doses \nreduced absorption of fat soluble vitamins D, E and K, and folic acid. \n \nIn a study in rats, administering sevelamer in 15-30 x the human dose, an increase in serum copper \nwas detected. This was not confirmed in a dog study or in clinical trials. \n\n\n\n16 \n\nCurrently, no formal carcinogenicity data are available. However, in vitro and in vivo studies have \nindicated that Renagel does not have genotoxic potential. Also the medicinal product is not absorbed \nin the gastrointestinal tract. \n \nIn reproduction studies there was no evidence that sevelamer induced embryolethality, foetotoxicity \nor teratogenicity at the doses tested (up to 1 g/kg/day in rabbits and up to 4.5 g/kg/day in rats). \nDeficits in skeletal ossification were observed in several locations in fetuses of female rats dosed with \nsevelamer at 8-20 times the maximum human dose of 200 mg/kg. The effects may be secondary to \nvitamin D and/or vitamin K depletion at these high doses. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n43 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nRenagel 400 mg film-coated tablets \nsevelamer hydrochloride \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Renagel is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Renagel \n3. How to take Renagel \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Renagel \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Renagel is and what it is used for \n \nRenagel contains sevelamer as the active ingredient. It binds phosphate from food in the digestive \ntract and so reduces serum phosphate levels in the blood. \n \nRenagel is used to control the levels of phosphate in the blood of adult kidney failure patients on \nhaemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis treatment.  \n \nAdult patients whose kidneys have failed and who are undergoing haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis \nare not able to control the level of serum phosphate in their blood. The amount of phosphate then rises \n(your doctor will call this hyperphosphataemia). Increased levels of serum phosphorus can lead to \nhard deposits in your body called calcification. These deposits can stiffen your blood vessels and \nmake it harder for blood to be pumped around the body. Increased serum phosphorus can also lead to \nitchy skin, red eyes, bone pain and fractures. \n \nRenagel may be used with other medicines which include calcium or vitamin D supplements to \ncontrol the development of renal bone disease. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Renagel  \n \nDo not take Renagel: \n\u2022 if you have low levels of phosphate in your blood (your doctor will check this for you). \n\u2022 if you have bowel obstruction.  \n\u2022 if you are allergic to sevelamer or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Renagel if any of the following applies to you: \n\n\u2022 if you are not on dialysis \n\u2022 if you have swallowing problems \n\u2022 if you have problems with motility (movement) in your stomach and bowel \n\u2022 if you have symptoms of delayed emptying of stomach contents such as feeling of fullness, \n\n\n\n44 \n\nnausea and/or vomiting  \n\u2022 if you have prolonged diarrhoea or pain in the abdomen (symptoms of active inflammatory \n\nbowel disease) \n\u2022 if you have undergone major surgery on your stomach or bowel \n\n \nTalk to your doctor while taking Renagel: \n\n\u2022 if you experience severe abdominal pain, stomach or intestine disorders, or blood in the stool \n(gastrointestinal bleeding). These symptoms can be due to serious inflammatory bowel \ndisease caused by sevelamer crystals deposit in your bowel. Contact your doctor who will \ndecide on continuing the treatment or not. \n\n \nAdditional treatments: \nDue to either your kidney condition or your dialysis treatment you may: \n\n\u2022 develop a low or high level of calcium in your blood. Since Renagel does not contain calcium \nyour doctor might prescribe additional calcium tablets. \n\n\u2022 have a low amount of vitamin D in your blood. Therefore, your doctor may monitor the levels \nof vitamin D in your blood and prescribe additional vitamin D as necessary. If you do not take \nmultivitamin supplements you may also develop low levels of vitamins A, E, K and folic acid \nin your blood and therefore your doctor may monitor these levels and prescribe supplemental \nvitamins as necessary. \n\n \nChanging treatment: \nWhen you switch from another phosphate binder to Renagel, your doctor might consider monitoring \nthe levels of bicarbonate in your blood more closely because Renagel may decrease the levels of \nbicarbonate. \n \nSpecial note for patients on peritoneal dialysis \nYou may develop peritonitis (infection of your abdominal fluid) associated with your peritoneal \ndialysis. This risk can be reduced by careful adherence to sterile techniques during bag changes. You \nshould tell your doctor immediately if you experience any new signs or symptoms of abdominal \ndistress, abdominal swelling, abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, or abdominal rigidity, \nconstipation, fever, chills, nausea or vomiting. \nYou should expect to be monitored more carefully for problems with low levels of vitamins A, D, E, \nK and folic acid. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe safety and efficacy in children (below the age of 18 years) has not been studied. Therefore \nRenagel is not recommended for use in this population. \n \nOther medicines and Renagel \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \n\n\u2022 Renagel should not be taken at the same time as ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic). \n \n\n\u2022 If you are taking medicines for heart rhythm problems or for epilepsy, you should consult \nyour doctor when taking Renagel. \n\n \n\u2022 The effects of medicines such as ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus \n\n(medicines used in transplant patients) may be reduced by Renagel. Your doctor will advise \nyou if you are taking these medicines. \n\n \n\u2022 In certain people taking levothyroxine (a thyroid hormone) and Renagel, increased levels of \n\nthyroid stimulating hormone (TSH, a substance in your blood which helps control your \nbody\u2019s chemical functions) may very rarely be observed. Therefore your doctor may monitor \nthe levels of TSH in your blood more closely. \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\u2022 If you are taking medicine such as omeprazole, pantoprazole, or lansoprazole to treat heartburn, \n\ngastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or gastric ulcers, you should consult your doctor when \ntaking Renagel. \n\n \nYour doctor will check for interactions between Renagel and other medicines on a regular basis. \n \nIn some cases where Renagel should be taken at the same time as another medicine, your doctor may \nadvise you to take this medicine 1 hour before or 3 hours after Renagel intake, or he/she may consider \nmonitoring the blood levels of that medicine. \n \nPregnancy and  breast-feeding \nThe safety of Renagel has not been established in pregnant or breast-feeding women. Renagel should \nonly be given to pregnant or breast-feeding women if clearly needed. \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nRenagel is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or to use machines. \n \n \n3. How to take Renagel  \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. He will base the dose on your serum phosphate level. The recommended starting dose of \nRenagel for adults and the elderly (>65 years) is two to four tablets with each meal 3 times a day. \n \nInitially your doctor will check the levels of phosphate in your blood every 2-3 weeks and  may adjust \nthe dose of Renagel when necessary (between 1 and 10 tablets of 400 mg per meal) to reach an \nadequate phosphate level. \n \nThe tablets must be swallowed whole. Do not crush, chew or break into pieces prior to swallowing. \n \nPatients taking Renagel should adhere to their prescribed diet and liquid intake.  \n \nIf you take more Renagel than you should \nIn the event of a possible overdose you should contact your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take Renagel \nIf you have missed one dose, this dose should be omitted and the next dose should be taken at the \nusual time with a meal. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects   \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine  can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSince constipation may be a preceding symptom in very rare cases of blockages in your intestine, it is \nimportant to inform your doctor or pharmacist of this symptom before or during the use of Renagel. \n \nThe following side effects have been reported in patients taking Renagel:  \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \nnausea, vomiting. \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):  \ndiarrhoea, indigestion, abdominal pain, constipation, flatulence. \n\n\n\n46 \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):  \nincreased acidity of the blood.  \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10000 people): \nhypersensitivity. \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): \ncases of itching, rash, abdominal pain, slow intestine motility (movement), inflammation of abnormal \nsmall pouches (called diverticula) in the large intestine, blockages in the intestine (signs include: \nsevere bloating; abdominal pain, swelling or cramps; severe constipation),  rupture in the intestine \nwall (signs include: severe stomach pain, chills, fever, nausea, vomiting, or a tender abdomen), \nserious inflammation of the large bowel (symptoms include: severe abdominal pain, stomach or \nintestine disorders, or blood in the stool [gastrointestinal bleeding]) and crystal deposit in the intestine \nhave been reported. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix \nV. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Renagel  \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date stated on the carton and bottle after \u201cEXP\u201d. The expiry \ndate refers to the last day of that month. \n \nDo not store this medicine above 25 \u00b0C.

These symptoms can be due to serious inflammatory bowel \ndisease caused by sevelamer crystals deposit in your bowel. Contact your doctor who will \ndecide on continuing the treatment or not. \n\n \nAdditional treatments: \nDue to either your kidney condition or your dialysis treatment you may: \n\u2022 develop a low or high level of calcium in your blood. Since Renagel does not contain calcium \n\nyour doctor might prescribe additional calcium tablets. \n\u2022 have a low amount of vitamin D in your blood. Therefore, your doctor may monitor the levels \n\nof vitamin D in your blood and prescribe additional vitamin D as necessary. If you do not take \nmultivitamin supplements you may also develop low levels of vitamins A, E, K and folic acid \nin your blood and therefore your doctor may monitor these levels and prescribe supplemental \nvitamins as necessary. \n\n \nChanging treatment: \nWhen you switch from another phosphate binder to Renagel, your doctor might consider monitoring \nthe levels of bicarbonate in your blood more closely because Renagel may decrease the levels of \nbicarbonate. \n \nSpecial note for patients on peritoneal dialysis: \nYou may develop peritonitis (infection of your abdominal fluid) associated with your peritoneal \ndialysis. This risk can be reduced by careful adherence to sterile techniques during bag changes. You \nshould tell your doctor immediately if you experience any new signs or symptoms of abdominal \ndistress, abdominal swelling, abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, or abdominal rigidity, \nconstipation, fever, chills, nausea or vomiting.  \nYou should expect to be monitored more carefully for problems with low levels of vitamins A, D, E, \nK and folic acid. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe safety and efficacy in children (below the age of 18 years) has not been studied. Therefore \nRenagel is not recommended for use in this population. \n \nOther medicines and Renagel \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \n\n\u2022 Renagel should not be taken at the same time as ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic). \n \n\n\u2022 If you are taking medicines for heart rhythm problems or for epilepsy, you should consult \nyour doctor when taking Renagel. \n\n \n\u2022 The effects of medicines such as ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus \n\n(medicines used in transplant patients) may be reduced by Renagel. Your doctor will advise \nyou if you are taking these medicines. \n\n \n\u2022 In certain people taking levothyroxine (a thyroid hormone) and Renagel, increased levels of \n\nthyroid stimulating hormone (TSH, a substance in your blood which helps control your \nbody\u2019s chemical functions) may very rarely be observed. Therefore your doctor may monitor \nthe levels of TSH in your blood more closely. \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\u2022 If you are taking medicine such as omeprazole, pantoprazole, or lansoprazole to treat heartburn, \n gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or gastric ulcers, you should consult your doctor  \n\n when taking Renagel. \n \nYour doctor will check for interactions between Renagel and other medicines on a regular basis. \n \nIn some cases where Renagel should be taken at the same time as another medicine, your doctor may \nadvise you to take this medicine 1 hour before or 3 hours after Renagel intake, or he/she may consider \nmonitoring the blood levels of that medicine. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nThe safety of Renagel has not been established in pregnant or breast-feeding women. Renagel should \nonly be given to pregnant or breast-feeding women if clearly needed. \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nRenagel is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or to use machines. \n \n \n3. How to take Renagel \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. He will base the dose on your serum phosphate level. The recommended starting dose of \nRenagel for adults and the elderly (>65 years) is one or two tablets with each meal 3 times a day.  \n \nInitially your doctor will check the levels of phosphate in your blood every 2-3 weeks and may adjust \nthe dose of Renagel when necessary (between 1 and 5 tablets of 800 mg per meal) to reach an \nadequate phosphate level. \n \nThe tablets must be swallowed whole. Do not crush, chew or break into pieces prior to swallowing. \n \nPatients taking Renagel should adhere to their prescribed diet and liquid intake.  \n \nIf you take more Renagel than you should \nIn the event of a possible overdose you should contact your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take Renagel \nIf you have missed one dose, this dose should be omitted and the next dose should be taken at the \nusual time with a meal. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSince constipation may be a preceding symptom in very rare cases of blockages in your intestine, it is \nimportant to inform your doctor or pharmacist of this symptom before or during the use of Renagel. \n \nThe following side effects have been reported in patients taking Renagel:  \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \nnausea, vomiting. \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):  \ndiarrhoea, indigestion, abdominal pain, constipation, flatulence. \n\n\n\n52 \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):  \nincreased acidity of the blood. \nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10000 people): \nhypersensitivity. \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): \ncases of itching, rash, abdominal pain, slow intestine motility (movement), inflammation of abnormal \nsmall pouches (called diverticula) in the large intestine, blockages in the intestine (signs include: \nsevere bloating; abdominal pain, swelling or cramps; severe constipation), rupture in the intestine wall \n(signs include: severe stomach pain, chills, fever, nausea, vomiting, or a tender abdomen),serious \ninflammation of the large bowel (symptoms include: severe abdominal pain, stomach or intestine \ndisorders, or blood in the stool [gastrointestinal bleeding]) and crystal deposit in the intestine have \nbeen reported. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix \nV. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.

digestive tract and so reduces serum phosphate levels in the blood. renagel is used to control the levels of phosphate in the blood of adult kidney failure patients on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis treatment. adult patients whose kidneys have failed and who are undergoing haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis are not able to control the level of serum phosphate in their blood. the amount of phosphate then rises (your doctor will call this hyperphosphataemia). increased levels of serum phosphorus can lead to hard deposits in your body called calcification. these deposits can stiffen your blood vessels and make it harder for blood to be pumped around the body. increased serum phosphorus can also lead to itchy skin, red eyes, bone pain and fractures. renagel may be used with other medicines which include calcium or vitamin d supplements to control the development of renal bone disease.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "renagel", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0,
