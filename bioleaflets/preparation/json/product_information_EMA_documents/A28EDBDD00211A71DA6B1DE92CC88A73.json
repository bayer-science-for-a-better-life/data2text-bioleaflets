CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1  Therapeutic indications \n\n \nEpilepsy \n \nPregabalin Mylan Pharma is indicated as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial seizures with \nor without secondary generalisation. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nGeneralised Anxiety Disorder \n \nPregabalin Mylan Pharma is indicated for the treatment of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) \nin adults. \n \n4.2  Posology and method of administration \n \n\nPosology \n \nThe dose range is 150 to 600 mg per day given in either two or three divided doses.  \n \nEpilepsy \nPregabalin treatment can be started with a dose of 150 mg per day given as two or three divided \ndoses. Based on individual patient response and tolerability, the dose may be increased to \n300 mg per day after 1 week. The maximum dose of 600 mg per day may be achieved after an \nadditional week. \n \nGeneralised Anxiety Disorder \nThe dose range is 150 to 600 mg per day given as two or three divided doses. The need for \ntreatment should be reassessed regularly. \n \nPregabalin treatment can be started with a dose of 150 mg per day. Based on individual patient \nresponse and tolerability, the dose may be increased to 300 mg per day after 1 week. Following \nan additional week the dose may be increased to 450 mg per day. The maximum dose of 600 mg \nper day may be achieved after an additional week. \n \nDiscontinuation of pregabalin \nIn accordance with current clinical practice, if pregabalin has to be discontinued, it is \nrecommended this should be done gradually over a minimum of 1 week independent of the \nindication (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nPregabalin is eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal excretion as unchanged \ndrug. As pregabalin clearance is directly proportional to creatinine clearance (see section 5.2), \ndose reduction in patients with compromised renal function must be individualised according to \ncreatinine clearance (CLcr), as indicated in Table 1 determined using the following formula: \n \n\n \n\n \nPregabalin is removed effectively from plasma by haemodialysis (50% of drug in 4 hours). For \npatients receiving haemodialysis, the pregabalin daily dose should be adjusted based on renal \nfunction. In addition to the daily dose, a supplementary dose should be given immediately \nfollowing every 4 hour haemodialysis treatment (see Table 1). \n \nTable 1. Pregabalin dose adjustment based on renal function \n \n\nCreatinine \nclearance (CLcr) \n(ml/min) \n\nTotal pregabalin daily dose *  Dose regimen \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\n \n Starting dose \n\n(mg/day) \n \n\nMaximum dose \n(mg/day) \n \n\n \n\n≥ 60 150 600 BID or TID \n≥30 - <60 75 300 BID or TID \n\n \n\n≥15 - <30 25-50 150 Once Daily or BID \n< 15 25 75 Once Daily \n\n    \nSupplementary dosage following haemodialysis (mg) \n\n 25 100 Single dose+ \n \nTID = Three divided doses \nBID = Two divided doses \n* Total daily dose (mg/day) should be divided as indicated by dose regimen to provide mg/dose \n+ Supplementary dose is a single additional dose \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Pregabalin Mylan Pharma in children below the age of 12 years and in \nadolescents (12-17 years of age) have not been established. Currently available data are \ndescribed in section 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nElderly \nElderly patients may require a dose reduction of pregabalin due to a decreased renal function \n(see patients with renal impairment). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nPregabalin Mylan Pharma may be taken with or without food. \nPregabalin Mylan Pharma is for oral use only. \n \n4.3  Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \n4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nDiabetic patients \n \nIn accordance with current clinical practice, some diabetic patients who gain weight on \npregabalin treatment may need to adjust hypoglycaemic medicinal products. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nThere have been reports in the post-marketing experience of hypersensitivity reactions, including \ncases of angioedema. Pregabalin should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of \nangioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. \n \nDizziness, somnolence, loss of consciousness, confusion and mental impairment \n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nPregabalin treatment has been associated with dizziness and somnolence, which could increase \nthe occurrence of accidental injury (fall) in the elderly population. There have also been \npost-marketing reports of loss of consciousness, confusion and mental impairment. Therefore, \npatients should be advised to exercise caution until they are familiar with the potential effects of \nthe medicinal product. \n \nVision-related effects \n \nIn controlled trials, a higher proportion of patients treated with pregabalin reported blurred \nvision than did patients treated with placebo which resolved in a majority of cases with \ncontinued dosing. In the clinical studies where ophthalmologic testing was conducted, the \nincidence of visual acuity reduction and visual field changes was greater in pregabalin-treated \npatients than in placebo-treated patients; the incidence of fundoscopic changes was greater in \nplacebo-treated patients (see section 5.1). \n \nIn the post-marketing experience, visual adverse reactions have also been reported, including \nloss of vision, visual blurring or other changes of visual acuity, many of which were transient.  \nDiscontinuation of pregabalin may result in resolution or improvement of these visual \nsymptoms. \n \nRenal failure \n \nCases of renal failure have been reported and in some cases discontinuation of pregabalin did \nshow reversibility of this adverse reaction. \n \nWithdrawal of concomitant anti-epileptic medicinal products \n \nThere are insufficient data for the withdrawal of concomitant anti-epileptic medicinal products, \nonce seizure control with pregabalin in the add-on situation has been reached, in order to reach \nmonotherapy on pregabalin. \n \nWithdrawal symptoms \n \nAfter discontinuation of short-term and long-term treatment with pregabalin, withdrawal \nsymptoms have been observed in some patients. The following events have been mentioned: \ninsomnia, headache, nausea, anxiety, diarrhoea, flu syndrome, nervousness, depression, pain, \nconvulsion, hyperhidrosis and dizziness, suggestive of physical dependence. The patient should \nbe informed about this at the start of the treatment. \n \nConvulsions, including status epilepticus and grand mal convulsions, may occur during \npregabalin use or shortly after discontinuing pregabalin. \n \nConcerning discontinuation of long-term treatment of pregabalin, data suggest that the incidence \nand severity of withdrawal symptoms may be dose-related. \n \nCongestive heart failure \n \nThere have been post-marketing reports of congestive heart failure in some patients receiving \npregabalin. These reactions are mostly seen in elderly cardiovascular compromised patients \nduring pregabalin treatment for a neuropathic indication. Pregabalin should be used with caution \nin these patients. Discontinuation of pregabalin may resolve the reaction. \n \nAdverse reactions in patients with spinal cord injury \n \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nThe incidence of adverse reactions in general, central nervous system adverse reactions and \nespecially somnolence was increased in the treatment of central neuropathic pain due to spinal \ncord injury. This may be attributed to an additive effect due to concomitant medicinal products \n(e.g. anti-spasticity agents) needed for this condition. \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic agents \nin several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo controlled studies of anti-epileptic \ndrugs has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. The mechanism \nof this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk \nfor pregabalin. \n \nTherefore patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and \nappropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be \nadvised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. \n \nReduced lower gastrointestinal tract function \n \nThere are post-marketing reports of events related to reduced lower gastrointestinal tract \nfunction (e.g. intestinal obstruction, paralytic ileus, constipation) when pregabalin was \nco-administered with medications that have the potential to produce constipation, such as opioid \nanalgesics. When pregabalin and opioids will be used in combination, measures to prevent \n\nconstipation may be considered (especially in female patients and elderly). \n \nConcomitant use with opioids \n \nCaution is advised when prescribing pregabalin concomitantly with opioids due to risk of CNS \ndepression (see section 4.5). In a case-control study of opioid users, those patients who took \npregabalin concomitantly with an opioid had an increased risk for opioid-related death compared \nto opioid use alone (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.68 [95% CI, 1.19 – 2.36]). This increased risk \nwas observed at low doses of pregabalin (≤ 300 mg, aOR 1.52 [95% CI, 1.04 – 2.22]) and there \nwas a trend for a greater risk at high doses of pregabalin (> 300 mg, aOR 2.51 [95% CI 1.24 – \n5.06]). \n \nMisuse, abuse potential or dependence \n \nCases of misuse, abuse and dependence have been reported. Caution should be exercised in \npatients with a history of substance abuse and the patient should be monitored for symptoms of \npregabalin misuse, abuse or dependence (development of tolerance, dose escalation, \ndrug-seeking behaviour have been reported). \n \nEncephalopathy \n \nCases of encephalopathy have been reported, mostly in patients with underlying conditions that \nmay precipitate encephalopathy. \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule. That is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’ \n \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\n4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nSince pregabalin is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine, undergoes negligible \nmetabolism in humans (<2% of a dose recovered in urine as metabolites), does not inhibit drug \nmetabolism in vitro, and is not bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely to produce, or be subject \nto, pharmacokinetic interactions. \n \nIn vivo studies and population pharmacokinetic analysis \n \nAccordingly, in in vivo studies no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed \nbetween pregabalin and phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, lamotrigine, gabapentin, \nlorazepam, oxycodone or ethanol. Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that oral \nantidiabetics, diuretics, insulin, phenobarbital, tiagabine and topiramate had no clinically \nsignificant effect on pregabalin clearance. \n \nOral contraceptives, norethisterone and/or ethinyl oestradiol \n \nCo-administration of pregabalin with the oral contraceptives norethisterone and/or ethinyl \noestradiol does not influence the steady-state pharmacokinetics of either substance. \n \nCentral nervous system influencing medical products \n \nPregabalin may potentiate the effects of ethanol and lorazepam.  \n \nIn the postmarketing experience, there are reports of respiratory failure, coma and deaths in \npatients taking pregabalin and opioids and/or other central nervous system (CNS) depressant \nmedicinal products. Pregabalin appears to be additive in the impairment of cognitive and gross \nmotor function caused by oxycodone. \n \nInteractions and the elderly \n \nNo specific pharmacodynamic interaction studies were conducted in elderly volunteers. \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n \nAs the potential risk for humans is unknown, effective contraception must be used in women of \nchild bearing potential. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of pregabalin in pregnant women. \n \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for \nhumans is unknown. \n \nPregabalin Mylan Pharma should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary (if the \nbenefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nPregabalin is excreted into human milk (see section 5.2). The effect of pregabalin on \nnewborns/infants is unknown. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nto discontinue pregabalin therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child \nand the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no clinical data on the effects of pregabalin on female fertility. \n \nIn a clinical trial to assess the effect of pregabalin on sperm motility, healthy male subjects were \nexposed to pregabalin at a dose of 600 mg/day. After 3 months of treatment, there were no \neffects on sperm motility. \n \nA fertility study in female rats has shown adverse reproductive effects. Fertility studies in male \nrats have shown adverse reproductive and developmental effects. The clinical relevance of these \nfindings is unknown (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nPregabalin Mylan Pharma may have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use \nmachines. Pregabalin Mylan Pharma may cause dizziness and somnolence and therefore may \ninfluence the ability to drive or use machines. Patients are advised not to drive, operate complex \nmachinery or engage in other potentially hazardous activities until it is known whether this \nmedicinal product affects their ability to perform these activities. \n \n4.8  Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe pregabalin clinical programme involved over 8900 patients exposed to pregabalin, of whom \nover 5600 were in double-blind placebo controlled trials. The most commonly reported adverse \nreactions were dizziness and somnolence. Adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in \nintensity. In all controlled studies, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 12% for \npatients receiving pregabalin and 5% for patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse \nreactions resulting in discontinuation from pregabalin treatment groups were dizziness and \nsomnolence. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn table 2 below all adverse reactions, which occurred at an incidence greater than placebo and in \nmore than one patient, are listed by class and frequency (very common (≥1/10); common \n(≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (< \n1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe adverse reactions listed may also be associated with the underlying disease and/or \nconcomitant medicinal products. \n \nThe incidence of adverse reactions in general, CNS adverse reactions and especially somnolence \nwas increased in the treatment of central neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury (see section \n4.4). \n \nAdditional reactions reported from post-marketing experience are included in italics in the list \nbelow. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nTable 2.

The following reactions have been mentioned: \ninsomnia, headache, nausea, anxiety, diarrhoea, flu syndrome, convulsions, nervousness, \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\ndepression, pain, hyperhidrosis and dizziness, suggestive of physical dependence. The patient \nshould be informed about this at the start of the treatment. \n \nConcerning discontinuation of long-term treatment of pregabalin, data suggest that the incidence \nand severity of withdrawal symptoms may be dose-related. \n \nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe pregabalin safety profile observed in four paediatric studies in patients with partial seizures \n\nwith or without secondary generalization (12-week efficacy and safety study in patients  4 to 16 \n\nyears of age , n=295; 14-day efficacy and safety study in patients 1month to younger than 4years \n\nof age, n=175; pharmacokinetic and tolerability study, n=65; and 1 year open label follow on \n\nsafety study, n=54) was similar to that observed in the adult studies of patients with epilepsy. \n\nThe most common adverse events observed in the 12-week study with pregabalin treatment were \n\nsomnolence, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, increased appetite, weight increased, and \n\nnasopharyngitis. The most common adverse events observed in the 14-day study with pregabalin \n\ntreatment were somnolence, upper respiratory tract infection, and pyrexia (see sections 4.2, 5.1 \n\nand 5.2). \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. \n\nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. \n\n \n4.9  Overdose \n\n \n\nSymptoms \n \nIn the post-marketing experience, the most commonly reported adverse reactions observed when \npregabalin was taken in overdose included somnolence, confusional state, agitation, and \nrestlessness. Seizures were also reported. \n \nIn rare occasions, cases of coma have been reported. \n \nManagement \n \nTreatment of pregabalin overdose should include general supportive measures and may include \nhaemodialysis if necessary (see section 4.2 Table 1). \n \n \n5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-epileptics, other anti-epileptics, ATC code: N03AX16. \n \nThe active substance, pregabalin, is a gamma-aminobutyric acid analogue [(S)-3-(aminomethyl)-\n5- methylhexanoic acid]. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n14 \n \n\nMechanism of action \n \nPregabalin binds to an auxiliary subunit (α2- δ protein) of voltage-gated calcium channels in the \ncentral nervous system. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nEpilepsy \nAdjunctive Treatment \nPregabalin has been studied in 3 controlled clinical trials of 12 week duration with either BID or \nTID dosing. Overall, the safety and efficacy profiles for BID and TID dosing regimens were \nsimilar. \n \nA reduction in seizure frequency was observed by Week 1. \n \nPaediatric population \n\nThe efficacy and safety of pregabalin as adjunctive treatment for epilepsy in paediatric patients \n\nbelow the age of 12 and adolescents has not been established. The adverse events observed in a \n\npharmacokinetic and tolerability study that enrolled patients from 3 months to 16 years of age \n\n(n=65) with partial onset seizures were similar to those observed in adults. Results of a 12-week \n\nplacebo-controlled study of 295 paediatric patients aged 4 to  16 years and a 14-day placebo-\n\ncontrolled study of 175 paediatric patients aged 1month to younger than 4years of age  \n\nperformed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pregabalin as adjunctive therapy for the \n\ntreatment of partial onset seizures and a 1 year open label safety study in 54 paediatric patients \n\nfrom 3 months to 16 years of age with epilepsy indicate that the adverse events of pyrexia and \n\nupper respiratory infections were observed more frequently than in adult studies of patients with \n\nepilepsy (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nIn the 12-week placebo-controlled study, paediatric patients (4 to 16 years of age) were assigned \nto pregabalin 2.5 mg/kg/day (maximum, 150 mg/day), pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day (maximum, \n600 mg/day), or placebo. The percentage of subjects with at least a 50% reduction in partial \nonset seizures as compared to baseline was 40.6% of subjects treated with pregabalin \n10 mg/kg/day (p=0.0068 versus placebo), 29.1% of subjects treated with pregabalin \n2.5 mg/kg/day (p=0.2600 versus placebo) and 22.6% of those receiving placebo. \n \nIn the 14-day placebo-controlled study, paediatric patients (1month to younger than 4years of \nage) were assigned to pregabalin 7 mg/kg/day, pregabalin 14 mg/kg/day, or placebo. Median 24-\nhour seizure frequencies at baseline and at the final visit were 4.7 and 3.8 for pregabalin \n7 mg/kg/day, 5.4 and 1.4 for pregabalin 14 mg/kg/day, and 2.9 and 2.3 for placebo, respectively. \nPregabalin 14 mg/kg/day significantly reduced the log-transformed partial onset seizure \nfrequency versus placebo (p=0.0223); pregabalin 7 mg/kg/day did not show improvement \nrelative to placebo. \n \nMonotherapy (newly diagnosed patients) \nPregabalin has been studied in 1 controlled clinical trial of 56 week duration with BID dosing. \nPregabalin did not achieve non-inferiority to lamotrigine based on the 6-month seizure freedom \nendpoint. Pregabalin and lamotrigine were similarly safe and well tolerated. \n \nGeneralised Anxiety Disorder \nPregabalin has been studied in 6 controlled trials of 4-6 week duration, an elderly study of 8 \nweek duration and a long-term relapse prevention study with a double blind relapse prevention \nphase of 6 months duration. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nRelief of the symptoms of GAD as reflected by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) \nwas observed by Week 1. \n \nIn controlled clinical trials (4-8 week duration) 52% of the pregabalin treated patients and 38% \nof the patients on placebo had at least a 50% improvement in HAM-A total score from baseline \nto endpoint. \n \nIn controlled trials, a higher proportion of patients treated with pregabalin reported blurred \nvision than did patients treated with placebo which resolved in a majority of cases with \ncontinued dosing. \n \nOphthalmologic testing (including visual acuity testing, formal visual field testing and dilated \nfunduscopic examination) was conducted in over 3600 patients within controlled clinical trials. \nIn these patients, visual acuity was reduced in 6.5% of patients treated with pregabalin, and 4.8% \nof placebo-treated patients. Visual field changes were detected in 12.4% of pregabalin-treated, \nand 11.7% of placebo-treated patients. Funduscopic changes were observed in 1.7% of \npregabalin-treated and 2.1% of placebo-treated patients. \n \n5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nPregabalin steady-state pharmacokinetics are similar in healthy volunteers, patients with epilepsy \nreceiving anti-epileptic drugs and patients with chronic pain. \n \nAbsorption \n \nPregabalin is rapidly absorbed when administered in the fasted state, with peak plasma \nconcentrations occurring within 1 hour following both single and multiple dose administration. \nPregabalin oral bioavailability is estimated to be ≥ 90% and is independent of dose. Following \nrepeated administration, steady state is achieved within 24 to 48 hours. The rate of pregabalin \nabsorption is decreased when given with food resulting in a decrease in Cmax by approximately \n25-30% and a delay in tmax to approximately 2.5 hours. However, administration of pregabalin \nwith food has no clinically significant effect on the extent of pregabalin absorption. \n \nDistribution \n \nIn preclinical studies, pregabalin has been shown to cross the blood brain barrier in mice, rats, \nand monkeys. Pregabalin has been shown to cross the placenta in rats and is present in the milk \nof lactating rats. In humans, the apparent volume of distribution of pregabalin following oral \nadministration is approximately 0.56 l/kg. Pregabalin is not bound to plasma proteins. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nPregabalin undergoes negligible metabolism in humans. Following a dose of radiolabelled \npregabalin, approximately 98% of the radioactivity recovered in the urine was unchanged \npregabalin. The N-methylated derivative of pregabalin, the major metabolite of pregabalin found \nin urine, accounted for 0.9% of the dose. In preclinical studies, there was no indication of \nracemisation of pregabalin S-enantiomer to the R-enantiomer. \n \nElimination \n \nPregabalin is eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal excretion as unchanged \ndrug. Pregabalin mean elimination half-life is 6.3 hours. Pregabalin plasma clearance and renal \nclearance are directly proportional to creatinine clearance (see section 5.2 Renal impairment). \n \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\nDose adjustment in patients with reduced renal function or undergoing haemodialysis is \nnecessary (see section 4.2 Table 1). \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nPregabalin pharmacokinetics are linear over the recommended daily dose range. Inter-subject \npharmacokinetic variability for pregabalin is low (<20%). Multiple dose pharmacokinetics are \npredictable from single-dose data. Therefore, there is no need for routine monitoring of plasma \nconcentrations of pregabalin. \n \nGender \n \nClinical trials indicate that gender does not have a clinically significant influence on the plasma \nconcentrations of pregabalin. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nPregabalin clearance is directly proportional to creatinine clearance. In addition, pregabalin is \neffectively removed from plasma by haemodialysis (following a 4 hour haemodialysis treatment \nplasma pregabalin concentrations are reduced by approximately 50%). Because renal elimination \nis the major elimination pathway, dose reduction in patients with renal impairment and dose \nsupplementation following haemodialysis is necessary (see section 4.2 Table 1). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo specific pharmacokinetic studies were carried out in patients with impaired liver function. \nSince pregabalin does not undergo significant metabolism and is excreted predominantly as \nunchanged drug in the urine, impaired liver function would not be expected to significantly alter \npregabalin plasma concentrations. \n \nPaediatric population \n\n \nPregabalin pharmacokinetics were evaluated in paediatric patients with epilepsy (age groups: 1 \nto 23 months, 2 to 6 years, 7 to 11 years and 12 to 16 years) at dose levels of 2.5, 5, 10 and \n15 mg/kg/day in a pharmacokinetic and tolerability study. \n \nAfter oral administration of pregabalin in paediatric patients in the fasted state, in general, time \nto reach peak plasma concentration was similar across the entire age group and occurred \n0.5 hours to 2 hours postdose. \n \nPregabalin Cmax and AUC parameters increased in a linear manner with increasing dose within \neach age group. The AUC was lower by 30% in paediatric patients below a weight of 30  kg due \nto an increased body weight adjusted clearance of 43% for these patients in comparison to \npatients weighing ≥30 kg. \n \nPregabalin terminal half-life averaged about 3 to 4 hours in paediatric patients up to 6 years of \nage, and 4 to 6 hours in those 7 years of age and older. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis showed that creatinine clearance was a significant covariate \nof pregabalin oral clearance, body weight was a significant covariate of pregabalin apparent oral \nvolume of distribution, and these relationships were similar in paediatric and adult patients. \n \nPregabalin pharmacokinetics in patients younger than 3 months old have not been studied (see \nsections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\nElderly \n \nPregabalin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age. This decrease in pregabalin oral \nclearance is consistent with decreases in creatinine clearance associated with increasing age. \nReduction of pregabalin dose may be required in patients who have age related compromised \nrenal function (see section 4.2 Table 1). \n \nBreast-feeding mothers \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of 150 mg pregabalin given every 12 hours (300 mg daily dose) was \nevaluated in 10 lactating women who were at least 12 weeks postpartum. Lactation had little to \nno influence on pregabalin pharmacokinetics. Pregabalin was excreted into breast milk with \naverage steady-state concentrations approximately 76% of those in maternal plasma. The \nestimated infant dose from breast milk (assuming mean milk consumption of 150 ml/kg/day) of \nwomen receiving 300 mg/day or the maximum dose of 600 mg/day would be 0.31 or \n0.62 mg/kg/day, respectively. These estimated doses are approximately 7% of the total daily \nmaternal dose on a mg/kg basis. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nIn conventional safety pharmacology studies in animals, pregabalin was well-tolerated at \nclinically relevant doses. In repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys CNS effects were \nobserved, including hypoactivity, hyperactivity and ataxia. An increased incidence of retinal \natrophy commonly observed in aged albino rats was seen after long term exposure to pregabalin \nat exposures ≥ 5 times the mean human exposure at the maximum recommended clinical dose. \n \nPregabalin was not teratogenic in mice, rats or rabbits. Foetal toxicity in rats and rabbits \noccurred only at exposures sufficiently above human exposure. In prenatal/postnatal toxicity \nstudies, pregabalin induced offspring developmental toxicity in rats at exposures >2 times the \nmaximum recommended human exposure. \n \nAdverse effects on fertility in male and female rats were only observed at exposures sufficiently \nin excess of therapeutic exposure. Adverse effects on male reproductive organs and sperm \nparameters were reversible and occurred only at exposures sufficiently in excess of therapeutic \nexposure or were associated with spontaneous degenerative processes in male reproductive \norgans in the rat. Therefore the effects were considered of little or no clinical relevance. \n \nPregabalin is not genotoxic based on results of a battery of in vitro and in vivo tests. \n \nTwo-year carcinogenicity studies with pregabalin were conducted in rats and mice. No tumours \nwere observed in rats at exposures up to 24 times the mean human exposure at the maximum \nrecommended clinical dose of 600 mg/day. In mice, no increased incidence of tumours was \nfound at exposures similar to the mean human exposure, but an increased incidence of \nhaemangiosarcoma was observed at higher exposures. The non-genotoxic mechanism of \npregabalin-induced tumour formation in mice involves platelet changes and associated \nendothelial cell proliferation. These platelet changes were not present in rats or in humans based \non short term and limited long term clinical data. There is no evidence to suggest an associated \nrisk to humans. \n \nIn juvenile rats the types of toxicity do not differ qualitatively from those observed in adult rats. \nHowever, juvenile rats are more sensitive. At therapeutic exposures, there was evidence of CNS \nclinical signs of hyperactivity and bruxism and some changes in growth (transient body weight \ngain suppression). Effects on the oestrus cycle were observed at 5-fold the human therapeutic \nexposure. Reduced acoustic startle response was observed in juvenile rats 1-2 weeks after \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\nexposure at >2 times the human therapeutic exposure. Nine weeks after exposure, this effect was \nno longer observable. \n \n \n6.
