NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nRapiscan 400 microgram solution for injection \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach 5 ml vial contains 400 micrograms regadenoson (80 micrograms/ml).  \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nSolution for injection  \n\nClear, colourless solution. \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nThis medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. \n\n \n\nRapiscan is a selective coronary vasodilator for use in adults as a pharmacological stress agent for: \n\n \n\n• radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in patients unable to undergo adequate \nexercise stress. \n\n \n\n• the measurement of fractional flow reserve (FFR) of a single coronary artery stenosis during \ninvasive coronary angiography, when repeated FFR measurements are not anticipated (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nTreatment with Rapiscan is restricted to use in a medical facility where cardiac monitoring and \n\nresuscitation equipment are available. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose is a single injection of 400 micrograms regadenoson (5 ml) into a peripheral \n\nvein, with no dose adjustment necessary for body weight. \n\n \n\nPatients should avoid consumption of any products containing methylxanthines (e.g. caffeine) as well \n\nas any medicinal products containing theophylline for at least 12 hours before Rapiscan administration \n\n(see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nWhen possible, dipyridamole should be withheld for at least two days prior to Rapiscan administration \n\n(see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nAminophylline may be used to attenuate severe and/or persistent adverse reactions to regadenoson but \n\nshould not be used solely for the purpose of terminating a seizure induced by Rapiscan (see section \n\n4.4). \n\n \n\nRegadenoson causes a rapid increase in heart rate (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). Patients should remain \n\nsitting or lying down and be monitored at frequent intervals after the injection until the ECG \n\nparameters, heart rate and blood pressure have returned to pre-dose levels. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nRepeated use \n\nFor use in radionuclide MPI: This product is to be administered only once within a 24 hour period. \n\nSafety and tolerability of repeated use of this product within 24 hours has not been characterised. \n\n \n\n \n\nFor use in FFR: This product is to be administered no more than twice, no less than10 minutes apart, \n\nduring any 24 hour period. When administered twice 10 minutes apart in a 24-hour period, full safety \n\ndata for the second injection of Rapiscan are not available. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of regadenoson in children below the age of 18 years have not yet been \n\nestablished. \n\n \n\nNo data are available. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nFor intravenous use. \n\nRadionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI):  \n\n \n\n• Rapiscan should be administered as a rapid, 10-second injection into a peripheral vein using a \n22-gauge or larger catheter or needle. \n\n• 5 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection should be administered \nimmediately after the injection of Rapiscan. \n\n• The radiopharmaceutical for the myocardial perfusion imaging agent should be administered \n10-20 seconds after the sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. The \n\nradiopharmaceutical may be injected directly into the same catheter as Rapiscan. \n\n \n\nFractional flow reserve (FFR): \n\n \n\n• Rapiscan should be administered as a rapid 10-second injection into a peripheral vein, using a \n22-gauge or larger catheter or needle \n\n• 10 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection should be administered \nimmediately after the injection of Rapiscan.  \n\n• FFR should be measured as the lowest value of Pd/Pa achieved during steady state hyperemia. \n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n• Second or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block or sinus node dysfunction, unless these \npatients have a functioning artificial pacemaker. \n\n• Unstable angina that has not been stabilised with medical therapy. \n\n• Severe hypotension. \n\n• Decompensated states of heart failure. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nRegadenoson has the potential to cause serious and life-threatening reactions, including those listed \n\nbelow (see also section 4.8). Continuous ECG monitoring should be performed and vital signs should \n\nbe monitored at frequent intervals until the ECG parameters, heart rate and blood pressure have \n\nreturned to pre-dose levels. Regadenoson should be used with caution and should only be administered \n\nin a medical facility with cardiac monitoring and resuscitation equipment. Aminophylline may be \n\nadministered in doses ranging from 50 mg to 250 mg by slow intravenous injection (50 mg to 100 mg \n\nover 30-60 seconds) to attenuate severe and/or persistent adverse reactions to regadenoson but should \n\nnot be used solely for the purpose of terminating a seizure induced by regadenoson. \n\n \n\nMyocardial ischaemia \n\nFatal cardiac arrest, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction may result from \n\nthe ischaemia induced by pharmacologic stress agents like regadenoson. \n\n \n\nRegadenoson should be used with  caution in patients with recent myocardial infarction.  \n\nRadionuclide MPI clinical trials conducted with regadenoson excluded patients with recent (within 3 \n\nmonths) myocardial infarction.  \n\nClinical trials for the measurement of FFR excluded patients with an acute myocardial infarction, or \n\nwithin 5 days of an acute myocardial infarction. \n\n \n\nSinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal block \n\nAdenosine receptor agonists including regadenoson can depress the sinoatrial (SA) and AV nodes and \n\nmay cause first, second or third degree AV block, or sinus bradycardia. \n\n \n\nHypotension \n\nAdenosine receptor agonists including regadenoson induce arterial vasodilation and hypotension. The \n\nrisk of serious hypotension may be higher in patients with autonomic dysfunction, hypovolemia, left \n\nmain coronary artery stenosis, stenotic valvular heart disease, pericarditis or pericardial effusions, or \n\nstenotic carotid artery disease with cerebrovascular insufficiency. \n\n \n\nElevated blood pressure \n\nRegadenoson may cause clinically significant increases in blood pressure, which in some patients can \n\nlead to hypertensive crisis (see section 4.8). The risk of significant increases in blood pressure may be \n\nhigher in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Consideration should be given to delaying \n\nregadenoson administration until blood pressure is well controlled \n\n \n\nCombination with exercise \n\nUse of regadenoson involving exercise has been associated with serious adverse reactions including \n\nhypotension, hypertension, syncope and cardiac arrest. Patients who have had any symptoms or signs \n\nsuggestive of acute myocardial ischaemia during exercise or recovery are likely to be at especially high \n\nrisk of serious adverse reactions. \n\n \n\nTransient ischaemic attacks and cerebrovascular accident \n\nRegadenoson can cause transient ischaemic attack (see section 4.8). In post-marketing experience \n\nthere have also been reports of cerebrovascular accident (CVA).  \n\n \n\nRisk of seizure  \n\nCaution should be used when administering regadenoson to patients with a history of seizures or other \n\nrisk factors for seizures, including the concomitant administration of medicinal products that lower \n\nseizure threshold (e.g. antipsychotics, antidepressants, theophyllines, tramadol, systemic steroids and \n\nquinolones). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAminophylline should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures or who have other \n\nrisk factors for seizures as it may prolong a seizure or cause multiple seizures because of its \n\nproconvulsant effect. Therefore administration of aminophylline solely for the purpose of terminating \n\na seizure induced by regadenoson is not recommended. \n\n \n\nAtrial fibrillation or flutter \n\nRegadenoson should be used with caution in patients with a history of atrial fibrillation or flutter. In \n\npost- marketing experience there have been cases of worsening or recurrence of atrial fibrillation after \n\nadministration of regadenoson. \n\n \n\nBronchoconstriction \n\nRegadenoson may cause bronchoconstriction and respiratory arrest (see section 4.8) , especially in \n\npatients with known or suspected bronchoconstrictive disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \n\n(COPD) or asthma. Appropriate bronchodilator therapy and resuscitative measures should be available \n\nprior to regadenoson administration. \n\n \n\nLong QT syndrome \n\nRegadenoson stimulates sympathetic output and may increase the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias \n\nin patients with a long QT syndrome. \n\n \n\nWarnings related to excipients \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. However, the injection of \n\nsodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution given after regadenoson contains 45 mg of sodium. To be \n\ntaken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \n\nMethylxanthines \n\nMethylxanthines (e.g., caffeine and theophylline) are non-specific adenosine receptor antagonists and \n\nmay interfere with the vasodilation activity of regadenoson (see section 5.1). Patients should avoid \n\nconsumption of any medicinal products containing methylxanthines as well as any medicinal products \n\ncontaining theophylline for at least 12 hours before regadenoson administration (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n \n\nDipyridamole \n\nDipyridamole increases blood adenosine levels and the response to regadenoson may be altered when \n\nblood adenosine levels are increased. When possible, dipyridamole should be withheld for at least two \n\ndays prior to regadenoson administration (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nCardioactive medicinal products \n\nIn clinical studies, regadenoson was administered to patients taking other cardioactive medicinal \n\nproducts (i.e., β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, nitrates, cardiac glycosides, and \n\nangiotensin receptor blockers) without apparent effects on the safety or efficacy profile of regadenoson. \n\n \n\nOther interactions \n\nRegadenoson does not inhibit the metabolism of substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, \n\nCYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes, indicating that it is unlikely to alter the \n\npharmacokinetics of medicinal products metabolised by these cytochrome P450 enzymes. \n\n \n\nRegadenoson does not significantly inhibit the transporters OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OATP1B1, \n\nOATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2-K, BCRP, P-gp, BSEP, ENT 1 or ENT2 at 1 µM. The data are \n\ninsufficient to conclude about the risk of interactions at the level of these transporters given that a \n\nsingle concentration was evaluated in most instances.  \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nRegadenoson may have a modest inhibitory effect on the active renal transporter, OCT2, and has been \n\nfound to be likely substrate for BCRP, ENT1 or ENT2 mediated transport. However, given the \n\nproposed duration of use, the effects of the drug transporters are unlikely to be clinically relevant. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of regadenoson in pregnant women. Animal studies on pre- and \n\npost-natal development have not been conducted. Fetotoxicity, but not teratogenicity, was noted in \n\nembryo-fetal development studies (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n\nRegadenoson should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether regadenoson is excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of regadenoson in \n\nmilk has not been studied in animals. A decision should be made whether to discontinue breast- \n\nfeeding or to abstain from regadenoson administration taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding \n\nfor the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. If regadenoson is administered, the woman \n\nshould not breast-feed for at least 10 hours (that is, at least 5 times the plasma elimination half-life) \n\nfollowing regadenoson administration. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nFertility studies with regadenoson have not been performed (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nRegadenoson administration may result in adverse reactions such as dizziness, headache, and dyspnoea \n\n(see section 4.8) soon after administration. However, most adverse reactions are mild and transient, \n\nresolving within 30 minutes after receiving regadenoson. Therefore, regadenoson would be expected to \n\nhave no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines once treatment has been \n\ncompleted and these reactions have resolved. \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nAdverse reactions in most patients receiving regadenoson in clinical trials were mild, transient (usually \n\nresolving within 30 minutes after receiving regadenoson) and required no medical intervention. Adverse \n\nreactions occurred in approximately 80% of patients. The most common adverse reactions reported \n\nduring clinical development in a total of 1,651 patients/subjects were: dyspnoea (29%), headache \n\n(27%), flushing (23%), chest pain (19%), electrocardiogram ST segment changes (18%), \n\ngastrointestinal discomfort (15%) and dizziness (11%). \n\n \n\n \n\nRegadenoson may cause myocardial ischaemia (potentially associated with fatal cardiac arrest, life- \n\nthreatening ventricular arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction), hypotension leading to syncope and \n\ntransient ischaemic attacks, elevated blood pressure leading to hypertension and hypertensive crises, \n\nand SA/AV node block leading to first, second or third degree AV block, or sinus bradycardia requiring \n\nintervention (see section 4.4). Signs of hypersensitivity (rash, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis and/or \n\nthroat tightness) may be immediate or delayed onset. Aminophylline may be used to attenuate severe or \n\npersistent adverse reactions to regadenoson but should not be used solely for the purpose of terminating \n\na seizure induced by regadenoson (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAssessment of adverse reactions for regadenoson is based on safety data from clinical studies and post-\n\nmarketing experience. All adverse reactions are presented in the table below and are listed by system \n\norgan class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common \n\n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) and rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000). Within each \n\nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders: \n\nUncommon Hypersensitivity reactions including: Rash, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis \n\nPsychiatric disorders: \n\nUncommon Anxiety, insomnia \n\nNervous system disorders: \n\nVery common Headache, dizziness \n\nCommon Paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, dysgeusia \n\nUncommon Convulsions, syncope, transient ischaemic attack, unresponsiveness to stimuli, \n\ndepressed level of consciousness, tremor, somnolence \n\nRare Cerebrovascular accident \n\nEye disorders: \n\nUncommon Vision blurred, eye pain \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders: \n\nUncommon Tinnitus \n\nCardiac disorders: \n\nVery common Electrocardiogram ST segment changes \n\nCommon Angina pectoris, atrioventricular block, tachycardia, palpitations, other \n\nECG abnormalities including electrocardiogram QT corrected interval prolonged \n\nUncommon Cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, complete AV block, bradycardia, atrial flutter, \n\nnew-onset, worsening or recurrence of atrial fibrillation \n\nVascular disorders: \n\nVery common Flushing \n\nCommon Hypotension \n\nUncommon Hypertension, pallor, peripheral coldness \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: \n\nVery common Dyspnoea \n\nCommon Throat tightness, throat irritation, cough \n\nUncommon Tachypnoea, wheezing \n\nNot known Bronchospasm, Respiratory arrest \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: \n\nVery common Gastrointestinal discomfort \n\nCommon Vomiting, nausea, oral discomfort \n\nUncommon Abdominal distension, diarrhoea, faecal incontinence \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \n\nCommon Hyperhidrosis \n\nUncommon Erythema \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \n\nCommon Back, neck or jaw pain, pain in extremity, musculoskeletal discomfort \n\nUncommon Arthralgia \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \n\nVery common Chest pain \n\nCommon Malaise, asthenia \n\nUncommon Pain at injection site, general body pain \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nFatal cardiac arrest, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and myocardial infarction may result from \n\nthe ischaemia induced by pharmacologic stress agents. Cardiac resuscitation equipment and trained \n\nstaff should be available before administering regadenoson (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nSinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal block \n\nRegadenoson, can depress the SA and AV nodes and may cause first, second or third degree AV block, \n\nor sinus bradycardia requiring intervention. In clinical trials first degree AV block (PR prolongation \n\n> 220 msec) developed in 3% of patients within 2 hours of regadenoson administration; transient \n\nsecond degree AV block with one dropped beat was observed in one patient receiving regadenoson. In \n\n\n\n9 \n\npostmarketing experience, third degree heart block and asystole have been reported within minutes of \n\nregadenoson administration. \n\n \n\nHypotension \n\nAdenosine receptor agonists, including regadenoson induce arterial vasodilation and hypotension. In \n\nclinical trials, decreased systolic blood pressure (> 35 mm Hg) was observed in 7% of patients and \n\ndecreased diastolic blood pressure (> 25 mm Hg) was observed in 4% of patients within 45 minutes of \n\nregadenoson administration. The risk of serious hypotension may be higher in patients with autonomic \n\ndysfunction, hypovolemia, left main coronary artery stenosis, stenotic valvular heart disease, \n\npericarditis or pericardial effusions, or stenotic carotid artery disease with cerebrovascular \n\ninsufficiency. In postmarketing experience, syncope and transient ischaemic attacks have been \n\nreported. \n\n \n\nElevated blood pressure \n\nIn clinical trials, increased systolic blood pressure (≥ 50 mm Hg) was observed in 0.7% of patients and \n\nincreased diastolic blood pressure (≥ 30 mm Hg) in 0.5% of patients. Most increases resolved within \n\n10 to 15 minutes, but in some cases, increases were observed at 45 minutes following administration. \n\n \n\nLong QT syndrome \n\nRegadenoson increases sympathetic tone, which causes an increase in heart rate and a shortening of the \n\nQT interval. In a patient with a long QT syndrome, sympathetic stimulation can result in less \n\nshortening of the QT interval than is normal and may even cause a paradoxical increase in the QT \n\ninterval. In these patients, the phenomenon of R-on-T syndrome can occur, wherein an extra beat \n\ninterrupts the T wave of the previous beat, and this increases the risk of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia. \n\n \n\nHeadache \n\nHeadache was reported by 27% of subjects who received regadenoson in clinical trials. The headache \n\nwas considered severe in 3% of subjects. \n\n \n\nElderly population \n\nOlder patients (≥ 75 years of age; n = 321) had a similar adverse reaction profile compared to younger \n\npatients (< 65 years of age; n = 1,016), but had a higher incidence of hypotension (2% versus < 1%). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nIn a study of healthy volunteers, symptoms of flushing, dizziness and increased heart rate were \n\nassessed as intolerable at regadenoson doses greater than 0.02 mg/kg. \n\n \n\nTreatment \n\n \n\nAminophylline may be used to attenuate severe or persistent adverse reactions to regadenoson. \n\nAdministration of aminophylline, solely for the purpose of terminating a regadenoson-induced seizure \n\nis not recommended (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Cardiac therapy, other cardiac preparations, ATC code: C01EB21 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nRegadenoson is a low affinity agonist (Ki ≈ 1.3 µM) for the A2A adenosine receptor, with at least 10-\n\nfold lower affinity for the A1 adenosine receptor (Ki > 16.5 µM), and very low, if any, affinity for the \n\nA2B and A3 adenosine receptors. Activation of the A2A adenosine receptor produces coronary \n\nvasodilation and increases coronary blood flow (CBF). Despite low affinity for the A2A adenosine \n\nreceptor, regadenoson has high potency for increasing coronary conductance in rat and guinea pig \n\nisolated hearts, with EC50 values of 6.4 nM and 6.7-18.6 nM, respectively. Regadenoson shows \n\nselectivity (≥ 215-fold) for increasing coronary conductance (A2A-mediated response) relative to \n\nslowing of cardiac AV nodal conduction (A1-mediated response) as measured by AV conduction time \n\n(rat heart) or the S-H interval (guinea pig heart). Regadenoson preferentially increases blood flow in \n\ncoronary relative to peripheral (forelimb, brain, pulmonary) arterial vascular beds in the anaesthetised \n\ndog. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nCoronary blood flow \n\nRegadenoson causes a rapid increase in CBF which is sustained for a short duration. In patients \n\nundergoing coronary catheterisation, pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography was used to measure the \n\naverage peak velocity (APV) of CBF before and up to 30 minutes after administration of regadenoson  \n\n(400 micrograms, intravenously). Mean APV increased to greater than twice baseline by 30 seconds \n\nand decreased to less than half of the maximal effect within 10 minutes (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nMyocardial uptake of the radiopharmaceutical is proportional to CBF. Because regadenoson increases \n\nblood flow in normal coronary arteries with little or no increase in stenotic arteries, regadenoson causes \n\nrelatively less uptake of the radiopharmaceutical in vascular territories supplied by stenotic arteries. \n\nMyocardial radiopharmaceutical uptake after regadenoson  administration is therefore greater in areas \n\nperfused by normal relative to stenosed arteries. The same applies to the FFR measurement where the \n\nmaximal myocardial blood flow is decreased in presence of severe coronary artery stenosis.  \n\n \n\nRadionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) \n\n \n\nHaemodynamic effects \n\nThe majority of patients experience a rapid increase in heart rate. The greatest mean change from \n\nbaseline (21 bpm) occurs approximately 1 minute after administration of regadenoson. Heart rate \n\nreturns to baseline within 10 minutes. Systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure changes \n\nwere variable, with the greatest mean change in systolic pressure of −3 mm Hg and in diastolic \n\npressure of −4 mm Hg approximately 1 minute after regadenoson  administration. An increase in blood \n\npressure has been observed in some patients (maximum systolic blood pressure of 240 mm Hg and \n\nmaximum diastolic blood pressure of 138 mm Hg). \n\n \n\nRespiratory effects \n\nThe A2B and A3 adenosine receptors have been implicated in the pathophysiology of \n\nbronchoconstriction in susceptible individuals (i.e., asthmatics). In in vitro studies, regadenoson has \n\nbeen shown to have little binding affinity for the A2B and A3 adenosine receptors. The incidence of a \n\nFEV1 reduction > 15% from baseline after regadenoson  administration was assessed in three \n\nrandomised, controlled clinical studies. In the first study in 49 patients with moderate to severe COPD, \n\nthe rate of FEV1 reduction > 15% from baseline was 12% and 6% following regadenoson  and \n\nplacebo dosing, respectively (p=0.31). In the second study in 48 patients with mild to moderate asthma \n\n\n\n11 \n\nwho had previously been shown to have bronchoconstrictive reactions to adenosine monophosphate, \n\nthe rate of FEV1 reduction > 15% from baseline was the same (4%) following both regadenoson  and \n\nplacebo dosing. In the third study in 1009 patients with mild or moderate asthma (n=537) and \n\nmoderate or severe COPD (n=472) the incidence of FEV1 reduction >15% from baseline was 1.1% \n\nand 2.9% in patients with asthma (p=0.15) and 4.2% and 5.4% in patients with COPD (p=0.58) \n\nfollowing regadenoson  and placebo dosing, respectively. In the first and second studies, dyspnoea was \n\nreported as an adverse reaction following regadenoson  dosing (61% for patients with COPD; 34% for \n\npatients with asthma) while no subjects experienced dyspnoea following placebo dosing. In the third \n\nstudy dyspnoea was reported more frequently following regadenoson  (18% for patients with COPD; \n\n11% for patients with asthma) than placebo, but at a lower rate than reported during clinical \n\ndevelopment (see Section 4.8). A relationship between increased severity of disease and the increased \n\nincidence of dyspnoea was apparent in patients with asthma, but not in patients with COPD. The use \n\nof bronchodilator therapy for symptoms was not different between regadenoson  and placebo. \n\nDyspnoea did not correlate with a decrease in FEV1. \n\n \n\nFractional Flow Reserve (FFR) \n\nHaemodynamic Effects \n\nIn the measurement of FFR, the time to peak maximum hyperaemia was 30±13 seconds. The mean \n\nduration of hyperaemic plateau was 163 (±169) seconds and maximum hyperaemia lasted at least \n\n19 seconds in 90% of patients, however, in the individual patient the duration of hyperaemia varied \n\nbetween 10 seconds to more than 10 minutes. Hyperaemia may fluctuate between sub-maximum and \n\nmaximum until it slowly vanishes. The 10-second window of steady state hyperaemia can be too short \n\nfor performing extensive pressure pullback recordings to assess complex or diffuse coronary artery \n\ndisease. Repeat dosing within 10 minutes – except in patients where the duration of hyperaemia lasted \n\nfor more than 10 minutes – caused a similar effect on peak and duration of maximum hyperaemia.  \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nClinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of regadenoson  in patients indicated for \n\npharmacologic stress radionuclide MPI and for the measurement of FFR. \n\n \n\nPharmacologic stress radionuclide MPI \n\nThe efficacy and safety of regadenoson for pharmacologic stress radionuclide MPI were determined \n\nrelative to adenosine in two randomised, double- blind studies (ADVANCE MPI 1 and ADVANCE \n\nMPI 2) in 2,015 patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease who were referred for a \n\nclinically-indicated pharmacologic stress MPI. A total of 1,871 of these patients had images considered \n\nvalid for the primary efficacy evaluation, including 1,294 (69%) men and 577 (31%) women with a \n\nmedian age of 66 years (range 26-93 years of age). Each patient received an initial stress scan using \n\nadenosine (6-minute infusion using a dose of 0.14 mg/kg/min, without exercise) with a radionuclide \n\ngated SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) imaging protocol. After the initial scan, \n\npatients were randomised to either regadenoson  or adenosine, and received a second stress scan with \n\nthe same radionuclide imaging protocol as that used for the initial scan. The median time between \n\nscans was 7 days (range of 1-104 days). \n\n \n\nThe most common cardiovascular histories included hypertension (81%), coronary artery bypass graft \n\n(CABG), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or stenting (51%), angina (63%), \n\nand history of myocardial infarction (41%) or arrhythmia (33%); other medical history included \n\ndiabetes (32%) and COPD (5%). Patients with a recent history of serious uncontrolled ventricular \n\narrhythmia, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina, a history of greater than first degree AV block, \n\nor with symptomatic bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, or a heart transplant were excluded. A number \n\nof patients took cardioactive medicinal products on the day of the scan, including β-blockers (18%), \n\ncalcium channel blockers (9%), and nitrates (6%). \n\n \n\nComparison of the images obtained with regadenoson  to those obtained with adenosine was performed \n\nas follows. Using the 17-segment model, the number of segments showing a reversible perfusion defect \n\nwas calculated for the initial adenosine study and for the randomised study obtained using regadenoson  \n\n\n\n12 \n\nor adenosine. In the pooled study population, 68% of patients had 0-1 segments showing reversible \n\ndefects on the initial scan, 24% had 2-4 segments, and 9% had ≥ 5 segments. The agreement rate for \n\nthe image obtained with regadenoson  or adenosine relative to the initial adenosine image was \n\ncalculated by determining how frequently the patients assigned to each initial adenosine category (0-1, \n\n2-4, 5-17 reversible segments) were placed in the same category with the randomised scan. The \n\nagreement rates for regadenoson  and adenosine were calculated as the average of the agreement rates \n\nacross the three categories determined by the initial scan. The ADVANCE MPI 1 and ADVANCE MPI \n\n2 studies, individually and combined, demonstrated that regadenoson  is similar to adenosine in \n\nassessing the extent of reversible perfusion abnormalities: \n\n \n\n ADVANCE \n\n \n\nADVANCE Combined \n MPI 1 MPI 2 Studies \n (n = 1,113) (n = 758) (n = 1,871) \nAdenosine – Adenosine Agreement Rate (± SE) 61 ± 3% 64 ± 4% 62 ± 3% \nNumber of Patients (n) 372 259 631 \nAdenosine – regadenoson  Agreement Rate (± SE) 62 ± 2% 63 ± 3% 63 ± 2% \nNumber of Patients (n) 741 499 1,240 \nRate Difference (regadenoson  – Adenosine) (± \n\nSE) \n\n1 ± 4% -1 ± 5% 0 ± 3% \n95% Confidence Interval -7.5, 9.2% -11.2, 8.7% -6.2, 6.8% \n\n \n\nIn ADVANCE MPI 1 and ADVANCE MPI 2, the Cicchetti-Allison and Fleiss-Cohen weighted kappas \n\nof the median score of three blinded readers with respect to ischaemia size category (not counting \n\nsegments with normal rest uptake and mild/equivocal reduction in stress uptake as ischaemic) for the \n\ncombined studies of regadenoson with the adenosine scan were moderate, 0.53 and 0.61, respectively; \n\nas were the weighted kappas of two consecutive adenosine scans, 0.50 and 0.55, respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\nSuboptimal Exercise Stress Test \n\n \n\nIn the EXERRT trial the efficacy and safety of regadenoson was evaluated in patients with suboptimal \n\nExercise Stress in an open-label randomized, multi-center, non-inferiority study when regadenoson \n\nadministered either at 3 minutes during recovery (exercise with regadenoson) or at rest 1 hour later \n\n(regadenoson only). \n\n \n\nAll 1404 patients initially had a baseline MPI scan at rest in accordance with ASNC 2009 guidelines. \n\n \n\nPatients initiated exercise using a standard or modified Bruce protocol. Patients who did not achieve ≥ \n\n85% maximum predicted heart rate (MPHR) and/or ≥ 5 METS (metabolic equivalents), transitioned \n\ninto a 3-5 minutes walking recovery where during the first 3 minutes of recovery, patients were \n\nrandomized 1:1. \n\n \n\nTherefore, 1147 patients were randomized in two groups: 578 patients from the exercise with \n\nregadenoson group and 569 from the regadenoson only group to either 3 minutes recovery (for the \n\nexercise with regadenoson group) or at rest 1 hour later (for the regadenoson only group). \n\n  \n\nPatients from both groups (exercise with regadenoson and regadenoson only) underwent a SPECT \n\nMyocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) at 60-90 minutes post-regadenoson administration.  \n\n \n\nThe baseline MPI scan at rest, and the MPI scans for the exercise with regadenoson and regadenoson \n\nonly groups constituted the MPI 1 phase. \n\n  \n\nSubsequentially, patients from both groups, returned 1-14 days later, to undergo a second stress MPI \n\nregadenoson study without exercise.  \n\nThe baseline MPI scans at rest and those without exercise at 1-14 days later from both groups, \n\nconstituted the MPI 2 phase. \n \n\nThe images from MPI 1 and MPI 2 were compared for presence or absence of perfusion defects.  \n\nThe level of agreement between the MPI 1 (exercise with regadenoson) and the MPI 2 reads was \n\n\n\n13 \n\nsimilar to the level of agreement between MPI 1 (regadenoson only) and MPI 2 reads.  \n\n \n\nFor two patients from the exercise with regadenoson group, a serious cardiac adverse reaction was \n\nreported. Upon case review, both patients, experienced ischemic symptoms and ECG changes during \n\nexercise or recovery prior to regadenoson administration.  \n\nNo serious cardiac adverse reactions occurred in patients receiving regadenoson 1 hour following \n\ninadequate exercise stress.  \n\n \n\nMeasurement of FFR \n\nFor the measurement of FFR, five independent studies have been conducted. A total of 249 patients, \n\nwho were clinically indicated to undergo coronary angiography with invasive measurement of FFR, \n\nreceived regadenoson, with 88 of those patients receiving regadenoson twice.  \n\nFFR was measured after IV infusion of adenosine and IV injection of regadenoson (400 μg). \n\nAdenosine was administered first, followed by regadenoson as its hyperaemia may last unpredictably \n\nand the measured FFR values were compared. \n\n \n\nThe most common cardiovascular conditions were patients with a medical history of hypertension, \n\ndyslipidemia / hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking, prior PCI and prior MI.  \n\n \n\nFor FFR measurement, a diagnosis of inducible ischemia was made according to the measurement of \n\nFFR of 0.8 (>0.8 represents the absence of inducible ischemia vs ≤ 0.8 representing the presence of \n\ninducible ischemia). Adenosine was treated as a gold standard to estimate sensitivity, specificity, and \n\nthe proportion of accuracy. \n\n \n\nStudy Sensitivity Specificity \nClassification agreement \n\nCohen’s kappa \n\nStolker et al. 2015 (n=149) 98% 97% 0.94 \n\nvan Nunen et al. 2015 (n=98) 98% 95% 0.94 \n\n \n\nAminophylline \n\n \n\nAminophylline (100 mg, administered by slow intravenous injection over 60 seconds) injected 1 minute \n\nafter 400 micrograms regadenoson in subjects undergoing cardiac catheterisation, was shown to \n\nshorten the duration of the coronary blood flow response to regadenoson as measured by pulsed- wave \n\nDoppler ultrasonography. Aminophylline has been used to attenuate adverse reactions to regadenoson \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nEffect of caffeine \n\nIn a study of adult patients undergoing pharmacological stress radionuclide MPI with regadenoson , \n\nrandomized to placebo (n=66) or caffeine (200 mg, n=70 or 400 mg, n=71) administered 90 minutes \n\nbefore the test, caffeine compromised the diagnostic accuracy of detecting reversible perfusion defects \n\n(p<0.001). There was no statistical difference between 200 mg and 400 mg caffeine with regadenoson . \n\nAlso, there was no apparent effect of 200 mg or 400 mg of caffeine on regadenoson plasma \n\nconcentrations. \n\n \n\nSafety and tolerability testing \n\nIn ADVANCE MPI 1 and ADVANCE MPI 2, the following pre-specified safety and tolerability \n\nendpoints comparing regadenoson  to adenosine achieved statistical significance: (1) a summed score \n\nof both the presence and severity of the symptom groups of flushing, chest pain, and dyspnoea was \n\nlower with regadenoson  (0.9 ± 0.03) than with adenosine (1.3 ± 0.05); and (2) the symptom groups of \n\nflushing (21% vs 32%), chest pain (28% vs 40%), and ‘throat, neck or jaw pain’ (7% vs 13%) were less \n\nfrequent with regadenoson ; the incidence of headache (25% vs 16%) was more frequent with \n\nregadenoson . \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\n\n\n14 \n\nregadenoson  in one or more subsets of the paediatric population with myocardial perfusion \n\ndisturbances (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nAbsorption \n\nRegadenoson  is administered by intravenous injection for pharmacologic stress radionuclide MPI. The \n\nregadenoson plasma concentration-time profile in healthy volunteers is multi-exponential in nature and \n\nbest characterised by 3-compartment model. The maximal plasma concentration of regadenoson is \n\nachieved within 1 to 4 minutes after injection of regadenoson  and parallels the onset of the \n\npharmacodynamic response (see section 5.1). The half-life of this initial phase is approximately 2 to 4 \n\nminutes. An intermediate phase follows, with a half-life on average of 30 minutes coinciding with loss \n\nof the pharmacodynamic effect. The terminal phase consists of a decline in plasma concentration with a \n\nhalf-life of approximately 2 hours. Within the dose range of 0.003-0.02 mg/kg (or approximately \n\n0.18-1.2 mg) in healthy subjects, clearance, terminal half-life or volume of distribution do not appear \n\ndependent upon the dose. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nRegadenoson is moderately bound to human plasma proteins (25-30%). \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nThe metabolism of regadenoson is unknown in humans. Incubation with rat, dog, and human liver \n\nmicrosomes as well as human hepatocytes produced no detectable metabolites of regadenoson. \n\nFollowing intravenous administration of \n14\n\nC-radiolabeled regadenoson to rats and dogs, most \n\nradioactivity (85-96%) was excreted in the form of unchanged regadenoson. These findings indicate \n\nthat metabolism of regadenoson does not play a major role in the elimination of regadenoson. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nIn healthy volunteers, 57% of the regadenoson dose is excreted unchanged in the urine (range 19-77%), \n\nwith an average plasma renal clearance around 450 ml/min, i.e., in excess of the glomerular filtration \n\nrate. This indicates that renal tubular secretion plays a role in regadenoson elimination. \n\n \n\nMultiple injections \n\nUp to three consecutive injections of regadenoson (100 and 200 μg) have been tested in healthy \n\nvolunteers, and two consecutive doses of 400 μg in healthy volunteers, as well as in patients assessed \n\nfor FFR. Transient dose dependent increases in heart rate occurred following administration of each \n\ndose of regadenoson, whereas no consistent dose-related effect on systolic blood pressure was \n\nobserved. Mean plasma concentrations increased in a dose-related manner and by successive doses as \n\nobserved in healthy volunteers. \n\nSpecial populations \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis including data from subjects and patients demonstrated that \n\nregadenoson clearance decreases in parallel with a reduction in creatinine clearance (CLcr) and \n\nincreases with increased body weight. Age, gender, and race have minimal effects on the \n\npharmacokinetics of regadenoson. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe disposition of regadenoson was studied in 18 subjects with various degrees of renal function and in \n\n6 healthy subjects. With increasing renal impairment, from mild (CLcr 50 to < 80 ml/min) to moderate \n\n(CLcr 30 to < 50 ml/min) to severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 ml/min), the fraction of regadenoson \n\nexcreted unchanged in urine and the renal clearance decreased, resulting in increased elimination half-\n\nlives and AUC values compared to healthy subjects (CLcr ml/min). However, the maximum observed \n\nplasma concentrations as well as volumes of distribution estimates were similar across the groups. The \n\nplasma concentration-time profiles were not significantly altered in the early stages after dosing when \n\nmost pharmacologic effects are observed. No dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal \n\nimpairment.  \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of regadenoson in patients on dialysis has not been assessed.  \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nGreater than 55% of the regadenoson dose is excreted unchanged in the urine and factors that decrease \n\nclearance do not affect the plasma concentration in the early stages after dosing when clinically \n\nmeaningful pharmacologic effects are observed. The pharmacokinetic parameters of regadenoson have \n\nnot been specifically evaluated in those with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. However, post-hoc \n\nanalysis of data from the two Phase 3 clinical trials showed that the pharmacokinetics of regadenoson \n\nwere not affected in a small subset of patients with laboratory values suggestive of impaired hepatic \n\nfunction (2.5-fold transaminase elevation or 1.5-fold elevation of serum bilirubin or prothrombin time). \n\nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age has a minor influence on the pharmacokinetics of \n\nregadenoson. No dose adjustment is needed in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of regadenoson have not yet been studied in the paediatric population \n\n(< 18 years). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, single and repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, or embryo-fetal development. Signs of \n\nmaternal and fetal toxicity were seen in rats and rabbits (reduced fetal weights, delays in ossification \n\n[rats], reduced litter size and number of live fetuses [rabbits]), but not teratogenicity.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nPACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER \n\n \n\nRapiscan 400 microgram solution for injection \n\nRegadenoson \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you. \n\n \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not \n\nlisted in this leaflet. See section 4.  \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet: \n\n1. What Rapiscan is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Rapiscan \n3. How Rapiscan is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Rapiscan \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n\n \n\n1. What Rapiscan is and what it is used for \n \n\nRapiscan contains the active substance regadenoson. This belongs to a group of medicines called \n\n‘coronary vasodilators’. It makes the heart arteries expand and heart rate increase. This makes more \n\nblood flow to the muscles of the heart. \n\n \n\nThis medicine is for diagnostic use only. \n\n \n\nRapiscan is used in a type of heart scan in adults called ‘myocardial perfusion imaging’. \n\n \n\nThe scan uses a radioactive substance called a ‘radiopharmaceutical’ to create images. These images \n\nshow how well blood flows to the muscles of the heart. Usually, exercise on a treadmill is used to put \n\nthe heart under stress before a scan. During the exercise, a small amount of radiopharmaceutical is \n\ninjected into the body, often into a vein in the hand. Images are then taken of the heart. The doctor can \n\nthen see if the heart muscles are getting enough blood flow when it is under stress.  \n\nIf you are unable to exercise enough to reach sufficient stress to the heart, Rapiscan will be injected to \n\nprovide a stress of similar amplitude to the heart to increase the blood flow.  \n\n \n\nRapiscan is also used during catheterisation and imaging arteries of the heart (invasive coronary \n\nangiography) to expand the arteries of the heart to measure the difference in pressure, caused by a \n\nnarrowing within one or more arteries. During cardiac catheterisation, a long thin tube called a \n\ncatheter is inserted either through your femoral or radial artery and threaded through your blood \n\nvessels to your heart. The doctor performing the catheterisation may also want to measure the \n\ndifference in pressure (fractional flow reserve) due to a narrowing detected in one or more arteries of \n\nthe heart. \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given  Rapiscan \n \n\nDo not take Rapiscan: \n\n• if you have slow heart rate (high degree heart block or sinus node disease), and don’t have a \npacemaker fitted. \n\n• if you have chest pain that occurs unpredictably (unstable angina) and that has not improved \nafter treatment. \n\n• if you have low blood pressure (hypotension). \n\n• if you have heart failure. \n\n\n\n26 \n\n• if you are allergic to regadenoson or any of the other ingredients of Rapiscan listed in section 6 \nof this leaflet. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor or nurse before taking Rapiscan \n\nYour doctor needs to know before you are given Rapiscan: \n\n• if you have had a recent serious heart problem (for example a heart attack or abnormal heart \nrhythms). \n\n• if you have a heart rhythm where your heartbeat is very fast or uneven (atrial fibrillation or \natrial flutter) \n\n• if you have high blood pressure that is not controlled, especially if this has been accompanied \nby recent episodes of nose bleed, headache or blurred or double vision. \n\n• if you have had episodes of mini strokes (called transient ischaemic attacks)  \n\n• if you have a heart rhythm disorder called long QT syndrome. \n\n• if you have episodes of heart block (which can slow the heart down) or a very slow heart rate.  \n\n• if you have any heart or blood vessel condition, particularly one that gets worse when your \nblood pressure decreases. These include low blood volume (caused, for example, by severe \n\ndiarrhoea or dehydration or taking water pills), inflammation around the heart (pericarditis) and \n\nsome forms of heart valve or artery disease (for example, aortic or mitral stenosis). \n\n• if you have a condition that causes fits (seizures), such as epilepsy, or if you have ever had fits. \n\n• if you have asthma or lung disease. \nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before you are given the injection. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents  \n\nRapiscan should not be used in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Rapiscan \n\nPlease tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines including medicines \n\nobtained without prescription. \n\n \n\nParticular care should be taken with the following medicines: \n\n• theophylline, a medicine used to treat asthma and other lung diseases, must not be used for at \nleast 12 hours before you are given Rapiscan because it can block the effect of Rapiscan. \n\n• dipyridamole, a medicine used to prevent blood clots, must not be used for at least two days \nbefore you are given Rapiscan because it can change the effect of Rapiscan. \n\n \n\nRapiscan with food and drink \n\nDo not eat food or have drinks containing caffeine (for example, tea, coffee, cocoa, cola or chocolate) \n\nfor at least 12 hours before you are given Rapiscan. This is because caffeine can interfere with the \n\neffect of Rapiscan. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\nBefore you are given Rapiscan, tell your doctor: \n\n• if you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or planning to have a baby. There is no adequate \ninformation on the use of Rapiscan in pregnant women. Harmful effects have been seen in \n\nanimal studies but it is not known if there is a risk to humans. Your doctor will only give you \n\nRapiscan if it is clearly necessary. \n\n• if you are breast-feeding. It is not known whether Rapiscan can pass into breast milk and will \nonly be given to you if your doctor thinks it is necessary. You should avoid breast-feeding for at \n\nleast 10 hours after you are given Rapiscan. \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor for advice before using any medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nRapiscan may make you feel dizzy. It may cause other symptoms (headache or shortness of breath) \n\nthat could affect your ability to drive or use machinery. These effects usually do not last longer than \n\n30 minutes. Do not drive or operate machinery until these effects have improved. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nRapiscan contains sodium  \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. After you have been given \n\nRapiscan, you will be given an injection of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution which contains \n\n45 mg of sodium. To be taken into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. \n\n \n\n3. How Rapiscan is given \n \n\nRapiscan is injected by a healthcare professional (a doctor, nurse or medical technician) in a \n\nmedical facility where your heart and blood pressure can be monitored. It is injected directly into a \n\nvein, as a single dose of 400 micrograms in a 5 ml solution – the injection will take about 10 seconds \n\nto complete. The dose injected does not depend on your weight. \n\n \n\nYou will also be given an injection of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution (5 ml), and an \n\ninjection of a small amount of a radioactive substance (radiopharmaceutical). \n\nWhen you are given Rapiscan, your heart rate will increase quickly. Your heart rate and blood \n\npressure will be monitored. \n\n \n\nAfter the Rapiscan injection you will need to sit or lie down until your heart rate and blood pressure \n\nreturn to your normal levels. The doctor, nurse or medical technician will let you know when you can \n\nstand up. \n\n \n\nA scan of your heart will be made after enough time has passed to allow the radiopharmaceutical to \n\nreach the heart muscle.  \n\nDuring catheterisation of the arteries of the heart, your doctor may measure the pressure difference \n\n(also known as fractional flow reserve – FFR) due to a narrowing in one or more arteries of the heart.  \n\n \n\nIf deemed necessary, a second dose of 400 micrograms can be injected at least 10 minutes after the first \n\ndose for such pressure difference measurement during the same catheterization procedure. Heart rate \n\nand blood pressure will be monitored during the entire procedure. \n\n \n\n \n\nIf you are given more Rapiscan than you should \n\nSome people have had flushing, dizziness and increased heart rate when they have been given too \n\nmuch Rapiscan. If your doctor thinks that you are having severe side effects, or the effects of Rapiscan \n\nare lasting too long, they may give you an injection of a medicine called aminophylline that reduces \n\nthese effects. \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, Rapiscan can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nThe side effects are usually mild. They normally start soon after the Rapiscan injection and are \n\nusually over within 30 minutes. They don’t usually need any treatment. \n\n \n\nMore serious side effects include: \n\n• sudden stopping of the heart or damage to the heart, heart block (a disorder of the heart’s \nelectrical signal, where the signal cannot pass from the upper to the lower chambers), rapid \n\nheart beat \n\n• low blood pressure which may result in fainting or mini strokes (including weakness of the face \nor an inability to speak). Rarely, Rapiscan can cause a stroke (also known as a cerebrovascular \n\naccident). \n\n• an allergic reaction which can cause rash, wheals/weals, swelling under the skin near the eyes or \nthroat, throat tightness, and difficulty in breathing may occur immediately or have delayed onset \n\nafter Rapiscan injection \n\n \n\nTell your doctor straight away if you think you are having severe side effects. Your doctor may then \n\n\n\n28 \n\ngive you an injection of a medicine called aminophylline that reduces these effects. \n\n \n\nVery common side effects \n\n(affects more than 1 user in 10) \n\n• headache, dizziness \n\n• shortness of breath \n\n• chest pain \n\n• changes in heart tracing tests (electrocardiogram) \n\n• flushing \n\n• discomfort in the stomach \n \n\nCommon side effects \n\n(affects 1 to 10 users in 100) \n\n• heart pain (angina), abnormal heart rhythms, rapid heart beat, feeling the heart skipping a beat, \nfluttering, or beating too hard or fast (palpitations) \n\n• low blood pressure \n\n• throat tightness, throat irritation, cough \n\n• being sick (vomiting), feeling sick (nausea) \n\n• feeling unwell or weak \n\n• excessive sweating \n\n• pain in the back, arms, legs, neck or jaw \n\n• discomfort in the bones and muscles \n\n• pins and needles, reduced sensation, taste changes \n\n• discomfort in the mouth \n \n\nUncommon side effects \n\n(affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000) \n\n• sudden stopping of the heart or damage to the heart, heart block (a disorder of the heart’s \nelectrical signal, where the signal cannot pass from the upper to the lower chambers), slow heart \n\nbeat \n\n• fits, fainting, mini strokes (including weakness of the face or an inability to speak), reduced \nresponsiveness (which may include a comatose state), trembling, sleepiness \n\n• an allergic reaction which can cause rash, wheals/weals, swelling under the skin near the eyes or \nthroat, throat tightness, difficulty breathing \n\n• wheezing \n\n• rapid breathing \n\n• high blood pressure, paleness, cold extremities \n\n• blurred vision, eye pain \n\n• anxiety, difficulty sleeping \n\n• ringing in the ears \n\n• bloating, diarrhoea, involuntary loss of faeces \n\n• redness of the skin \n\n• pain in the joints \n\n• pain or discomfort around the area injected, body pain \n \n\nNot known \n\n(frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n• difficulty in breathing (bronchospasm) \n\n• respiratory arrest \n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse.
