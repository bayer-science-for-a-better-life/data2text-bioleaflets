NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nClopidogrel Teva Pharma 75 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 75 mg of clopidogrel (as hydrochloride). \n \nExcipient with known effect: \nEach film-coated tablet contains 13 mg of hydrogenated castor oil.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \nPink, round and slightly convex film-coated tablets. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPrevention of atherothrombotic events \n \nClopidogrel is indicated in: \n\uf0b7 Adult patients suffering from myocardial infarction (from a few days until less than 35 days), \n\nischaemic stroke (from 7 days until less than 6 months) or established peripheral arterial \ndisease. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Adult patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome: \n\n- Non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave \nmyocardial infarction), including patients undergoing a stent placement following \npercutaneous coronary intervention, in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). \n\n- ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction, in combination with ASA in medically \ntreated patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy. \n\n \nPrevention of atherothrombotic and thromboembolic events in atrial fibrillation \nIn adult patients with atrial fibrillation who have at least one risk factor for vascular events, are not \nsuitable for treatment with Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) and who have a low bleeding risk, \nclopidogrel is indicated in combination with ASA for the prevention of atherothrombotic and \nthromboembolic events, including stroke. \n \nFor further information please refer to section 5.1. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n\uf0b7 Adults and elderly \n \n\nClopidogrel should be given as a single daily dose of 75 mg. \n \nIn patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome: \n\n2 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n\uf02d Non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave \nmyocardial infarction): clopidogrel treatment should be initiated with a single 300-mg \nloading dose and then continued at 75 mg once a day (with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) \n75 mg-325 mg daily). Since higher doses of ASA were associated with higher bleeding \nrisk it is recommended that the dose of ASA should not be higher than 100 mg. The \noptimal duration of treatment has not been formally established. Clinical trial data \nsupport use up to 12 months, and the maximum benefit was seen at 3 months (see \nsection 5.1). \n\n- ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction: clopidogrel should be given as a \nsingle daily dose of 75 mg initiated with a 300-mg loading dose in combination with \nASA and with or without thrombolytics. For patients over 75 years of age clopidogrel \nshould be initiated without a loading dose. Combined therapy should be started as early \nas possible after symptoms start and continued for at least four weeks. The benefit of the \ncombination of clopidogrel with ASA beyond four weeks has not been studied in this \nsetting (see section 5.1). \n \n\nIn patients with atrial fibrillation, clopidogrel should be given as a single daily dose of 75 mg. ASA \n(75-100 mg daily) should be initiated and continued in combination with clopidogrel (see section 5.1). \n \nIf a dose is missed: \n\n\uf02d Within less than 12 hours after regular scheduled time: patients should take the dose \nimmediately and then take the next dose at the regular scheduled time. \n\n\uf02d For more than 12 hours: patients should take the next dose at the regular scheduled time and \nshould not double the dose. \n\n \n\uf0b7 Paediatric population \n\nClopidogrel should not be used in children because of efficacy concerns (see section 5.1).   \n \n\uf0b7 Renal impairment \n\nTherapeutic experience is limited in patients with renal impairment (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\uf0b7 Hepatic impairment \nTherapeutic experience is limited in patients with moderate hepatic disease who may have \nbleeding diatheses (see section 4.4). \n\n \nMethod of administration \nFor oral use \nIt may be given with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\uf0b7 Severe hepatic impairment. \n\uf0b7 Active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial haemorrhage. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nBleeding and haematological disorders \nDue to the risk of bleeding and haematological adverse reactions, blood cell count determination \nand/or other appropriate testing should be promptly considered whenever clinical symptoms \nsuggestive of bleeding arise during the course of treatment (see section 4.8). As with other antiplatelet \nagents, clopidogrel should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding \nfrom trauma, surgery or other pathological conditions and in patients receiving treatment with ASA, \nheparin, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including \nCox-2 inhibitors, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or other medicinal products \nassociated with bleeding risk such as pentoxifylline (see section 4.5). Patients should be followed \n\n3 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\ncarefully for any signs of bleeding including occult bleeding, especially during the first weeks of \ntreatment and/or after invasive cardiac procedures or surgery. The concomitant administration of \nclopidogrel with oral anticoagulants is not recommended since it may increase the intensity of \nbleedings (see section 4.5). \n \nIf a patient is to undergo elective surgery and antiplatelet effect is temporarily not desirable, \nclopidogrel should be discontinued 7 days prior to surgery. Patients should inform physicians and \ndentists that they are taking clopidogrel before any surgery is scheduled and before any new medicinal \nproduct is taken. Clopidogrel prolongs bleeding time and should be used with caution in patients who \nhave lesions with a propensity to bleed (particularly gastrointestinal and intraocular). \n \nPatients should be told that it might take longer than usual to stop bleeding when they take clopidogrel \n(alone or in combination with ASA), and that they should report any unusual bleeding (site or \nduration) to their physician. \n \nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) \nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been reported very rarely following the use of \nclopidogrel, sometimes after a short exposure. It is characterised by thrombocytopenia and \nmicroangiopathic haemolytic anaemia associated with either neurological findings, renal dysfunction \nor fever. TTP is a potentially fatal condition requiring prompt treatment including plasmapheresis. \n \nAcquired haemophilia \nAcquired haemophilia has been reported following use of clopidogrel. In cases of confirmed isolated \nactivated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) prolongation with or without bleeding, acquired \nhaemophilia should be considered. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of acquired haemophilia should \nbe managed and treated by specialists, and clopidogrel should be discontinued. \n \n \nRecent ischaemic stroke \nIn view of the lack of data, clopidogrel cannot be recommended during the first 7 days after acute \nischaemic stroke. \n \nCytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) \nPharmacogenetics: In patients who are poor CYP2C19 metabolisers, clopidogrel at recommended \ndoses forms less of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and has a smaller effect on platelet function. \nTests are available to identify a patient's CYP2C19 genotype. \n \nSince clopidogrel is metabolised to its active metabolite partly by CYP2C19, use of medicinal \nproducts that inhibit the activity of this enzyme would be expected to result in reduced drug levels of \nthe active metabolite of clopidogrel. The clinical relevance of this interaction is uncertain. As a \nprecaution concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP2C19 inhibitors should be discouraged (see \nsection 4.5 for a list of CYP2C19 inhibitors, see also section 5.2). \n \nCYP2C8 substrates \nCaution is required in patients treated concomitantly with clopidogrel and CYP2C8 substrate \nmedicinal products (see section 4.5). \n \nCross-reactions among thienopyridines \nPatients should be evaluated for history of hypersensitivity to thienopyridines (such as clopidogrel, \nticlopidine, prasugrel) since cross-reactivity among thienopyridines has been reported (see section 4.8). \nThienopyridines may cause mild to severe allergic reactions such as rash, angioedema, or \nhaematological cross-reactions such as thrombocytopaenia and neutropaenia. Patients who had \ndeveloped a previous monitored allergic reaction and/or haematological reaction to one thienopyridine \nmay have an increased risk of developing the same or another reaction to another thienopyridine. \nMonitoring for signs of hypersensitivity in patients with a known allergy to thienopyridines is advised. \n \nRenal impairment \n\n4 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\nTherapeutic experience with clopidogrel is limited in patients with renal impairment. Therefore \nclopidogrel should be used with caution in these patients (see section 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nExperience is limited in patients with moderate hepatic disease who may have bleeding diatheses. \nClopidogrel should therefore be used with caution in this population (see section 4.2). \n \nExcipients \nThis medicinal product contains hydrogenated castor oil which may cause stomach upset and \ndiarrhoea. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nMedicinal products associated with bleeding risk: There is an increased risk of bleeding due to the \npotential additive effect. The concomitant administration of medicinal products associated with \nbleeding risk should be undertaken with caution (see section 4.4). \n \nOral anticoagulants: the concomitant administration of clopidogrel with oral anticoagulants is not \nrecommended since it may increase the intensity of bleedings (see section 4.4). Although the \nadministration of clopidogrel 75 mg/day did not modify the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin or \nInternational Normalised Ratio (INR) in patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy, \ncoadministration of clopidogrel with warfarin increases the risk of bleeding because of independent \neffects on hemostasis. \n \nGlycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors: clopidogrel should be used with caution in patients who receive \nconcomitant glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (see section 4.4). \n \nAcetylsalicylic acid (ASA): ASA did not modify the clopidogrel-mediated inhibition of ADP-induced \nplatelet aggregation, but clopidogrel potentiated the effect of ASA on collagen-induced platelet \naggregation. However, concomitant administration of 500 mg of ASA twice a day for one day did not \nsignificantly increase the prolongation of bleeding time induced by clopidogrel intake. A \npharmacodynamic interaction between clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid is possible, leading to \nincreased risk of bleeding. Therefore, concomitant use should be undertaken with caution (see \nsection 4.4). However, clopidogrel and ASA have been administered together for up to one year (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nHeparin: in a clinical study conducted in healthy subjects, clopidogrel did not necessitate modification \nof the heparin dose or alter the effect of heparin on coagulation. Co-administration of heparin had no \neffect on the inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by clopidogrel. A pharmacodynamic \ninteraction between clopidogrel and heparin is possible, leading to increased risk of bleeding. \nTherefore, concomitant use should be undertaken with caution (see section 4.4). \n \nThrombolytics: the safety of the concomitant administration of clopidogrel, fibrin or non-fibrin \nspecific thrombolytic agents and heparins was assessed in patients with acute myocardial infarction. \nThe incidence of clinically significant bleeding was similar to that observed when thrombolytic agents \nand heparin are co-administered with ASA (see section 4.8). \n \nNSAIDs: in a clinical study conducted in healthy volunteers, the concomitant administration of \nclopidogrel and naproxen increased occult gastrointestinal blood loss. However, due to the lack of \ninteraction studies with other NSAIDs it is presently unclear whether there is an increased risk of \ngastrointestinal bleeding with all NSAIDs. Consequently, NSAIDs including Cox-2 inhibitors and \nclopidogrel should be co-administered with caution (see section 4.4). \n \nSSRIs: since SSRIs affect platelet activation and increase the risk of bleeding, the concomitant \nadministration of SSRIs with clopidogrel should be undertaken with caution. \n \n\n5 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\nOther concomitant therapy: Since clopidogrel is metabolised to its active metabolite partly by \nCYP2C19, use of medicinal products that inhibit the activity of this enzyme would be expected to \nresult in reduced drug levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel. The clinical relevance of this \ninteraction is uncertain. As a precaution concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP2C19 inhibitors \nshould be discouraged (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nMedicinal products that are strong or moderate CYP2C19 inhibitors include, for example, omeprazole \nand esomeprazole, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, moclobemide, voriconazole, fluconazole, ticlopidine, \ncarbamazepine, and efavirenz. \n \nProton Pump Inhibitors (PPI):  \nOmeprazole 80 mg once daily administered either at the same time as clopidogrel or with 12 hours \nbetween the administrations of the two drugs decreased the exposure of the active metabolite by 45% \n(loading dose) and 40% (maintenance dose). The decrease was associated with a 39% (loading dose) \nand 21% (maintenance dose) reduction of inhibition of platelet aggregation. Esomeprazole is expected \nto give a similar interaction with clopidogrel. \n \nInconsistent data on the clinical implications of this pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) \ninteraction in terms of major cardiovascular events have been reported from both observational and \nclinical studies. As a precaution, concomitant use of omeprazole or esomeprazole should be \ndiscouraged (see section 4.4). \n \nLess pronounced reductions of metabolite exposure has been observed with pantoprazole or \nlansoprazole. \nThe plasma concentrations of the active metabolite was 20% reduced (loading dose) and 14% reduced \n(maintenance dose) during concomitant treatment with pantoprazole 80 mg once daily. This was \nassociated with a reduction of the mean inhibition of platelet aggregation by 15% and 11%, \nrespectively. These results indicate that clopidogrel can be administered with pantoprazole. \n \nThere is no evidence that other medicinal products that reduce stomach acid such as H2 blockers or \nantacids interfere with antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel. \n \nOther medicinal products: A number of other clinical studies have been conducted with clopidogrel \nand other concomitant medicinal products to investigate the potential for pharmacodynamic and \npharmacokinetic interactions. No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed \nwhen clopidogrel was co-administered with atenolol, nifedipine, or both atenolol and nifedipine. \nFurthermore, the pharmacodynamic activity of clopidogrel was not significantly influenced by the \ncoadministration of phenobarbital or oestrogen. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of digoxin or theophylline were not modified by the co-administration of \nclopidogrel. Antacids did not modify the extent of clopidogrel absorption. \n \nData from the CAPRIE study indicate that phenytoin and tolbutamide which are metabolised by \nCYP2C9 can be safely co-administered with clopidogrel. \n \nCYP2C8 substrate medicinal products: Clopidogrel has been shown to increase repaglinide exposure \nin healthy volunteers. In vitro studies have shown the increase in repaglinide exposure is due to \ninhibition of CYP2C8 by the glucuronide metabolite of clopidogrel. Due to the risk of increased \nplasma concentrations, concomitant administration of clopidogrel and drugs primarily cleared by \nCYP2C8 metabolism (e.g., repaglinide, paclitaxel) should be undertaken with caution (see section 4.4). \n \nApart from the specific medicinal product interaction information described above, interaction studies \nwith clopidogrel and some medicinal products commonly administered in patients with \natherothrombotic disease have not been performed. However, patients entered into clinical trials with \nclopidogrel received a variety of concomitant medicinal products including diuretics, beta blockers, \nACEI, calcium antagonists, cholesterol lowering agents, coronary vasodilators, antidiabetic agents \n\n6 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n(including insulin), antiepileptic agents, and GPIIb/IIIa antagonists without evidence of clinically \nsignificant adverse interactions. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nAs no clinical data on exposure to clopidogrel during pregnancy are available, it is preferable not to \nuse clopidogrel during pregnancy as a precautionary measure.  \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, \nembryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether clopidogrel is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of clopidogrel in breast milk. As a precautionary measure, breast-feeding should not be \ncontinued during treatment with Clopidogrel Teva Pharma. \n \nFertility \nClopidogrel was not shown to alter fertility in animal studies. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nClopidogrel has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nClopidogrel has been evaluated for safety in more than 44,000 patients, who have participated in \nclinical studies, including over 12,000 patients treated for 1 year or more. Overall, clopidogrel \n75 mg/day was comparable to ASA 325 mg/day in CAPRIE regardless of age, gender and race. The \nclinically relevant adverse reactions observed in the CAPRIE, CURE, CLARITY, COMMIT and \nACTIVE-A studies are discussed below. In addition to clinical studies experience, adverse reactions \nhave been spontaneously reported. \n \nBleeding is the most common reaction reported both in clinical studies as well as in post-marketing \nexperience where it was mostly reported during the first month of treatment. \n \nIn CAPRIE, in patients treated with either clopidogrel or ASA, the overall incidence of any bleeding \nwas 9.3%. The incidence of severe cases was similar for clopidogrel and ASA.  \n \nIn CURE, there was no excess in major bleeds with clopidogrel plus ASA within 7 days after coronary \nbypass graft surgery in patients who stopped therapy more than five days prior to surgery. In patients \nwho remained on therapy within five days of bypass graft surgery, the event rate was 9.6% for \nclopidogrel plus ASA, and 6.3% for placebo plus ASA. \n \nIn CLARITY, there was an overall increase in bleeding in the clopidogrel plus ASA group vs. the \nplacebo plus ASA group. The incidence of major bleeding was similar between groups. This was \nconsistent across subgroups of patients defined by baseline characteristics, and type of fibrinolytic or \nheparin therapy.  \n \nIn COMMIT, the overall rate of noncerebral major bleeding or cerebral bleeding was low and similar \nin both groups. \n \nIn ACTIVE-A, the rate of major bleeding was greater in the clopidogrel + ASA group than in the \nplacebo + ASA group (6.7% versus 4.3%). Major bleeding was mostly of extracranial origin in both \ngroups (5.3% in the clopidogrel + ASA group; 3.5% in the placebo +ASA group), mainly from the \n\n7 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\ngastrointestinal tract (3.5% vs. 1.8%). There was an excess of intracranial bleeding in the clopidogrel \n+ ASA treatment group compared to the placebo + ASA group (1.4% versus 0.8%, respectively). \nThere was no statistically significant difference in the rates of fatal bleeding (1.1% in the clopidogrel + \nASA group and 0.7% in the placebo +ASA group) and haemorrhagic stroke (0.8% and 0.6%, \nrespectively) between groups. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions that occurred either during clinical studies or that were spontaneously reported are \npresented in the table below. Their frequency is defined using the following conventions: common (\uf0b3 \n1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\uf0b3 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\uf0b31/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, platelet aggregation inhibitors excl. heparin, ATC \nCode: B01AC-04.  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nClopidogrel is a prodrug, one of whose metabolites is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel \nmust be metabolised by CYP450 enzymes to produce the active metabolite that inhibits platelet \naggregation. The active metabolite of clopidogrel selectively inhibits the binding of adenosine \ndiphosphate (ADP) to its platelet P2Y12 receptor and the subsequent ADP-mediated activation of the \nglycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation. Due to the irreversible \nbinding, platelets exposed are affected for the remainder of their lifespan (approximately 7-10 days) \nand recovery of normal platelet function occurs at a rate consistent with platelet turnover. Platelet \naggregation induced by agonists other than ADP is also inhibited by blocking the amplification of \nplatelet activation by released ADP. \n \nBecause the active metabolite is formed by CYP450 enzymes, some of which are polymorphic or \nsubject to inhibition by other medicinal products, not all patients will have adequate platelet inhibition. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nRepeated doses of 75 mg per day produced substantial inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation \nfrom the first day; this increased progressively and reached steady state between Day 3 and Day 7. At \nsteady state, the average inhibition level observed with a dose of 75 mg per day was between 40% and \n60%. Platelet aggregation and bleeding time gradually returned to baseline values, generally within \n5 days after treatment was discontinued. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe safety and efficacy of clopidogrel have been evaluated in 5 double-blind studies involving over \n88,000 patients: the CAPRIE study, a comparison of clopidogrel to ASA, and the CURE, CLARITY, \nCOMMIT and ACTIVE-A studies comparing clopidogrel to placebo, both medicinal products given in \ncombination with ASA and other standard therapy. \n \nRecent myocardial infarction (MI), recent stroke or established peripheral arterial disease \n \nThe CAPRIE study included 19,185 patients with atherothrombosis as manifested by recent \nmyocardial infarction (<35 days), recent ischaemic stroke (between 7 days and 6 months) or \nestablished peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Patients were randomised to clopidogrel 75 mg/day or \nASA 325 mg/day, and were followed for 1 to 3 years. In the myocardial infarction subgroup, most of \nthe patients received ASA for the first few days following the acute myocardial infarction. \n \n\n11 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\nClopidogrel significantly reduced the incidence of new ischaemic events (combined end point of \nmyocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and vascular death) when compared to ASA. In the intention \nto treat analysis, 939 events were observed in the clopidogrel group and 1,020 events with ASA \n(relative risk reduction (RRR) 8.7%, [95% CI: 0.2 to 16.4]; p=0.045), which corresponds, for every \n1000 patients treated for 2 years, to 10 [CI: 0 to 20] additional patients being prevented from \nexperiencing a new ischaemic event. Analysis of total mortality as a secondary endpoint did not show \nany significant difference between clopidogrel (5.8%) and ASA (6.0%). \n \nIn a subgroup analysis by qualifying condition (myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, and PAD) the \nbenefit appeared to be strongest (achieving statistical significance at p=0.003) in patients enrolled due \nto PAD (especially those who also had a history of myocardial infarction) (RRR = 23.7%; CI: 8.9 to \n36.2) and weaker (not significantly different from ASA) in stroke patients (RRR = 7.3%; CI: -5.7 to \n18.7 [p=0.258]). In patients who were enrolled in the trial on the sole basis of a recent myocardial \ninfarction, clopidogrel was numerically inferior, but not statistically different from ASA (RRR = -\n4.0%; CI: -22.5 to 11.7 [p=0.639]). In addition, a subgroup analysis by age suggested that the benefit \nof clopidogrel in patients over 75 years was less than that observed in patients \u226475 years. \n \nSince the CAPRIE trial was not powered to evaluate efficacy of individual subgroups, it is not clear \nwhether the differences in relative risk reduction across qualifying conditions are real, or a result of \nchance. \n \nAcute coronary syndrome \n \nThe CURE study included 12,562 patients with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome \n(unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction), and presenting within 24 hours of onset of the \nmost recent episode of chest pain or symptoms consistent with ischaemia. Patients were required to \nhave either ECG changes compatible with new ischaemia or elevated cardiac enzymes or troponin I or \nT to at least twice the upper limit of normal. Patients were randomised to clopidogrel (300 mg loading \ndose followed by 75 mg/day, N=6,259) or placebo (N=6,303), both given in combination with ASA \n(75-325 mg once daily) and other standard therapies. Patients were treated for up to one year. In \nCURE, 823 (6.6%) patients received concomitant GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist therapy. Heparins \nwere administered in more than 90% of the patients and the relative rate of bleeding between \nclopidogrel and placebo was not significantly affected by the concomitant heparin therapy.  \n \nThe number of patients experiencing the primary endpoint [cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial \ninfarction (MI), or stroke] was 582 (9.3%) in the clopidogrel-treated group and 719 (11.4%) in the \nplacebo-treated group, a 20% relative risk reduction (95% CI of 10%-28%; p=0.00009) for the \nclopidogrel-treated group (17% relative risk reduction when patients were treated conservatively, 29% \nwhen they underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with or without stent \nand 10% when they underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)). New cardiovascular events \n(primary endpoint) were prevented, with relative risk reductions of 22% (CI: 8.6, 33.4), 32% (CI: 12.8, \n46.4), 4% (CI: -26.9, 26.7), 6% (CI: -33.5, 34.3) and 14% (CI: -31.6, 44.2), during the 0-1, 1-3, 3-6, \n6-9 and 9-12 month study intervals, respectively. Thus, beyond 3 months of treatment, the benefit \nobserved in the clopidogrel + ASA group was not further increased, whereas the risk of haemorrhage \npersisted (see section 4.4).  \n \nThe use of clopidogrel in CURE was associated with a decrease in the need of thrombolytic therapy \n(RRR = 43.3%; CI: 24.3%, 57.5%) and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (RRR = 18.2%; CI: 6.5%, 28.3%). \n \nThe number of patients experiencing the co-primary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke or refractory \nischaemia) was 1,035 (16.5%) in the clopidogrel-treated group and 1,187 (18.8%) in the \nplacebo-treated group, a 14% relative risk reduction (95% CI of 6%-21%, p=0.0005) for the \nclopidogrel-treated group. This benefit was mostly driven by the statistically significant reduction in \nthe incidence of MI [287 (4.6%) in the clopidogrel treated group and 363 (5.8%) in the placebo treated \ngroup]. There was no observed effect on the rate of rehospitalisation for unstable angina. \n \n\n12 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\nThe results obtained in populations with different characteristics (e.g. unstable angina or non-Q-wave \nMI, low to high risk levels, diabetes, need for revascularisation, age, gender, etc.) were consistent with \nthe results of the primary analysis. In particular, in a post-hoc analysis in 2,172 patients (17% of the \ntotal CURE population) who underwent stent placement (Stent-CURE), the data showed that \nclopidogrel compared to placebo, demonstrated a significant RRR of 26.2% favouring clopidogrel for \nthe co-primary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke) and also a significant RRR of 23.9% for the second \nco-primary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke or refractory ischaemia). Moreover, the safety profile of \nclopidogrel in this subgroup of patients did not raise any particular concern. Thus, the results from this \nsubset are in line with the overall trial results.  \n \nThe benefits observed with clopidogrel were independent of other acute and long-term cardiovascular \ntherapies (such as heparin/LMWH, GPIIb/IIIa antagonists, lipid lowering medicinal products, beta \nblockers, and ACE-inhibitors). The efficacy of clopidogrel was observed independently of the dose of \nASA (75-325 mg once daily). \n \nIn patients with acute ST-segment elevation MI, safety and efficacy of clopidogrel have been \nevaluated in 2 randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, CLARITY and COMMIT. \n \nThe CLARITY trial included 3,491 patients presenting within 12 hours of the onset of a ST elevation \nMI and planned for thrombolytic therapy. Patients received clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose, \nfollowed by 75 mg/day, n=1,752) or placebo (n=1,739), both in combination with ASA (150 to \n325 mg as a loading dose, followed by 75 to 162 mg/day), a fibrinolytic agent and, when appropriate, \nheparin. The patients were followed for 30 days. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of the \ncomposite of an occluded infarct-related artery on the predischarge angiogram, or death or recurrent \nMI before coronary angiography. For patients who did not undergo angiography, the primary endpoint \nwas death or recurrent myocardial infarction by Day 8 or by hospital discharge. The patient population \nincluded 19.7% women and 29.2% patients \u2265 65 years. A total of 99.7% of patients received \nfibrinolytics (fibrin specific: 68.7%, non-fibrin specific: 31.1%), 89.5% heparin, 78.7% beta blockers, \n54.7% ACE inhibitors and 63% statins. \n \nFifteen percent (15.0%) of patients in the clopidogrel group and 21.7% in the placebo group reached \nthe primary endpoint, representing an absolute reduction of 6.7% and a 36 % odds reduction in favor \nof clopidogrel (95% CI: 24, 47%; p < 0.001), mainly related to a reduction in occluded infarct-related \narteries. This benefit was consistent across all prespecified subgroups including patients\u2019 age and \ngender, infarct location, and type of fibrinolytic or heparin used. \n \nThe 2x2 factorial design COMMIT trial included 45,852 patients presenting within 24 hours of the \nonset of the symptoms of suspected MI with supporting ECG abnormalities (i.e. ST elevation, ST \ndepression or left bundle-branch block). Patients received clopidogrel (75 mg/day, n=22,961) or \nplacebo (n=22,891), in combination with ASA (162 mg/day), for 28 days or until hospital discharge. \nThe co-primary endpoints were death from any cause and the first occurrence of re-infarction, stroke \nor death. The population included 27.8% women, 58.4% patients \u2265 60 years (26% \u2265 70 years) and \n54.5% patients who received fibrinolytics. \n \nClopidogrel significantly reduced the relative risk of death from any cause by 7% (p=0.029), and the \nrelative risk of the combination of re-infarction, stroke or death by 9% (p=0.002), representing an \nabsolute reduction of 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively. This benefit was consistent across age, gender and \nwith or without fibrinolytics, and was observed as early as 24 hours. \n \nAtrial fibrillation \n \nThe ACTIVE-W and ACTIVE-A studies, separate trials in the ACTIVE program, included patients \nwith atrial fibrillation (AF) who had at least one risk factor for vascular events. Based on enrollment \ncriteria, physicians enrolled patients in ACTIVE-W if they were candidates for vitamin K antagonist \n(VKA) therapy (such as warfarin). The ACTIVE-A study included patients who could not receive \nVKA therapy because they were unable or unwilling to receive the treatment. \n\n13 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \nThe ACTIVE-W study demonstrated that anticoagulant treatment with vitamin K antagonists was \nmore effective than with clopidogrel and ASA. \n \nThe ACTIVE-A study (N=7,554) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled \nstudy which compared clopidogrel 75 mg/day + ASA (N=3,772) to placebo + ASA (N=3,782). The \nrecommended dose for ASA was 75 to 100 mg/day. Patients were treated for up to 5 years. \n \nPatients randomized in the ACTIVE program were those presenting with documented AF, i.e., either \npermanent AF or at least 2 episodes of intermittent AF in the past 6 months, and had at least one of the \nfollowing risk factors: age \uf0b375 years or age 55 to 74 years and either diabetes mellitus requiring drug \ntherapy, or documented previous MI or documented coronary artery disease; treated for systemic \nhypertension; prior stroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA), or non-CNS systemic embolus; left \nventricular dysfunction with left ventricular ejection fraction <45%; or documented peripheral \nvascular disease. The mean CHADS2 score was 2.0 (range 0-6). \n \nThe major exclusion criteria for patients were documented peptic ulcer disease within the previous \n6 months; prior intracerebral hemorrhage; significant thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50 x 109/l); \nrequirement for clopidogrel or oral anticoagulants (OAC); or intolerance to any of the two compounds. \n \nSeventy-three percent (73%) of patients enrolled into the ACTIVE-A study were unable to take VKA \ndue to physician assessment, inability to comply with INR (international normalised ratio) monitoring, \npredisposition to falling or head trauma, or specific risk of bleeding; for 26% of the patients, the \nphysician\u2019s decision was based on the patient\u2019s unwillingness to take VKA.  \n \nThe patient population included 41.8 % women. The mean age was 71 years, 41.6% of patients were \n\u226575 years. A total of 23.0% of patients received anti-arrhythmics, 52.1% beta-blockers, 54.6% ACE \ninhibitors, and 25.4% statins. \n \nThe number of patients who reached the primary endpoint (time to first occurrence of stroke, MI, \nnon-CNS systemic embolism or vascular death) was 832 (22.1%) in the group treated with clopidogrel \n+ ASA and 924 (24.4%) in the placebo + ASA group (relative risk reduction of 11.1%; 95% CI of \n2.4% to 19.1%; p=0.013), primarily due to a large reduction in the incidence of strokes. Strokes \noccurred in 296 (7.8%) patients receiving clopidogrel + ASA and 408 (10.8%) patients receiving \nplacebo + ASA (relative risk reduction, 28.4%; 95% CI, 16.8% to 38.3%; p=0.00001).  \n \nPaediatric population \nIn a dose escalation study of 86 neonates or infants up to 24 months of age at risk for thrombosis \n(PICOLO), clopidogrel was evaluated at consecutive doses of 0.01, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg in neonates and \ninfants and 0.15 mg/kg only in neonates. The dose of 0.2 mg/kg achieved the mean percent inhibition \nof 49.3% (5 \u00b5M ADP-induced platelet aggregation) which was comparable to that of adults taking \nClopidogrel 75 mg/day. \n \nIn a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study (CLARINET), 906 paediatric patients (neonates \nand infants) with cyanotic congenital heart disease palliated with a systemic-to-pulmonary arterial \nshunt were randomised to receive clopidogrel 0.2 mg/kg (n=467) or placebo (n=439) along with \nconcomitant background therapy up to the time of second stage surgery. The mean time between shunt \npalliation and first administration of study medicinal product was 20 days. Approximately 88% of \npatients received concomitant ASA (range of 1 to 23 mg/kg/day). There was no significant difference \nbetween groups in the primary composite endpoint of death, shunt thrombosis or cardiac-related \nintervention prior to 120 days of age following an event considered of thrombotic nature (89 [19.1%] \nfor the clopidogrel group and 90 [20.5%] for the placebo group) (see section 4.2). Bleeding was the \nmost frequently reported adverse reaction in both clopidogrel and placebo groups; however, there was \nno significant difference in the bleeding rate between groups. In the long-term safety follow-up of this \nstudy, 26 patients with the shunt still in place at one year of age received clopidogrel up to 18 months \nof age. No new safety concerns were noted during this long-term follow-up. \n\n14 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n \nThe CLARINET and the PICOLO trials were conducted using a constituted solution of clopidogrel. In \na relative bioavailability study in adults, the constituted solution of clopidogrel showed a similar extent \nand slightly higher rate of absorption of the main circulating (inactive) metabolite compared to the \nauthorised tablet. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption  \nAfter single and repeated oral doses of 75 mg per day, clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed. Mean peak \nplasma levels of unchanged clopidogrel (approximately 2.2-2.5 ng/ml after a single 75 mg oral dose) \noccurred approximately 45 minutes after dosing. Absorption is at least 50%, based on urinary \nexcretion of clopidogrel metabolites.  \n \nDistribution \nClopidogrel and the main circulating (inactive) metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma \nproteins (98 % and 94 % respectively). The binding is non-saturable in vitro over a wide concentration \nrange.  \n \nBiotransformation \nClopidogrel is extensively metabolised by the liver. In vitro and in vivo, clopidogrel is metabolised \naccording to two main metabolic pathways: one mediated by esterases and leading to hydrolysis into \nits inactive carboxylic acid derivative (85% of circulating metabolites), and one mediated by multiple \ncytochromes P450. Clopidogrel is first metabolised to a 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite. \nSubsequent metabolism of the 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite results in formation of the \nactive metabolite, a thiol derivative of clopidogrel. The active metabolite is formed mostly by \nCYP2C19 with contributions from several other CYP enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and \nCYP3A4. The active thiol metabolite which has been isolated in vitro, binds rapidly and irreversibly to \nplatelet receptors, thus inhibiting platelet aggregation. \n \nThe Cmax of the active metabolite is twice as high following a single 300-mg clopidogrel loading dose \nas it is after four days of 75-mg maintenance dose. Cmax occurs approximately 30 to 60 minutes after \ndosing.  \n \nElimination  \nFollowing an oral dose of 14C-labelled clopidogrel in man, approximately 50% was excreted in the \nurine and approximately 46% in the faeces in the 120-hour interval after dosing. After a single oral \ndose of 75 mg, clopidogrel has a half-life of approximately 6 hours. The elimination halflife of the \nmain circulating (inactive) metabolite was 8 hours after single and repeated administration. \n \nPharmacogenetics \nCYP2C19 is involved in the formation of both the active metabolite and the 2-oxo-clopidogrel \nintermediate metabolite. Clopidogrel active metabolite pharmacokinetics and antiplatelet effects, as \nmeasured by ex vivo platelet aggregation assays, differ according to CYP2C19 genotype.  \n \nThe CYP2C19*1 allele corresponds to fully functional metabolism while the CYP2C19*2 and \nCYP2C19*3 alleles are nonfunctional. The CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 alleles account for the \nmajority of reduced function alleles in Caucasian (85%) and Asian (99%) poor metabolisers. Other \nalleles associated with absent or reduced metabolism are less frequent and include CYP2C19*4, *5, \n*6, *7, and *8. A patient with poor metaboliser status will possess two loss-of-function alleles as \ndefined above. Published frequencies for the poor CYP2C19 metaboliser genotypes are approximately \n2% for Caucasians, 4% for Blacks and 14% for Chinese. Tests are available to determine a patient\u2019s \nCYP2C19 genotype.  \n \nA crossover study in 40 healthy subjects, 10 each in the four CYP2C19 metaboliser groups (ultrarapid, \nextensive, intermediate and poor), evaluated pharmacokinetic and antiplatelet responses using 300 mg \n\n15 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\nfollowed by 75 mg/day and 600 mg followed by 150 mg/day, each for a total of 5 days (steady state). \nNo substantial differences in active metabolite exposure and mean inhibition of platelet aggregation \n(IPA) were observed between ultrarapid, extensive and intermediate metabolisers. In poor \nmetabolisers, active metabolite exposure was decreased by 63-71% compared to extensive \nmetabolisers. After the 300 mg/75 mg dose regimen, antiplatelet responses were decreased in the poor \nmetabolisers with mean IPA (5 \u03bcM ADP) of 24% (24 hours) and 37% (Day 5) as compared to IPA of \n39% (24 hours) and 58% (Day 5) in the extensive metabolisers and 37% (24 hours) and 60% (Day 5) \nin the intermediate metabolisers. When poor metabolisers received the 600 mg/150 mg regimen, active \nmetabolite exposure was greater than with the 300 mg/75 mg regimen. In addition, IPA was 32% \n(24 hours) and 61% (Day 5), which were greater than in the poor metabolisers receiving the \n300 mg/75 mg regimen, and were similar to the other CYP2C19 metaboliser groups receiving the \n300 mg/75 mg regimen. An appropriate dose regimen for this patient population has not been \nestablished in clinical outcome trials. \n \nConsistent with the above results, in a meta-analysis including 6 studies of 335 clopidogrel-treated \nsubjects at steady state, it was shown that active metabolite exposure was decreased by 28% for \nintermediate metabolisers, and 72% for poor metabolisers while platelet aggregation inhibition (5 \u03bcM \nADP) was decreased with differences in IPA of 5.9% and 21.4%, respectively, when compared to \nextensive metabolisers. \n \nThe influence of CYP2C19 genotype on clinical outcomes in patients treated with clopidogrel has not \nbeen evaluated in prospective, randomised, controlled trials. There have been a number of \nretrospective analyses, however, to evaluate this effect in patients treated with clopidogrel for whom \nthere are genotyping results: CURE (n=2721), CHARISMA (n=2428), CLARITY-TIMI 28 (n=227), \nTRITON-TIMI 38 (n=1477), and ACTIVE-A (n=601), as well as a number of published cohort \nstudies. \n \nIn TRITON-TIMI 38 and 3 of the cohort studies (Collet, Sibbing, Giusti) the combined group of \npatients with either intermediate or poor metaboliser status had a higher rate of cardiovascular events \n(death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) or stent thrombosis compared to extensive metabolisers. \n \nIn CHARISMA and one cohort study (Simon), an increased event rate was observed only in poor \nmetabolisers when compared to extensive metabolisers. \n \nIn CURE, CLARITY, ACTIVE-A and one of the cohort studies (Trenk), no increased event rate was \nobserved based on metaboliser status. \n \nNone of these analyses were adequately sized to detect differences in outcome in poor metabolisers. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite of clopidogrel is not known in these special populations. \n \nRenal impairment \nAfter repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day in subjects with severe renal disease (creatinine \nclearance from 5 to 15 ml/min), inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was lower (25%) than \nthat observed in healthy subjects, however, the prolongation of bleeding time was similar to that seen \nin healthy subjects receiving 75 mg of clopidogrel per day. In addition, clinical tolerance was good in \nall patients. \n \nHepatic impairment \nAfter repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day for 10 days in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment, inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was similar to that observed in healthy \nsubjects. The mean bleeding time prolongation was also similar in the two groups.  \n \nRace \n\n16 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\nThe prevalence of CYP2C19 alleles that result in intermediate and poor CYP2C19 metabolism differs \naccording to race/ethnicity (see Pharmacogenetics). From literature, limited data in Asian populations \nare available to assess the clinical implication of genotyping of this CYP on clinical outcome events. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nDuring non clinical studies in rat and baboon, the most frequently observed effects were liver changes. \nThese occurred at doses representing at least 25 times the exposure seen in humans receiving the \nclinical dose of 75 mg/day and were a consequence of an effect on hepatic metabolising enzymes. No \neffect on hepatic metabolising enzymes was observed in humans receiving clopidogrel at the \ntherapeutic dose. \n \nAt very high doses, a poor gastric tolerability (gastritis, gastric erosions and/or vomiting) of \nclopidogrel was also reported in rat and baboon.  \n \nThere was no evidence of carcinogenic effect when clopidogrel was administered for 78 weeks to \nmice and 104 weeks to rats when given at doses up to 77 mg/kg per day (representing at least 25 times \nthe exposure seen in humans receiving the clinical dose of 75 mg/day). \n \nClopidogrel has been tested in a range of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies, and showed no \ngenotoxic activity.  \n \nClopidogrel was found to have no effect on the fertility of male and female rats and was not \nteratogenic in either rats or rabbits. When given to lactating rats, clopidogrel caused a slight delay in \nthe development of the offspring. Specific pharmacokinetic studies performed with radiolabelled \nclopidogrel have shown that the parent compound or its metabolites are excreted in the milk. \nConsequently, a direct effect (slight toxicity), or an indirect effect (low palatability) cannot be \nexcluded. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you have any of the side effects, including any side effects not listed in this leaflet, talk to \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist.

How to take Clopidogrel Teva Pharma  \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Clopidogrel Teva Pharma  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Clopidogrel Teva Pharma is and what it is used for  \n \nClopidogrel Teva Pharma contains clopidogrel and belongs to a group of medicines called antiplatelet \nmedicinal products. Platelets are very small structures in the blood, which clump together during blood \nclotting. By preventing this clumping, antiplatelet medicinal products reduce the chances of blood \nclots forming (a process called thrombosis). \n \nClopidogrel Teva Pharma is taken by adults to prevent blood clots (thrombi) forming in hardened \nblood vessels (arteries), a process known as atherothrombosis, which can lead to atherothrombotic \nevents (such as stroke, heart attack, or death). \n \nYou have been prescribed Clopidogrel Teva Pharma to help prevent blood clots and reduce the risk of \nthese severe events because: \n- You have a condition of hardening of arteries (also known as atherosclerosis), and \n- You have previously experienced a heart attack, stroke or have a condition known as peripheral \n\narterial disease, or \n- You have experienced a severe type of chest pain known as \u2018unstable angina\u2019 or \u2018myocardial \n\ninfarction\u2019 (heart attack). For the treatment of this condition your doctor may have placed a stent \nin the blocked or narrowed artery to restore effective blood flow. You should also be given \nacetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain and lower fever \nas well as to prevent blood clotting) by your doctor. \n\n- You have an irregular heartbeat, a condition called \u2018atrial fibrillation\u2019, and you cannot take \nmedicines known as \u2018oral anticoagulants\u2019 (vitamin K antagonists) which prevent new clots from \nforming and prevent existing clots from growing. You should have been told that \u2018oral \nanticoagulants\u2019 are more effective than acetylsalicylic acid or the combined use of Clopidogrel \nTeva Pharma and acetylsalicylic acid for this condition. Your doctor should have prescribed \nClopidogrel Teva Pharma plus acetylsalicylic acid if you cannot take \u2018oral anticoagulants\u2019 and \nyou do not have a risk of major bleeding \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Clopidogrel Teva Pharma  \n \n\n29 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\nDo not take Clopidogrel Teva Pharma  \n\uf0b7 If you are allergic to clopidogrel or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\uf0b7 If you have a medical condition that is currently causing bleeding such as a stomach ulcer or \n\nbleeding within the brain. \n\uf0b7 If you suffer from severe liver disease. \n \nIf you think any of these apply to you, or if you are in any doubt at all, consult your doctor before \ntaking Clopidogrel Teva Pharma. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nIf any of the situations mentioned below apply to you, you should tell your doctor before taking \nClopidogrel Teva Pharma: \n\uf0b7 if you have a risk of bleeding such as \n\n- a medical condition that puts you at risk of internal bleeding (such as a stomach ulcer) \n- a blood disorder that makes you prone to internal bleeding (bleeding inside any tissues, organs \nor joints of your body). \n- a recent serious injury. \n- a recent surgery (including dental). \n- a planned surgery (including dental) in the next seven days. \n\n\uf0b7 if you have had a clot in an artery of your brain (ischaemic stroke) which occurred within the \nlast seven days. \n\n\uf0b7 if you have kidney or liver disease. \n\uf0b7 if you have had an allergy or reaction to any medicine used to treat your disease. \n \nWhile you are taking Clopidogrel Teva Pharma: \n\uf0b7 You should tell your doctor if a surgery (including dental) is planned. \n\uf0b7 You should also tell your doctor immediately if you develop a medical condition (also known as \n\nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura or TTP) that includes fever and bruising under the skin \nthat may appear as red pinpoint dots, with or without unexplained extreme tiredness, confusion, \nyellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice) (see section 4 \u2018Possible side effects\u2019). \n\n\uf0b7 If you cut or injure yourself, it may take longer than usual for bleeding to stop. This is linked to \nthe way your medicine works as it prevents the ability of blood clots to form. For minor cuts \nand injuries e.g., cutting yourself, shaving, this is usually of no concern. However, if you are \nconcerned by your bleeding, you should contact your doctor straightaway (see section 4 \n\u2018Possible side effects\u2019). \n\n\uf0b7 Your doctor may order blood tests. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children because it does not work. \n  \nOther medicines and Clopidogrel Teva Pharma \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \nSome other medicines may influence the use of Clopidogrel Teva Pharma or vice versa.  \n \nYou should specifically tell your doctor if you take \n- medicines that may increase your risk of bleeding such as: \n\no oral anticoagulants, medicines used to reduce blood clotting, \no a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicine, usually used to treat painful and/or \n\ninflammatory conditions of muscle or joints, \no heparin or any other injectable medicine used to reduce blood clotting, \no ticlopidine, other antiplatelet agent, \no a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (including but not restricted to fluoxetine or \n\nfluvoxamine), medicines usually used to treat depression, \n- omeprazole or esomeprazole, medicines to treat upset stomach, \n\n30 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n- fluconazole or voriconazole, medicines to treat fungal infections, \n- efavirenz, a medicine to treat HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infections, \n- carbamazepine, a medicine to treat some forms of epilepsy, \n- moclobemide, medicine to treat depression, \n- repaglinide, medicine to treat diabetes, \n- paclitaxel, medicine to treat cancer. \nIf you have experienced severe chest pain (unstable angina or heart attack), you may be prescribed \nClopidogrel Teva Pharma in combination with acetylsalicylic acid, a substance present in many \nmedicines used to relieve pain and lower fever. An occasional use of acetylsalicylic acid (no more \nthan 1,000 mg in any 24 hour period) should generally not cause a problem, but prolonged use in other \ncircumstances should be discussed with your doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIt is preferable not to take this medicine during pregnancy. \n \nIf you are pregnant or suspect that you are pregnant, you should tell your doctor or your pharmacist \nbefore taking Clopidogrel Teva Pharma.

How to take Clopidogrel Teva Pharma  \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nThe recommended dose, including for patients with a condition called \u2018atrial fibrillation\u2019 (an irregular \nheartbeat), is one 75 mg tablet of Clopidogrel Teva Pharma per day to be taken orally with or without \nfood, and at the same time each day. \n \nIf you have experienced severe chest pain (unstable angina or heart attack), your doctor may give you \n300 mg of Clopidogrel Teva Pharma (4 tablets of 75 mg) once at the start of treatment. Then, the \nrecommended dose is one 75 mg tablet of Clopidogrel Teva Pharma per day as described above. \n \nYou should take Clopidogrel Teva Pharma for as long as your doctor continues to prescribe it. \n \nIf you take more Clopidogrel Teva Pharma than you should \nContact your doctor or the nearest hospital emergency department because of the increased risk of \nbleeding. \n \nIf you forget to take Clopidogrel Teva Pharma \nIf you forget to take a dose of Clopidogrel Teva Pharma, but remember within 12 hours of your usual \ntime, take your tablet straightaway and then take your next tablet at the usual time. \n \n\n31 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\nIf you forget for more than 12 hours, simply take the next single dose at the usual time.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what clopidogrel teva pharma is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "clopidogrel teva pharma contains clopidogrel and belongs to a group of medicines called antiplatelet medicinal products. platelets are very small structures in the blood, which clump together during blood clotting. by preventing this clumping, antiplatelet medicinal products reduce the chances of blood clots forming (a process called thrombosis). clopidogrel teva pharma is taken by adults to prevent blood clots (thrombi) forming in hardened blood vessels (arteries), a process known as atherothrombosis, which can lead to atherothrombotic events (such as stroke, heart attack, or death). you have been prescribed clopidogrel teva pharma to help prevent blood clots and reduce the risk of these severe events because: - you have a condition of hardening of arteries (also known as atherosclerosis), and - you have previously experienced a heart attack, stroke or have a condition known as peripheral arterial disease, or - you have experienced a severe type of chest pain known as 'unstable angina' or 'myocardial infarction' (heart attack). for the treatment of this condition your doctor may have placed a stent in the blocked or narrowed artery to restore effective blood flow. you should also be given acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain and lower fever as well as to prevent blood clotting) by your doctor. - you have an irregular heartbeat, a condition called 'atrial fibrillation', and you cannot take medicines known as 'oral anticoagulants' (vitamin k antagonists) which prevent new clots from forming and prevent existing clots from growing. you should have been told that 'oral anticoagulants' are more effective than acetylsalicylic acid or the combined use of clopidogrel teva pharma and acetylsalicylic acid for this condition. your doctor should have prescribed clopidogrel teva pharma plus acetylsalicylic acid if you cannot take 'oral anticoagulants' and you do not have a risk of major bleeding", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "clopidogrel teva pharma", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME",

condition that is currently causing bleeding such as a stomach ulcer or bleeding within the brain. if you suffer from severe liver disease. if you think any of these apply to you, or if you are in any doubt at all, consult your doctor before taking clopidogrel teva pharma. warnings and precautions if any of the situations mentioned below apply to you, you should tell your doctor before taking clopidogrel teva pharma: if you have a risk of bleeding such as - a medical condition that puts you at risk of internal bleeding (such as a stomach ulcer) - a blood disorder that makes you prone to internal bleeding (bleeding inside any tissues, organs or joints of your body). - a recent serious injury. - a recent surgery (including dental). - a planned surgery (including dental) in the next seven days. if you have had a clot in an artery of your brain (ischaemic stroke) which occurred within the last seven days. if you have kidney or liver disease. if you have had an allergy or reaction to any medicine used to treat your disease. while you are taking clopidogrel teva pharma: you should tell your doctor if a surgery (including dental) is planned. you should also tell your doctor immediately if you develop a medical condition (also known as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or ttp) that includes fever and bruising under the skin that may appear as red pinpoint dots, with or without unexplained extreme tiredness, confusion, yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice) (see section 4 'possible side effects'). if you cut or injure yourself, it may take longer than usual for bleeding to stop. this is linked to the way your medicine works as it prevents the ability of blood clots to form. for minor cuts and injuries e.g., cutting yourself, shaving, this is usually of no concern. however, if you are concerned by your bleeding, you should contact your doctor straightaway (see section 4 'possible side effects'). your doctor may order blood tests. children and

skin and/or the eyes (jaundice), whether or not associated with bleeding which appears under the skin as red pinpoint dots and/or confusion (see section 2 'warnings and precautions'). - swelling in the mouth or skin disorders such as rashes and itching, blisters of the skin. these may be the signs of an allergic reaction. the most common side effect reported with clopidogrel teva pharma is bleeding. bleeding may occur as bleeding in the stomach or bowels, bruising, haematoma (unusual bleeding or bruising under the skin), nose bleed, blood in the urine. in a small number of cases, bleeding in the eye, inside the head, the lung or the joints has also been reported. if you experience prolonged bleeding when taking clopidogrel teva pharma if you cut or injure yourself, it may take slightly longer than usual for bleeding to stop. this is linked to the way your medicine works as it prevents the ability of blood clots to form. for minor cuts and injuries e.g., cutting yourself, shaving, this is usually of no concern. however, if you are concerned by your bleeding, you should contact your doctor straightaway (see section 2 'warnings and precautions'). other side effects include: common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): diarrhoea, abdominal pain, indigestion or heartburn. uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): headache, stomach ulcer, vomiting, nausea, constipation, excessive gas in stomach or intestines, rashes, itching, dizziness, sensation of tingling and numbness. rare side effect (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people): vertigo, enlarged breasts in males. very rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): jaundice; severe abdominal pain with or without back pain; fever, breathing difficulties sometimes associated with cough; generalised allergic reactions (for example, overall sensation of heat with sudden general discomfort until fainting); swelling in the mouth; blisters of the skin; skin allergy; sore mouth (stomatitis); decrease in blood pressure; confusion; hallucinations; joint pain; muscular pain; changes in taste of food. in addition, your doctor may identify changes in your blood or urine test
