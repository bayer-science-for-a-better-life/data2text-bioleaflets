CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVaborem is indicated for the treatment of the following infections in adults (see sections 4.4 and 5.1): \n\n• Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), including pyelonephritis  \n• Complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) \n• Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), including ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). \n\n \nTreatment of patients with bacteraemia that occurs in association with, or is suspected to be associated \nwith, any of the infections listed above. \n \nVaborem is also indicated for the treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms in \nadults with limited treatment options (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nVaborem should be used to treat infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms in adult patients with \nlimited treatment options only after consultation with a physician with appropriate experience in the \nmanagement of infectious diseases (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nPosology \n \nTable 1 shows the recommended intravenous dose for patients with a creatinine clearance \n(CrCl) ≥40 ml/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nTable 1:  Recommended intravenous dose for patients with a creatinine clearance \n(CrCl) ≥40 ml/min1 \nType of infection Dose of Vaborem \n\n(meropenem/ \nvaborbactam)2 \n\n \n\nFrequency Infusion time Duration of \ntreatment \n\nComplicated UTI (cUTI), \nincluding pyelonephritis \n \n\n2 g/2 g \n \n\nEvery  \n8 hours \n\n3 hours 5 to 10 days2 \n\ncIAI \n \n\n2 g/2 g Every  \n8 hours \n\n \n\n3 hours 5 to 10 days2 \n\nHospital-acquired \npneumonia (HAP), \nincluding VAP \n \n\n2 g/2 g Every  \n8 hours \n\n3 hours 7 to 14 days \n\nBacteraemia, in \nassociation with, or \nsuspected to be \nassociated with, any of \nthe infections listed \nabove \n \n\n2 g/2 g Every  \n8 hours \n\n3 hours  Duration in \naccordance with \n\nthe site of \ninfection \n\nInfections due to aerobic \nGram-negative organisms \nin patients with limited \ntreatment options \n \n \n\n2 g/2 g Every  \n8 hours \n\n3 hours  Duration in \naccordance with \n\nthe site of \ninfection \n\n1 As calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula \n2 Treatment may continue up to 14 days  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly population \nNo dose adjustment based on age is required (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nTable 2 shows the recommended dose adjustments for patients with a CrCl ≤39 ml/min.  \n \nMeropenem and vaborbactam are removed by haemodialysis (see section 5.2). Doses adjusted for renal \nimpairment should be administered after a dialysis session. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nTable 2:  Recommended intravenous doses for patients with a CrCl ≤39 ml/min1 \nCrCl (ml/min)1 Recommended Dosage \n\nRegimen2 \nDosing Interval Infusion Time \n\n20 to 39 1 g/1 g Every 8 hours 3 hours \n\n10 to 19 1 g/1 g Every 12 hours 3 hours \n\nLess than 10 0.5 g/0.5 g Every 12 hours 3 hours \n1 As calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula \n2 Refer to Table 1 for the recommended duration of treatment \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of meropenem/vaborbactam in children and adolescents younger than 18 years of \nage have not yet been established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nIntravenous use. \n \nVaborem is administered by intravenous infusion over 3 hours.  \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section \n6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nHypersensitivity to any carbapenem antibacterial agent. \n \nSevere hypersensitivity (e.g. anaphylactic reaction, severe skin reaction) to any other type of beta-lactam \nantibacterial agent (e.g. penicillins, cephalosporins or monobactams). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nSerious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with meropenem and/or \nmeropenem/vaborbactam (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). \n \nPatients who have a history of hypersensitivity to carbapenems, penicillins or other beta-lactam \nantibacterial agents may also be hypersensitive to meropenem/vaborbactam. Before initiating therapy with \nVaborem, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to beta-lactam \nantibiotics. \n \nIf a severe allergic reaction occurs, treatment with Vaborem must be discontinued immediately and \nadequate emergency measures must be initiated. \n \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nSeizures \n \nSeizures have been reported during treatment with meropenem (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients with known seizure disorders should continue anticonvulsant therapy. Patients who develop focal \ntremors, myoclonus, or seizures should be evaluated neurologically and placed on anticonvulsant therapy \nif not already instituted. If necessary, the dose of meropenem/vaborbactam should be adjusted based on \nrenal function (see section 4.2). Alternatively, meropenem/vaborbactam should be discontinued (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nHepatic function monitoring \n \nHepatic function should be closely monitored during treatment with meropenem/vaborbactam due to the \nrisk of hepatic toxicity (hepatic dysfunction with cholestasis and cytolysis) (see section 4.8).  \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver disorders should have liver function monitored during treatment with \nmeropenem/vaborbactam. There is no dose adjustment necessary (see section 4.2).  \n \nAntiglobulin test (Coombs test) seroconversion \n \nA positive direct or indirect Coombs test may develop during treatment with meropenem/vaborbactam as \nseen with meropenem (see section 4.8). \n \nClostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea \n \nClostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea has been reported with meropenem/vaborbactam. The condition \ncan range in severity from mild diarrhoea to fatal colitis and should be considered in patients who present \nwith diarrhoea during or subsequent to the administration of Vaborem (see section 4.8). Discontinuation \nof therapy with Vaborem and the administration of specific treatment for Clostridium difficile should be \nconsidered. Medicinal products that inhibit peristalsis should not be given. \n \nConcomitant use with valproic acid/sodium valproate/valpromide  \n \nCase reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to \npatients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium may reduce plasma levels of valproic acid to \nconcentrations below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, thus increasing the risk of \nbreakthrough seizures. If administration of Vaborem is necessary, supplemental anticonvulsant therapy \nshould be considered (see section 4.5). \n \nLimitations of the clinical data \n \nComplicated intra-abdominal infections  \nThe use of Vaborem to treat patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections is based on experience \nwith meropenem alone and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analyses of meropenem/vaborbactam.  \n \nHospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia \nThe use of  Vaborem to treat patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated \npneumonia, is based on experience with meropenem alone and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic \nanalyses for meropenem/vaborbactam. \n \nPatients with limited treatment options \n\n\n\n6 \n\nThe use of Vaborem to treat patients with infections due to bacterial organisms who have limited \ntreatment options is based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses for meropenem/vaborbactam \nand on limited data from a randomised clinical trial in which 32 patients were treated with Vaborem and \n15 patients were treated with best available therapy for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant \norganisms (see section 5.1).  \n \nSpectrum of activity of meropenem/vaborbactam \n \nMeropenem does not have activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and \nStaphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) or vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). Alternative or \nadditional antibacterial agents should be used when these pathogens are known or suspected to be \ncontributing to the infectious process.  \n \nThe inhibitory spectrum of vaborbactam includes class A carbapenemases (such as KPC) and Class C \ncarbapenemases. Vaborbactam does not inhibit class D carbapenemases such as OXA-48 or class B \nmetallo-β-lactamases such as NDM and VIM (see section 5.1). \n \nNon-susceptible organisms \n \nThe use of meropenem/vaborbactam may result in the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, which \nmay require interruption of treatment or other appropriate measures. \n  \nControlled sodium diet \n \nVaborem contains 10.9 mmol (approximately 250 mg) of sodium per vial. This should be taken into \nconsideration while treating patients on a controlled sodium diet.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCaution should be used when administering meropenem/vaborbactam concomitantly with medicinal \nproducts with a narrow therapeutic window that are predominantly metabolised by CYP450 enzymes (e.g. \nimmunosuppressants such as tacrolimus, everolimus and cyclosporine, lovastatin, midazolam, sildenafil \nand warfarin) as conclusive data on whether meropenem or vaborbactam may be inhibitors or inducers of \nCYP450 enzymes is not yet available. It is unknown whether a potential interaction would result in \nincreased or decreased plasma concentrations, and thus patients should be monitored both for signs of \ntoxicity and lack of efficacy of the narrow therapeutic index drug. \n \nIn vitro data suggest that vaborbactam may inhibit CYP2D6, and a risk for increased plasma \nconcentrations of sensitive CYP2D6 substrates in vivo cannot be excluded. Patients taking CYP2D6 \nsubstrates with narrow therapeutic index (e.g. dextromethorphan, desipramine, venlafaxine, and \nmetoprolol) should be monitored for signs of toxicity. \n \nMeropenem alone is not known to interact with active transport systems. \n \nMeropenem is a substrate of OAT1 and OAT3 and as such, probenecid competes with meropenem for \nactive tubular secretion and thus inhibits the renal excretion of meropenem. Co-administration of \nprobenecid with Vaborem is not recommended, as it may result in increased plasma concentrations of \nmeropenem. \n \nConcomitant administration of meropenem and valproic acid has been associated with reductions in \nvalproic acid concentrations with subsequent loss in seizure control. Data from in vitro and animal studies \nsuggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid’s glucuronide metabolite (VPA g) \nback to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. Therefore, supplemental \n\n\n\n7 \n\nanticonvulsant therapy should be administered when concomitant administration of valproic acid and \nmeropenem/vaborbactam cannot be avoided (see section 4.4). \n \nOral anticoagulants \n \nSimultaneous administration of antibacterial agents with warfarin may augment its anticoagulant effects. \nThere have been many reports of increases in the anticoagulant effects of orally administered \nanticoagulants, including warfarin in patients, who are concomitantly receiving antibacterial agents. The \nrisk may vary with the underlying infection, age and general status of the patient so that the contribution \nof the antibacterial agent to the increase in international normalised ratio (INR) is difficult to assess. It is \nrecommended that the INR should be monitored frequently during and shortly after co-administration of \nVaborem with an oral anticoagulant. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of \nmeropenem/vaborbactam in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful \neffects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Vaborem during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nMeropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. It is unknown whether vaborbactam is \nexcreted in human milk or animal milk. Because a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded, \nbreastfeeding must be discontinued prior to initiating therapy. \n \nFertility \n \nThe effects of meropenem/vaborbactam on fertility in humans have not been studied. Animal studies \nconducted with meropenem and vaborbactam do not indicate harmful effects with respect to fertility (see \nsection 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nVaborem has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Seizures have been reported \nduring treatment with meropenem alone, especially in patients treated with anticonvulsants (see section \n4.4). Meropenem/vaborbactam may cause headache, paraesthesia, lethargy and dizziness (see section 4.8). \nTherefore, caution should be exercised when driving or using machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reactions that occurred among 322 patients from the pooled Phase 3 trials were \nheadache (8.1%), diarrhoea (4.7%), infusion site phlebitis (2.2%) and nausea (2.2%). \n \nSevere adverse reactions were observed in two patients (0.6 %), one infusion related reaction and one \nblood alkaline phosphatase increased respectively.  In one additional patient, a serious adverse reaction of \ninfusion related reaction was reported (0.3%). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been reported with meropenem alone and/or identified during the \nPhase 3 trials with Vaborem. Adverse reactions are classified according to frequency and System Organ \nClass. Adverse reactions listed in the table with a frequency of “unknown” were not observed in patients \nparticipating in trials with Vaborem or meropenem, but have been reported in the post-marketing setting \nfor meropenem alone. \n \nFrequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); unknown (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). Within each System Organ Class, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness.  \n \nTable 3:  Frequency of adverse reactions by system organ class  \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nCommon \n(≥1/100 to <1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100) \n\nRare \n(≥1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000) \n\nUnknown \n(cannot be \nestimated from the \navailable data) \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n Clostridium \ndifficile colitis  \n \nVulvovaginal \ncandidiasis \n \nOral candidiasis \n\n  \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nThrombocythaemia Leucopenia  \n \nNeutropenia \n \nEosinophilia \n \nThrombocytopenia  \n\n Agranulocytosis \n \nHaemolytic \nanaemia \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Anaphylactic \nreaction \n \nHypersensitivity \n\n Angioedema \n \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nHypokalaemia \n \nHypoglycaemia \n\nDecreased appetite \n \nHyperkalaemia \n \nHyperglycaemia \n\n  \n\nPsychiatric disorders  Insomnia  \n \nHallucination \n \n \n\n  \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache Tremor \n \nLethargy \n \nDizziness \n \nParaesthesia \n\nConvulsions   \n\nVascular disorders Hypotension \n \n\nPhlebitis \n \nVascular pain \n\n  \n\nRespiratory,  Bronchospasm   \n\n\n\n9 \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nCommon \n(≥1/100 to <1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100) \n\nRare \n(≥1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000) \n\nUnknown \n(cannot be \nestimated from the \navailable data) \n\nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nDiarrhoea \n \nNausea \n \nVomiting \n\nAbdominal \ndistension \n \nAbdominal pain \n\n  \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\nAlanine \naminotransferase \nincreased  \n \nAspartate \naminotransferase \nincreased  \n \nBlood alkaline \nphosphatase \nincreased \n \nBlood lactate \ndehydrogenase \nincreased \n\nBlood bilirubin \nincreased \n \n\n  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ndisorders \n\n Pruritus \n \n\nRash \n \nUrticaria \n\n Toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis \n \nStevens Johnson \nsyndrome \n \nErythema \nmultiforme \n \nDrug reaction with \neosinophilia and \nsystemic \nsymptoms \n(DRESS \nsyndrome) \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\n Renal impairment \n \nIncontinence \n \nBlood creatinine \nincreased \n \nBlood urea \nincreased \n\n  \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nInfusion site \nphlebitis \n \n\nPyrexia \n \n \n\nChest discomfort \n \nInfusion site \nreaction \n \nInfusion site \nerythema \n\n  \n\n\n\n10 \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nCommon \n(≥1/100 to <1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100) \n\nRare \n(≥1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000) \n\nUnknown \n(cannot be \nestimated from the \navailable data) \n\n \nInjection site \nphlebitis \n \nInfusion site \nthrombosis \n \nPain \n\nInvestigations  Blood creatine \nphosphokinase \nincreased \n\n Direct and indirect \nCoombs test \npositive \n\nInjury, poisoning \nand procedural \ncomplications \n\n Infusion related \nreaction \n\n  \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no experience with overdose of Vaborem.  \n \nLimited post-marketing experience with meropenem alone indicates that if adverse reactions occur \nfollowing overdose, they are consistent with the adverse reaction profile described in section 4.8, are \ngenerally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction.   \n \nIn the event of overdose, discontinue Vaborem and institute general supportive treatment. In individuals \nwith normal renal function, rapid renal elimination will occur. \n \nMeropenem and vaborbactam can be removed by haemodialysis. In subjects with end stage renal disease \n(ESRD) administered 1 g meropenem and 1 g vaborbactam, the mean total recovery in dialysate following \na haemodialysis session was 38% and 53% for meropenem and vaborbactam, respectively. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antibacterials for systemic use, carbapenems, ATC code: J01DH52 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nMeropenem exerts bactericidal activity by inhibiting peptidoglycan cell wall synthesis as a result of \nbinding to and inhibition of activity of essential penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).  \n \nVaborbactam is a non-beta-lactam inhibitor of class A and class C serine beta-lactamases, including \nKlebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase, KPC. It acts by forming a covalent adduct with beta-lactamases \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\nand is stable to beta-lactamase-mediated hydrolysis. Vaborbactam does not inhibit class B enzymes \n(metallo-β-lactamases) or class D carbapenemases.  Vaborbactam has no antibacterial activity. \n \nResistance  \n \nMechanisms of resistance in Gram-negative bacteria that are known to affect meropenem/vaborbactam \ninclude organisms that produce metallo-β-lactamases or oxacillinases with carbapenemase activity.  \n \nMechanisms of bacterial resistance that could decrease the antibacterial activity of \nmeropenem/vaborbactam include porin mutations affecting outer membrane permeability and \noverexpression of efflux pumps. \n \nAntibacterial activity in combination with other antibacterial agents \n \nIn vitro studies demonstrated no antagonism between meropenem/vaborbactam and levofloxacin, \ntigecycline, polymyxin, amikacin, vancomycin, azithromycin, daptomycin or linezolid. \n \nSusceptibility testing break points \n \nMinimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints established by the European Committee on \nAntimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) are as follows: \n \n \nOrganisms \n\nMinimum Inhibitory Concentrations (mg/l) \nSusceptible Resistant \n\nEnterobacteriaceae ≤81 >81  \nPseudomonas aeruginosa ≤81  >81  \n1For susceptibility testing purposes, the concentration of vaborbactam is fixed at 8 mg/l. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship  \n \nThe antimicrobial activity of meropenem has been shown to best correlate with the percent of the dosing \ninterval during which the free meropenem concentrations in plasma exceed the meropenem minimum \ninhibitory concentration. For vaborbactam, the PK-PD index associated with antimicrobial activity is the \nratio of free vaborbactam plasma AUC: meropenem/vaborbactam MIC. \n \nClinical efficacy against specific pathogens \n \nEfficacy has been demonstrated in clinical studies against the following pathogens that were susceptible to \nmeropenem/vaborbactam in vitro. \n\nComplicated urinary-tract infections, including pyelonephritis \nGram-negative micro-organisms: \n\n• Escherichia coli \n• Klebsiella pneumoniae \n• Enterobacter cloacae species complex \n\n \nClinical efficacy has not been established against the following pathogens that are relevant to the approved \nindications although in vitro studies suggest that they would be susceptible to meropenem and/or \nmeropenem/vaborbactam in the absence of acquired mechanisms of resistance.  \n\nGram-negative micro-organisms: \n• Citrobacter freundii \n\n\n\n12 \n\n• Citrobacter koseri \n• Enterobacter aerogenes \n• Klebsiella oxytoca \n• Morganella morganii \n• Proteus mirabilis \n• Providencia spp. \n• Pseudomonas aeruginosa \n• Serratia marcescens \n\nGram-positive micro-organisms: \n• Staphylococcus saprophyticus \n• Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible isolates only) \n• Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin susceptible isolates only) \n• Streptococcus agalactiae \n\nAnaerobic micro-organisms: \n• Bacteroides fragilis \n• Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron \n• Clostridium perfringens \n• Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus \n• Peptostreptococcus species (including P. micros, P anaerobius, P. magnus) \n• Bacteroides caccae \n• Prevotella bivia \n• Prevotella disiens \n\n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nVaborem in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of infections due to Gram-\nnegative bacteria (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDistribution \n \nThe plasma protein binding of meropenem is approximately 2%. The plasma protein binding of \nvaborbactam is approximately 33%.  \n \nThe steady-state volumes of distribution of meropenem and vaborbactam in patients were 20.2 L and \n18.6 L, respectively, following doses of 2 g meropenem/2 g vaborbactam infused over 3 hours every \n8 hours, indicating that both compounds distribute into a volume of distribution consistent with the \nextracellular fluid compartment. \n \nBoth meropenem and vaborbactam penetrate into human bronchial epithelial lining fluid (ELF) with \nconcentrations around 65% and 79% of unbound plasma concentrations of meropenem and vaborbactam, \nrespectively. The concentration time profiles are similar for ELF and plasma. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nMeropenem is mostly eliminated unchanged. About 25% of the administered dose is eliminated as the \ninactive open ring form.  \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \nVaborbactam does not undergo metabolism. \n \nElimination \n \nThe terminal half-life (t½) is 2.30 hours and 2.25 hours for meropenem and vaborbactam, respectively. \n \nBoth meropenem and vaborbactam are primarily excreted via the kidneys. Approximately 40-60% of a \nmeropenem dose is excreted unchanged within 24 - 48 hours with a further 25% recovered as the \nmicrobiologically inactive hydrolysis product. The elimination of meropenem by the kidneys resulted in \nhigh therapeutic concentrations in urine. The mean renal clearance for meropenem was 7.7 L/h. The mean \nnon-renal clearance for meropenem was 4.8 L/h, which comprises both fecal elimination (~2% of the \ndose) and degradation due to hydrolysis. \n \nApproximately 75 to 95% of vaborbactam is excreted unchanged in the urine over a 24 - 48 hour period. \nThe elimination of vaborbactam by the kidneys resulted in high concentrations in the urine. The mean \nrenal clearance for vaborbactam was 10.5 L/h.  \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nThe Cmax and AUC of meropenem and vaborbactam are linear across the dose range studied (1 g to 2 g for \nmeropenem and 0.25 g to 2 g for vaborbactam) when administered as a single 3-hour intravenous infusion. \nThere is no accumulation of meropenem or vaborbactam following multiple intravenous infusions \nadministered every 8 hours for 7 days in subjects with normal renal function.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nPharmacokinetic studies with meropenem and vaborbactam in patients with renal impairment have shown \nthat the plasma clearance of both meropenem and vaborbactam correlates with creatinine clearance. \n \nHepatic impairment \nAs meropenem/vaborbactam does not undergo hepatic metabolism, the systemic clearance of \nmeropenem/vaborbactam is not expected to be affected by hepatic impairment. \n \nElderly \nPharmacokinetic data from a population pharmacokinetic analysis showed a reduction in plasma clearance \nof meropenem/vaborbactam that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance. \n \nGender and race \nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis there was no effect of gender or race on the pharmacokinetics of \nmeropenem and vaborbactam. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nMeropenem \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, reproduction toxicity or genotoxicity. Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted \nwith meropenem. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nVaborbactam \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, reproduction toxicity or genotoxicity. Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted \nwith vaborbactam. \n \nIn repeat dose toxicity studies in dogs, minimal hepatic inflammation was observed after 14 days and 28 \ndays of exposure to vaborbactam alone or combined meropenem/vaborbactam. \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Vaborem is and what it is used for  \n \nWhat Vaborem is \nVaborem is an antibiotic medicine that contains two active substances: meropenem and vaborbactam. \n• Meropenem belongs to group of antibiotics called “carbapenems”. It can kill many types of bacteria \n\nby preventing them from building the protective walls that surround their cells. \n• Vaborbactam is a “beta lactamase inhibitor”. It blocks the action of an enzyme that allows some \n\nbacteria to resist the action of meropenem. This helps meropenem kill some bacteria that it cannot \nkill on its own.   \n\n \nWhat Vaborem is used for \nVaborem is used in adults to treat certain serious bacterial infections: \n• of the bladder or kidneys (urinary tract infections) \n• of the stomach and gut (intra-abdominal infections) \n• of the lungs (pneumonia) \n \nIt is also used to treat infections \n• of the blood associated with any of the infections mentioned above \n• caused by bacteria that other antibiotics may not be able to kill \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Vaborem  \n \nYou must not be given Vaborem if \n• you are allergic to meropenem, vaborbactam or the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n• you are allergic to other carbapenem antibiotics (the group to which meropenem belongs). \n• you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to related antibiotics belonging to the beta-lactam group \n\n(including penicillins, cephalosporins or monobactams).  \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before receiving Vaborem if: \n• you have ever had any allergic reaction to other antibiotics belonging to the beta-lactam group \n\n(including carbapenems, penicillins, cephalosporins, or monobactams) \n• you have ever developed severe diarrhoea during or after antibiotic treatment \n• you have ever suffered from seizures \n \nIf any of the above apply to you or you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before using Vaborem. \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse if you suffer from diarrhoea during your treatment. \n \nThis medicine can affect your liver. Your doctor may take some blood to check how well your liver is \nworking while taking the medicine. \n \nNew infection \nAlthough Vaborem can fight certain bacteria, there is a possibility that you may get a different infection \ncaused by another organism during or after your treatment. Your doctor will monitor you closely for any \nnew infections and give you another treatment if necessary. \n \nBlood tests \nTell your doctor that you are taking Vaborem if you are going to have any blood tests. This is because you \nmay get an abnormal result with something called a “Coombs test”. This test looks for the presence of \nantibodies that can destroy red blood cells or may be affected by the response of your immune system to \nVaborem. \n \nChildren or adolescents \nVaborem should not be used in children or adolescents under 18 years of age. This is because it is not \nknown if the medicine is safe to use in these age groups. \n \nOther medicines and Vaborem \nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nIt is particularly important to tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n• medicines used to treat epilepsy called valproic acid, sodium valproate or valpromide because \n\nVaborem may decrease their effect  \n• a medicine for gout called probenecid \n• oral anticoagulant medicines, such as warfarin (used to treat or prevent blood clots) \n• medicines that weaken your body’s immune system, such as tacrolimus, everolimus and \n\ncyclosporine \n• a cholesterol-lowering medicine called lovastatin \n• a medicine used to treat seizures or given prior to a surgery or certain examinations inside your body \n\nsuch as a colonoscopy, called midazolam \n• a medicine to treat issues with getting an erection in men or to treat high blood pressure in the lungs \n\ncalled sildenafil \n\n\n\n28 \n\n• a medicine commonly used in medicines to treat a cough called dextromethorphan \n• a medicine used to treat depression called desipramine \n• a medicine used to treat depression or anxiety called venlafaxine \n• a medicine used to treat high blood pressure or chest pain called metoprolol \n \nTell your doctor before using Vaborem if any of the above apply to you. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice \nbefore receiving this medicine. \n \nIt is important that you tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or if you intend to breast-feed before \nreceiving Vaborem. Small amounts of this medicine may pass into the breast milk and it may affect the \nbaby. Therefore, you must discontinue breastfeeding before you are given Vaborem. \n \nDriving and using machines \nVaborem may make you feel dizzy, sleepy and sluggish, give you a headache or tingling sensation (like \n“pins and needles”) or, in rare cases, cause a fit or seizure. This may affect your ability to drive, use tools \nor machines.  \n \nVaborem contains sodium \nThis product contains approximately 250 mg of sodium per vial. This should be taken into consideration if \nyou are on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n \n3. How you will be given Vaborem \n \nVaborem will be given to you by a doctor or nurse by infusion (a drip) into a vein, lasting 3 hours.  \n \nThe recommended dose is 2 vials (a total of 2 g meropenem and 2 g vaborbactam), given every 8 hours. \nYour doctor will decide how many days of treatment are needed, depending on the type of infection. \n \nPatients with kidney problems \nIf you have kidney problems, your doctor may lower your dose. Your doctor may also want to do some \nblood tests to see how well your kidneys are working. \n \nIf you are given more Vaborem than you should \nVaborem will be given to you by a doctor or a nurse, so it is unlikely you will be given the wrong dose. If \nyou think you have been given too much Vaborem, tell your doctor or nurse straight away.  \n \nIf you miss a dose of Vaborem \nIf you think you have missed a dose, tell your doctor or nurse straight away. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4.

The final volume is approximately 21.3 ml. The reconstituted solution is not for direct \ninjection. The reconstituted solution must be diluted before intravenous infusion. \n \nDilution:  \nTo prepare the Vaborem  2 g/2 g for intravenous infusion: Immediately after reconstitution of two vials, \nthe entire reconstituted vial contents should be withdrawn from each of the two vials and added back into \nthe 250 ml infusion bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection (normal saline). The \nfinal infusion concentration of meropenem and vaborbactam will be about 8 mg/ml each. \n \nTo prepare the Vaborem  1 g/1 g for intravenous infusion: Immediately after reconstitution of one vial, the \nentire reconstituted vial contents should be withdrawn from the vial and added back into the 250 ml \ninfusion bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection (normal saline). The final infusion \nconcentration of meropenem and vaborbactam will be about 4 mg/ml each. \n \nTo prepare the Vaborem  0.5 g/0.5 g for intravenous infusion: Immediately after reconstitution of one vial, \n10.5 ml of the reconstituted vial contents should be withdrawn from the vial and added back into the \n250 ml infusion bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection (normal saline). The final \ninfusion concentration of meropenem and vaborbactam will be 2 mg/ml each. \n \nThe diluted solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter. The colour of the diluted solution \nis clear to light yellow.  \n \nFollowing dilution, the infusion should be completed within 4 hours when stored at 25 °C, or within \n22 hours when refrigerated at 2 – 8 °C. \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the medicinal product should be used immediately upon \nreconstitution and dilution. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n34 \n\n \nVaborem  is not chemically compatible with glucose-containing solutions.
