NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nTOVIAZ 4 mg prolonged-release tablets \n\nTOVIAZ 8 mg prolonged-release tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nTOVIAZ 4 mg tablets \n\nEach prolonged-release tablet contains fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg corresponding to 3.1 mg of \n\nfesoterodine. \n\n \n\nTOVIAZ 8 mg tablets \n\nEach prolonged-release tablet contains fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg corresponding to 6.2 mg of \n\nfesoterodine. \n\n \n\nExcipients with known effect \n\n \n\nTOVIAZ 4 mg tablets \n\nEach 4 mg prolonged-release tablet contains 0.525 mg of soya lecithin and 91.125 mg of lactose. \n\n \n\nTOVIAZ 8 mg tablets \n\nEach 8 mg prolonged-release tablet contains 0.525 mg of soya lecithin and 58.125 mg of lactose. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nProlonged-release tablet. \n\n \n\nTOVIAZ 4 mg tablets \n\nThe 4 mg tablets are light blue, oval, biconvex, film-coated, and engraved on one side with the \n\nletters ‘FS’. \n\n \n\nTOVIAZ 8 mg tablets \n\nThe 8 mg tablets are blue, oval, biconvex, film-coated, and engraved on one side with the letters \n\n‘FT’. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTOVIAZ is indicated in adults for treatment of the symptoms (increased urinary frequency and/or \n\nurgency and/or urgency incontinence) that may occur with overactive bladder syndrome. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nAdults (including elderly) \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 4 mg once daily. Based upon individual response, the dose may \n\nbe increased to 8 mg once daily. The maximum daily dose is 8 mg. \n\n \n\nFull treatment effect was observed between 2 and 8 weeks. Hence, it is recommended to re-\n\nevaluate the efficacy for the individual patient after 8 weeks of treatment.  \n\n \n\nIn subjects with normal renal and hepatic function receiving concomitant administration of potent \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors, the maximum daily dose of TOVIAZ should be 4 mg once daily (see section \n\n4.5).  \n\n \n\nSpecial population \n\n \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \n\nThe following table provides the daily dosing recommendations for subjects with renal or hepatic \n\nimpairment in the absence and presence of moderate and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (see sections \n\n4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2). \n\n \n\n Moderate(3) or potent(4) CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nNone Moderate Potent \n\nRenal impairment(1) Mild 4→8 mg(2) 4 mg Should be avoided \n\n Moderate 4→8 mg(2) 4 mg Contraindicated \n\n Severe 4 mg \nShould be \n\navoided \nContraindicated \n\nHepatic impairment Mild 4→8 mg(2) 4 mg Should be avoided \n\n Moderate 4 mg \nShould be \n\navoided \nContraindicated \n\n(1)  Mild GFR = 50-80 ml/min; Moderate GFR = 30-50 ml/min; Severe GFR = <30 ml/min \n\n(2)  Cautious dose increase. See sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2 \n\n(3) Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. See section 4.5 \n\n(4) Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. See sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 \n\n \n\nTOVIAZ is contraindicated in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of TOVIAZ in children below 18 years of age have not yet been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nTablets are to be taken once daily with liquid and swallowed whole. TOVIAZ can be administered \n\nwith or without food. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to peanut or soya or to any of the excipients listed \nin section 6.1 \n\n• Urinary retention \n• Gastric retention  \n• Uncontrolled narrow angle glaucoma \n\n\n\n4 \n\n• Myasthenia gravis \n• Severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) \n• Concomitant use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in subjects with moderate to severe hepatic or \n\nrenal impairment \n\n• Severe ulcerative colitis \n• Toxic megacolon. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  \n\n \n\nTOVIAZ should be used with caution in patients with: \n\n \n\n- Clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction at risk of urinary retention (e.g. clinically \n\nsignificant prostate enlargement due to benign prostatic hyperplasia, see section 4.3) \n\n- Gastrointestinal obstructive disorders (e.g. pyloric stenosis) \n\n- Gastro-oesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking medicinal products (such as \n\noral bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate oesophagitis \n\n- Decreased gastrointestinal motility \n\n- Autonomic neuropathy \n\n- Controlled narrow-angle glaucoma \n\n \n\nCaution should be exercised when prescribing or uptitrating fesoterodine to patients in whom an \n\nincreased exposure to the active metabolite (see section 5.1) is expected: \n\n \n\n- Hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2) \n\n- Renal impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2) \n\n- Concomitant administration of potent or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (see sections 4.2 and \n\n4.5) \n\n- Concomitant administration of a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nDose increases \n\nIn patients with a combination of these factors, additional exposure increases are expected. Dose \n\ndependent antimuscarinic adverse reactions are likely to occur. In populations where the dose may \n\nbe increased to 8 mg once daily, the dose increase should be preceded by an evaluation of the \n\nindividual response and tolerability.  \n\n \n\nOrganic causes must be excluded before any treatment with antimuscarinics is considered. Safety \n\nand efficacy have not yet been established in patients with a neurogenic cause for detrusor \n\noveractivity.  \n\n \n\nOther causes of frequent urination (treatment of heart failure or renal disease) should be assessed \n\nbefore treatment with fesoterodine. If urinary tract infection is present, an appropriate medical \n\napproach should be taken/antibacterial therapy should be started.  \n\n \n\nAngioedema \n\nAngioedema has been reported with fesoterodine and has occurred after the first dose in some \n\ncases. If angioedema occurs, fesoterodine should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be \n\npromptly provided. \n\n \n\nPotent CYP3A4 inducers \n\nThe concomitant use of fesoterodine with a potent CYP3A4 inducer (i.e. carbamazepine, rifampicin, \n\nphenobarbital, phenytoin, St John’s Wort) is not recommended (see section 4.5).  \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nQT prolongation \n\nTOVIAZ should be used with caution in patients with risk for QT prolongation (e.g. hypokalaemia, \n\nbradycardia and concomitant administration of medicines known to prolong QT interval) and \n\nrelevant pre-existing cardiac diseases (e.g. myocardial ischaemia, arrhythmia, congestive heart \n\nfailure), (see section 4.8). This especially holds true when taking potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (see \n\nsections 4.2, 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nLactose \n\nTOVIAZ prolonged-release tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of \n\ngalactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not \n\ntake this medicine. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n\n \n\nPharmacological interactions \n\nCaution should be exercised in coadministration of fesoterodine with other antimuscarinics and \n\nmedicinal products with anticholinergic properties (e.g. amantadine, tri-cyclic antidepressants, \n\ncertain neuroleptics) as this may lead to more pronounced therapeutic - and side-effects (e.g. \n\nconstipation, dry mouth, drowsiness, urinary retention). \n\nFesoterodine may reduce the effect of medicinal products that stimulate the motility of the \n\ngastro-intestinal tract, such as metoclopramide. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n\nIn vitro data demonstrate that the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, \n\n2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically \n\nrelevant plasma concentrations. Thus fesoterodine is unlikely to alter the clearance of medicinal \n\nproducts that are metabolised by these enzymes. \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors \n\n \n\nPotent CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nFollowing inhibition of CYP3A4 by co-administration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily, Cmax and \n\nAUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.0 and 2.3-fold in CYP2D6 extensive \n\nmetabolisers and 2.1 and 2.5-fold in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, respectively. Therefore, the \n\nmaximum dose of fesoterodine should be restricted to 4 mg when used concomitantly with potent \n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, \n\nnefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir (and all ritonavir boosted PI-regimens), saquinavir and \n\ntelithromycin (see sections 4.2 and 4.4)). \n\n \n\nModerate CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nFollowing blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole \n\n200 mg twice a day for 2 days, Cmax and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased \n\napproximately 19% and 27%, respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the \n\npresence of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil and \n\ngrapefruit juice). \n\n \n\nWeak CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nThe effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine), was not examined; it is not expected to be \n\nin excess of the effect of moderate inhibitor. \n\n \n\nCYP3A4 inducers \n\nFollowing induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampicin 600 mg once a day, Cmax and \n\nAUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, \n\nrespectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine 8 mg.  \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nInduction of CYP3A4 may lead to subtherapeutic plasma levels. Concomitant use with CYP3A4 \n\ninducers (e.g. carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, St John’s Wort) is not \n\nrecommended (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nCYP2D6 inhibitors \n\nThe interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not tested clinically. Mean Cmax and AUC of the active \n\nmetabolite are 1.7 and 2-fold higher, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers as compared to \n\nextensive metabolisers. Co-administration of a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor may result in increased \n\nexposure and adverse events. A dose reduction to 4 mg may be needed (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nOral contraceptives \n\nFesoterodine does not impair the suppression of ovulation by oral hormonal contraception. In the \n\npresence of fesoterodine there are no changes in the plasma concentrations of combined oral \n\ncontraceptives containing ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. \n\n \n\nWarfarin \n\nA clinical study in healthy volunteers has shown that fesoterodine 8 mg once daily has no significant \n\neffect on the pharmacokinetics or the anticoagulant activity of a single dose of warfarin. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of fesoterodine in pregnant women. Reproductive toxicity \n\nstudies with fesoterodine in animals show minor embryotoxicity. In animal reproduction studies, \n\noral administration of fesoterodine to pregnant mice and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in \n\nfetotoxicity at maternal exposures that were 6 and 3 times the maximum recommended human dose \n\n(MRHD), respectively, based on AUC (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n\nTOVIAZ is not recommended during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether fesoterodine/metabolites are excreted into human milk; therefore, \n\nbreast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with TOVIAZ. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nNo clinical trials have been conducted to assess the effect of fesoterodine on human fertility.  \n\nFindings in mice at exposures approximately 5 to 19 times those at the MRHD show an effect on \n\nfemale fertility, however, the clinical implications of these animal findings are not known (see \n\nsection 5.3). Women of child bearing potential should be made aware of the lack of human fertility \n\ndata, and TOVIAZ should only be given after consideration of individual risks and benefits.  \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n\n \n\nTOVIAZ has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n\n \n\nCaution should be exercised when driving or using machines due to possible occurrence of side \n\neffects such as blurred vision, dizziness, and somnolence (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe safety of fesoterodine was evaluated in placebo-controlled clinical studies in a total of \n\n2859 patients with overactive bladder, of which 780 received placebo. \n\n \n\nDue to the pharmacological properties of fesoterodine, treatment may cause mild to moderate \n\nantimuscarinic effects like dry mouth, dry eye, dyspepsia and constipation.  Urinary retention may \n\noccur uncommonly. \n\n \n\nDry mouth, the only very common adverse reactions, occurred with a frequency of 28.8% in the \n\nfesoterodine group compared to 8.5% in the placebo group. The majority of adverse reactions \n\noccurred during the first month of treatment with the exception of cases classified as urinary \n\nretention or post void residual urine greater than 200 ml, which could occur after long term \n\ntreatment and was more common in male than female subjects.  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe table below gives the frequency of treatment emergent adverse reactions from placebo-\n\ncontrolled clinical trials and from post-marketing experience. The adverse reactions are reported in \n\nthis table with the following frequency convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to \n\n<1/10), uncommon (1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000). \n\n \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing \n\nseriousness. \n\n \n\nSystem organ class Very common Common Uncommon Rare \n\nInfections and \n\ninfestations \n\n \n\n  Urinary tract \n\ninfection \n\n \n\nPsychiatric disorders  Insomnia  Confusional \n\nstate \n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders \n\n Dizziness; \n\nHeadache \n\nDysgeusia; \n\nSomnolence \n\n \n\n \n\nEye disorders  Dry eye Blurred vision  \n\nEar and labyrinth \n\ndisorders \n\n  Vertigo  \n\nCardiac disorders \n\n \n\n  Tachycardia; \n\nPalpitations \n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \n\nand mediastinal \n\ndisorders \n\n Dry throat Pharyngolaryng\n\neal pain; Cough; \n\nNasal dryness \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal \n\ndisorders \n\nDry mouth Abdominal pain; \n\nDiarrhoea; \n\nDyspepsia; \n\nConstipation; \n\nNausea \n\nAbdominal \n\ndiscomfort; \n\nFlatulence, \n\nGastroesophage\n\nal reflux \n\n \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\n \n\n  ALT increased; \n\nGGT increased \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders \n\n  \n\n \n\nRash; Dry skin; \n\nPruritus \n\nAngioedema; \n\nUrticaria \n\n\n\n8 \n\nSystem organ class Very common Common Uncommon Rare \n\nRenal and urinary \n\ndisorders \n\n Dysuria Urinary \n\nretention \n\n(including \n\nfeeling of \n\nresidual urine; \n\nmicturition \n\ndisorder); \n\nUrinary \n\nhesitation \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site \n\nconditions \n\n  Fatigue  \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nIn clinical trials of fesoterodine, cases of markedly elevated liver enzymes were reported with the \n\noccurrence frequency no different from the placebo group. The relation to fesoterodine treatment is \n\nunclear. \n\n \n\nElectrocardiograms were obtained from 782 patients treated with 4 mg, 785 treated with 8 mg, 222 \n\ntreated with 12 mg fesoterodine and 780 with placebo. The heart rate corrected QT interval in \n\nfesoterodine treated patients did not differ from that seen in placebo treated patients. The incidence \n\nrates of QTc 500 ms post baseline or QTc increase of 60 ms is 1.9%, 1.3%, 1.4% and 1.5%, \n\nfor fesoterodine 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg and placebo, respectively. The clinical relevance of these \nfindings will depend on individual patient risk factors and susceptibilities present (see section 4.4) . \n\n \n\nPost-marketing cases of urinary retention requiring catheterisation have been described, generally \n\nwithin the first week of treatment with fesoterodine. They have mainly involved elderly (≥ 65 years) \n\nmale patients with a history consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nOverdose with antimuscarinics, including fesoterodine can result in severe anticholinergic effects. \n\nTreatment should be symptomatic and supportive. In the event of overdose, ECG monitoring is \n\nrecommended; standard supportive measures for managing QT prolongation should be adopted. \n\nFesoterodine has been safely administered in clinical studies at doses up to 28 mg/day. \n\n \n\nIn the event of fesoterodine overdose, treat with gastric lavage and give activated charcoal. Treat \n\nsymptoms as follows: \n\n \n\n- Severe central anticholinergic effects (e.g. hallucinations, severe excitation): treat with \n\nphysostigmine \n\n- Convulsions or pronounced excitation: treat with benzodiazepines \n\n- Respiratory insufficiency: treat with artificial respiration \n\n- Tachycardia: treat with beta-blockers \n\n- Urinary retention: treat with catheterisation \n\n- Mydriasis: treat with pilocarpine eye drops and/or place patient in dark room. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Urologicals, Urinary antispasmodics, ATC code: G04BD11. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nFesoterodine is a competitive, specific muscarinic receptor antagonist. It is rapidly and extensively \n\nhydrolysed by non-specific plasma esterases to the 5-hydroxymethyl derivative, its primary active \n\nmetabolite, which is the main active pharmacological principle of fesoterodine.  \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nThe efficacy of fixed doses of fesoterodine 4 mg and 8 mg was evaluated in two Phase 3 \n\nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies. Female (79%) and male (21%) \n\npatients with a mean age of 58 years (range 19-91 years) were included. A total of 33% of patients \n\nwere ≥65 years of age and 11% were ≥75 years of age. \n\n \n\nFesoterodine treated patients had statistically significant mean reductions in the number of \n\nmicturitions per 24 hours and in the number of urge incontinence episodes per 24 hours at the end \n\nof treatment compared to placebo. Likewise, the response rate (% of patients reporting that their \n\ncondition has been “greatly improved” or “improved” using a 4-point Treatment Benefit Scale) was \n\nsignificantly greater with fesoterodine compared to placebo. Furthermore, fesoterodine improved \n\nthe mean change in the voided volume per micturition, and the mean change in the number of \n\ncontinent days per week (see Table 1 below). \n\n \n\nTable 1: Mean changes from Baseline to end of treatment for primary and selected \n\nsecondary endpoints \n\n Study 1 Study 2 \n\nParameter Placebo Fesoterodine \n\n4 mg \n\nFesoterodine \n\n8 mg \n\nActive \n\ncomparator \n\nPlacebo Fesoterodine \n\n4 mg \n\nFesoterodine \n\n8 mg \n\nNumber of micturitions per 24 hours# \n\n N=279 N=265 N=276 N=283 N=266 N=267 N=267 \n\nBaseline 12.0 11.6 11.9 11.5 12.2 12.9 12.0 \n\nChange from \n\nbaseline \n\n-1.02 -1.74 -1.94 -1.69 -1.02 -1.86 -1.94 \n\np-value  <0.001 <0.001   0.032 <0.001 \n\nResponder rate (treatment response)# \n\n N=279 N=265 N=276 N=283 N=266 N=267 N=267 \n\nResponder \n\nrate \n\n53.4% 74.7% 79.0% 72.4% 45.1% 63.7% 74.2% \n\np-value  <0.001 <0.001   <0.001 <0.001 \n\nNumber of urge incontinence episodes per 24 hours \n\n N=211 N=199 N=223 N=223 N=205 N=228 N=218 \n\nBaseline 3.7 3.8 3.7 3.8 3.7 3.9 3.9 \n\nChange from \n\nbaseline \n\n-1.20 -2.06 -2.27 -1.83 -1.00 -1.77 -2.42 \n\np-value  0.001 <0.001   0.003 <0.001 \n\n\n\n10 \n\nNumber of continent days per week  \n\n N=211 N=199 N=223 N=223 N=205 N=228 N=218 \n\nBaseline 0.8 0.8 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.7 0.7 \n\nChange from \n\nbaseline \n\n2.1 2.8 3.4 2.5 1.4 2.4 2.8 \n\np-value  0.007 <0.001   <0.001  <0.001 \n\nVoided volume per micturition (ml) \n\n N=279 N=265 N=276 N=283 N=266 N=267 N=267 \n\nBaseline 150 160 154 154 159 152 156 \n\nChange from \n\nbaseline \n\n10 27 33 24 8 17 33 \n\np-value  <0.001 <0.001   0.150 <0.001 \n\n \n\n# primary end points \n\n \n\nCardiac electrophysiology \n\nThe effect of fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg on the QT interval was thoroughly evaluated in a \n\ndouble-blind, randomised, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) parallel group \n\nstudy with once-daily treatment over a period of 3 days in 261 male and female subjects aged 45 to \n\n65 years. Change from baseline in QTc based on the Fridericia correction method did not show any \n\ndifferences between the active treatment and placebo group. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nAfter oral administration, due to rapid and extensive hydrolysis by non-specific plasma esterases, \n\nfesoterodine was not detected in plasma.  \n\n \n\nBioavailability of the active metabolite is 52%. After single or multiple-dose oral administration of \n\nfesoterodine in doses from 4 mg to 28 mg, plasma concentrations of the active metabolite are \n\nproportional to the dose. Maximum plasma levels are reached after approximately 5 hours. \n\nTherapeutic plasma levels are achieved after the first administration of fesoterodine. No \n\naccumulation occurs after multiple-dose administration. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nPlasma protein binding of the active metabolite is low with approximately 50% bound to albumin \n\nand alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The mean steady-state volume of distribution following intravenous \n\ninfusion of the active metabolite is 169 l. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nAfter oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolysed to its active metabolite. \n\nThe active metabolite is further metabolised in the liver to its carboxy, carboxy-N-desisopropyl, and \n\nN-desisopropyl metabolite with involvement of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. None of these metabolites \n\ncontribute significantly to the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Mean Cmax and AUC of the \n\nactive metabolite are 1.7 and 2-fold higher, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers as compared \n\nto extensive metabolisers. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nHepatic metabolism and renal excretion contribute significantly to the elimination of the active \n\nmetabolite. After oral administration of fesoterodine, approximately 70% of the administered dose \n\nwas recovered in urine as the active metabolite (16%), carboxy metabolite (34%), \n\n\n\n11 \n\ncarboxy-N-desisopropyl metabolite (18%), or N-desisopropyl metabolite (1%), and a smaller \n\namount (7%) was recovered in faeces. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite following oral \n\nadministration is approximately 7 hours and is absorption rate-limited. \n\n \n\nAge and gender \n\nNo dose adjustment is recommended in these subpopulations. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine \n\nare not significantly influenced by age and gender. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine have not been evaluated in paediatric patients.  \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (GFR 30 – 80 ml/min), Cmax and AUC of the \n\nactive metabolite increased up to 1.5 and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. In \n\npatients with severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 ml/min), Cmax and AUC are increased 2.0 and \n\n2.3-fold, respectively.  \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B), Cmax and AUC of the active metabolite \n\nincreased 1.4 and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetics of \n\nfesoterodine in patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied.  \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nIn non-clinical safety pharmacology, general toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies no \n\nclinically relevant effects have been observed, except those related to the pharmacological effect of \n\nthe active substance. \n\n \n\nReproduction studies have shown minor embryotoxicity at doses close to maternally toxic ones \n\n(increased number of resorptions, pre-implantation and post-implantation losses). \n\n \n\nSupratherapeutic concentrations of the active metabolite of fesoterodine, have been shown to inhibit \n\nK+ current in cloned human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) channels and prolong action \n\npotential duration (70% and 90% repolarisation) in canine isolated Purkinje fibres. However in \n\nconscious dogs, the active metabolite had no effect on the QT interval and QTc interval at plasma \n\nexposures at least 33-fold higher than mean peak free plasma concentration in human subjects who \n\nare extensive metabolisers and 21-fold higher than measured in subjects who are poor CYP2D6 \n\nmetabolisers after fesoterodine 8 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nIn a study of fertility and early embryonic development in mice, fesoterodine had no effect on male \n\nreproductive function or fertility at doses up to 45 mg/kg/day. At 45 mg/kg/day, a lower number of \n\ncorpora lutea, implantation sites and viable foetuses was observed in female mice administered \n\nfesoterodine for 2 weeks prior to mating and continuing through day 7 of gestation. The maternal \n\nNo-Observed-Effect Level (NOEL) and the NOEL for effects on reproduction and early embryonic \n\ndevelopment were both 15 mg/kg/day. Based on AUC, the systemic exposure was 0.6 to 1.5 times \n\nhigher in mice than in humans at the MRHD, whereas based on peak plasma concentrations, the \n\nexposure in mice was 5 to 9 times higher. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.
