Hepatic impairment has a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide (see \n\nsection 5.2). No adjustment of the starting dose of pomalidomide is required for patients with hepatic \n\nimpairment as defined by the Child-Pugh criteria. However, patients with hepatic impairment should be \n\ncarefully monitored for adverse reactions and dose reduction or interruption of pomalidomide should be \n\nused as needed. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment of pomalidomide is required for patients with renal impairment. On haemodialysis \n\ndays, patients should take their pomalidomide dose following haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of pomalidomide in children aged 0-17 years for the indication of multiple \n\nmyeloma. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nOral use. \n\nImnovid hard capsules should be taken orally at the same time each day. The capsules should not be \n\nopened, broken or chewed (see section 6.6). The capsules should be swallowed whole, preferably with \n\nwater, with or without food. If the patient forgets to take a dose of pomalidomide on one day, then the \n\npatient should take the normal prescribed dose as scheduled on the next day. Patients should not adjust \n\nthe dose to make up for a missing dose on previous days. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended to press only on one end of the capsule to remove it from the blister thereby reducing \n\nthe risk of capsule deformation or breakage. \n\n \n\nFor information on other medicinal products given in combination with Imnovid, refer to the respective \n\ncurrent SmPC. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n• Pregnancy. \n\n• Women of childbearing potential, unless all the conditions of the pregnancy prevention programme \n\nare met (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n\n• Male patients unable to follow or comply with the required contraceptive measures (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nFor information on other medicinal products given in combination with Imnovid, refer to the respective \n\ncurrent SmPC. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nTeratogenicity \n\n \n\nPomalidomide must not be taken during pregnancy, since a teratogenic effect is expected. Pomalidomide \n\nis structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that causes severe \n\nlife-threatening birth defects. Pomalidomide was found to be teratogenic in both rats and rabbits when \n\nadministered during the period of major organogenesis (see section 5.3). \n\n  \n\nThe conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme must be fulfilled for all patients unless there is \n\nreliable evidence that the patient does not have childbearing potential. \n\n \n\nCriteria for women of non-childbearing potential \n\n \n\nA female patient or a female partner of a male patient is considered of non-childbearing potential if she \n\nmeets at least one of the following criteria: \n\n• Age ≥ 50 years and naturally amenorrhoeic for ≥ 1 year (amenorrhoea following cancer therapy or \n\nduring breast-feeding does not rule out childbearing potential) \n\n• Premature ovarian failure confirmed by a specialist gynaecologist \n\n• Previous bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or hysterectomy \n\n• XY genotype, Turner syndrome, uterine agenesis. \n\n \n\nCounselling \n\n \n\nFor women of childbearing potential, pomalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the following are met: \n\n• She understands the expected teratogenic risk to the unborn child \n\n• She understands the need for effective contraception, without interruption, at least 4 weeks before \n\nstarting treatment, throughout the entire duration of treatment, and at least 4 weeks after the end of \n\ntreatment \n\n• Even if a woman of childbearing potential has amenorrhoea she must follow all the advice on \n\neffective contraception \n\n• She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures \n\n• She is informed and understands the potential consequences of pregnancy and the need to rapidly \n\nconsult if there is a risk of pregnancy \n\n• She understands the need to commence the treatment as soon as pomalidomide is dispensed \n\nfollowing a negative pregnancy test \n\n• She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing at least every 4 weeks except in \n\ncase of confirmed tubal sterilisation \n\n• She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions associated with the \n\nuse of pomalidomide. \n\n \n\nThe prescriber must ensure that for women of childbearing potential: \n\n• The patient complies with the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme, including \n\nconfirmation that she has an adequate level of understanding \n\n• The patient has acknowledged the aforementioned conditions. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nFor male patients taking pomalidomide, pharmacokinetic data has demonstrated that pomalidomide is \n\npresent in human semen during treatment. As a precaution, and taking into account special populations \n\nwith potentially prolonged elimination time such as hepatic impairment, all male patients taking \n\npomalidomide must meet the following conditions: \n\n• He understands the expected teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant woman \n\nor a woman of childbearing potential \n\n• He understands the need for the use of a condom if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant \n\nwoman or a woman of childbearing potential not using effective contraception, throughout \n\ntreatment duration, during dose interruption and for 7 days after dose interruptions and/or cessation \n\nof treatment. This includes vasectomised males who should wear a condom if engaged in sexual \n\nactivity with a pregnant woman or a woman of childbearing potential as seminal fluid may still \n\ncontain pomalidomide in the absence of spermatozoa. \n\n• He understands that if his female partner becomes pregnant whilst he is taking pomalidomide or \n\n7 days after he has stopped taking pomalidomide, he should inform his treating physician \n\nimmediately and that it is recommended to refer the female partner to a physician specialised or \n\nexperienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. \n\n \n\nContraception \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use at least one effective method of contraception for at least \n\n4 weeks before therapy, during therapy, and until at least 4 weeks after pomalidomide therapy and even in \n\ncase of dose interruption unless the patient commits to absolute and continuous abstinence confirmed on a \n\nmonthly basis. If not established on effective contraception, the patient must be referred to an \n\nappropriately trained health care professional for contraceptive advice in order that contraception can be \n\ninitiated. \n\n \n\nThe following can be considered to be examples of suitable methods of contraception: \n\n• Implant \n\n• Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system \n\n• Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot \n\n• Tubal sterilisation \n\n• Sexual intercourse with a vasectomised male partner only; vasectomy must be confirmed by two \n\nnegative semen analyses \n\n• Ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only pills (i.e. desogestrel) \n\n \n\nBecause of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with multiple myeloma taking \n\npomalidomide and dexamethasone, combined oral contraceptive pills are not recommended (see also \n\nsection 4.5). If a patient is currently using combined oral contraception the patient should switch to one of \n\nthe effective methods listed above. The risk of venous thromboembolism continues for 4-6 weeks after \n\ndiscontinuing combined oral contraception. The efficacy of contraceptive steroids may be reduced during \n\ncotreatment with dexamethasone (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nImplants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an increased risk of \n\ninfection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. Prophylactic antibiotics should be \n\nconsidered particularly in patients with neutropenia. \n\n \n\nInsertion of copper-releasing intrauterine devices is not recommended due to the potential risks of \n\ninfection at the time of insertion and menstrual blood loss which may compromise patients with severe \n\nneutropenia or severe thrombocytopenia. \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\nPregnancy testing \n\n \n\nAccording to local practice, medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of \n\n25 mIU/mL must be performed for women of childbearing potential as outlined below. This requirement \n\nincludes women of childbearing potential who practice absolute and continuous abstinence. Ideally, \n\npregnancy testing, issuing a prescription and dispensing should occur on the same day. Dispensing of \n\npomalidomide to women of childbearing potential should occur within 7 days of the prescription. \n\n \n\nPrior to starting treatment \n\nA medically supervised pregnancy test should be performed during the consultation, when pomalidomide \n\nis prescribed, or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber once the patient had been using effective \n\ncontraception for at least 4 weeks. The test should ensure the patient is not pregnant when she starts \n\ntreatment with pomalidomide. \n\n \n\nFollow-up and end of treatment \n\nA medically supervised pregnancy test should be repeated at least every 4 weeks, including at least \n\n4 weeks after the end of treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal sterilisation. These pregnancy \n\ntests should be performed on the day of the prescribing visit or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the \n\nprescriber. \n\n \n\nAdditional precautions \n\n \n\nPatients should be instructed never to give this medicinal product to another person and to return any \n\nunused capsules to their pharmacist at the end of treatment. \n\n \n\nPatients should not donate blood, semen or sperm during treatment (including during dose interruptions) \n\nand for 7 days following discontinuation of pomalidomide. \n\n \n\nHealthcare professionals and caregivers should wear disposable gloves when handling the blister or \n\ncapsule. Women who are pregnant or suspect they may be pregnant should not handle the blister or \n\ncapsule (see section 6.6) \n\n \n\nEducational materials, prescribing and dispensing restrictions \n\n \n\nIn order to assist patients in avoiding foetal exposure to pomalidomide, the Marketing Authorisation \n\nHolder will provide educational material to health care professionals to reinforce the warnings about the \n\nexpected teratogenicity of pomalidomide, to provide advice on contraception before therapy is started, \n\nand to provide guidance on the need for pregnancy testing. The prescriber must inform the patient about \n\nthe expected teratogenic risk and the strict pregnancy prevention measures as specified in the Pregnancy \n\nPrevention Programme and provide patients with appropriate patient educational brochure, patient card \n\nand/or equivalent tool in accordance with the national implemented patient card system. A national \n\ncontrolled distribution system has been implemented in collaboration with each National Competent \n\nAuthority. The controlled distribution system includes the use of a patient card and/or equivalent tool for \n\nprescribing and /or dispensing controls, and the collection of detailed data relating to the indication in \n\norder to monitor the off-label use within the national territory. Ideally, pregnancy testing, issuing a \n\nprescription and dispensing should occur on the same day. Dispensing of pomalidomide to women of \n\nchildbearing potential should occur within 7 days of the prescription and following a medically \n\nsupervised negative pregnancy test result. Prescriptions for women of childbearing potential can be for a \n\nmaximum duration of treatment of 4 weeks according to the approved indications dosing regimens (see \n\nsection 4.2), and prescriptions for all other patients can be for a maximum duration of 12 weeks. \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nHaematological events \n\n \n\nNeutropenia was the most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 haematological adverse reaction in patients \n\nwith relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, followed by anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Patients should \n\nbe monitored for haematological adverse reactions, especially neutropenia. Patients should be advised to \n\nreport febrile episodes promptly. Physicians should observe patients for signs of bleeding including \n\nepistaxes, especially with use of concomitant medicinal products known to increase the risk of bleeding \n\n(see section 4.8). Complete blood counts should be monitored at baseline, weekly for the first 8 weeks \n\nand monthly thereafter. A dose modification may be required (see section 4.2). Patients may require use \n\nof blood product support and /or growth factors. \n\n \n\nThromboembolic events \n\n \n\nPatients receiving pomalidomide either in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone or in \n\ncombination with dexamethasone have developed venous thromboembolic events (predominantly deep \n\nvein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and arterial thrombotic events (myocardial infarction and \n\ncerebrovascular accident). Patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism – including prior \n\nthrombosis – should be closely monitored. Action should be taken to try to minimise all modifiable risk \n\nfactors (e.g. smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia). Patients and physicians are advised to be \n\nobservant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. Patients should be instructed to seek medical \n\ncare if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, arm or leg swelling. Anti-\n\ncoagulation therapy (unless contraindicated) is recommended, (such as acetylsalicylic acid, warfarin, \n\nheparin or clopidogrel), especially in patients with additional thrombotic risk factors. A decision to take \n\nprophylactic measures should be made after a careful assessment of the individual patient’s underlying \n\nrisk factors. In clinical studies, patients received prophylactic acetylsalicylic acid or alternative anti-\n\nthrombotic therapy. The use of erythropoietic agents carries a risk of thrombotic events including \n\nthromboembolism. Therefore, erythropoietic agents, as well as other agents that may increase the risk of \n\nthromboembolic events, should be used with caution. \n\n \n\nThyroid disorders \n\n \n\nCases of hypothyroidism have been reported. Optimal control of co-morbid conditions influencing \n\nthyroid function is recommended before start of treatment. Baseline and ongoing monitoring of thyroid \n\nfunction is recommended. \n\n \n\nPeripheral neuropathy \n\n \n\nPatients with ongoing ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy were excluded from clinical studies with \n\npomalidomide. Appropriate caution should be exercised when considering the treatment of such patients \n\nwith pomalidomide. \n\n \n\nSignificant cardiac dysfunction \n\n \n\nPatients with significant cardiac dysfunction (congestive heart failure [NY Heart Association Class III \n\nor IV]; myocardial infarction within 12 months of starting study; unstable or poorly controlled angina \n\npectoris) were excluded from clinical studies with pomalidomide. Cardiac events, including congestive \n\ncardiac failure, pulmonary oedema and atrial fibrillation (see section 4.8), have been reported, mainly in \n\npatients with pre-existing cardiac disease or cardiac risk factors. Appropriate caution should be exercised \n\nwhen considering the treatment of such patients with pomalidomide, including periodic monitoring for \n\nsigns or symptoms of cardiac events. \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\nTumour lysis syndrome \n\n \n\nPatients at greatest risk of tumour lysis syndrome are those with high tumour burden prior to treatment. \n\nThese patients should be monitored closely and appropriate precautions taken. \n\n \n\nSecond primary malignancies \n\n \n\nSecond primary malignancies, such as non-melanoma skin cancer, have been reported in patients \n\nreceiving pomalidomide (see section 4.8). Physicians should carefully evaluate patients before and during \n\ntreatment using standard cancer screening for occurrence of second primary malignancies and institute \n\ntreatment as indicated. \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions and severe skin reactions \n\n \n\nAngioedema, anaphylactic reaction and severe dermatologic reactions including SJS, TEN and DRESS \n\nhave been reported with the use of pomalidomide (see section 4.8). Patients should be advised of the signs \n\nand symptoms of these reactions by their prescribers and should be told to seek medical attention \n\nimmediately if they develop these symptoms. Pomalidomide must be discontinued for exfoliative or \n\nbullous rash, or if SJS, TEN or DRESS is suspected, and should not be resumed following discontinuation \n\nfor these reactions. Patients with a prior history of serious allergic reactions associated with thalidomide \n\nor lenalidomide were excluded from clinical studies. Such patients may be at higher risk of \n\nhypersensitivity reactions and should not receive pomalidomide. Pomalidomide interruption or \n\ndiscontinuation should be considered for Grade 2-3 skin rash. Pomalidomide must be discontinued \n\npermanently for angioedema and anaphylactic reaction. \n\n \n\nDizziness and confusion \n\n \n\nDizziness and confusional state have been reported with pomalidomide. Patients must avoid situations \n\nwhere dizziness or confusion may be a problem and not to take other medicinal products that may cause \n\ndizziness or confusion without first seeking medical advice. \n\n \n\nInterstitial lung disease (ILD) \n\n \n\nILD and related events, including cases of pneumonitis, have been observed with pomalidomide. Careful \n\nassessment of patients with an acute onset or unexplained worsening of pulmonary symptoms should be \n\nperformed to exclude ILD. Pomalidomide should be interrupted pending investigation of these symptoms \n\nand if ILD is confirmed, appropriate treatment should be initiated. Pomalidomide should only be resumed \n\nafter a thorough evaluation of the benefits and the risks. \n\n \n\nHepatic disorders \n\n \n\nMarkedly elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin have been observed in patients treated \n\nwith pomalidomide (see section 4.8). There have also been cases of hepatitis that resulted in \n\ndiscontinuation of pomalidomide. Regular monitoring of liver function is recommended for the first \n\n6 months of treatment with pomalidomide and as clinically indicated thereafter. \n\n \n\nInfections \n\n \n\nReactivation of hepatitis B has been reported rarely in patients receiving pomalidomide in combination \n\nwith dexamethasone who have previously been infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Some of these \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\ncases have progressed to acute hepatic failure, resulting in discontinuation of pomalidomide. Hepatitis B \n\nvirus status should be established before initiating treatment with pomalidomide. For patients who test \n\npositive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is \n\nrecommended. Caution should be exercised when pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone is \n\nused in patients previously infected with HBV, including patients who are anti-HBc positive but HBsAg \n\nnegative. These patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection \n\nthroughout therapy. \n\n \n\nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) \n\n \n\nCases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, including fatal cases, have been reported with \n\npomalidomide. PML was reported several months to several years after starting the treatment with \n\npomalidomide. Cases have generally been reported in patients taking concomitant dexamethasone or prior \n\ntreatment with other immunosuppressive chemotherapy. Physicians should monitor patients at regular \n\nintervals and should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or worsening \n\nneurological symptoms, cognitive or behavioural signs or symptoms. Patients should also be advised to \n\ninform their partner or caregivers about their treatment, since they may notice symptoms that the patient \n\nis not aware of. \n\n \n\nThe evaluation for PML should be based on neurological examination, magnetic resonance imaging of the \n\nbrain, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis for JC virus (JCV) DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or a \n\nbrain biopsy with testing for JCV. A negative JCV PCR does not exclude PML. Additional follow-up and \n\nevaluation may be warranted if no alternative diagnosis can be established.  \n\n \n\nIf PML is suspected, further dosing must be suspended until PML has been excluded. If PML is \n\nconfirmed, pomalidomide must be permanently discontinued. \n\n \n\nSodium content \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, i.e. essentially \n\n‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\nFor information on other medicinal products given in combination with Imnovid, refer to the respective \n\ncurrent SmPC. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nEffect of pomalidomide on other medicinal products \n\n \n\nPomalidomide is not anticipated to cause clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions due \n\nto P450 isoenzyme inhibition or induction or transporter inhibition when co-administered with substrates \n\nof these enzymes or transporters. The potential for such drug-drug interactions, including the potential \n\nimpact of pomalidomide on the pharmacokinetics of combined oral contraceptives, has not been evaluated \n\nclinically (see section 4.4 Teratogenicity). \n\n \n\nEffect of other medicinal products on pomalidomide \n\n \n\nPomalidomide is partly metabolised by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4/5. It is also a substrate for P-glycoprotein. \n\nCo-administration of pomalidomide with the strong CYP3A4/5 and P-gp inhibitor ketoconazole, or the \n\nstrong CYP3A4/5 inducer carbamazepine, had no clinically relevant effect on exposure to pomalidomide. \n\nCo-administration of the strong CYP1A2 inhibitor fluvoxamine with pomalidomide in the presence of \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nketoconazole, increased mean exposure to pomalidomide by 107% with a 90% confidence interval [91% \n\nto 124%] compared to pomalidomide plus ketoconazole. In a second study to evaluate the contribution of \n\na CYP1A2 inhibitor alone to metabolism changes, co-administration of fluvoxamine alone with \n\npomalidomide increased mean exposure to pomalidomide by 125% with a 90% confidence interval [98% \n\nto 157%] compared to pomalidomide alone. If strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g. ciprofloxacin, enoxacin \n\nand fluvoxamine) are co-administered with pomalidomide, reduce the dose of pomalidomide by 50%. \n\n \n\nDexamethasone \n\n \n\nCo-administration of multiple doses of up to 4 mg pomalidomide with 20 mg to 40 mg dexamethasone (a \n\nweak to moderate inducer of several CYP enzymes including CYP3A) to patients with multiple myeloma \n\nhad no effect on the pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide compared with pomalidomide administered \n\nalone. \n\n \n\nThe effect of dexamethasone on warfarin is unknown. Close monitoring of warfarin concentration is \n\nadvised during treatment. \n\n \n\nFor information on other medicinal products given in combination with Imnovid, refer to the respective \n\ncurrent SmPC.  \n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective method of contraception. If pregnancy occurs in a \n\nwoman treated with pomalidomide, treatment must be stopped and the patient should be referred to a \n\nphysician specialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. If pregnancy occurs in a \n\npartner of a male patient taking pomalidomide, it is recommended to refer the female partner to a \n\nphysician specialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. Pomalidomide is present in \n\nhuman semen. As a precaution, all male patients taking pomalidomide should use condoms throughout \n\ntreatment duration, during dose interruption and for 7 days after cessation of treatment if their partner is \n\npregnant or of childbearing potential and has no contraception (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nA teratogenic effect of pomalidomide in humans is expected. Pomalidomide is contraindicated during \n\npregnancy and in women of childbearing potential, except when all the conditions for pregnancy \n\nprevention have been met, see section 4.3 and section 4.4. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether pomalidomide is excreted in human milk. Pomalidomide was detected in milk of \n\nlactating rats following administration to the mother. Because of the potential for adverse reactions in \n\nbreastfed infants from pomalidomide, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or \n\nto discontinue the medicinal product, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and \n\nthe benefit of the therapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\nPomalidomide was found to impact negatively on fertility and be teratogenic in animals. Pomalidomide \n\ncrossed the placenta and was detected in foetal blood following administration to pregnant rabbits, see \n\nsection 5.3. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nPomalidomide has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue, \n\ndepressed level of consciousness, confusion, and dizziness have been reported with the use of \n\npomalidomide. If affected, patients should be instructed not to drive cars, use machines or perform \n\nhazardous tasks while being treated with pomalidomide. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\n• Pomalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone \n\nThe most commonly reported blood and lymphatic system disorders were neutropenia (46.8%), \n\nthrombocytopenia (36.7%) and anaemia (28.4%). The most frequently reported adverse reaction was \n\nperipheral sensory neuropathy (47.8%). The most commonly reported Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions \n\nwere blood and lymphatic system disorders including neutropenia (41.7%), thrombocytopenia (27.3%) \n\nand anaemia (14.0%). The most commonly reported serious adverse reaction was pneumonia (11.5%). \n\nOther serious adverse reactions reported included pyrexia (4.0%), lower respiratory tract infection (2.9%), \n\npulmonary embolism (2.9%), influenza (2.9%), and acute kidney injury (2.9%).  \n\n  \n\n• Pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical studies have been blood and lymphatic system \n\ndisorders including anaemia (45.7%), neutropenia (45.3%) and thrombocytopenia (27%); in general \n\ndisorders and administration site conditions including fatigue (28.3%), pyrexia (21%) and oedema \n\nperipheral (13%); and in infections and infestations including pneumonia (10.7%). Peripheral neuropathy \n\nadverse reactions were reported in 12.3% of patients and venous embolic or thrombotic (VTE) adverse \n\nreactions were reported in 3.3% of patients. The most commonly reported Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions \n\nwere in the blood and lymphatic system disorders including neutropenia (41.7%), anaemia (27%) and \n\nthrombocytopenia (20.7%); in infections and infestations including pneumonia (9%); and in general \n\ndisorders and administration site conditions including fatigue (4.7%), pyrexia (3%) and oedema \n\nperipheral (1.3%). The most commonly reported serious adverse reaction was pneumonia (9.3%). Other \n\nserious adverse reactions reported included febrile neutropenia (4.0%), neutropenia (2.0%), \n\nthrombocytopenia (1.7%) and VTE adverse reactions (1.7 %). \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions tended to occur more frequently within the first 2 cycles of treatment with \n\npomalidomide. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\n• Pomalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone \n\nIn randomised study CC-4047-MM-007, 278 patients received pomalidomide, bortezomib and \n\ndexamethasone (Pom+Btz+Dex arm). See section 4.2 for dosing information. \n\n \n\nThe adverse reactions observed in patients treated with pomalidomide in combination with bortezomib \n\nand dexamethasone are listed in Table 7 by system organ class (SOC) and frequency for all adverse \n\nreactions and for Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nFrequencies for Pom+Btz+Dex (any grade) are defined in accordance with current guidance, as: very \n\ncommon (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10); and uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100). \n\n \n\nTable 7.

Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active \n\nsubstance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. Pomalidomide was found to be teratogenic in \n\nboth rats and rabbits when administered during the period of major organogenesis (see sections 4.6 \n\nand 5.3). If pomalidomide is taken during pregnancy, a teratogenic effect of pomalidomide in humans is \n\nexpected (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nNeutropenia and thrombocytopenia \n\nIn patients receiving combination therapy with pomalidomide in clinical studies, neutropenia occurred in \n\nup to 46.8% of patients (41.7% Grade 3 or 4). Neutropenia did not lead to pomalidomide discontinuation \n\nin any patient and was infrequently serious.  \n\n \n\nFebrile neutropenia (FN) was reported in 3.2-6.7% of patients and was serious in 1.8-4.0% of patients \n\n(see section 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn patients receiving combination therapy with pomalidomide in clinical studies, thrombocytopenia \n\noccurred in 27.0-36.7% of patients. Thrombocytopenia was Grade 3 or 4 in 20.7-27.3% of patients, led to \n\npomalidomide discontinuation in 0.7% of patients and was serious in 0.4-1.7% of patients (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nNeutropenia and thrombocytopenia tended to occur more frequently within the first 2 cycles of treatment \n\nwith pomalidomide. \n\n \n\nInfection \n\nInfection was the most common non haematological toxicity. \n\n \n\nIn patients receiving combination therapy with pomalidomide in clinical studies, infection occurred in \n\n55.0-80.2% of patients (24.0-30.9% Grade 3 or 4). Upper respiratory tract infection and pneumonia were \n\nthe most frequently occurring infections. Fatal infections (Grade 5) occurred in 2.7-4.0% of patients. \n\nInfections led to pomalidomide discontinuation in 2.0-2.9% of patients. \n\n \n\nThromboembolic events \n\nProphylaxis with acetylsalicylic acid (and other anticoagulants in high risk patients) was mandatory for all \n\npatients in clinical studies. Anticoagulation therapy (unless contraindicated) is recommended (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn patients receiving combination therapy with pomalidomide in clinical studies, venous thromboembolic \n\nevents (VTE) occurred in 3.3-11.5% of patients (1.3-5.4% Grade 3 or 4). VTE was reported as serious in \n\n1.7-4.3% of patients, no fatal reactions were reported, and VTE was associated with pomalidomide \n\ndiscontinuation in up to 1.8% of patients. \n\n \n\nPeripheral neuropathy \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\n• Pomalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone \n\nPatients with ongoing peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade 2 with pain within 14 days prior to randomisation \n\nwere excluded from clinical trials. Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 55.4 % of patients (10.8% Grade 3; \n\n0.7% Grade 4). Exposure-adjusted rates were comparable across treatment arms. Approximately 30% of \n\nthe patients experiencing peripheral neuropathy had a history of neuropathy at baseline. Peripheral \n\nneuropathy led to discontinuation of bortezomib in approximately 12.9% of patients, pomalidomide in \n\n1.8% and dexamethasone in 2.2 - 8.9% of patients, respectively. Refer also to the bortezomib SmPC. \n\n \n\n• Pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone \n\nPatients with ongoing peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade 2 were excluded from clinical studies. Peripheral \n\nneuropathy occurred in 12.3% of patients (1.0% Grade 3 or 4). No peripheral neuropathy reactions were \n\nreported as serious, and peripheral neuropathy led to dose discontinuation in 0.3% of patients (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nHaemorrhage \n\nHaemorrhagic disorders have been reported with pomalidomide, especially in patients with risk factors \n\nsuch as concomitant medicinal products that increase susceptibility to bleeding. Haemorrhagic events \n\nhave included epistaxis, intracranial haemorrhage and gastrointestinal haemorrhage. \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions and severe skin reactions \n\nAngioedema, anaphylactic reaction and severe cutaneous reactions including SJS, TEN and DRESS have \n\nbeen reported with the use of pomalidomide. Patients with a history of severe rash associated with \n\nlenalidomide or thalidomide should not receive pomalidomide (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \n\nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nPomalidomide doses as high as 50 mg as a single dose in healthy volunteers, and 10 mg as once-daily \n\nmultiple doses in multiple myeloma patients have been studied without reported serious adverse reactions \n\nrelated to overdose. In studies, pomalidomide was found to be removed by haemodialysis. \n\n \n\nIn the event of overdose, supportive care is advised. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Other immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AX06 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nPomalidomide has direct anti-myeloma tumoricidal activity, immunomodulatory activities and inhibits \n\nstromal cell support for multiple myeloma tumour cell growth. Specifically, pomalidomide inhibits \n\nproliferation and induces apoptosis of haematopoietic tumour cells. Additionally, pomalidomide inhibits \n\nthe proliferation of lenalidomide-resistant multiple myeloma cell lines and synergises with \n\ndexamethasone in both lenalidomide-sensitive and lenalidomide-resistant cell lines to induce tumour cell \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\napoptosis. Pomalidomide enhances T cell- and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated immunity and inhibits \n\nproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α and IL-6) by monocytes. Pomalidomide also \n\ninhibits angiogenesis by blocking the migration and adhesion of endothelial cells. \n\n \n\nPomalidomide binds directly to the protein cereblon (CRBN), which is part of an E3 ligase complex that \n\nincludes deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage-binding protein 1(DDB1), cullin 4 (CUL4), and regulator \n\nof cullins-1 (Roc1), and can inhibit the auto-ubiquitination of CRBN within the complex. E3 ubiquitin \n\nligases are responsible for the poly-ubiquitination of a variety of substrate proteins, and may partially \n\nexplain the pleiotropic cellular effects observed with pomalidomide treatment. \n\n \n\nIn the presence of pomalidomide in vitro, substrate proteins Aiolos and Ikaros are targeted for \n\nubiquitination and subsequent degradation leading to direct cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects. In \n\nvivo, pomalidomide therapy led to reduction in the levels of Ikaros in patients with relapsed lenalidomide-\n\nrefractory multiple myeloma. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\n• Pomalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone \n\nThe efficacy and safety of pomalidomide in combination with bortezomib and low-dose dexamethasone \n\n(Pom+Btz+LD-Dex) was compared with bortezomib and low-dose dexamethasone (Btz+LD-Dex) in a \n\nPhase III multi-centre, randomised, open-label study (CC-4047-MM-007), in previously treated adult \n\npatients with multiple myeloma, who had received at least one prior regimen, including lenalidomide and \n\nhave demonstrated disease progression on or after the last therapy. A total of 559 patients were enrolled \n\nand randomised in the study: 281 in the Pom+Btz+LD-Dex arm and 278 in the Btz+LD-Dex arm. 54% of \n\npatients were male with median age for the overall population of 68 years (min, max: 27, 89 years). \n\nApproximately 70% of patients were refractory to lenalidomide (71.2% in Pom+Btz+LD-Dex, 68.7 % in \n\nBtz+LD-Dex). Approximately 40% of patients were in 1st relapse and approximately 73% of patients \n\nreceived bortezomib as prior treatment. \n\n \n\nPatients in the Pom+Btz+LD-Dex arm were administered 4 mg pomalidomide orally on Days 1 to 14 of \n\neach 21-day cycle. Bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2/dose) was administered to patients in both study arms on Days \n\n1, 4, 8 and 11 of a 21-day cycle for Cycles 1 to 8; and on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle for Cycles 9 and \n\nonwards. Low-dose dexamethasone (20 mg/day [≤ 75 years old] or 10 mg/day [> 75 years old]) was \n\nadministered to patients in both study arms on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 12 of a 21-day cycle for Cycles \n\n1 to 8; and on Days 1, 2, 8 and 9 of each subsequent 21-day cycle from Cycles 9 onwards. Doses were \n\nreduced and treatment was temporarily interrupted or stopped as needed to manage toxicity (see section \n\n4.2).  \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was Progression Free Survival (PFS) assessed by an Independent \n\nResponse Adjudication Committee (IRAC) according to the IMWG criteria using the intent to treat \n\npopulation (ITT). After a median follow-up of 15.9 months, median PFS time was 11.20 months (95% \n\nCI: 9.66, 13.73) in the Pom+Btz+LD-Dex arm. In the Btz+LD-Dex arm, median PFS time was 7.1 \n\nmonths (95% CI: 5.88, 8.48).  \n\n \n\nSummary of overall efficacy data are presented in Table 10 using a cut-off date of 26 Oct 2017.

Treatment continued until patients had disease progression. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was progression free survival by International Myeloma Working Group \n\n(IMWG criteria). For the intention to treat (ITT) population, median PFS time by Independent Review \n\nAdjudication Committee (IRAC) review based on IMWG criteria was 15.7 weeks (95% CI: 13.0, 20.1) in \n\nthe Pom + LD-Dex arm; the estimated 26-week event-free survival rate was 35.99% (±3.46%). In the \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\nHD-Dex arm, median PFS time was 8.0 weeks (95% CI: 7.0, 9.0); the estimated 26-week event-free \n\nsurvival rate was 12.15% (±3.63%). \n\n \n\nPFS was evaluated in several relevant subgroups: gender, race, ECOG performance status, stratification \n\nfactors (age, disease population, prior anti-myeloma therapies [2, > 2]), selected parameters of prognostic \n\nsignificance (baseline beta-2 microglobulin level, baseline albumin levels, baseline renal impairment, and \n\ncytogenetic risk), and exposure and refractoriness to prior anti-myeloma therapies. Regardless of the \n\nsubgroup evaluated, PFS was generally consistent with that observed in the ITT population for both \n\ntreatment groups. \n\n \n\nPFS is summarised in Table 11 for the ITT population. Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS for the ITT \n\npopulation is provided in Figure 2. \n\n \n\nTable 11.

The systemic exposure (AUC) \n\nof pomalidomide increases in an approximately linear and dose proportional manner. Following multiple \n\ndoses, pomalidomide has an accumulation ratio of 27 to 31% on AUC. \n\n \n\nCoadministration with a high-fat and high-calorie meal slows the rate of absorption, decreasing mean \n\nplasma Cmax by approximately 27%, but has minimal effect on the overall extent of absorption with an 8% \n\ndecrease in mean AUC. Therefore, pomalidomide can be administered without regard to food intake. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nPomalidomide has a mean apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) between 62 and 138 L at steady state. \n\nPomalidomide is distributed in semen of healthy subjects at a concentration of approximately 67% of \n\nplasma level at 4 hours post-dose (approximately Tmax) after 4 days of once daily dosing at 2 mg. In vitro \n\nbinding of pomalidomide enantiomers to proteins in human plasma ranges from 12% to 44% and is not \n\nconcentration dependent. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nPomalidomide is the major circulating component (approximately 70% of plasma radioactivity) in vivo in \n\nhealthy subjects who received a single oral dose of [14C]-pomalidomide (2 mg). No metabolites were \n\npresent at >10% relative to parent or total radioactivity in plasma. \n\n \n\nThe predominant metabolic pathways of excreted radioactivity are hydroxylation with subsequent \n\nglucuronidation, or hydrolysis. In vitro, CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 were identified as the primary enzymes \n\ninvolved in the CYP-mediated hydroxylation of pomalidomide, with additional minor contributions from \n\nCYP2C19 and CYP2D6. Pomalidomide is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein in vitro. Co-administration \n\nof pomalidomide with the strong CYP3A4/5 and P-gp inhibitor ketoconazole, or the strong CYP3A4/5 \n\ninducer carbamazepine, had no clinically relevant effect on exposure to pomalidomide. Co-administration \n\nof the strong CYP1A2 inhibitor fluvoxamine with pomalidomide in the presence of ketoconazole, \n\nincreased mean exposure to pomalidomide by 107% with a 90% confidence interval [91% to 124%] \n\ncompared to pomalidomide plus ketoconazole. In a second study to evaluate the contribution of a \n\nCYP1A2 inhibitor alone to metabolism changes, co-administration of fluvoxamine alone with \n\npomalidomide increased mean exposure to pomalidomide by 125% with a 90% confidence interval [98% \n\nto 157%] compared to pomalidomide alone. If strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g. ciprofloxacin, enoxacin \n\nand fluvoxamine) are co-administered with pomalidomide, reduce the dose of pomalidomide to 50%. \n\nAdministration of pomalidomide in smokers, with smoking tobacco known to induce the CYP1A2 \n\nisoform, had no clinically relevant effect on exposure to pomalidomide compared to that exposure to \n\npomalidomide observed in non-smokers. \n\n \n\nBased on in vitro data, pomalidomide is not an inhibitor or inducer of cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes, and \n\ndoes not inhibit any drug transporters that were studied. Clinically relevant drug-drug interactions are not \n\nanticipated when pomalidomide is coadministered with substrates of these pathways. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nPomalidomide is eliminated with a median plasma half-life of approximately 9.5 hours in healthy subjects \n\nand approximately 7.5 hours in patients with multiple myeloma. Pomalidomide has a mean total body \n\nclearance (CL/F) of approximately 7-10 L/hr. \n\n \n\nFollowing a single oral administration of [14C] -pomalidomide (2 mg) to healthy subjects, approximately \n\n73% and 15% of the radioactive dose was eliminated in urine and faeces, respectively, with \n\napproximately 2% and 8% of the dosed radiocarbon eliminated as pomalidomide in urine and faeces. \n\n \n\nPomalidomide is extensively metabolised prior to excretion, with the resulting metabolites eliminated \n\nprimarily in the urine. The 3 predominant metabolites in urine (formed via hydrolysis or hydroxylation \n\nwith subsequent glucuronidation) account for approximately 23%, 17%, and 12%, respectively, of the \n\ndose in the urine. \n\n \n\nCYP dependent metabolites account for approximately 43% of the total excreted radioactivity, while non-\n\nCYP dependent hydrolytic metabolites account for 25%, and excretion of unchanged pomalidomide \n\naccounted for 10% (2% in urine and 8% in faeces). \n\n \n\nPopulation Pharmacokinetics (PK) \n\n \n\nBased on population PK analysis using a two-compartment model, healthy subjects and MM patients had \n\ncomparable apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent central volume of distribution (V2/F). In peripheral \n\ntissues, pomalidomide was preferentially taken up by tumors with apparent peripheral distribution \n\nclearance (Q/F) and apparent peripheral volume of distribution (V3/F) 3.7-fold and 8-fold higher, \n\nrespectively, than that of healthy subjects. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nNo data are available on administration of pomalidomide to paediatric patients (< 18 years of age). \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analyses in healthy subjects and multiple myeloma patients, no \n\nsignificant influence of age (19-83 years) on oral clearance of pomalidomide was observed. In clinical \n\nstudies, no dose adjustment was required in elderly (> 65 years) patients exposed to pomalidomide (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the pomalidomide pharmacokinetic parameters were \n\nnot remarkably affected in renally impaired patients (defined by creatinine clearance or estimated \n\nglomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) compared to patients with normal renal function \n\n(CrCl ≥60 mL/minute). Mean normalised AUC exposure to pomalidomide was 98.2% with a \n\n90% confidence interval [77.4% to 120.6%] in moderate renal impairment patients (eGFR ≥30 to \n\n≤45 mL/minute/1.73 m2) compared to patients with normal renal function. Mean normalised AUC \n\nexposure to pomalidomide was 100.2% with a 90% confidence interval [79.7% to 127.0%] in severe renal \n\nimpairment patients not requiring dialysis (CrCl <30 or eGFR <30 mL/minute/1.73 m2) compared to \n\npatients with normal renal function. Mean normalised AUC exposure to pomalidomide increased by \n\n35.8% with a 90% CI [7.5% to 70.0%] in severe renal impairment patients requiring dialysis \n\n(CrCl <30mL/minute requiring dialysis) compared to patients with normal renal function. The mean \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\nchanges in exposure to pomalidomide in each of these renal impairment groups are not of a magnitude \n\nthat requires dosage adjustments.  \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic parameters were modestly changed in hepatically impaired patients (defined by \n\nChild-Pugh criteria) compared to healthy subjects. Mean exposure to pomalidomide increased by 51% \n\nwith a 90% confidence interval [9% to 110%] in mildly hepatically impaired patients compared to healthy \n\nsubjects. Mean exposure to pomalidomide increased by 58% with a 90% confidence interval [13% to \n\n119%] in moderately hepatically impaired patients compared to healthy subjects. Mean exposure to \n\npomalidomide increased by 72% with a 90% confidence interval [24% to 138%] in severely hepatically \n\nimpaired patients compared to healthy subjects. The mean increases in exposure to pomalidomide in each \n\nof these impairment groups are not of a magnitude for which adjustments in schedule or dose are required \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nRepeat-dose toxicology studies \n\n \n\nIn rats, chronic administration of pomalidomide at doses of 50, 250, and 1000 mg/kg/day for 6 months \n\nwas well tolerated. No adverse findings were noted up to 1000 mg/kg/day (175-fold exposure ratio \n\nrelative to a 4 mg clinical dose).  \n\n \n\nIn monkeys, pomalidomide was evaluated in repeat-dose studies of up to 9 months in duration. In these \n\nstudies, monkeys exhibited greater sensitivity to pomalidomide effects than rats. The primary toxicities \n\nobserved in monkeys were associated with the haematopoietic/lymphoreticular systems. In the 9-month \n\nstudy in monkeys with doses of 0.05, 0.1, and 1 mg/kg/day, morbidity and early euthanasia of 6 animals \n\nwere observed at the dose of 1 mg/kg/day and were attributed to immunosuppressive effects \n\n(staphylococcal infection, decreased peripheral blood lymphocytes, chronic inflammation of the large \n\nintestine, histologic lymphoid depletion, and hypocellularity of bone marrow) at high exposures of \n\npomalidomide (15-fold exposure ratio relative to a 4 mg clinical dose). These immunosuppressive effects \n\nresulted in early euthanasia of 4 monkeys due to poor health condition (watery stool, inappetence, \n\nreduced food intake, and weight loss); histopathologic evaluation of these animals showed chronic \n\ninflammation of the large intestine and villous atrophy of the small intestine. Staphylococcal infection \n\nwas observed in 4 monkeys; 3 of these animals responded to antibiotic treatment and 1 died without \n\ntreatment. In addition, findings consistent with acute myelogenous leukemia led to euthanasia of 1 \n\nmonkey; clinical observations and clinical pathology and/or bone marrow alterations observed in this \n\nanimal were consistent with immunosuppression. Minimal or mild bile duct proliferation with associated \n\nincreases in ALP and GGT were also observed at 1 mg/kg/day. Evaluation of recovery animals indicated \n\nthat all treatment-related findings were reversible after 8 weeks of dosing cessation, except for \n\nproliferation of intrahepatic bile ducts observed in 1 animal in the 1 mg/kg/day group. The No Observed \n\nAdverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was 0.1 mg/kg/day (0.5-fold exposure ratio relative to a 4 mg clinical \n\ndose). \n\n \n\nGenotoxicity/carcinogenicity \n\n \n\nPomalidomide was not mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian mutation assays, and did not induce \n\nchromosomal aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocytes or micronuclei formation in \n\npolychromatic erythrocytes in bone marrow of rats administered doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day. \n\nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\nFertility and early embryonic development \n\n \n\nIn a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, pomalidomide was administered to males \n\nand females at dosages of 25, 250, and 1000 mg/kg/day. Uterine examination on Gestation Day 13 \n\nshowed a decrease in mean number of viable embryos and an increase in postimplantation loss at all \n\ndosage levels. Therefore, the NOAEL for these observed effects was < 25 mg/kg/day (AUC 24h was \n\n39960 ng•h/mL (nanogram•hour/millilitres) at this lowest dose tested, and the exposure ratio was 99-fold \n\nrelative to a 4 mg clinical dose). When treated males on this study were mated with untreated females, all \n\nuterine parameters were comparable to the controls. Based on these results, the observed effects were \n\nattributed to the treatment of females. \n\n \n\nEmbryo-foetal development  \n\n \n\nPomalidomide was found to be teratogenic in both rats and rabbits when administered during the period \n\nof major organogenesis. In the rat embryofoetal developmental toxicity study, malformations of absence \n\nof urinary bladder, absence of thyroid gland, and fusion and misalignment of lumbar and thoracic \n\nvertebral elements (central and/or neural arches) were observed at all dosage levels (25, 250, and \n\n1000 mg/kg/day).  \n\n \n\nThere was no maternal toxicity observed in this study. Therefore, the maternal NOAEL was \n\n1000 mg/kg/day, and the NOAEL for developmental toxicity was < 25 mg/kg/day (AUC24h was \n\n34340 ng•h/mL on Gestation Day 17 at this lowest dose tested, and the exposure ratio was 85-fold \n\nrelative to a 4 mg clinical dose). In rabbits, pomalidomide at dosages ranging from 10 to 250 mg/kg \n\nproduced embryo-foetal developmental malforma tions. Increased cardiac anomalies were seen at all \n\ndoses with significant increases at 250 mg/kg/day. At 100 and 250 mg/kg/day, there were slight increases \n\nin post-implantation loss and slight decreases in fetal body weights. At 250 mg/kg/day, fetal \n\nmalformations included limb anomalies (flexed and/or rotated fore- and/or hindlimbs, unattached or \n\nabsent digit) and associated skeletal malformations (not ossified metacarpal, misaligned phalanx and \n\nmetacarpal, absent digit, not ossified phalanx, and short not ossified or bent tibia); moderate dilation of \n\nthe lateral ventricle in the brain; abnormal placement of the right subclavian artery; absent intermediate \n\nlobe in the lungs; low-set kidney; altered liver morphology; incompletely or not ossified pelvis; an \n\nincreased average for supernumerary thoracic ribs and a reduced average for ossified tarsals. Slight \n\nreduction in maternal body weight gain, significant reduction in triglycerides, and significant decrease in \n\nabsolute and relative spleen weights were observed at 100 and 250 mg/kg/day. The maternal NOAEL was \n\n10 mg/kg/day, and the developmental NOAEL was <10 mg/kg/day (AUC24h was 418 ng•h/mL on \n\nGestation Day 19 at this lowest dose tested, which was similar to that obtained from a 4 mg clinical dose). \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

This medicine is related to thalidomide and \n\nbelongs to a group of medicines which affect the immune system (the body’s natural defences). \n\n \n\nWhat Imnovid is used for \n\nImnovid is used to treat adults with a type of cancer called ‘multiple myeloma’. \n\n \n\nImnovid is either used with: \n\n• two other medicines - called ‘bortezomib’ (a type of chemotherapy medicine) and \n\n‘dexamethasone’ (an anti-inflammatory medicine) in people who have had at least one other \n\ntreatment - including lenalidomide.  \n\n \n\nOr \n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n\n•  one other medicine - called ‘dexamethasone’ in people whose myeloma has become worse, \n\ndespite having at least two other treatments - including lenalidomide and bortezomib. \n\n \n\nWhat is multiple myeloma \n\nMultiple myeloma is a type of cancer which affects a certain type of white blood cell (called the ‘plasma \n\ncell’). These cells grow out of control and accumulate in the bone marrow. This results in damage to the \n\nbones and kidneys. \n\n \n\nMultiple myeloma generally cannot be cured. However, treatment can reduce the signs and symptoms of \n\nthe disease, or make them disappear for a period of time. When this happens, it is called ‘response’. \n\n \n\nHow Imnovid works \n\nImnovid works in a number of different ways: \n\n• by stopping the myeloma cells developing \n\n• by stimulating the immune system to attack the cancer cells \n\n• by stopping the formation of blood vessels supplying the cancer cells. \n\n \n\nThe benefit of using Imnovid with bortezomib and dexamethasone \n\nWhen Imnovid is used with bortezomib and dexamethasone, in people who have had at least one other \n\ntreatment, it can stop multiple myeloma getting worse: \n\n• On average, Imnovid when used with bortezomib and dexamethasone stopped multiple myeloma \n\nfrom coming back for up to 11 months - compared with 7 months for those patients who only \n\nused bortezomib and dexamethasone. \n\n \n\nThe benefit of using Imnovid with dexamethasone  \n\nWhen Imnovid is used with dexamethasone, in people who have had at least two other treatments, it can \n\nstop multiple myeloma getting worse: \n\n• On average, Imnovid when used with dexamethasone stopped multiple myeloma from coming back \n\nfor up to 4 months - compared with 2 months for those patients who used only dexamethasone. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Imnovid \n\n \n\nDo not take Imnovid: \n\n• if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant or are planning to become pregnant – this is \n\nbecause Imnovid is expected to be harmful to an unborn child. (Men and women taking this \n\nmedicine must read the section “Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding – information for \n\nwomen and men” below). \n\n• if you are able to become pregnant, unless you follow all the necessary measures to prevent you \n\nfrom becoming pregnant (see “Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding – information for \n\nwomen and men”). If you are able to become pregnant, your doctor will record with each \n\nprescription that the necessary measures have been taken and will provide you with this \n\nconfirmation. \n\n• if you are allergic to pomalidomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. \n\n \n\nIf you are uncertain whether any of the conditions above apply to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or \n\nnurse before taking Imnovid. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Imnovid if: \n\n• you have ever had blood clots in the past. During the treatment with Imnovid you have an increased \n\nrisk of getting blood clots in your veins and arteries. Your doctor may recommend you take \n\nadditional treatments (e.g. warfarin) or lower the dose of Imnovid to reduce the chance that you get \n\nblood clots.  \n\n• you have ever had an allergic reaction such as rash, itching, swelling, feeling dizzy or trouble \n\nbreathing while taking related medicines called ‘thalidomide’ or ‘lenalidomide’. \n\n• you have had a heart attack, have heart failure, have difficulty breathing, or if you smoke, have \n\nhigh blood pressure or high cholesterol levels. \n\n• you have a high total amount of tumour throughout the body, including your bone marrow. This \n\ncould lead to a condition where the tumours break down and cause unusual levels of chemicals in \n\nthe blood which can lead to kidney failure. You may also experience an uneven heartbeat. This \n\ncondition is called tumour lysis syndrome. \n\n• you have or have had neuropathy (nerve damage causing tingling or pain in your hands or feet). \n\n• you have or have ever had hepatitis B infection. Treatment with Imnovid may cause the hepatitis B \n\nvirus to become active again in patients who carry the virus, resulting in a recurrence of the \n\ninfection. Your doctor should check whether you have ever had hepatitis B infection. \n\n• you experience or have experienced in the past a combination of any of the following symptoms: \n\nrash on face or extended rash, red skin, high fever, flu-like symptoms, enlarged lymph nodes (signs \n\nof severe skin reaction called Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) \n\nor drug hypersensitivity syndrome, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) or Stevens-Johnson \n\nSyndrome (SJS). See also section 4 “Possible side effects”).  \n\n \n\nIt is important to note that patients with multiple myeloma treated with pomalidomide may develop \n\nadditional types of cancer, therefore your doctor should carefully evaluate the benefit and risk when you \n\nare prescribed this medicine. \n\n \n\nAt any time during or after your treatment, tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you: experience \n\nblurred, loss of or double vision, difficulty speaking, weakness in an arm or a leg, a change in the way \n\nyou walk or problems with your balance, persistent numbness, decreased sensation or loss of sensation, \n\nmemory loss or confusion. These may all be symptoms of a serious and potentially fatal brain condition \n\nknown as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). If you had these symptoms prior to \n\ntreatment with Imnovid, tell your doctor about any change in these symptoms. \n\n \n\nAt the end of the treatment you should return all unused capsules to the pharmacist. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding – information for women and men \n\nThe following must be followed as stated in the Imnovid Pregnancy Prevention Programme. \n\nWomen and men taking Imnovid must not become pregnant or father a child. This is because \n\npomalidomide is expected to harm the unborn baby. You and your partner should use effective methods \n\nof contraception while taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nWomen \n\nDo not take Imnovid if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. \n\nThis is because this medicine is expected to harm the unborn baby. Before starting the treatment, you \n\nshould tell your doctor if you are able to become pregnant, even if you think this is unlikely. \n\n \n\nIf you are able to become pregnant: \n\n\n\n \n\n62 \n\n• you must use effective methods of contraception for at least 4 weeks before starting treatment, for \n\nthe whole time you are taking treatment, and until at least 4 weeks after stopping treatment. Talk to \n\nyour doctor about the best method of contraception for you. \n\n• each time your doctor writes a prescription for you, he will ensure you understand the necessary \n\nmeasures that have to be taken to prevent pregnancy. \n\n• your doctor will arrange pregnancy tests before treatment, at least every 4 weeks during treatment, \n\nand at least 4 weeks after the treatment has finished. \n\n \n\nIf you become pregnant despite the prevention measures: \n\n• you must stop the treatment immediately and talk to your doctor straight away. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known if Imnovid passes into human breast milk. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or \n\nintend to breast-feed. Your doctor will advise if you should stop or continue breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nMen \n\nImnovid passes into human semen. \n\n \n\n• If your partner is pregnant or able to become pregnant, you must use condoms for the whole time \n\nyou are taking treatment and for 7 days after the end of treatment. \n\n• If your partner becomes pregnant while you are taking Imnovid, tell your doctor straight away. \n\nYour partner should also tell her doctor straight away. \n\n \n\nYou should not donate semen or sperm during treatment and for 7 days after the end of treatment. \n\n \n\nBlood donation and blood tests \n\nYou should not donate blood during treatment and for 7 days after the end of treatment. \n\nBefore and during the treatment with Imnovid you will have regular blood tests. This is because your \n\nmedicine may cause a fall in the number of blood cells that help fight infection (white cells) and in the \n\nnumber of cells that help to stop bleeding (platelets). \n\n \n\nYour doctor should ask you to have a blood test: \n\n• before treatment \n\n• every week for the first 8 weeks of treatment \n\n• at least every month after that for as long as you are taking Imnovid. \n\n \n\nAs a result of these tests, your doctor may change your dose of Imnovid or stop your treatment. The \n\ndoctor may also change the dose or stop the medicine because of your general health. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents  \n\nImnovid is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Imnovid \n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. This is because Imnovid can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other \n\nmedicines can affect the way Imnovid works. \n\n \n\nIn particular, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Imnovid if you are taking any of the \n\nfollowing medicines: \n\n• some antifungals such as ketaconazole \n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n\n• some antibiotics (for example ciprofloxacin, enoxacin) \n\n• certain antidepressants such as fluvoxamine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nSome people feel tired, dizzy, faint, confused or less alert when taking Imnovid. If this happens to you, do \n\nnot drive or operate tools or machinery. \n\n \n\nImnovid contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, therefore it is considered \n\nessentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Imnovid \n\n \n\nImnovid must be given to you by a doctor with experience in treating multiple myeloma. \n\n \n\nAlways take your medicines exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or \n\nnurse if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nWhen to take Imnovid with other medicines \n\n \n\nImnovid with bortezomib and dexamethasone \n\n• See the leaflets that come with bortezomib and dexamethasone for further information on their use \n\nand effects. \n\n• Imnovid, bortezomib and dexamethasone are taken in ‘treatment cycles’.
