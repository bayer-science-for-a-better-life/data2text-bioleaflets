PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nClear, colourless to slightly yellowish liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRixathon is indicated in adults for the following indications: \n \nNon-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) \n \nRixathon is indicated for the treatment of previously untreated patients with stage III-IV follicular \nlymphoma in combination with chemotherapy. \n \nRixathon maintenance therapy is indicated for the treatment of follicular lymphoma patients \nresponding to induction therapy. \n \nRixathon monotherapy is indicated for treatment of patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma \nwho are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nRixathon is indicated for the treatment of patients with CD20 positive diffuse large B cell \nnon-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, \nprednisolone) chemotherapy. \n \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) \n \nRixathon in combination with chemotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously \nuntreated and relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Only limited data are available on \nefficacy and safety for patients previously treated with monoclonal antibodies including rituximab or \npatients refractory to previous rituximab plus chemotherapy. \n \nSee section 5.1 for further information. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nRixathon in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with severe \nactive rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to other \ndisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) including one or more tumour necrosis factor \n(TNF) inhibitor therapies. \n \nRituximab has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and \nto improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. \n \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis \n \nRixathon, in combination with glucocorticoids, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with \nsevere, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener\u2019s) (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis \n(MPA). \n \nPemphigus vulgaris \n \nRixathon is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris (PV). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nRixathon should be administered under the close supervision of an experienced healthcare \nprofessional, and in an environment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nPremedication and prophylactic medications \n \nPremedication consisting of an anti-pyretic and an antihistaminic, e.g. paracetamol and \ndiphenhydramine, should always be given before each administration of Rixathon. \n \nIn patients with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, premedication with \nglucocorticoids should be considered if Rixathon is not given in combination with \nglucocorticoid-containing chemotherapy.  \n \nProphylaxis with adequate hydration and administration of uricostatics starting 48 hours prior to start \nof therapy is recommended for CLL patients to reduce the risk of tumour lysis syndrome. For CLL \npatients whose lymphocyte counts are > 25 x 109/L it is recommended to administer \nprednisone/prednisolone 100 mg intravenous shortly before infusion with Rixathon to decrease the \nrate and severity of acute infusion reactions and/or cytokine release syndrome. \n \nIn patients with rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener\u2019s) or microscopic \npolyangiitis in disease remission or pemphigus vulgaris, premedication with 100 mg intravenous \n\n\n\n4 \n\nmethylprednisolone should be completed 30 minutes prior to Rixathon infusions to decrease the \nincidence and severity of infusion related reactions (IRRs). \n \nIn patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener\u2019s) or microscopic polyangiitis, \nmethylprednisolone given intravenously for 1 to 3 days at a dose of 1,000 mg per day is recommended \nprior to the first infusion of Rixathon (the last dose of methylprednisolone may be given on the same \nday as the first infusion of Rixathon). This should be followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (not to \nexceed 80 mg/day, and tapered as rapidly as possible based on clinical need) during and after the 4 \nweek induction course of Rixathon treatment. \n \nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis is recommended for patients with GPA/MPA or \nPV during and following Rixathon treatment, as appropriate according to local clinical practice \nguidelines. \n \nPosology \n \nIt is important to check the medicinal product labels to ensure that the appropriate formulation is being \ngiven to the patient, as prescribed. \n \nNon-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma \n \nFollicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma \n \nCombination therapy \nThe recommended dose of Rixathon in combination with chemotherapy for induction treatment of \npreviously untreated or relapsed/ refractory patients with follicular lymphoma is: 375 mg/m2 body \nsurface area per cycle, for up to 8 cycles. \n \nRixathon should be administered on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle, after intravenous \nadministration of the glucocorticoid component of the chemotherapy if applicable. \n \nMaintenance therapy \n\n\u2022 Previously untreated follicular lymphoma \nThe recommended dose of Rixathon used as a maintenance treatment for patients with previously \nuntreated follicular lymphoma who have responded to induction treatment is: 375 mg/m2 body surface \narea once every 2 months (starting 2 months after the last dose of induction therapy) until disease \nprogression or for a maximum period of two years (12 infusions in total). \n \n\n\u2022 Relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma \nThe recommended dose of Rixathon used as a maintenance treatment for patients with \nrelapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma who have responded to induction treatment is: 375 mg/m2 \nbody surface area once every 3 months (starting 3 months after the last dose of induction therapy) until \ndisease progression or for a maximum period of two years (8 infusions in total). \n \nMonotherapy \n\n\u2022 Relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma \nThe recommended dose of Rixathon monotherapy used as induction treatment for adult patients with \nstage III-IV follicular lymphoma who are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse \nafter chemotherapy is: 375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered as an intravenous infusion once \nweekly for four weeks. \n \nFor retreatment with Rixathon monotherapy for patients who have responded to previous treatment \nwith rituximab monotherapy for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, the recommended dose is: \n375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered as an intravenous infusion once weekly for four weeks \n(see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nDiffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma \n \nRixathon should be used in combination with CHOP chemotherapy. The recommended dosage is \n375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle for 8 cycles after \nintravenous infusion of the glucocorticoid component of CHOP. Safety and efficacy of rituximab have \nnot been established in combination with other chemotherapies in diffuse large B cell non- Hodgkin\u2019s \nlymphoma. \n \nDose adjustments during treatment \n \nNo dose reductions of Rixathon are recommended. When Rixathon is given in combination with \nchemotherapy, standard dose reductions for the chemotherapeutic medicinal products should be \napplied. \n \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nThe recommended dosage of Rixathon in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated \nand relapsed/refractory patients is 375 mg/m2 body surface area administered on day 0 of the first \ntreatment cycle followed by 500 mg/m2 body surface area administered on day 1 of each subsequent \ncycle for 6 cycles in total. The chemotherapy should be given after Rixathon infusion. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nPatients treated with Rixathon must be given the patient alert card with each infusion. \n \nA course of Rixathon consists of two 1,000 mg intravenous infusions. The recommended dosage of \nRixathon is 1,000 mg by intravenous infusion followed by a second 1,000 mg intravenous infusion \ntwo weeks later. \n \nThe need for further courses should be evaluated 24 weeks following the previous course. Retreatment \nshould be given at that time if residual disease activity remains, otherwise retreatment should be \ndelayed until disease activity returns. \n \nAvailable data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 16 to 24 weeks of an initial \ntreatment course. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in patients who show no \nevidence of therapeutic benefit within this time period. \n \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis \n \nPatients treated with Rixathon must be given the patient alert card with each infusion. \n \nInduction of remission \nThe recommended dosage of Rixathon for induction of remission therapy of granulomatosis with \npolyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis is 375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered as an \nintravenous infusion once weekly for 4 weeks (four infusions in total). \n \nMaintenance treatment \nFollowing induction of remission with Rixathon, maintenance treatment should be initiated no sooner \nthan 16 weeks after the last rituximab infusion. \n \nFollowing induction of remission with other standard of care immunosuppressants, Rixathon \nmaintenance treatment should be initiated during the 4 week period that follows disease remission.  \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nRixathon should be administered as two 500 mg IV infusions separated by two weeks, followed by a \n500 mg IV infusion every 6 months thereafter. Patients should receive Rixathon for at least 24 months \nafter achievement of remission (absence of clinical signs and symptoms). For patients who may be at \nhigher risk for relapse, physicians should consider a longer duration of Rixathon maintenance therapy, \nup to 5 years. \n \nPemphigus vulgaris \n \nPatients treated with Rixathon must be given the patient alert card with each infusion. \n \nThe recommended dosage of Rixathon for the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris is 1000 mg \nadministered as an IV infusion followed two weeks later by a second 1000 mg IV infusion in \ncombination with a tapering course of glucocorticoids. \n \nMaintenance treatment \nA maintenance infusion of 500 mg IV should be administered at months 12 and 18, and then every 6 \nmonths thereafter if needed, based on clinical evaluation. \n \nTreatment of relapse \nIn the event of relapse, patients may receive 1000 mg IV. The healthcare provider should also consider \nresuming or increasing the patient\u2019s glucocorticoid dose based on clinical evaluation.  \n \nSubsequent infusions may be administered no sooner than 16 weeks following the previous infusion. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of rituximab in children below 18 years have not been established. No data are \navailable. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (aged > 65 years). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nRixathon is for intravenous use. The prepared Rixathon solution should be administered as an \nintravenous infusion through a dedicated line. It should not be administered as an intravenous push or \nbolus. \n \nPatients should be closely monitored for the onset of cytokine release syndrome (see section 4.4). \nPatients who develop evidence of severe reactions, especially severe dyspnoea, bronchospasm or \nhypoxia should have the infusion interrupted immediately. Patients with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma \nshould then be evaluated for evidence of tumour lysis syndrome including appropriate laboratory tests \nand, for pulmonary infiltration, with a chest X-ray. In all patients, the infusion should not be restarted \nuntil complete resolution of all symptoms, and normalisation of laboratory values and chest X-ray \nfindings. At this time, the infusion can be initially resumed at not more than one-half the previous rate. \nIf the same severe adverse reactions occur for a second time, the decision to stop the treatment should \nbe seriously considered on a case by case basis. \n \nMild or moderate infusion-related reactions (IRR) (section 4.8) usually respond to a reduction in the \nrate of infusion. The infusion rate may be increased upon improvement of symptoms. \n \nFirst infusion \n \nThe recommended initial rate for infusion is 50 mg/h; after the first 30 minutes, it can be escalated in \n50 mg/h increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/h. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nSubsequent infusions \n \nAll indications \n \nSubsequent doses of Rixathon can be infused at an initial rate of 100 mg/h, and increased by 100 mg/h \nincrements at 30 minute intervals, to a maximum of 400 mg/h. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis only \n \nAlternative subsequent, faster, infusion schedule \n \nIf patients did not experience a serious infusion related reaction with their first or subsequent infusions \nof a dose of 1,000 mg Rixathon administered over the standard infusion schedule, a more rapid \ninfusion can be administered for second and subsequent infusions using the same concentration as in \nprevious infusions (4 mg/mL in a 250 mL volume). Initiate at a rate of 250 mg/hour for the first \n30 minutes and then 600 mg/hour for the next 90 minutes. If the more rapid infusion is tolerated, this \ninfusion schedule can be used when administering subsequent infusions. \n \nPatients who have clinically significant cardiovascular disease, including arrhythmias, or previous \nserious infusion reactions to any prior biologic therapy or to rituximab, should not be administered the \nmore rapid infusion. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nContraindications for use in non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to murine proteins, or to any of the other excipients listed in \nsection 6.1. \n \nActive, severe infections (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients in a severely immunocompromised state. \n \nContraindications for use in rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic \npolyangiitis and pemphigus vulgaris \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to murine proteins, or to any of the other excipients listed in \nsection 6.1. \n \nActive, severe infections (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients in a severely immunocompromised state. \n \nSevere heart failure (New York Heart Association Class IV) or severe, uncontrolled cardiac disease \n(see section 4.4 regarding other cardiovascular diseases). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy \n \nAll patients treated with Rixathon for rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, \nmicroscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris must be given the patient alert card with each \n\n\n\n8 \n\ninfusion. The alert card contains important safety information for patients regarding potential \nincreased risk of infections, including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). \n \nVery rare cases of fatal PML have been reported following use of rituximab. Patients must be \nmonitored at regular intervals for any new or worsening neurological symptoms or signs that may be \nsuggestive of PML. If PML is suspected, further dosing must be suspended until PML has been \nexcluded. The clinician should evaluate the patient to determine if the symptoms are indicative of \nneurological dysfunction, and if so, whether these symptoms are possibly suggestive of PML. \nConsultation with a Neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. \n \nIf any doubt exists, further evaluation, including MRI scan preferably with contrast, cerebrospinal \nfluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat neurological assessments, should be considered. \n \nThe physician should be particularly alert to symptoms suggestive of PML that the patient may not \nnotice (e.g. cognitive, neurological or psychiatric symptoms). Patients should also be advised to \ninform their partner or caregivers about their treatment, since they may notice symptoms that the \npatient is not aware of. \n \nIf a patient develops PML, the dosing of Rixathon must be permanently discontinued. \n \nFollowing reconstitution of the immune system in immunocompromised patients with PML, \nstabilisation or improved outcome has been seen. It remains unknown if early detection of PML and \nsuspension of rituximab therapy may lead to similar stabilisation or improved outcome. \n \nNon-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nRituximab is associated with infusion-related reactions, which may be related to release of cytokines \nand/or other chemical mediators. Cytokine release syndrome may be clinically indistinguishable from \nacute hypersensitivity reactions. \n \nThis set of reactions which includes syndrome of cytokine release, tumour lysis syndrome and \nanaphylactic and hypersensitivity reactions are described below. \n \nSevere infusion-related reactions with fatal outcome have been reported during post-marketing use of \nthe rituximab intravenous formulation, with an onset ranging within 30 minutes to 2 hours after \nstarting the first rituximab intravenous infusion. They were characterised by pulmonary events and in \nsome cases included rapid tumour lysis and features of tumour lysis syndrome in addition to fever, \nchills, rigors, hypotension, urticaria, angioedema and other symptoms (see section 4.8). \n \nSevere cytokine release syndrome is characterised by severe dyspnoea, often accompanied by \nbronchospasm and hypoxia, in addition to fever, chills, rigors, urticaria, and angioedema. This \nsyndrome may be associated with some features of tumour lysis syndrome such as hyperuricaemia, \nhyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia, acute renal failure, elevated lactate \ndehydrogenase (LDH) and may be associated with acute respiratory failure and death. The acute \nrespiratory failure may be accompanied by events such as pulmonary interstitial infiltration or oedema, \nvisible on a chest X-ray. The syndrome frequently manifests itself within one or two hours of initiating \nthe first infusion. Patients with a history of pulmonary insufficiency or those with pulmonary tumour \ninfiltration may be at greater risk of poor outcome and should be treated with increased caution. \nPatients who develop severe cytokine release syndrome should have their infusion interrupted \nimmediately (see section 4.2) and should receive aggressive symptomatic treatment. Since initial \nimprovement of clinical symptoms may be followed by deterioration, these patients should be closely \nmonitored until tumour lysis syndrome and pulmonary infiltration have been resolved or ruled out. \nFurther treatment of patients after complete resolution of signs and symptoms has rarely resulted in \nrepeated severe cytokine release syndrome. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nPatients with a high tumour burden or with a high number (\u2265 25 x 109/L) of circulating malignant cells \nsuch as patients with CLL, who may be at higher risk of especially severe cytokine release syndrome, \nshould be treated with extreme caution. These patients should be very closely monitored throughout \nthe first infusion. Consideration should be given to the use of a reduced infusion rate for the first \ninfusion in these patients or a split dosing over two days during the first cycle and any subsequent \ncycles if the lymphocyte count is still > 25 x 109/L. \n \nInfusion-related adverse reactions of all kinds have been observed in 77% of patients treated with \nrituximab (including cytokine release syndrome accompanied by hypotension and bronchospasm in \n10% of patients) see section 4.8. These symptoms are usually reversible with interruption of rituximab \ninfusion and administration of an anti-pyretic, an antihistaminic and occasionally oxygen, intravenous \nsaline or bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids if required. Please see cytokine release syndrome above \nfor severe reactions. \n \nAnaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported following the intravenous \nadministration of proteins to patients. In contrast to cytokine release syndrome, true hypersensitivity \nreactions typically occur within minutes after starting infusion. Medicinal products for the treatment of \nhypersensitivity reactions, e.g. epinephrine (adrenaline), antihistamines and glucocorticoids, should be \navailable for immediate use in the event of an allergic reaction during administration of rituximab. \nClinical manifestations of anaphylaxis may appear similar to clinical manifestations of the cytokine \nrelease syndrome (described above). Reactions attributed to hypersensitivity have been reported less \nfrequently than those attributed to cytokine release. \n \nAdditional reactions reported in some cases were myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary \noedema and acute reversible thrombocytopenia. \n \nSince hypotension may occur during rituximab administration, consideration should be given to \nwithholding anti-hypertensive medicinal product 12 hours prior to the Rixathon infusion. \n \nCardiac disorders \nAngina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and fibrillation, heart failure and/or \nmyocardial infarction have occurred in patients treated with rituximab. Therefore patients with a \nhistory of cardiac disease and/or cardiotoxic chemotherapy should be monitored closely. \n \nHaematological toxicities \nAlthough rituximab is not myelosuppressive in monotherapy, caution should be exercised when \nconsidering treatment of patients with neutrophils < 1.5 x 109/L and/or platelet counts < 75 x 109/L as \nclinical experience in this population is limited. Rituximab has been used in 21 patients who \nunderwent autologous bone marrow transplantation and other risk groups with a presumable reduced \nbone marrow function without inducing myelotoxicity. \n \nRegular full blood counts, including neutrophil and platelet counts, should be performed during \nRixathon therapy. \n \nInfections \nSerious infections, including fatalities, can occur during therapy with rituximab (see section 4.8). \nRixathon should not be administered to patients with an active, severe infection (e.g. tuberculosis, \nsepsis and opportunistic infections, see section 4.3). \n \nPhysicians should exercise caution when considering the use of Rixathon in patients with a history of \nrecurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions which may further predispose patients to \nserious infection (see section 4.8). \n \nCases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported in subjects receiving rituximab including \nfulminant hepatitis with fatal outcome. The majority of these subjects were also exposed to cytotoxic \nchemotherapy. Limited information from one study in relapsed/refractory CLL patients suggests that \nrituximab treatment may also worsen the outcome of primary hepatitis B infections. Hepatitis B virus \n\n\n\n10 \n\n(HBV) screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment with Rixathon. At \nminimum this should include HBsAg-status and HBcAb-status. These can be complemented with \nother appropriate markers as per local guidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B disease should not be \ntreated with Rixathon. Patients with positive hepatitis B serology (either HBsAg or HBcAb) should \nconsult liver disease experts before start of treatment and should be monitored and managed following \nlocal medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation. \n \nVery rare cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported during \npost-marketing use of rituximab in NHL and CLL (see section 4.8). The majority of patients had \nreceived rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell \ntransplant. \n \nImmunisations \nThe safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines, following rituximab therapy has not been studied \nfor NHL and CLL patients and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended. Patients \ntreated with Rixathon may receive non-live vaccinations. However with non-live vaccines response \nrates may be reduced. In a non-randomised study, patients with relapsed low-grade NHL who received \nrituximab monotherapy when compared to healthy untreated controls had a lower rate of response to \nvaccination with tetanus recall antigen (16% vs. 81%) and Keyhole Limpet Haemocyanin (KLH) \nneoantigen (4% vs. 76% when assessed for > 2-fold increase in antibody titer). For CLL patients \nsimilar results are assumable considering similarities between both diseases but that has not been \ninvestigated in clinical trials. \n \nMean pre-therapeutic antibody titres against a panel of antigens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza \nA, mumps, rubella, varicella) were maintained for at least 6 months after treatment with rituximab. \n \nSkin reactions \nSevere skin reactions such as Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell\u2019s syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see section 4.8). In case of such an event, \nwith a suspected relationship to rituximab, treatment should be permanently discontinued. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, and pemphigus \nvulgaris \n \nMethotrexate (MTX) na\u00efve populations with rheumatoid arthritis \nThe use of rituximab is not recommended in MTX-na\u00efve patients since a favourable benefit risk \nrelationship has not been established. \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nRituximab is associated with infusion related reactions (IRRs), which may be related to release of \ncytokines and/or other chemical mediators.  \n \nSevere IRRs with fatal outcome have been reported in rheumatoid arthritis patients in the post-\nmarketing setting. In rheumatoid arthritis most infusion-related events reported in clinical trials were \nmild to moderate in severity. The most common symptoms were allergic reactions like headache, \npruritus, throat irritation, flushing, rash, urticaria, hypertension, and pyrexia. In general, the proportion \nof patients experiencing any infusion reaction was higher following the first infusion than following \nthe second infusion of any treatment course. The incidence of IRR decreased with subsequent courses \n(see section 4.8). The reactions reported were usually reversible with a reduction in rate, or \ninterruption, of rituximab infusion and administration of an anti-pyretic, an antihistamine, and, \noccasionally, oxygen, intravenous saline or bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids if required. Closely \nmonitor patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions and those who experienced prior \ncardiopulmonary adverse reactions. Depending on the severity of the IRR and the required \ninterventions, temporarily or permanently discontinue Rixathon. In most cases, the infusion can be \nresumed at a 50% reduction in rate (e.g. from 100 mg/h to 50 mg/h) when symptoms have completely \nresolved. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nMedicinal products for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, e.g. epinephrine (adrenaline), \nantihistamines and glucocorticoids, should be available for immediate use in the event of an allergic \nreaction during administration of Rixathon. \n \nThere are no data on the safety of rituximab in patients with moderate heart failure (NYHA class III) \nor severe, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease. In patients treated with rituximab, the occurrence of \npre-existing ischemic cardiac conditions becoming symptomatic, such as angina pectoris, has been \nobserved, as well as atrial fibrillation and flutter. Therefore, in patients with a known cardiac history, \nand those who experienced prior cardiopulmonary adverse reactions, the risk of cardiovascular \ncomplications resulting from infusion reactions should be considered before treatment with Rixathon \nand patients closely monitored during administration. Since hypotension may occur during rituximab \ninfusion, consideration should be given to withholding anti-hypertensive medicinal products 12 hours \nprior to the Rixathon infusion. \n \nIRRs for patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis and pemphigus \nvulgaris were consistent with to those seen for rheumatoid arthritis patients in clinical trials (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nCardiac disorders \nAngina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and fibrillation, heart failure and/or \nmyocardial infarction have occurred in patients treated with rituximab. Therefore patients with a \nhistory of cardiac disease should be monitored closely (see Infusion-related reactions, above). \n \nInfections \nBased on the mechanism of action of rituximab and the knowledge that B cells play an important role \nin maintaining normal immune response, patients have an increased risk of infection following \nrituximab therapy (see section 5.1). Serious infections, including fatalities, can occur during therapy \nwith rituximab (see section 4.8). Rixathon should not be administered to patients with an active, severe \ninfection (e.g. tuberculosis, sepsis and opportunistic infections, see section 4.3) or severely \nimmunocompromised patients (e.g. where levels of CD4 or CD8 are very low). Physicians should \nexercise caution when considering the use of rituximab in patients with a history of recurring or \nchronic infections or with underlying conditions which may further predispose patients to serious \ninfection, e.g. hypogammaglobulinaemia (see section 4.8). It is recommended that immunoglobulin \nlevels are determined prior to initiating treatment with Rixathon. \n \nPatients reporting signs and symptoms of infection following Rixathon therapy should be promptly \nevaluated and treated appropriately. Before giving a subsequent course of Rixathon treatment, patients \nshould be re-evaluated for any potential risk for infections. \n \nVery rare cases of fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported \nfollowing use of rituximab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune diseases \nincluding Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and vasculitis. \n \nHepatitis B infections \nCases of hepatitis B reactivation, including those with a fatal outcome, have been reported in \nrheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients receiving \nrituximab. \n \nHepatitis B virus (HBV) screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment \nwith Rixathon. At minimum this should include HBsAg-status and HBcAb-status. These can be \ncomplemented with other appropriate markers as per local guidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B \ndisease should not be treated with rituximab. Patients with positive hepatitis B serology (either HBsAg \nor HBcAb) should consult liver disease experts before start of treatment and should be monitored and \nmanaged following local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation. \n \nLate neutropenia \n\n\n\n12 \n\nMeasure blood neutrophils prior to each course of Rixathon, and regularly up to 6-months after \ncessation of treatment, and upon signs or symptoms of infection (see section 4.8). \n \nSkin reactions \nSevere skin reactions such as Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell\u2019s syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see section 4.8). In case of such an event \nwith a suspected relationship to Rixathon, treatment should be permanently discontinued. \n \nImmunisation \nPhysicians should review the patient\u2019s vaccination status and follow current immunisation guidelines \nprior to Rixathon therapy. Vaccination should be completed at least 4 weeks prior to first \nadministration of Rixathon. \n \nThe safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines following rituximab therapy has not been studied. \nTherefore vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended whilst on Rixathon or whilst \nperipherally B cell depleted. \n \nPatients treated with Rixathon may receive non-live vaccinations. However, response rates to non- live \nvaccines may be reduced. In a randomised trial, patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with \nrituximab and methotrexate had comparable response rates to tetanus recall antigen (39% vs. 42%), \nreduced rates to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (43% vs. 82% to at least 2 pneumococcal \nantibody serotypes), and KLH neoantigen (47% vs. 93%), when given 6 months after rituximab as \ncompared to patients only receiving methotrexate. Should non-live vaccinations be required whilst \nreceiving rituximab therapy, these should be completed at least 4 weeks prior to commencing the next \ncourse of rituximab. \n \nIn the overall experience of rituximab repeat treatment over one year in rheumatoid arthritis, the \nproportions of patients with positive antibody titres against S. pneumoniae, influenza, mumps, rubella, \nvaricella and tetanus toxoid were generally similar to the proportions at baseline. \n \nConcomitant/sequential use of other DMARDs in rheumatoid arthritis \nThe concomitant use of Rixathon and anti-rheumatic therapies other than those specified under the \nrheumatoid arthritis indication and posology is not recommended. \n \nThere are limited data from clinical trials to fully assess the safety of the sequential use of other \nDMARDs (including TNF inhibitors and other biologics) following rituximab (see section 4.5). The \navailable data indicate that the rate of clinically relevant infection is unchanged when such therapies \nare used in patients previously treated with rituximab, however patients should be closely observed for \nsigns of infection if biologic agents and/or DMARDs are used following rituximab therapy. \n \nMalignancy \nImmunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy. On the basis of limited \nexperience with rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis patients (see section 4.8) the present data do not \nseem to suggest any increased risk of malignancy. However, the possible risk for the development of \nsolid tumours cannot be excluded at this time. \n \nSodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains 2.3 mmol (or 52.6 mg) sodium per 10 mL vial up to 23.06 mmol (or \n530.1 mg) sodium per dose. This medicinal product contains 11.5 mmol (263.2 mg) sodium per 50 mL \nvial. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCurrently, there are limited data on possible interactions with other medicinal products and rituximab. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nIn CLL patients, co-administration with rituximab did not appear to have an effect on the \npharmacokinetics of fludarabine or cyclophosphamide. In addition, there was no apparent effect of \nfludarabine and cyclophosphamide on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab. \n \nCo-administration with methotrexate had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab in \nrheumatoid arthritis patients. \n \nPatients with human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) or anti-drug antibody (ADA) titres may have \nallergic or hypersensitivity reactions when treated with other diagnostic or therapeutic monoclonal \nantibodies. \n \nIn patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 283 patients received subsequent therapy with a biologic \nDMARD following rituximab. In these patients the rate of clinically relevant infection while on \nrituximab was 6.01 per 100 patient years compared to 4.97 per 100 patient years following treatment \nwith the biologic DMARD. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nContraception in males and females  \n \nDue to the long retention time of rituximab in B cell depleted patients, women of childbearing \npotential should use effective contraceptive methods during and for 12 months following treatment \nwith Rixathon. \n \nPregnancy \n \nIgG immunoglobulins are known to cross the placental barrier. \n \nB cell levels in human neonates following maternal exposure to rituximab have not been studied in \nclinical trials. There are no adequate and well-controlled data from studies in pregnant women, \nhowever transient B-cell depletion and lymphocytopenia have been reported in some infants born to \nmothers exposed to rituximab during pregnancy. Similar effects have been observed in animal studies \n(see section 5.3). For these reasons Rixathon should not be administered to pregnant women unless the \npossible benefit outweighs the potential risk. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nWhether rituximab is excreted in human milk is not known. However, because maternal IgG is \nexcreted in human milk, and rituximab was detectable in milk from lactating monkeys, women should \nnot breast-feed while treated with Rixathon and for 12 months following Rixathon treatment. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies did not reveal deleterious effects of rituximab on reproductive organs. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRituximab may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness may occur \nfollowing administration of rituximab (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nExperience from non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe overall safety profile of rituximab in non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic \nleukaemia is based on data from patients from clinical trials and from post-marketing surveillance. \nThese patients were treated either with rituximab monotherapy (as induction treatment or maintenance \ntreatment following induction treatment) or in combination with chemotherapy. \n \nThe most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in patients receiving rituximab were \nIRRs which occurred in the majority of patients during the first infusion. The incidence of infusion-\nrelated symptoms decreases substantially with subsequent infusions and is less than 1% after eight \ndoses of rituximab. \n \nInfectious events (predominantly bacterial and viral) occurred in approximately 30-55% of patients \nduring clinical trials in patients with NHL and in 30-50% of patients during clinical trials in patients \nwith CLL. \n \nThe most frequent reported or observed serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were: \n\u2022 IRRs (including cytokine-release syndrome, tumour-lysis syndrome), see section 4.4. \n\u2022 Infections, see section 4.4. \n\u2022 Cardiovascular events, see section 4.4. \n \nOther serious ADRs reported include hepatitis B reactivation and PML (see section 4.4.) \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe frequencies of ADRs reported with rituximab alone or in combination with chemotherapy are \nsummarised in Table 1. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. Frequencies are defined as very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and very rare (< 1/10,000) \nand not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nThe ADRs identified only during post-marketing surveillance, and for which a frequency could not be \nestimated, are listed under \u201cnot known\u201d. \n \nTable 1 ADRs reported in clinical trials or during postmarketing surveillance in patients \n\nwith NHL and CLL disease treated with rituximab monotherapy/maintenance or in \ncombination with chemotherapy \n\n \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \nCommon Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Not known \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nBacterial \ninfections, \nviral \ninfections, \n+bronchitis \n\nSepsis, \n+pneumonia, \n+febrile infection, \n+herpes zoster, \n+respiratory tract \ninfection, fungal \ninfections, \ninfections of \nunknown \naetiology, +acute \nbronchitis, \n+sinusitis, \nhepatitis B1 \n\n Serious viral \ninfection2 \nPneumocystis \njirovecii \n\nPML  \n\nBlood and Neutropenia Anaemia, Coagulation  Transient Late \n\n\n\n15 \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \nCommon Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Not known \n\nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n, leucopenia, \n+febrile \nneutropenia, \n+thrombocyt\nopenia \n\n+pancytopenia, \n+granulocytopenia \n\ndisorders, \naplastic \nanaemia, \nhaemolytic \nanaemia, \nlymphadeno\npathy \n\nincrease in \nserum IgM \nlevels3 \n\nneutropenia3 \n\nImmune \nsystem \ndisorders \n\nInfusion \nrelated \nreactions4, \nangioedema \n\nHypersensitivity  Anaphylaxis Tumour \nlysis \nsyndrome, \ncytokine \nrelease \nsyndrome4, \nserum \nsickness \n\nInfusion-\nrelated acute \nreversible \nthrombocytop\nenia4 \n\nMetabolism \nand nutrition \ndisorders \n\n Hyperglycaemia, \nweight decrease, \nperipheral \noedema, face \noedema, increased \nLDH, \nhypocalcaemia \n\n    \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n  Depression, \nnervousness \n\n   \n\nNervous \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n Paraesthesia, \nhypoaesthesia, \nagitation, \ninsomnia, \nvasodilatation, \ndizziness, anxiety \n\nDysgeusia  Peripheral \nneuropathy\n, facial \nnerve \npalsy5 \n\nCranial \nneuropathy, \nloss of other \nsenses5 \n\nEye disorders  Lacrimation \ndisorder, \nconjunctivitis \n\n  Severe \nvision loss5 \n\n \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n Tinnitus, ear pain    Hearing loss5 \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n +Myocardial \ninfarction4 and 6, \narrhythmia, +atrial \nfibrillation, \ntachycardia, \n+cardiac disorder \n\n+Left \nventricular \nfailure, \n+supraventri\ncular \ntachycardia, \n+ventricular \ntachycardia, \n+angina, \n+myocardial \nischaemia, \nbradycardia \n\nSevere \ncardiac \ndisorders 4 and \n6 \n\nHeart \nfailure4and 6 \n\n \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n Hypertension, \northostatic \nhypotension, \nhypotension \n\n  Vasculitis \n(predomin\nately \ncutaneous), \nleukocytoc\nlastic \nvasculitis \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Bronchospasm4, \nrespiratory \ndisease, chest \npain, dyspnoea, \nincreased cough, \n\nAsthma, \nbronchiolitis \nobliterans, \nlung \ndisorder, \n\nInterstitial \nlung disease7 \n\nRespirator\ny failure4 \n\nLung \ninfiltration \n\n\n\n16 \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \nCommon Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Not known \n\nrhinitis hypoxia \nGastrointestin\nal disorders \n\nNausea Vomiting, \ndiarrhoea, \nabdominal pain, \ndysphagia, \nstomatitis, \nconstipation, \ndyspepsia, \nanorexia, throat \nirritation \n\nAbdominal \nenlargement \n\n Gastro-\nintestinal \nperforation\n7 \n\n \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue \ndisorders \n\nPruritis, \nrash, \n+alopecia \n\nUrticaria, \nsweating, night \nsweats, +skin \ndisorder \n\n  Severe \nbullous \nskin \nreactions, \nStevens-\nJohnson \nSyndrome \ntoxic \nepidermal \nnecrolysis \n(Lyell\u2019s \nSyndrome)\n7, \n\n \n\nMusculoskelet\nal and \nconnective \ntissue \ndisorders \n\n Hypertonia, \nmyalgia, \narthralgia, back \npain, neck pain, \npain \n\n    \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n    Renal \nfailure4 \n\n \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministratio\nn site \nconditions \n\nFever , \nchills, \nasthenia, \nheadache \n\nTumour pain, \nflushing, malaise, \ncold syndrome, \n+fatigue, \n+shivering, +multi-\norgan failure4 \n\nInfusion site \npain \n\n   \n\nInvestigations Decreased \nIgG levels \n\n     \n\nFor each term, the frequency count was based on reactions of all grades (from mild to severe), except for terms \nmarked with \"+\" where the frequency count was based only on severe (\u2265 grade 3 NCI common toxicity criteria) \nreactions.

Rarely fatal cases reported \n5 signs and symptoms of cranial neuropathy. Occurred at various times up to several months after completion of \nrituximab therapy \n6 observed mainly in patients with prior cardiac condition and/or cardiotoxic chemotherapy and were mostly \nassociated with infusion-related reactions \n7 includes fatal cases \n\n \nThe following terms have been reported as adverse events during clinical trials, however, were \nreported at a similar or lower incidence in the rituximab arms compared to control arms: \nhaematotoxicity, neutropenic infection, urinary tract infection, sensory disturbance, pyrexia. \n \nSigns and symptoms suggestive of an infusion-related reaction were reported in more than 50% of \npatients in clinical trials, and were predominantly seen during the first infusion, usually in the first one \nto two hours. These symptoms mainly comprised fever, chills and rigors. Other symptoms included \nflushing, angioedema, bronchospasm, vomiting, nausea, urticaria/rash, fatigue, headache, throat \n\n\n\n17 \n\nirritation, rhinitis, pruritus, pain, tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, dyspnoea, dyspepsia, \nasthenia and features of tumour lysis syndrome. Severe infusion-related reactions (such as \nbronchospasm, hypotension) occurred in up to 12% of the cases. Additional reactions reported in some \ncases were myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary oedema and acute reversible \nthrombocytopenia. Exacerbations of pre-existing cardiac conditions such as angina pectoris or \ncongestive heart failure or severe cardiac disorders (heart failure, myocardial infarction, atrial \nfibrillation), pulmonary oedema, multi-organ failure, tumour lysis syndrome, cytokine release \nsyndrome, renal failure, and respiratory failure were reported at lower or unknown frequencies. The \nincidence of infusion-related symptoms decreased substantially with subsequent infusions and is < 1% \nof patients by the eighth cycle of rituximab (containing) treatment. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfections \nRituximab induces B-cell depletion in about 70-80% of patients, but was associated with decreased \nserum immunoglobulins only in a minority of patients. \n \nLocalised candida infections as well as Herpes zoster were reported at a higher incidence in the \nrituximab-containing arm of randomised studies. Severe infections were reported in about 4% of \npatients treated with rituximab monotherapy. Higher frequencies of infections overall, including grade \n3 or 4 infections, were observed during rituximab maintenance treatment up to 2 years when compared \nto observation. There was no cumulative toxicity in terms of infections reported over a 2-year \ntreatment period. In addition, other serious viral infections either new, reactivated or exacerbated, \nsome of which were fatal, have been reported with rituximab treatment. The majority of patients had \nreceived rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a haematopoietic stem cell \ntransplant. Examples of these serious viral infections are infections caused by the herpes viruses \n(Cytomegalovirus, Varicella Zoster Virus and Herpes Simplex Virus), JC virus (progressive multifocal \nleukoencephalopathy [PML]) and hepatitis C virus. Cases of fatal PML that occurred after disease \nprogression and retreatment have also been reported in clinical trials. Cases of hepatitis B reactivation, \nhave been reported, the majority of which were in patients receiving rituximab in combination with \ncytotoxic chemotherapy. In patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, the incidence of grade 3/4 hepatitis \nB infection (reactivation and primary infection) was 2% in R-FC vs. 0% FC. Progression of Kaposi\u2019s \nsarcoma has been observed in rituximab-exposed patients with pre-existing Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma. These \ncases occurred in non-approved indications and the majority of patients were HIV positive. \n \nHaematologic adverse reactions \nIn clinical trials with rituximab monotherapy given for 4 weeks, haematological abnormalities \noccurred in a minority of patients and were usually mild and reversible. Severe (grade 3/4) neutropenia \nwas reported in 4.2%, anaemia in 1.1% and thrombocytopenia in 1.7% of the patients. During \nrituximab maintenance treatment for up to 2 years, leucopenia (5% vs. 2%, grade 3/4) and neutropenia \n(10% vs. 4%, grade 3/4) were reported at a higher incidence when compared to observation. The \nincidence of thrombocytopenia was low (< 1%, grade 3/4) and was not different between treatment \narms. During the treatment course in studies with rituximab in combination with chemotherapy, \ngrade 3/4 leucopenia (R-CHOP 88% vs. CHOP 79%, R-FC 23% vs. FC 12%), neutropenia (R-CVP \n24% vs. CVP 14%; R-CHOP 97% vs. CHOP 88%, R-FC 30% vs. FC 19% in previously untreated \nCLL), pancytopenia (R-FC 3% vs. FC 1% in previously untreated CLL) were usually reported with \nhigher frequencies when compared to chemotherapy alone. However, the higher incidence of \nneutropenia in patients treated with rituximab and chemotherapy was not associated with a higher \nincidence of infections and infestations compared to patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Studies \nin previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL have established that in up to 25% of patients \ntreated with R-FC neutropenia was prolonged (defined as neutrophil count remaining below 1 x 109/L \nbetween day 24 and 42 after the last dose) or occurred with a late onset (defined as neutrophil count \nbelow 1 x 109/L later than 42 days after last dose in patients with no previous prolonged neutropenia \nor who recovered prior to day 42) following treatment with rituximab plus FC. There were no \ndifferences reported for the incidence of anaemia. Some cases of late neutropenia occurring more than \nfour weeks after the last infusion of rituximab were reported. In the CLL first-line study, Binet stage C \npatients experienced more adverse events in the R-FC arm compared to the FC arm (R-FC 83% vs. FC \n\n\n\n18 \n\n71%). In the relapsed/refractory CLL study grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was reported in 11% of \npatients in the R-FC group compared to 9% of patients in the FC group. \n \nIn studies of rituximab in patients with Waldenstrom\u2019s macroglobulinaemia, transient increases in \nserum IgM levels have been observed following treatment initiation, which may be associated with \nhyperviscosity and related symptoms. The transient IgM increase usually returned to at least baseline \nlevel within 4 months. \n \nCardiovascular adverse reactions \nCardiovascular reactions during clinical trials with rituximab monotherapy were reported in 18.8% of \npatients with the most frequently reported events being hypotension and hypertension. Cases of \ngrade 3 or 4 arrhythmia (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia) and angina pectoris \nduring infusion were reported. During maintenance treatment, the incidence of grade 3/4 cardiac \ndisorders was comparable between patients treated with rituximab and observation. Cardiac events \nwere reported as serious adverse events (including atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, left \nventricular failure, myocardial ischaemia) in 3% of patients treated with rituximab compared to < 1% \non observation. In studies evaluating rituximab in combination with chemotherapy, the incidence of \ngrade 3 and 4 cardiac arrhythmias, predominantly supraventricular arrhythmias such as tachycardia \nand atrial flutter/fibrillation, was higher in the R-CHOP group (14 patients, 6.9%) as compared to the \nCHOP group (3 patients, 1.5%). All of these arrhythmias either occurred in the context of a rituximab \ninfusion or were associated with predisposing conditions such as fever, infection, acute myocardial \ninfarction or pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease. No difference between the R-CHOP \nand CHOP group was observed in the incidence of other grade 3 and 4 cardiac events including heart \nfailure, myocardial disease and manifestations of coronary artery disease. In CLL, the overall \nincidence of grade 3 or 4 cardiac disorders was low both in the first-line study (4% R-FC, 3% FC) and \nin the relapsed/refractory study (4% R-FC, 4% FC). \n \nRespiratory system \nCases of interstitial lung disease, some with fatal outcome have been reported. \n \nNeurologic disorders \nDuring the treatment period (induction treatment phase comprising of R-CHOP for at most eight \ncycles), four patients (2%) treated with R-CHOP, all with cardiovascular risk factors, experienced \nthromboembolic cerebrovascular accidents during the first treatment cycle. There was no difference \nbetween the treatment groups in the incidence of other thromboembolic events. In contrast, three \npatients (1.5%) had cerebrovascular events in the CHOP group, all of which occurred during the \nfollow-up period. In CLL, the overall incidence of grade 3 or 4 nervous system disorders was low both \nin the first-line study (4% R-FC, 4% FC) and in the relapsed/refractory study (3% R-FC, 3% FC). \n \nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) / reversible posterior \nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported. Signs and symptoms included visual \ndisturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A \ndiagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The reported cases had recognized \nrisk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients\u2019 underlying disease, hypertension, \nimmunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nGastrointestinal perforation in some cases leading to death has been observed in patients receiving \nrituximab for treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In the majority of these cases, rituximab was \nadministered with chemotherapy. \n \nIgG levels \nIn the clinical trial evaluating rituximab maintenance treatment in relapsed/refractory follicular \nlymphoma, median IgG levels were below the lower limit of normal (LLN) (< 7 g/L) after induction \ntreatment in both the observation and the rituximab groups. In the observation group, the median IgG \nlevel subsequently increased to above the LLN, but remained constant in the rituximab group. The \nproportion of patients with IgG levels below the LLN was about 60% in the rituximab group \n\n\n\n19 \n\nthroughout the 2 year treatment period, while it decreased in the observation group (36% after \n2 years). \n \nA small number of spontaneous and literature cases of hypogammaglobulinaemia have been observed \nin paediatric patients treated with rituximab, in some cases severe and requiring long-term \nimmunoglobulin substitution therapy. The consequences of long term B cell depletion in paediatric \npatients are unknown. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, some with fatal \noutcome, have been reported very rarely. \n \nPatient subpopulations \u2013 rituximab monotherapy \n \nElderly patients (\u2265 65 years) \nThe incidence of ADRs of all grades and grade 3 /4 ADR was similar in elderly patients compared to \nyounger patients (< 65 years). \n \nBulky disease \nThere was a higher incidence of grade 3/4 ADRs in patients with bulky disease than in patients \nwithout bulky disease (25.6% vs. 15.4%). The incidence of ADRs of any grade was similar in these \ntwo groups. \n \nRe-treatment \nThe percentage of patients reporting ADRs upon re-treatment with further courses of rituximab was \nsimilar to the percentage of patients reporting ADRs upon initial exposure (any grade and grade 3/4 \nADRs). \n \nPatient subpopulations \u2013 rituximab combination therapy \n \nElderly patients (\u2265 65 years) \nThe incidence of grade 3/4 blood and lymphatic adverse events was higher in elderly patients \ncompared to younger patients (< 65 years), with previously untreated or relapsed/refractory CLL. \n \nExperience from rheumatoid arthritis \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe overall safety profile of rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis is based on data from patients from \nclinical trials and from post-marketing surveillance. \n \nThe safety profile of rituximab in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is \nsummarised in the sections below. In clinical trials more than 3,100 patients received at least one \ntreatment course and were followed for periods ranging from 6 months to over 5 years; approximately \n2,400 patients received two or more courses of treatment with over 1,000 having received 5 or more \ncourses. The safety information collected during post marketing experience reflects the expected \nadverse reaction profile as seen in clinical trials for rituximab (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients received 2 x 1,000 mg of rituximab separated by an interval of two weeks; in addition to \nmethotrexate (10 \u2013 25 mg/week). Rituximab infusions were administered after an intravenous infusion \nof 100 mg methylprednisolone; patients also received treatment with oral prednisone for 15 days. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are listed in Table 2. Frequencies are defined as very common (\u2265 1/10), common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100) and very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each \nfrequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \nThe most frequent adverse reactions considered due to receipt of rituximab IRRs. The overall \nincidence of IRRs in clinical trials was 23% with the first infusion and decreased with subsequent \ninfusions. Serious IRRs were uncommon (0.5% of patients) and were predominantly seen during the \ninitial course. In addition to adverse reactions seen in RA clinical trials for rituximab, progressive \nmultifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (see section 4.4) and serum sickness-like reaction have been \nreported during post marketing experience. \n \nTable 2 Summary of ADRs reported in clinical trials or during postmarketing surveillance \n\noccurring in patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving rituximab \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \nCommon Common Uncommon Rare Very rare \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nUpper \nrespiratory \ntract infection, \nurinary tract \ninfections \n\nBronchitis, \nsinusitis, \ngastroenteritis, \ntinea pedis \n\n  PML, \nreactivation of \nhepatitis B \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n Neutropenia1  Late \nneutropenia2 \n\nSerum \nickness-like \nreaction \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\nInfusion-\nrelated \nreactions3 \n(hypertension, \nnausea, rash, \npyrexia, \npruritus, \nurticaria, \nthroat \nirritation, hot \nflush, \nhypotension, \nrhinitis, rigors, \ntachycardia, \nfatigue, \noropharyngeal \npain, \nperipheral \noedema, \nerythma) \n\n Infusion-\nrelated \nreactions3 \n(generalised \noedema, \nbronchospas\nm, wheezing, \nlaryngeal \noedema, \nangioneuroti\nc oedema, \ngeneralised \npruritus, \nanaphylaxis, \nanaphylactoi\nd reaction) \n\n  \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n Hypercholestero\nlemia \n\n   \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n Depression, \nanxiety \n\n   \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache Paraesthesia, \nmigraine, \ndizziness, \nsciatica \n\n   \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n   Angina \npectoris, \natrial \nfibrillation, \nheart failure, \nmyocardial \ninfarction \n\nAtrial flutter \n\n\n\n21 \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \nCommon Common Uncommon Rare Very rare \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Dyspepsia, \ndiarrhoea, \ngastro-\noesophageal \nreflux, mouth \nulceration, upper \nabdominal pain \n\n   \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n Alopecia   Toxic \nEpidermal \nNecrolysis \n(Lyell\u2019s \nsyndrome), \nStevens-\nJohnson \nsyndrome5 \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n Arthralgia / \nmusculoskeletal \npain, \nosteoarthritis, \nbursitis \n\n   \n\nInvestigations Decreased \nIgM \nlevels4 \n\nDecreased IgG \nlevels4 \n\n   \n\n1 Frequency category derived from laboratory values collected as part of routine laboratory monitoring \nin clinical trials \n2 Frequency category derived from post-marketing data. \n3 Reactions occurring during or within 24 hours of infusion.

The rate of all ADRs following first rituximab exposure was highest during the first \n6 months and declined thereafter. This is mostly accounted for by IRRs (most frequent during the first \ntreatment course), RA exacerbation and infections, all of which were more frequent in the first \n6 months of treatment. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nThe most frequent ADRs following receipt of rituximab in clinical studies were IRRs (refer to \nTable 2). Among the 3189 patients treated with rituximab, 1,135 (36%) experienced at least one IRR \nwith 733/3,189 (23%) of patients experiencing an IRR following first infusion of the first exposure to \nrituximab. The incidence of IRRs declined with subsequent infusions. In clinical trials fewer than 1% \n(17/3,189) of patients experienced a serious IRR. There were no CTC Grade 4 IRRs and no deaths due \nto IRRs in the clinical trials. The proportion of CTC Grade 3 events and of IRRs leading to withdrawal \ndecreased by course and were rare from course 3 onwards. Premedication with intravenous \nglucocorticoid significantly reduced the incidence and severity of IRRs (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \nSevere IRRs with fatal outcome have been reported in the post-marketing setting. \n \nIn a trial designed to evaluate the safety of a more rapid rituximab infusion in patients with rheumatoid \narthritis, patients with moderate-to-severe active RA who did not experience a serious IRR during or \nwithin 24 hours of their first studied infusion were allowed to receive a 2-hour intravenous infusion of \nrituximab. Patients with a history of a serious infusion reaction to a biologic therapy for RA were \n\n\n\n22 \n\nexcluded from entry. The incidence, types and severity of IRRs were consistent with that observed \nhistorically. No serious IRRs were observed. \n \nInfections \nThe overall rate of infection was approximately 94 per 100 patient years in rituximab treated patients. \nThe infections were predominately mild to moderate and consisted mostly of upper respiratory tract \ninfections and urinary tract infections. The incidence of infections that were serious or required \nintravenous antibiotics was approximately 4 per 100 patient years. The rate of serious infections did \nnot show any significant increase following multiple courses of rituximab. Lower respiratory tract \ninfections (including pneumonia) have been reported during clinical trials, at a similar incidence in the \nrituximab arms compared to control arms. \n \nCases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with fatal outcome have been reported following \nuse of rituximab for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. This includes rheumatoid arthritis and \noff-label autoimmune diseases, including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and vasculitis. \n \nIn patients with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma receiving rituximab in combination with cytotoxic \nchemotherapy, cases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported (see non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma). \nReactivation of hepatitis B infection has also been very rarely reported in RA patients receiving \nrituximab (see section 4.4). \n \nCardiovascular adverse reactions \nSerious cardiac reactions were reported at a rate of 1.3 per 100 patient years in the rituximab treated \npatients compared to 1.3 per 100 patient years in placebo treated patients. The proportions of patients \nexperiencing cardiac reactions (all or serious) did not increase over multiple courses. \n \nNeurologic events  \nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)/reversible posterior \nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported. Signs and symptoms included visual \ndisturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A \ndiagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The reported cases had recognised \nrisk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients\u2019 underlying disease, hypertension, \nimmunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. \n \nNeutropenia \nEvents of neutropenia were observed with rituximab treatment, the majority of which were transient \nand mild or moderate in severity. Neutropenia can occur several months after the administration of \nrituximab (see section 4.4). \n \nIn placebo-controlled periods of clinical trials, 0.94% (13/1,382) of rituximab treated patients and \n0.27% (2/731) of placebo patients developed severe neutropenia. \n \nNeutropenic events, including severe late onset and persistent neutropenia, have been rarely reported \nin the post-marketing setting, some of which were associated with fatal infections. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell\u2019s syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, some with fatal \noutcome, have been reported very rarely. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \nHypogammaglobulinaemia (IgG or IgM below the lower limit of normal) has been observed in RA \npatients treated with rituximab. There was no increased rate in overall infections or serious infections \nafter the development of low IgG or IgM (see section 4.4). \n \nA small number of spontaneous and literature cases of hypogammaglobulinaemia have been observed \nin paediatric patients treated with rituximab, in some cases severe and requiring long-term \n\n\n\n23 \n\nimmunoglobulin substitution therapy. The consequences of long term B cell depletion in paediatric \npatients are unknown. \n \nExperience from granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis \n \nInduction of remission \nNinety-nine patients were treated for induction of remission of GPA and MPA in a clinical trial with \nrituximab (375 mg/m2, once weekly for 4 weeks) and glucocorticoids (see section 5.1). \n \nThe ADRs listed in Table 3 were all adverse events which occurred at an incidence of \u2265 5% in the \nrituximab group and at a higher frequency than the comparator group. \n \nTable 3 Adverse drug reactions occurring at 6-months in \u2265 5% of patients receiving \n\nrituximab for induction of remission of GPA and MPA, and at a higher frequency \nthan the comparator group. \n\nBody System \n \n\nRituximab \n \n\nAdverse event (n=99) \nInfections and infestations \n\nUrinary tract infection 7% \nBronchitis 5% \nHerpes zoster 5% \nNasopharyngitis 5% \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nThrombocytopenia 7% \n\nImmune system disorders \nCytokine release syndrome 5% \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nHyperkalaemia 5% \n\nPsychiatric disorders \nInsomnia 14% \n\nNervous system disorders \nDizziness 10% \nTremor 10% \n\nVascular disorders \nHypertension 12% \nFlushing 5% \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nCough 12% \nDyspnoea 11% \nEpistaxis 11% \nNasal congestion 6% \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nDiarrhoea 18% \nDyspepsia 6% \nConstipation 5% \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nAcne 7% \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nMuscle spasms 18% \nArthralgia 15% \nBack pain 10% \nMuscle weakness 5% \nMusculoskeletal pain 5% \nPain in extremities 5% \n\n\n\n24 \n\nBody System \n \n\nRituximab \n \n\nAdverse event (n=99) \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nPeripheral oedema 16% \nInvestigations \n\nDecreased haemoglobin 6% \n \nMaintenance treatment \nIn a further clinical study, a total of 57 severe, active GPA and MPA patients in disease remission \nwere treated with rituximab for the maintenance of remission (see section 5.1). \n \nTable 4 Adverse drug reactions occurring in \u2265 5% of patients receiving rituximab for \n\nmaintenance treatment of GPA and MPA, and at a higher frequency than the \ncomparator group \n\n \nSystem Organ Class \nAdverse drug reaction1 \n\nRituximab  \n(n=57) \n\nInfections and infestations   \nBronchitis 14% \nRhinitis 5% \nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions  \n\nPyrexia 9% \nInfluenza-like illness 5% \nOedema peripheral 5% \nGastrointestinal disorders   \nDiarrhoea 7% \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders  \n\nDyspnoea 9% \nInjury, poisoning and procedural \ncomplications  \n\nInfusion-related reactions2 12% \n1 Events were considered ADRs only after thorough assessment and where a \ncausal relationship between the medicinal product and the adverse event was at \nleast a reasonable possibility. \n2Details on infusion related reactions are provided in the description of selected \nadverse drug reactions section. \n \nThe overall safety profile was consistent with the well-established safety profile for rituximab in \napproved autoimmune indications, including GPA/MPA. Overall, 4% of patients in the rituximab arm \nexperienced adverse events leading to discontinuation. Most adverse events in the rituximab arm were \nmild or moderate in intensity. No patients in the rituximab arm had fatal adverse events. \n \nThe most commonly reported events considered as ADRs were infusion-related reactions and \ninfections.   \n \nIn a long-term observational safety study, 97 GPA/MPA patients received treatment with rituximab \n(mean of 8 infusions [range 1-28]) for up to 4 years, according to their physician\u2019s standard practice \nand discretion.  The overall safety profile was consistent with the well-established safety profile of \nrituximab in RA and GPA/MPA and no new adverse drug reactions were reported.    \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfusion-related reactions \n\n\n\n25 \n\nIn the clinical trial studying induction of remission with severe active GPA and MPA, IRRs were \ndefined as any adverse event occurring within 24 hours of an infusion and considered to be infusion-\nrelated by investigators in the safety population. Of the ninety nine patients treated with rituximab, 12 \n(12%) experienced at least one IRR. All IRRs were CTC Grade 1 or 2. The most common IRRs \nincluded cytokine release syndrome, flushing, throat irritation, and tremor. Rituximab was given in \ncombination with intravenous glucocorticoids which may reduce the incidence and severity of these \nevents. \n \nIn the maintenance therapy clinical trial, 7/57 (12%) patients in the rituximab arm experienced at least \none infusion-related reaction. The incidence of IRR symptoms was highest during or after the first \ninfusion (9%) and decreased with subsequent infusions (<4%). All IRR symptoms were mild or \nmoderate and most of them were reported from the SOCs Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal \nDisorders and Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue disorders.  \n \nInfections \nIn the clinical trial on induction of remission, which included 99 rituximab-treated patients, the overall \nrate of infection was approximately 237 per 100 patient years (95% CI 197 - 285) at the 6-month \nprimary endpoint. Infections were predominately mild to moderate and consisted mostly of upper \nrespiratory tract infections, herpes zoster and urinary tract infections. The rate of serious infections \nwas approximately 25 per 100 patient years. The most frequently reported serious infection in the \nrituximab group was pneumonia at a frequency of 4%. \n \nIn the maintenance therapy clinical trial, 30/57 (53%) patients in the rituximab arm experienced \ninfections. The incidence of all grade infections was similar between the arms. Infections were \npredominately mild to moderate. The most common infections in the rituximab arm included upper \nrespiratory tract infections, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections and herpes zoster. The incidence of \nserious infections was similar in both arms (approximately 12%). The most commonly reported \nserious infection in the rituximab group was mild or moderate bronchitis. \n \nMalignancies \nIn the clinical trial on induction of remission, the incidence of malignancy in rituximab treated patients \nin the granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis clinical study was \n2.00 per 100 patient years at the study common closing date (when the final patient had completed the \nfollow-up period). On the basis of standardised incidence ratios, the incidence of malignancies appears \nto be similar to that previously reported in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. \n \nCardiovascular adverse reactions \nIn the clinical trial on induction of remission, cardiac events occurred at a rate of approximately \n273 per 100 patient years (95% CI 149 - 470) at the 6-month primary endpoint. The rate of serious \ncardiac events was 2.1 per 100 patient years (95% CI 3 - 15). The most frequently reported events \nwere tachycardia (4%) and atrial fibrillation (3%) (see section 4.4). \n \nNeurologic events \nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)/reversible posterior \nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported in autoimmune conditions. Signs and \nsymptoms included visual disturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without \nassociated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The \nreported cases had recognised risk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients\u2019 underlying disease, \nhypertension, immunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy.\" \n \nHepatitis-B reactivation \nA small number of cases of hepatitis-B reactivation, some with fatal outcome, have been reported in \ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients receiving rituximab in the \npostmarketing setting. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nHypogammaglobulinaemia \nHypogammaglobulinaemia (IgA, IgG or IgM below the lower limit of normal) has been observed in \ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients treated with rituximab. The rate \nof overall infections and serious infections was not increased after the development of low IgA, IgG or \nIgM. \n \nIn the induction of remission clinical trial, at 6 months, in the rituximab group, 27%, 58% and 51% of \npatients with normal immunoglobulin levels at baseline, had low IgA, IgG and IgM levels, \nrespectively compared to 25%, 50% and 46% in the cyclophosphamide group.  \n \nIn the maintenance therapy clinical trial, no clinically meaningful differences between the two \ntreatment arms or decreases in total immunoglobulin, IgG, IgM or IgA levels were observed \nthroughout the trial. \n \nNeutropenia \nIn the induction of remission clinical trial,  24% of patients in the rituximab group (single course) and \n23% of patients in the cyclophosphamide group developed CTC grade 3 or greater neutropenia. \nNeutropenia was not associated with an observed increase in serious infection in rituximab-treated \npatients.  \n \nIn the maintenance therapy clinical trial, the incidence of all-grade neutropenia was 0% for rituximab-\ntreated patients vs 5% for azathioprine treated patients. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell\u2019s syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, some with fatal \noutcome, have been reported very rarely. \n \nExperience from pemphigus vulgaris \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety profile of rituximab in combination with short-term, low-dose glucocorticoids in the \ntreatment of patients with pemphigus vulgaris was studied in a Phase 3, randomised, controlled, \nmulticenter, open-label study in pemphigus patients that included 38 pemphigus vulgaris (PV) patients \nrandomised to the rituximab group. Patients randomised to the rituximab group received an initial \n1000 mg IV on Study Day 1 and a second 1000 mg IV on Study Day 15. Maintenance doses of \n500 mg IV were administered at months 12 and 18. Patients could receive 1000 mg IV at the time of \nrelapse (see section 5.1).   \n\nThe safety profile of rituximab in patients with PV was consistent with that observed in RA and \nGPA/MPA patients.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse drug reactions presented in Table 5 were adverse events which occurred at a rate of  \u2265 5% \namong rituximab-treated PV patients, with a  \u2265 2% absolute difference in incidence between the \nrituximab-treated group and the standard-dose prednisone group up to month 24. No patients were \nwithdrawn due to ADRs. \n \nTable 5 Adverse drugs reactions for rituximab-treated pemphigus vulgaris patients in the \n\nclinical study up to month 24 \n \nSystem Organ Class \nAdverse drug reaction \n\nrituximab + low-dose prednisone \n(n = 38) \n\nInjury, Poisoning and Procedural  \nComplications \nInfusion-related reactions* 58% \n\n\n\n27 \n\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue  \nDisorders \nAlopecia 13% \nPruritus 5% \nUrticaria 5% \nSkin disorder 5% \nPsychiatric Disorders \nPersistent depressive disorder 13% \nMajor depression 5% \nIrritability 5% \nInfections and Infestations \nHerpes virus infection 8% \nHerpes zoster 5% \nOral herpes 5% \nConjunctivitis 5% \nGeneral Disorders and Administration  \nSite Conditions \nFatigue 8% \nPyrexia 5% \nNervous System Disorders \nHeadache 5% \nDizziness 5% \nGastrointestinal Disorders \nAbdominal pain upper 5% \nCardiac Disorders \nTachycardia 5% \nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue \nDisorders \nMusculoskeletal pain 5% \nNeoplasms Benign, Malignant and  \nUnspecified (incl cysts and polyps) \nSkin papilloma 5% \n* Infusion-related reactions included symptoms collected on the next scheduled visit \nafter each infusion, and adverse events occurring on the day of or one day after the \ninfusion.  The most common infusion-related reaction symptoms/Preferred Terms \nincluded headaches, chills, high blood pressure, nausea, asthenia and pain.  \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nInfusion-related reactions in the pemphigus vulgaris clinical study were common (58%). Nearly all \ninfusion-related reactions were mild to moderate. The proportion of patients experiencing an infusion- \nrelated reaction was 29% (11 patients), 40% (15 patients), 13% (5 patients), and 10% (4 patients) \nfollowing the first, second, third, and fourth infusions, respectively. No patients were withdrawn from \ntreatment due to infusion-related reactions. Symptoms of infusion-related reactions were similar in \ntype and severity to those seen in RA and GPA/MPA patients. \n \nInfections \nFourteen patients (37%) in the rituximab group experienced treatment-related infections compared to \n15 patients (42%) in the standard-dose prednisone group. The most common infections in the \nrituximab group were herpes simplex and zoster infections, bronchitis, urinary tract infection, fungal \ninfection and conjunctivitis. Three patients (8%) in the rituximab group experienced a total of 5 \nserious infections (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, infective thrombosis, intervertebral discitis, \nlung infection, Staphylococcal sepsis) and one patient (3%) in the standard-dose prednisone group \nexperienced a serious infection (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia).  \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nLimited experience with doses higher than the approved dose of intravenous rituximab formulation is \navailable from clinical trials in humans. The highest intravenous dose of rituximab tested in humans to \ndate is 5,000 mg (2,250 mg/m\u00b2), tested in a dose escalation study in patients with chronic lymphocytic \nleukaemia. No additional safety signals were identified. \n \nPatients who experience overdose should have immediate interruption of their infusion and be closely \nmonitored. \n \nIn the post-marketing setting five cases of rituximab overdose have been reported. Three cases had no \nreported adverse event. The two adverse events that were reported were flu-like symptoms, with a \ndose of 1.8 g of rituximab and fatal respiratory failure, with a dose of 2 g of rituximab. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01X C02 \n \nRixathon is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nRituximab binds specifically to the transmembrane antigen, CD20, a non-glycosylated \nphosphoprotein, located on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. The antigen is expressed on > 95% of all \nB cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas. \n \nCD20 is found on both normal and malignant B cells, but not on haematopoietic stem cells, pro-B \ncells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissue. This antigen does not internalise upon antibody \nbinding and is not shed from the cell surface. CD20 does not circulate in the plasma as a free antigen \nand, thus, does not compete for antibody binding. \n \nThe Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes and the Fc domain can \nrecruit immune effector functions to mediate B cell lysis. Possible mechanisms of effector-mediated \ncell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) resulting from C1q binding, and \nantibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by one or more of the Fc\u03b3 receptors on the \nsurface of granulocytes, macrophages and NK cells. Rituximab binding to CD 20 antigen on B \nlymphocytes has also been demonstrated to induce cell death via apoptosis. \n \nPeripheral B cell counts declined below normal following completion of the first dose of rituximab. In \npatients treated for haematological malignancies, B cell recovery began within 6 months of treatment \nand generally returned to normal levels within 12 months after completion of therapy, although in \nsome patients this may take longer (up to a median recovery time of 23 months post-induction \ntherapy). In rheumatoid arthritis patients, immediate depletion of B cells in the peripheral blood was \nobserved following two infusions of 1,000 mg rituximab separated by a 14 day interval. Peripheral \nblood B cell counts begin to increase from week 24 and evidence for repopulation is observed in the \nmajority of patients by week 40, whether rituximab was administered as monotherapy or in \ncombination with methotrexate. A small proportion of patients had prolonged peripheral B cell \ndepletion lasting 2 years or more after their last dose of rituximab. In patients with granulomatosis \n\n\n\n29 \n\nwith polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis, the number of peripheral blood B cells decreased to \n< 10 cells/\u03bcL after two weekly infusions of rituximab 375 mg/m2, and remained at that level in most \npatients up to the 6 month time point. The majority of patients (81%) showed signs of B cell return, \nwith counts > 10 cells/\u03bcL by month 12, increasing to 87% of patients by month 18. \n \nClinical experience in Non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nFollicular lymphoma \n \nMonotherapy \n \nInitial treatment, weekly for 4 doses \nIn the pivotal trial, 166 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant low-grade or follicular B cell NHL \nreceived 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as an intravenous infusion once weekly for four weeks. The overall \nresponse rate (ORR) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population was 48% (CI95% 41%-56%) with a 6% \ncomplete response (CR) and a 42% partial response (PR) rate. The projected median time to \nprogression (TTP) for responding patients was 13.0 months. In a subgroup analysis, the ORR was \nhigher in patients with IWF B, C, and D histological subtypes as compared to IWF A subtype (58% \nvs. 12%), higher in patients whose largest lesion was < 5 cm vs. > 7 cm in greatest diameter (53% vs. \n38%), and higher in patients with chemosensitive relapse as compared to chemoresistant (defined as \nduration of response < 3 months) relapse (50% vs. 22%). ORR in patients previously treated with \nautologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) was 78% versus 43% in patients with no ABMT. Neither \nage, sex, lymphoma grade, initial diagnosis, presence or absence of bulky disease, normal or high \nLDH nor presence of extranodal disease had a statistically significant effect (Fisher\u2019s exact test) on \nresponse to rituximab. A statistically significant correlation was noted between response rates and \nbone marrow involvement. 40% of patients with bone marrow involvement responded compared to \n59% of patients with no bone marrow involvement (p=0.0186). This finding was not supported by a \nstepwise logistic regression analysis in which the following factors were identified as prognostic \nfactors: histological type, bcl-2 positivity at baseline, resistance to last chemotherapy and bulky \ndisease. \n \nInitial treatment, weekly for 8 doses \nIn a multi-centre, single-arm trial, 37 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant, low grade or follicular \nB cell NHL received 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as intravenous infusion weekly for eight doses. The \nORR was 57% (95% Confidence interval (CI); 41% \u2013 73%; CR 14%, PR 43%) with a projected \nmedian TTP for responding patients of 19.4 months (range 5.3 to 38.9 months). \n \nInitial treatment, bulky disease, weekly for 4 doses \nIn pooled data from three trials, 39 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant, bulky disease (single \nlesion \u2265 10 cm in diameter), low grade or follicular B cell NHL received 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as \nintravenous infusion weekly for four doses. The ORR was 36% (CI95% 21% \u2013 51%; CR 3%, PR 33%) \nwith a median TTP for responding patients of 9.6 months (range 4.5 to 26.8 months). \n \nRe-treatment, weekly for 4 doses \nIn a multi-centre, single-arm trial, 58 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant low grade or follicular \nB cell NHL, who had achieved an objective clinical response to a prior course of rituximab, were \nre-treated with 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as intravenous infusion weekly for four doses. Three of the \npatients had received two courses of rituximab before enrolment and thus were given a third course in \nthe study. Two patients were re-treated twice in the study. For the 60 re-treatments on study, the ORR \nwas 38% (CI95% 26% \u2013 51%; CR 10%, PR 28%) with a projected median TTP for responding patients \nof 17.8 months (range 5.4\u201326.6). This compares favourably with the TTP achieved after the prior \ncourse of rituximab (12.4 months). \n \nInitial treatment, in combination with chemotherapy \n \nIn an open-label randomised trial, a total of 322 previously untreated patients with follicular \nlymphoma were randomised to receive either CVP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, \n\n\n\n30 \n\nvincristine 1.4 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 2 mg on day 1, and prednisolone 40 mg/m2/day on days 1 -\n 5) every 3 weeks for 8 cycles or rituximab 375 mg/m2 in combination with CVP (R-CVP). Rituximab \nwas administered on the first day of each treatment cycle. A total of 321 patients (162 R-CVP, \n159 CVP) received therapy and were analysed for efficacy. The median follow up of patients was \n53 months. R-CVP led to a significant benefit over CVP for the primary endpoint, time to treatment \nfailure (27 months vs. 6.6 months, p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The proportion of patients with a tumour \nresponse (CR, CRu, PR) was significantly higher (p  < 0.0001 Chi-Square test) in the R-CVP group \n(80.9%) than the CVP group (57.2%). Treatment with R-CVP significantly prolonged the time to \ndisease progression or death compared to CVP, 33.6 months and 14.7 months, respectively \n(p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The median duration of response was 37.7 months in the R-CVP group and \nwas 13.5 months in the CVP group (p < 0.0001, log-rank test). \n \nThe difference between the treatment groups with respect to overall survival showed a significant \nclinical difference (p=0.029, log-rank test stratified by centre): survival rates at 53 months were 80.9% \nfor patients in the R-CVP group compared to 71.1% for patients in the CVP group. \n \nResults from three other randomised trials using rituximab in combination with chemotherapy regimen \nother than CVP (CHOP, MCP, CHVP/Interferon-\u03b1) have also demonstrated significant improvements \nin response rates, time-dependent parameters as well as in overall survival.

A total of 1,078 patients responded \nto induction therapy, of which 1,018 were randomised to rituximab maintenance therapy (n=505) or \nobservation (n=513). The two treatment groups were well balanced with regards to baseline \n\n\n\n31 \n\ncharacteristics and disease status. Rituximab maintenance treatment consisted of a single infusion of \nrituximab at 375 mg/m2 body surface area given every 2 months until disease progression or for a \nmaximum period of two years. \n \nThe pre-specified primary analysis was conducted at a median observation time of 25 months from \nrandomization, maintenance therapy with rituximab resulted in a clinically relevant and statistically \nsignificant improvement in the primary endpoint of investigator assessed progression-free survival \n(PFS) as compared to observation in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma (Table 7). \n \nSignificant benefit from maintenance treatment with rituximab was also seen for the secondary \nendpoints event-free survival (EFS), time to next anti-lymphoma treatment (TNLT) time to next \nchemotherapy (TNCT) and overall response rate (ORR) in the primary analysis (Table 7).  \n \nData from extended follow up of patients in the study (median follow-up 9 years) confirmed the long-\nterm benefit of rituximab maintenance therapy in terms of PFS, EFS, TNLT, and TNCT (Table 7). \n \nTable 7 Overview of efficacy results for rituximab maintenance vs. observation at the \n\nprotocol-defined primary analysis and after 9 years median follow-up (final \nanalysis) \n\n Primary analysis  \n(median FU: 25 months) \n\n \n \n\nFinal analysis  \n(median FU:9.0 years) \n\n Observation \nN=513 \n\nRituximab \nN=505 \n\n \n\nObservation \nN=513 \n\nRituximab \nN=505 \n\n \n\nPrimary efficacy  \nProgression-free survival (median)  \nlog-rank p value \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction \n\n \n\n \nNR                    NR \n\n<0.0001 \n0.50 (0.39, 0.64) \n\n50% \n\n \n4.06 years           10.49 years \n\n<0.0001 \n0.61 (0.52, 0.73) \n\n39% \nSecondary efficacy  \nOverall survival (median)  \nlog-rank p value \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction \n\n \n\n \nNR                    NR \n\n0.7246 \n0.89 (0.45, 1.74) \n\n11% \n\n \nNR                    NR \n\n0.7948 \n1.04 (0.77, 1.40) \n\n-6% \nEvent-free survival (median)  \nlog-rank p value \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction \n\n38 months           NR \n<0.0001 \n\n0.54 (0.43, 0.69) \n46% \n\n4.04 years           9.25 years \n<0.0001 \n\n0.64 (0.54, 0.76) \n36% \n\nTNLT (median)  \nlog-rank p value \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction \n\nNR                    NR \n0.0003 \n\n0.61 (0.46, 0.80) \n39% \n\n6.11 years           NR \n<0.0001 \n\n0.66 (0.55, 0.78) \n34% \n\nTNCT (median)  \nlog-rank p value \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction \n\nNR                    NR \n0.0011 \n\n0.60 (0.44, 0.82) \n40% \n\n9.32 years           NR \n0.0004 \n\n0.71 (0.59, 0.86) \n39% \n\nOverall response rate*  \nchi-squared test p value  \nodds ratio (95% CI)  \n\n55%                    74% \n<0.0001 \n\n2.33 (1.73, 3.15) \n\n61%                    79% \n<0.0001 \n\n2.43 (1.84, 3.22) \nComplete response (CR/CRu) rate*  \nchi-squared test p value  \nodds ratio (95% CI) \n\n48%                    67% \n<0.0001 \n\n2.21 (1.65, 2.94) \n\n53%                    67% \n<0.0001 \n\n2.34 (1.80, 3.03) \n* at end of maintenance/observation; final analysis results based on median follow-up of 73 months.  \nFU: follow-up; NR: not reached at time of clinical cut off, TNCT: time to next chemotherapy treatment; TNLT: time to next anti \nlymphoma treatment. \n \nRituximab maintenance treatment provided consistent benefit in all predefined subgroups tested: \ngender (male, female), age (< 60 years, >= 60 years), FLIPI score (<=1, 2 or >= 3), induction therapy \n(R-CHOP, R-CVP or R-FCM) and regardless of the quality of response to induction treatment (CR, \nCRu or PR).

The two treatment groups were well balanced with regard to baseline \ncharacteristics and disease status. A total of 334 patients achieving a complete or partial remission \nfollowing induction therapy were randomised in a second step to rituximab maintenance therapy \n(n=167) or observation (n=167). Rituximab maintenance treatment consisted of a single infusion of \nrituximab at 375 mg/m2 body surface area given every 3 months until disease progression or for a \nmaximum period of two years. \n \nThe final efficacy analysis included all patients randomised to both parts of the study. After a median \nobservation time of 31 months for patients randomised to the induction phase, R-CHOP significantly \nimproved the outcome of patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma when compared to \nCHOP (see Table 8). \n \nTable 8 Induction phase: overview of efficacy results for CHOP vs. R-CHOP (31 months \n\nmedian observation time) \n \n\n CHOP R-CHOP p-value Risk reduction1) \nPrimary efficacy \n\nORR2) \nCR2) \nPR2) \n\n \n74% \n16% \n58% \n\n \n87% \n29% \n58% \n\n \n0.0003 \n0.0005 \n0.9449 \n\n \nNA \nNA \nNA \n\n1) Estimates were calculated by hazard ratios \n2) Last tumour response as assessed by the investigator.

Rituximab maintenance treatment significantly prolonged median PFS in patients \nresponding to CHOP induction therapy (median PFS 37.5 months vs. 11.6 months, p < 0.0001) as well \nas in those responding to R-CHOP induction (median PFS 51.9 months vs. 22.1 months, p=0.0071). \nAlthough subgroups were small, rituximab maintenance treatment provided a significant benefit in \nterms of overall survival for both patients responding to CHOP and patients responding to R-CHOP, \nalthough longer follow-up is required to confirm this observation. \n \nDiffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma \n \nIn a randomised, open-label trial, a total of 399 previously untreated elderly patients \n(age 60 to 80 years) with diffuse large B cell lymphoma received standard CHOP chemotherapy \n(cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 up to a maximum of \n2 mg on day 1, and prednisolone 40 mg/m2/day on days 1-5) every 3 weeks for eight cycles, or \nrituximab 375 mg/m2 plus CHOP (R-CHOP). Rituximab was administered on the first day of the \ntreatment cycle. \n \nThe final efficacy analysis included all randomised patients (197 CHOP, 202 R-CHOP), and had a \nmedian follow-up duration of approximately 31 months. The two treatment groups were well balanced \nin baseline disease characteristics and disease status. The final analysis confirmed that R-CHOP \ntreatment was associated with a clinically relevant and statistically significant improvement in the \nduration of event-free survival (the primary efficacy parameter; where events were death, relapse or \nprogression of lymphoma, or institution of a new anti-lymphoma treatment) (p=0.0001). Kaplan Meier \nestimates of the median duration of event-free survival were 35 months in the R-CHOP arm compared \nto 13 months in the CHOP arm, representing a risk reduction of 41%. At 24 months, estimates for \noverall survival were 68.2% in the R-CHOP arm compared to 57.4% in the CHOP arm. A subsequent \nanalysis of the duration of overall survival, carried out with a median follow-up duration of 60 months, \nconfirmed the benefit of R-CHOP over CHOP treatment (p=0.0071), representing a risk reduction of \n32%. \n \nThe analysis of all secondary parameters (response rates, progression-free survival, disease-free \nsurvival, duration of response) verified the treatment effect of R-CHOP compared to CHOP. The \ncomplete response rate after cycle 8 was 76.2% in the R-CHOP group and 62.4% in the CHOP group \n(p=0.0028). The risk of disease progression was reduced by 46% and the risk of relapse by 51%. In all \npatients subgroups (gender, age, age adjusted IPI, Ann Arbor stage, ECOG, \u03b22 microglobulin, LDH, \nalbumin, B symptoms, bulky disease, extranodal sites, bone marrow involvement), the risk ratios for \nevent-free survival and overall survival (R-CHOP compared with CHOP) were less than 0.83 and 0.95 \n\n\n\n34 \n\nrespectively. R-CHOP was associated with improvements in outcome for both high- and low-risk \npatients according to age adjusted IPI. \n \nClinical laboratory findings \n \nOf 67 patients evaluated for human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA), no responses were noted. Of \n356 patients evaluated for anti-drug antibody (ADA), 1.1% (4 patients) were positive. \n \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nIn two open-label randomised trials, a total of 817 previously untreated patients and 552 patients with \nrelapsed/refractory CLL were randomised to receive either FC chemotherapy (fludarabine 25 mg/m2, \ncyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2, days 1-3) every 4 weeks for 6 cycles or rituximab in combination with \nFC (R-FC). Rituximab was administered at a dosage of 375 mg/m2 during the first cycle one day prior \nto chemotherapy and at a dosage of 500 mg/m2 on day 1 of each subsequent treatment cycle. Patients \nwere excluded from the study in relapsed/refractory CLL if they had previously been treated with \nmonoclonal antibodies or if they were refractory (defined as failure to achieve a partial remission for \nat least 6 months) to fludarabine or any nucleoside analogue. A total of 810 patients (403 R-FC, \n407 FC) for the first-line study (Table 10a and Table 10b) and 552 patients (276 R-FC, 276 FC) for the \nrelapsed/refractory study (Table 11) were analysed for efficacy. \n \nIn the first-line study, after a median observation time of 48.1 months, the median PFS was 55 months \nin the R-FC group and 33 months in the FC group (p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The analysis of overall \nsurvival showed a significant benefit of R-FC treatment over FC chemotherapy alone (p=0.0319, \nlog-rank test) (Table 10a). The benefit in terms of PFS was consistently observed in most patient \nsubgroups analysed according to disease risk at baseline (i.e. Binet stages A-C) (Table 10b). \n \nTable 10a First-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n\nOverview of efficacy results for rituximab plus FC vs. FC alone \u2013 48.1 months \nmedian observation time \n\n \nEfficacy parameter Kaplan-Meier estimate of \n\nmedian time to event (months) \nRisk \n\nreduction \nFC \n\n(N=409) \nR-FC \n\n(N=408) \nLog-rank \np value \n\nProgression-free survival (PFS) 32.8 55.3 < 0.0001 45% \nOverall survival NR NR 0.0319 27% \nEvent free survival 31.3 51.8 < 0.0001 44% \nResponse rate (CR, nPR, or PR) \nCR rates \n\n72.6% \n16.9% \n\n85.8% \n36.0% \n\n< 0.0001 \n< 0.0001 \n\nn.a. \nn.a. \n\nDuration of response* 36.2 57.3 < 0.0001 44% \nDisease free survival (DFS)** 48.9 60.3 0.0520 31% \nTime to new treatment 47.2 69.7 < 0.0001 42% \n\nResponse rate and CR rates analysed using Chi-squared Test.

These studies support the use of rituximab with any chemotherapy. \n \nData in approximately 180 patients pre-treated with rituximab have demonstrated clinical benefit \n(including CR) and are supportive for rituximab re-treatment. \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nrituximab in all subsets of the paediatric population with follicular lymphoma and chronic \nlymphocytic leukaemia. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n \nClinical experience in rheumatoid arthritis \n \nThe efficacy and safety of rituximab in alleviating the symptoms and signs of rheumatoid arthritis in \npatients with an inadequate response to TNF-inhibitors was demonstrated in a pivotal randomised, \ncontrolled, double-blind, multicenter trial (Trial 1). \n \nTrial 1 evaluated 517 patients that had experienced an inadequate response or intolerance to one or \nmore TNF inhibitor therapies. Eligible patients had active rheumatoid arthritis, diagnosed according to \nthe criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). Rituximab was administered as two \nintravenous infusions separated by an interval of 15 days. Patients received 2 x 1,000 mg intravenous \ninfusions of rituximab or placebo in combination with MTX. All patients received concomitant 60 mg \noral prednisone on days 2-7 and 30 mg on days 8-14 following the first infusion. The primary endpoint \nwas the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at week 24. Patients were followed \nbeyond week 24 for long term endpoints, including radiographic assessment at 56 weeks and at \n104 weeks. During this time, 81% of patients, from the original placebo group received rituximab \nbetween weeks 24 and 56, under an open label extension study protocol. \n \nTrials of rituximab in patients with early arthritis (patients without prior methotrexate treatment and \npatients with an inadequate response to methotrexate, but not yet treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors) \nhave met their primary endpoints. Rituximab is not indicated for these patients, since the safety data \nabout long-term rituximab treatment are insufficient, in particular concerning the risk of development \nof malignancies and PML. \n \nDisease activity outcomes \nRituximab in combination with methotrexate significantly increased the proportion of patients \nachieving at least a 20% improvement in ACR score compared with patients treated with methotrexate \nalone (Table 12). Across all development studies the treatment benefit was similar in patients \nindependent of age, gender, body surface area, race, number of prior treatments or disease status. \n \nClinically and statistically significant improvement was also noted on all individual components of the \nACR response (tender and swollen joint counts, patient and physician global assessment, disability \nindex scores (HAQ), pain assessment and C-Reactive Proteins (mg/dL). \n \nTable 12 Clinical response outcomes at primary endpoint in Trial 1 (ITT population) \n \n Outcome\u2020 Placebo+MTX Rituximab+MTX \n\n(2 x 1,000 mg) \n\nTrial 1  N=201 N=298 \n\n ACR20 \nACR50 \nACR70 \n\n36 (18%) \n11 (5%) \n3 (1%) \n\n153 (51%)*** \n80 (27%)*** \n37 (12%)*** \n\n EULAR response \n(good/moderate) \n\n44 (22%) 193 (65%)*** \n\n Mean change in DAS -0.34 -1.83*** \n\n\u2020 Outcome at 24 weeks \nSignificant difference from placebo + MTX at the primary timepoint: ***p \u2264 0.0001 \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nPatients treated with rituximab in combination with methotrexate had a significantly greater reduction \nin disease activity score (DAS28) than patients treated with methotrexate alone (Table 12). Similarly, \na good to moderate European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response was achieved by \nsignificantly more rituximab treated patients treated with rituximab and methotrexate compared to \npatients treated with methotrexate alone (Table 12). \n \nRadiographic response \nStructural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in modified Total \nSharp Score (mTSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score. \n \nIn Trial 1, conducted in patients with inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF inhibitor \ntherapies, receiving rituximab in combination with methotrexate demonstrated significantly less \nradiographic progression than patients originally receiving methotrexate alone at 56 weeks. Of the \npatients originally receiving methotrexate alone, 81% received rituximab either as rescue between \nweeks 16-24 or in the extension trial, before week 56. A higher proportion of patients receiving the \noriginal rituximab/MTX treatment also had no erosive progression over 56 weeks (Table 13). \n \nTable 13 Radiographic outcomes at 1 year (mITT population) \n \n Placebo+MTX Rituximab+MTX \n\n2 x 1,000 mg \n\nTrial 1 (n=184) (n=273) \nMean change from baseline:   \n\nModified total sharp score 2.30 1.01* \n\nErosion score 1.32 0.60* \n\nJoint space narrowing score 0.98 0.41** \n\nProportion of patients with no \nradiographic change \n\n46% 53%, NS \n\nProportion of patients with no erosive \nchange \n\n52% 60%, NS \n\n150 patients originally randomised to placebo + MTX in Trial 1 received at least one course of RTX + MTX by \none year * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.001.

The \nproportions of rituximab treated patients showing a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in \nHAQ-DI (defined as an individual total score decrease of > 0.22) was also higher than among patients \nreceiving methotrexate alone (Table 14). \n \nSignificant improvement in health related quality of life was also demonstrated with significant \nimprovement in both the physical health score (PHS) and mental health score (MHS) of the SF-36. \nFurther, significantly higher proportion of patients achieved MCIDs for these scores (Table 14).  \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nTable 14 Physical Function and Quality of Life outcomes at week 24 in Trial 1 \n \n\nOutcome\u2020 Placebo+MTX Rituximab+MTX \n(2 x 1,000 mg) \n\n \n \nMean change in HAQ-DI \n\nn=201 \n \n\n0.1 \n\nn=298 \n \n\n-0.4*** \n% HAQ-DI MCID 20% 51% \nMean change in FACIT-T -0.5 -9.1*** \n \n \nMean change in SF-36 PHS \n\nn=197 \n \n\n0.9 \n\nn=294 \n \n\n5.8*** \n% SF-36 PHS MCID 13% 48%*** \nMean change in SF-36 MHS 1.3 4.7** \n% SF-36 MHS MCID 20% 38%* \n\n\u2020 Outcome at 24 weeks \nSignificant difference from placebo at the primary time point: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.001, *** p \u2264 0.0001 \nMCID HAQ-DI \u2265 0.22, MCID SF-36 PHS > 5.42, MCID SF-36 MHS > 6.33 \n \nEfficacy in autoantibody (RF and or anti-CCP) seropositive patients \nPatients seropositive to Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and/or anti-Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide (anti-CCP) \nwho were treated with rituximab in combination with methotrexate showed an enhanced response \ncompared to patients negative to both. \n \nEfficacy outcomes in rituximab treated patients were analysed based on autoantibody status prior to \ncommencing treatment. At week 24, patients who were seropositive to RF and/or anti-CCP at baseline \nhad a significantly increased probability of achieving ACR20 and 50 responses compared to \nseronegative patients (p=0.0312 and p=0.0096) (Table 15). These findings were replicated at week 48, \nwhere autoantibody seropositivity also significantly increased the probability of achieving ACR70. At \nweek 48 seropositive patients were 2-3 times more likely to achieve ACR responses compared to \nseronegative patients. Seropositive patients also had a significantly greater decrease in DAS28-ESR \ncompared to seronegative patients (Figure 1). \n \nTable 15 Summary of efficacy by baseline autoantibody status \n \n Week 24 Week 48 \n Seropositive \n\n(n=514) \nSeronegative \n\n(n=106) \nSeropositive \n\n(n=506) \nSeronegative \n\n(n=101) \nACR20 (%) 62.3* 50.9 71. 1* 51.5 \nACR50 (%) 32.7* 19.8 44.9** 22.8 \nACR70 (%) 12.1 5.7 20.9* 6.9 \nEULAR response (%) 74.8* 62.9 84.3* 72.3 \nMean change DAS28-\nESR \n\n-1.97** -1.50 -2.48*** -1.72 \n\nSignificance levels were defined as * p <0.05, ** p < 0.001, *** p < 0.0001. \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\nFigure 1: Change from baseline of DAS28-ESR by baseline autoantibody status \n \n\n \n \nLong-term efficacy with multiple course therapy \nTreatment with rituximab in combination with methotrexate over multiple courses resulted in \nsustained improvements in the clinical signs and symptoms of RA, as indicated by ACR, DAS28-ESR \nand EULAR responses which was evident in all patient populations studied (Figure 2).

The emergence of ADA was not associated with clinical \ndeterioration or with an increased risk of reactions to subsequent infusions in the majority of patients. \n\n\n\n40 \n\nThe presence of ADA may be associated with worsening of infusion or allergic reactions after the \nsecond infusion of subsequent courses. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nrituximab in all subsets of the paediatric population with autoimmune arthritis. See section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use. \n \nClinical experience in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener\u2019s) and microscopic polyangiitis \n \nInduction of remission \nA total of 197 patients aged 15 years or older with severely, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis \n(75%) and microscopic polyangiitis (24%) were enrolled and treated in an active-comparator, \nrandomised, double-blind, multicenter, non-inferiority trial. \n \nPatients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either oral cyclophosphamide daily (2 mg/kg/day) \nfor 3-6 months or rituximab (375 mg/m2) once weekly for 4 weeks. All patients in the \ncyclophosphamide arm received azathioprine maintenance therapy in during follow-up. Patients in \nboth arms received 1,000 mg of pulse intravenous methylprednisolone (or another equivalent-dose \nglucocorticoid) per day for 1 to 3 days, followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day, not exceeding \n80 mg/day). Prednisone tapering was to be completed by 6 months from the start of trial treatment. \n \nThe primary outcome measure was achievement of complete remission at 6 months defined as a \nBirmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis (BVAS/WG) of 0, and off \nglucocorticoid therapy. The prespecified non-inferiority margin for the treatment difference was 20%. \nThe trial demonstrated non-inferiority of rituximab to cyclophosphamide for complete remission (CR) \nat 6 months (Table 16). \n \nEfficacy was observed both for patients with newly diagnosed disease and for patients with relapsing \ndisease (Table 17). \n \nTable 16 Percentage of patients who achieved complete remission at 6 months (intent-to-treat \n\npopulation*) \n \n\n Rituximab (n=99) Cyclophosphamide \n(n=98) \n\nTreatment difference \n(rituximab- \n\ncyclophosphamide) \n \nRate \n\n \n63.6% \n\n \n53.1% \n\n10.6% \n95.1%b CI (-3.2%, \n\n24.3%)a \n\u2212 CI = confidence interval. \n\u2212 * Worst case imputation \na Non-inferiority was demonstrated since the lower bound (\u2212 3.2%) was higher than the pre-\ndetermined  non-inferiority margin (\u2212 20%). \nb The 95.1% confidence level reflects an additional 0.001 alpha to account for an interim efficacy \nanalysis. \n\n \n\n\n\n41 \n\nTable 17 Complete remission at 6-months by disease status \n \n Rituximab Cyclophosphamide Difference (CI 95%) \n\nAll patients \n \nNewly diagnosed \n \nRelapsing \n\nn=99 \n \n\nn=48 \n \n\nn=51 \n\nn=98 \n \n\nn=48 \n \n\nn=50 \n\n \n\nComplete remission \nAll patients 63.6% 53.1% 10.6% (-3.2, 24.3) \nNewly diagnosed 60.4% 64.6% -4.2% (-23.6, 15.3) \nRelapsing 66.7% 42.0% 24.7% (5.8, 43.6) \n\nWorst case imputation is applied for patients with missing data \n \nComplete remission at 12 and 18 months \nIn the rituximab group, 48% of patients achieved CR at 12 months, and 39% of patients achieved CR \nat 18 months. In patients treated with cyclophosphamide (followed by azathioprine for maintenance of \ncomplete remission), 39% of patients achieved CR at 12 months, and 33% of patients achieved CR at \n18 months. From month 12 to month 18, 8 relapses were observed in the rituximab group compared \nwith four in the cyclophosphamide group. \n \nLaboratory evaluations \nA total of 23/99 (23%) rituximab-treated patients from the induction of remission trial tested positive \nfor ADA by 18 months. None of the 99 rituximab-treated patients were ADA positive at screening. \nThere was no apparent negative impact of the presence of ADA on safety or efficacy in the induction \nof remission trial. \n \nMaintenance treatment  \nA total of 117 patients (88 with GPA, 24 with MPA, and 5 with renal-limited ANCA-associated \nvasculitis) in disease remission were randomized to receive azathioprine (59 patients) or rituximab (58 \npatients) in a prospective, multi-center, controlled, open-label study. Included patients were 21 to 75 \nyears of age and had newly diagnosed or relapsing disease in complete remission after combined \ntreatment with glucocorticoids and pulse cyclophosphamide. The majority of patients were ANCA-\npositive at diagnosis or during the course of their disease; had histologically confirmed necrotizing \nsmall-vessel vasculitis with a clinical phenotype of GPA/MPA, or renal limited ANCA-associated \nvasculitis; or both. \n \nRemission-induction therapy included IV prednisone, administered as per the investigator\u2019s discretion, \npreceded in some patients by methylprednisolone pulses, and pulse cyclophosphamide until remission \nwas attained after 4 to 6 months. At that time, and within a maximum of 1 month after the last \ncyclophosphamide pulse, patients were randomly assigned to receive either rituximab (two 500 mg IV \ninfusions separated by two weeks (on Day 1 and Day 15) followed by 500 mg IV every 6 months for \n18 months) or azathioprine (administered orally at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day for 12 months, then \n1.5 mg/kg/day for 6 months, and finally 1 mg/kg/day for 4 months (treatment discontinuation after \nthese 22 months)). Prednisone treatment was tapered and then kept at a low dose (approximately 5 mg \nper day) for at least 18 months after randomization. Prednisone dose tapering and the decision to stop \nprednisone treatment after month 18 were left at the investigator\u2019s discretion.  \n \nAll patients were followed until month 28 (10 or 6 months, respectively, after the last rituximab \ninfusion or azathioprine dose). Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis was required for all \npatients with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts less than 250 per cubic millimeter. \n \nThe primary outcome measure was the rate of major relapse at month 28.  \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nResults \nAt month 28, major relapse (defined by the reappearance of clinical and/or laboratory signs of \nvasculitis activity ([BVAS] > 0) that could lead to organ failure or damage or could be life \nthreatening) occurred in 3 patients (5%) in the rituximab group and 17 patients (29%) in the \nazathioprine group (p=0.0007). Minor relapses (not life threatening and not involving major organ \ndamage) occurred in seven patients in the rituximab group (12%) and eight patients in the azathioprine \ngroup (14%).  \n \nThe cumulative incidence rate curves showed that time to first major relapse was longer in patients \nwith rituximab starting from month 2 and was maintained up to month 28 (Figure 3). \n \nFigure 3:  Cumulative incidence over time of first major relapse \n\n      \n \n \nNumber of Subjects with Major Relapse \nAzathioprine 0 0 3 3 5 5 8 8 9 9 9 10 13 15 17 \nRituximab 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 \nNumber of subjects at risk \nAzathioprine 59 56 52 50 47 47 44 44 42 41 40 39 36 34 0 \nRituximab 58 56 56 56 55 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 52 50 0 \n \nNote: Patients were censored at month 28 if they had no event.    \n \nLaboratory evaluations \nA total of 6/34 (18%) of rituximab treated patients from the maintenance therapy clinical trial \ndeveloped ADA. There was no apparent negative impact of the presence of ADA on safety or efficacy \nin the maintenance therapy clinical trial.  \n \nClinical experience in pemphigus vulgaris \n \nThe efficacy and safety of rituximab in combination with short-term, low-dose glucocorticoid \n(prednisone) therapy were evaluated in newly diagnosed patients with moderate to severe pemphigus \n(74 pemphigus vulgaris [PV] and 16 pemphigus foliaceus [PF]) in this randomised, open-label, \ncontrolled, multicenter study. Patients were between 19 and 79 years of age and had not received prior \ntherapies for pemphigus. In the PV population, 5 (13%) patients in the rituximab group and 3 (8%) \npatients in the standard prednisone group had moderate disease and 33 (87%) patients in the rituximab \ngroup and 33 (92%) patients in the standard-dose prednisone group had severe disease according to \ndisease severity defined by Harman\u2019s criteria. \n\nSurvival Time (Months) \n\nPercent\nage of \n\nPatients \nwith \nFirst \n\nMajor \nRelapse \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \nPatients were stratified by baseline disease severity (moderate or severe) and randomised 1:1 to \nreceive either rituximab and low-dose prednisone or standard-dose prednisone. Patients randomised to \nthe rituximab group received an initial intravenous infusion of 1000 mg rituximab on Study Day 1 in \ncombination with 0.5 mg/kg/day oral prednisone tapered off over 3 months if they had moderate \ndisease or 1 mg/kg/day oral prednisone tapered off over 6 months if they had severe disease, and a \nsecond intravenous infusion of 1000 mg on Study Day 15. Maintenance infusions of rituximab 500 mg \nwere administered at months 12 and 18. Patients randomised to the standard-dose prednisone group \nreceived an initial 1 mg/kg/day oral prednisone tapered off over 12 months if they had moderate \ndisease or 1.5 mg/kg/day oral prednisone tapered off over 18 months if they had severe disease. \nPatients in the rituximab group who relapsed could receive an additional infusion of rituximab \n1000 mg in combination with reintroduced or escalated prednisone dose. Maintenance and relapse \ninfusions were administered no sooner than 16 weeks following the previous infusion.  \n \nThe primary objective for the study was complete remission (complete epithelialisation and absence of \nnew and/or established lesions) at month 24 without the use of prednisone therapy for two months or \nmore (CRoff for \u22652 months).  \n \nResults \nThe study showed statistically significant results of rituximab and low-dose prednisone over standard-\ndose prednisone in achieving CRoff \u2265 2 months at month 24 in PV patients (see Table 18).   \n \nTable 18  Percentage of PV patients who achieved complete remission off corticosteroid \ntherapy for two months or more at month 24 (Intent-to-Treat Population - PV) \n\n Rituximab + \nPrednisone \nN=38 \n\nPrednisone \nN=36 \n\n \np-value a 95% CIb \n\nNumber of responders      \n(response rate [%]) \n\n34 (89.5%) 10 (27.8%) <0.0001 61.7% (38.4, 76.5) \n\nap-value is from Fisher\u2019s exact test with mid-p correction \nb 95% confidence interval is corrected Newcombe interval   \n\n \n\n \nThe number of rituximab plus low-dose prednisone patients off prednisone therapy or on minimal \ntherapy (prednisone dose of 10 mg or less per day) compared to standard-dose prednisone patients \nover the 24-month treatment period shows a steroid-sparing effect of rituximab (Figure 4).  \n \nFigure 4:  Number of patients who were off or on minimal corticosteroid (\u226410mg/day) therapy \n\nover time \n\n \n \n\n\n\n44 \n\nPost-hoc retrospective laboratory evaluation \nA total of 19/34 (56%) patients with PV, who were treated with rituximab, tested positive for ADA \nantibodies by 18 months. The clinical relevance of ADA formation in rituximab-treated PV patients is \nunclear. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNon-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 298 NHL patients who received single or multiple \ninfusions of rituximab as a single agent or in combination with CHOP therapy (applied rituximab \ndoses ranged from 100 to 500 mg/m2), the typical population estimates of nonspecific clearance (CL1), \nspecific clearance (CL2) likely contributed by B cells or tumour burden, and central compartment \nvolume of distribution (V1) were 0.14 L/day, 0.59 L/day, and 2.7 L, respectively. The estimated \nmedian terminal elimination half-life of rituximab was 22 days (range, 6.1 to 52 days). Baseline \nCD19-positive cell counts and size of measurable tumour lesions contributed to some of the variability \nin CL2 of rituximab in data from 161 patients given 375 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion for \n4 weekly doses. Patients with higher CD19-positive cell counts or tumour lesions had a higher CL2. \nHowever, a large component of inter-individual variability remained for CL2 after correction for \nCD19-positive cell counts and tumour lesion size. V1 varied by body surface area (BSA) and CHOP \ntherapy. This variability in V1 (27.1% and 19.0%) contributed by the range in BSA (1.53 to 2.32 m2) \nand concurrent CHOP therapy, respectively, were relatively small. Age, gender and WHO \nperformance status had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab. This analysis suggests that \ndose adjustment of rituximab with any of the tested covariates is not expected to result in a meaningful \nreduction in its pharmacokinetic variability. \n \nRituximab, administered as an intravenous infusion at a dose of 375 mg/m2 at weekly intervals for \n4 doses to 203 patients with NHL naive to rituximab, yielded a mean Cmax following the fourth \ninfusion of 486 \u00b5g/mL (range, 77.5 to 996.6 \u00b5g/mL). Rituximab was detectable in the serum of \npatients 3 to 6 months after completion of last treatment. \n \nUpon administration of rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion at weekly \nintervals for 8 doses to 37 patients with NHL, the mean Cmax increased with each successive infusion, \nspanning from a mean of 243 \u00b5g/mL (range, 16 \u2013 582 \u00b5g/mL) after the first infusion to 550 \u00b5g/mL \n(range, 171-1,177 \u00b5g/mL) after the eighth infusion. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic profile of rituximab when administered as 6 infusions of 375 mg/m2 in \ncombination with 6 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy was similar to that seen with rituximab alone. \n \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nRituximab was administered as an intravenous infusion at a first-cycle dose of 375 mg/m2 increased to \n500 mg/m2 each cycle for 5 doses in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in CLL \npatients. The mean Cmax (N=15) was 408 \u00b5g/mL (range, 97 \u2013 764 \u00b5g/mL) after the fifth 500 mg/m2 \ninfusion and the mean terminal half-life was 32 days (range, 14 \u2013 62 days). \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nFollowing two intravenous infusions of rituximab at a dose of 1,000 mg, two weeks apart, the mean \nterminal half-life was 20.8 days (range, 8.58 to 35.9 days), mean systemic clearance was 0.23 L/day \n(range, 0.091 to 0.67 L/day), and mean steady-state distribution volume was 4.6 L (range, 1.7 to \n7.51 L). Population pharmacokinetic analysis of the same data gave similar mean values for systemic \nclearance and half-life, 0.26 L/day and 20.4 days, respectively. Population pharmacokinetic analysis \nrevealed that BSA and gender were the most significant covariates to explain inter-individual \nvariability in pharmacokinetic parameters. After adjusting for BSA, male subjects had a larger volume \nof distribution and a faster clearance than female subjects. The gender-related pharmacokinetic \n\n\n\n45 \n\ndifferences are not considered to be clinically relevant and dose adjustment is not required. No \npharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of rituximab were assessed following two intravenous doses of 500 mg and \n1,000 mg on days 1 and 15 in four studies. In all these studies, rituximab pharmacokinetics were dose \nproportional over the limited dose range studied. Mean Cmax for serum rituximab following first \ninfusion ranged from 157 to 171 \u03bcg/mL for 2 x 500 mg dose and ranged from 298 to 341 \u03bcg/mL for \n2 x 1,000 mg dose. Following second infusion, mean Cmax ranged from 183 to 198 \u03bcg/mL for the \n2 x 500 mg dose and ranged from 355 to 404 \u03bcg/mL for the 2 x 1,000 mg dose. Mean terminal \nelimination half-life ranged from 15 to 16 days for the 2 x 500 mg dose group and 17 to 21 days for \nthe 2 x 1,000 mg dose group. Mean Cmax was 16 to 19% higher following second infusion compared to \nthe first infusion for both doses. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of rituximab were assessed following two intravenous doses of 500 mg and \n1,000 mg upon re-treatment in the second course. Mean Cmax for serum rituximab following first \ninfusion was 170 to 175 \u03bcg/mL for 2 x 500 mg dose and 317 to 370 \u03bcg/mL for 2 x 1,000 mg dose. \nCmax following second infusion, was 207 \u03bcg/mL for the 2 x 500 mg dose and ranged from \n377 to 386 \u03bcg/mL for the 2 x 1,000 mg dose. Mean terminal elimination half-life after the second \ninfusion, following the second course, was 19 days for 2 x 500 mg dose and ranged from 21 to 22 days \nfor the 2 x 1,000 mg dose. PK parameters for rituximab were comparable over the two treatment \ncourses. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in the anti-TNF inadequate responder population, following the \nsame dosage regimen (2 x 1,000 mg, intravenous, 2 weeks apart), were similar with a mean maximum \nserum concentration of 369 \u03bcg/mL and a mean terminal half-life of 19.2 days. \n \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis \n \nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data in 97 patients with granulomatosis with \npolyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis who received 375 mg/m2 rituximab once weekly for four \ndoses, the estimated median terminal elimination half-life was 23 days (range, 9 \u2013 49 days).  \nRituximab mean clearance and volume of distribution were 0.313 L/day (range, 0.116 \u2013 0.726 L/day) \nand 4.50 L (range 2.25 \u2013 7.39 L) respectively. The PK parameters of rituximab in these patients appear \nsimilar to what has been observed in rheumatoid arthritis patients. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRituximab has shown to be highly specific to the CD20 antigen on B cells. Toxicity studies in \ncynomolgus monkeys have shown no other effect than the expected pharmacological depletion of B \ncells in peripheral blood and in lymphoid tissue. \n \nDevelopmental toxicity studies have been performed in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to \n100 mg/kg (treatment on gestation days 20-50) and have revealed no evidence of toxicity to the foetus \ndue to rituximab. However, dose-dependent pharmacologic depletion of B cells in the lymphoid \norgans of the foetuses was observed, which persisted postnatally and was accompanied by a decrease \nin IgG level in the newborn animals affected. B cell counts returned to normal in these animals within \n6 months of birth and did not compromise the reaction to immunisation. \n \nStandard tests to investigate mutagenicity have not been carried out, since such tests are not relevant \nfor this molecule. No long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic \npotential of rituximab.  \nSpecific studies to determine the effects of rituximab on fertility have not been performed. In general \ntoxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys no deleterious effects on reproductive organs in males or \nfemales were observed. \n \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nSodium citrate \nPolysorbate 80 \nSodium chloride \nSodium hydroxide \nHydrochloric acid \nWater for injections \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nNo incompatibilities between Rixathon and polyvinyl chloride or polyethylene bags or infusion sets \nhave been observed. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \nUnopened vial \n3 years. \n \nDiluted solution \n\u2022 After aseptic dilution in sodium chloride solution: \nChemical and physical stability of Rixathon diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride solution has been \ndemonstrated for 30 days at 2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C and subsequently 24 hours at room temperature (\u226425\u00b0C). \n \n\u2022 After aseptic dilution in glucose solution: \nChemical and physical stability of Rixathon diluted in 5% glucose solution has been demonstrated for \n24 hours at 2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C and subsequently 12 hours at room temperature (\u226425\u00b0C). \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the prepared infusion solution should be used immediately. If \nnot used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user \nand would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C, unless dilution has taken place in \ncontrolled and validated aseptic conditions. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C). \nKeep the container in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nFor storage conditions after dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \n10 mL vial: Clear Type I glass vials with butyl rubber stopper containing 100 mg of rituximab in \n10 mL.

This will allow quick identification of new safety \ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how \nto report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n\u2022 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\u2022 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\u2022 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n \n1. What Rixathon is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Rixathon \n3. How Rixathon is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Rixathon \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Rixathon is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Rixathon is \nRixathon contains the active substance \u201crituximab\u201d. This is a type of protein called a \u201cmonoclonal \nantibody\u201d. It sticks to the surface of a type of white blood cell called \u201cB-Lymphocyte\u201d. When \nrituximab sticks to the surface of this cell, the cell dies. \n \nWhat Rixathon is used for \nRixathon may be used for the treatment of several different conditions in adults. Your doctor may \nprescribe Rixathon for the treatment of: \n \na) Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma \nThis is a disease of the lymph tissue (part of the immune system) that affects a type of white blood cell \ncalled B-Lymphocytes. Rixathon can be given alone or with other medicines called \u201cchemotherapy\u201d. \nIn patients where the treatment is working, Rixathon may be used as a maintenance treatment for \n2 years after completing the initial treatment. \n \nb) Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common form of adult leukaemia. CLL affects a \nparticular lymphocyte, the B cell, which originates from the bone marrow and develops in the lymph \nnodes. Patients with CLL have too many abnormal lymphocytes, which accumulate mainly in the bone \nmarrow and blood. The proliferation of these abnormal B-lymphocytes is the cause of symptoms you \nmay have. Rixathon in combination with chemotherapy destroys these cells which are gradually \nremoved from the body by biological processes. \n \nc) Rheumatoid arthritis \nRixathon is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease of the \njoints. B lymphocytes are involved in the cause of some of the symptoms you have. Rixathon is used \nto treat rheumatoid arthritis in people who have already tried some other medicines which have either \n\n\n\n63 \n\nstopped working, have not worked well enough or have caused side effects. Rixathon is usually taken \ntogether with another medicine called methotrexate. \n \nRixathon slows down the damage to your joints caused by rheumatoid arthritis and improves your \nability to do normal daily activities. \n \nThe best responses to Rixathon are seen in those who have a positive blood test to rheumatoid factor \n(RF) and/or anti- Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide (anti-CCP). Both tests are commonly positive in \nrheumatoid arthritis and aid in confirming the diagnosis. \n \nd) Granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis \nRixathon is used for the treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener\u2019s \ngranulomatosis) or microscopic polyangiitis, taken in combination with corticosteroids.  \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis are two forms of inflammation of the \nblood vessels which mainly affects the lungs and kidneys, but may affect other organs as well. B \nlymphocytes are involved in the cause of these conditions. \n \ne) Pemphigus vulgaris \nRixathon is used for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris.  \nPemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune condition that causes painful blisters on the skin and lining of \nthe mouth, nose, throat and genitals. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Rixathon \n \nDo not take Rixathon if \n\u2022 you are allergic to rituximab, other proteins which are like rituximab, or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\u2022 you have a severe active infection at the moment \n\u2022 you have a weak immune system. \n\u2022 you have severe heart failure or severe uncontrolled heart disease and have rheumatoid arthritis, \n\ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris. \n \nDo not have Rixathon if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse before you are given Rixathon.  \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Rixathon if: \n \n\u2022 you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis infection. This is because in a few cases, \n\nRixathon could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in very rare cases. \nPatients who have ever had hepatitis B infection will be carefully checked by their doctor for \nsigns of this infection. \n\n\u2022 you have ever had heart problems (such as angina, palpitations or heart failure) or breathing \nproblems. \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nyou are given Rixathon. Your doctor may need to take special care of you during your treatment with \nRixathon. \n \nIf you have rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or \npemphigus vulgaris also tell your doctor \n\u2022 if you think you may have an infection, even a mild one like a cold. The cells that are affected \n\nby Rixathon help to fight infection and you should wait until the infection has passed before you \nare given Rixathon. Also please tell your doctor if you had a lot of infections in the past or \nsuffer from severe infections. \n\n\n\n64 \n\n\u2022 if you think you may need any vaccinations in the near future, including vaccinations needed to \ntravel to other countries. Some vaccines should not be given at the same time as Rixathon or in \nthe months after you receive Rixathon. Your doctor will check if you should have any vaccines \nbefore you receive Rixathon. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this medicine if you, or your child, are \nunder 18 years of age. This is because there is not much information about the use of rituximab in \nchildren and young people. \n \nOther medicines and Rixathon \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is \nbecause Rixathon can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can \naffect the way Rixathon works. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor: \n\u2022 if you are taking medicines for high blood pressure. You may be asked not to take these other \n\nmedicines 12 hours before you are given Rixathon. This is because some people have a fall in \ntheir blood pressure while they are being given Rixathon. \n\n\u2022 if you have ever taken medicines which affect your immune system \u2013 such as chemotherapy or \nimmune-suppressive medicines. \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nyou are given Rixathon. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou must tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, think that you might be pregnant or are \nplanning to become pregnant. This is because Rixathon can cross the placenta and may affect your \nbaby. \nIf you can get pregnant, you and your partner must use an effective method of contraception while \nusing Rixathon. You must also do this for 12 months after your last treatment with Rixathon. Do not \nbreast-feed while you are being treated with Rixathon. Also do not breast-feed for 12 months after \nyour last treatment with Rixathon. This is because Rixathon may pass into breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nRituximab may make you feel dizzy and may affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. \nIf you feel dizzy, do not drive or use any tools or machines. \n \nRixathon contains sodium \nThis medicine contains 2.3 mmol (or 52.6 mg) sodium per 10 mL vial. This medicine contains 11.5 \nmmol (or 263.2 mg) sodium per 50 mL vial. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled \nsodium diet. \n \n \n3. How Rixathon is given \n \nHow it is given \nRixathon will be given to you by a doctor or nurse who is experienced in the use of this treatment. \nThey will watch you closely while you are being given this medicine. This is in case you get any side \neffects. \nYou will always be given Rixathon as a drip (intra-venous infusion). \n \nMedicines given before each Rixathon administration \nBefore you are given Rixathon you will be given other medicines (premedication) to prevent or reduce \npossible side effects. \n \n\n\n\n65 \n\nHow much and how often you will receive your treatment \n \na) If you are being treated for non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma \n\n\u2022 If you are having Rixathon alone  \n\u2022 Rixathon will be given to you once a week for 4 weeks. Repeated treatment courses with \n\nRixathon are possible.  \n\u2022 If you are having Rixathon with chemotherapy \n\u2022 Rixathon will be given to you on the same day as your chemotherapy. This is usually \n\ngiven every 3 week up to 8 times.  \n\u2022 If you respond well to treatment, you may be given Rixathon as a maintenance treatment \n\nevery 2 or 3 months for two years. Your doctor may change this, depending on how you \nrespond to the medicine. \n\n \nb) If you are being treated for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \nWhen you are treated with Rixathon in combination with chemotherapy, you will receive Rixathon \ninfusions on day 0 cycle 1 then day 1 of each cycle for 6 cycles in total. Each cycle has a duration of \n28 days. The chemotherapy should be given after the Rixathon infusion. Your doctor will decide if \nyou should receive concomitant supportive therapy. \n \nc) If you are being treated for rheumatoid arthritis \nEach course of treatment is made up of two separate infusions which are given 2 weeks apart. \nRepeated courses of treatment with Rixathon are possible. Depending on the signs and symptoms of \nyour disease, your doctor will decide when you should receive more Rixathon. This may be months \nfrom now. \n \nd) If you are being treated for granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis \nTreatment with Rixathon uses four separate infusions given at weekly intervals. Corticosteroids will \nusually be given by injection before the start of Rixathon treatment. Corticosteroids given by mouth \nmay be started at any time by your doctor to treat your condition. \nIf you respond well to treatment, you may be given Rixathon as a maintenance treatment. This will be \nadministered as 2 separate infusions which are given 2 weeks apart, followed by 1 infusion every 6 \nmonths for at least 2 years. Your doctor may decide to treat you longer with Rixathon (up to 5 years), \ndepending on how you respond to the medicine. \n \ne) If you are being treated for pemphigus vulgaris \nEach course of treatment is made up of two separate infusions which are given 2 weeks apart. If you \nrespond well to treatment, you may be given Rixathon as a maintenance treatment. This will be \nadministered 1 year and 18 months after the initial treatment and then every 6 months as needed or \nyour doctor may change this, depending on how you respond to the medicine. \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nMost side effects are mild to moderate but some may be serious and require treatment. Rarely, some of \nthese reactions have been fatal. \n \nInfusion reactions \nDuring or within the first 24 hours of the infusion you may develop fever, chills and shivering. Less \nfrequently, some patients may experience pain at the infusion site, blisters, itching, sickness (nausea), \ntiredness, headache, breathing difficulties, blood pressure raised, wheezing, throat discomfort, tongue \nor throat swelling, itchy or runny nose, vomiting, flushing or palpitations, heart attack or low number \nof platelets. If you have heart disease or angina, these reactions might get worse. Tell the person \ngiving you the infusion immediately if you develop any of these symptoms, as the infusion may need \nto be slowed down or stopped. You may require additional treatment such as an antihistamine or \n\n\n\n66 \n\nparacetamol. When these symptoms go away, or improve, the infusion can be continued. These \nreactions are less likely to happen after the second infusion. Your doctor may decide to stop your \nRixathon treatment if these reactions are serious. \n \nInfections \nTell your doctor immediately if you get signs of an infection including: \n\u2022 fever, cough, sore throat, burning pain when passing urine or feeling weak or generally unwell \n\u2022 memory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty walking or sight loss \u2013these may be due to a very rare, \n\nserious brain infection, which has been fatal (Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy or \nPML). \n\nYou might get infections more easily during your treatment with Rixathon.  \nThese are often colds, but there have been cases of pneumonia or urinary infections. These are listed \nbelow under \u201cOther side effects\u201d.  \n \nIf you are being treated for rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic \npolyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris, you will also find this information in the Patient Alert Card you \nhave been given by your doctor. It is important that you keep this Alert Card and show it to your \npartner or caregiver. \n \nSkin reactions \nVery rarely, severe blistering skin conditions that can be life-threatening may occur.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what rixathon is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "what rixathon is rixathon contains the active substance \"rituximab\". this is a type of protein called a \"monoclonal antibody\". it sticks to the surface of a type of white blood cell called \"b-lymphocyte\". when rituximab sticks to the surface of this cell, the cell dies. what rixathon is used for rixathon may be used for the treatment of several different conditions in adults. your doctor may prescribe rixathon for the treatment of: a) non-hodgkin's lymphoma this is a disease of the lymph tissue (part of the immune system) that affects a type of white blood cell called b-lymphocytes. rixathon can be given alone or with other medicines called \"chemotherapy\". in patients where the treatment is working, rixathon may be used as a maintenance treatment for 2 years after completing the initial treatment. b) chronic lymphocytic leukaemia chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (cll) is the most common form of adult leukaemia. cll affects a particular lymphocyte, the b cell, which originates from the bone marrow and develops in the lymph nodes. patients with cll have too many abnormal lymphocytes, which accumulate mainly in the bone marrow and blood. the proliferation of these abnormal b-lymphocytes is the cause of symptoms you may have. rixathon in combination with chemotherapy destroys these cells which are gradually removed from the body by biological processes. c) rheumatoid arthritis rixathon is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. rheumatoid arthritis is a disease of the joints. b lymphocytes are involved in the cause of some of the symptoms you have. rixathon is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in people who have already tried some other medicines which have either 63 stopped working, have not worked well enough or have caused side effects. rixathon is usually taken together with another medicine called methotrexate. rixathon slows down the damage to your joints caused by rheumatoid arthritis and improves your ability to do normal daily activities. the best responses to rixathon are seen in those who have a positive blood test to rheumatoid factor (rf) and/or anti- cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-ccp). both tests are commonly positive in rheumatoid arthritis and aid in confirming the diagnosis. d) granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis rixathon is used for the treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called wegener's granulomatosis) or microscopic polyangiitis, taken in combination with corticosteroids. granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis are two forms of inflammation of the blood vessels which mainly affects the lungs and kidneys, but may affect other organs as well. b lymphocytes are involved in the cause of these conditions. e) pemphigus vulgaris rixathon is used for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris. pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune condition that causes painful blisters on the skin and lining of the mouth, nose, throat and genitals.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text":

other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). you have a severe active infection at the moment you have a weak immune system. you have severe heart failure or severe uncontrolled heart disease and have rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris. do not have rixathon if any of the above apply to you. if you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given rixathon. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given rixathon if: you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis infection. this is because in a few cases, rixathon could cause hepatitis b to become active again, which can be fatal in very rare cases. patients who have ever had hepatitis b infection will be carefully checked by their doctor for signs of this infection. you have ever had heart problems (such as angina, palpitations or heart failure) or breathing problems. if any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given rixathon. your doctor may need to take special care of you during your treatment with rixathon. if you have rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris also tell your doctor if you think you may have an infection, even a mild one like a cold. the cells that are affected by rixathon help to fight infection and you should wait until the infection has passed before you are given rixathon. also please tell your doctor if you had a lot of infections in the past or suffer from severe infections. if you think you may need any vaccinations in the near future, including vaccinations needed to travel to other countries. some vaccines should not be given at the same time as rixathon or in the months after you receive rixathon. your doctor will check if you should have any vaccines before you receive rixathon. children and adolescents talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this medicine if you, or your child, are under 18 years of age. this is because there is not much information about the use of rituximab in children and young people. other medicines and rixathon tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. this includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. this is because rixathon can affect the way some other medicines work. also some other medicines can affect the way rixathon works. in particular, tell your doctor: if you are taking medicines for high blood pressure. you may be asked not to take these other medicines 12 hours before you are given rixathon. this is because some people have a fall in their blood pressure while they are being given rixathon. if you have ever taken medicines which affect your immune system such as chemotherapy or immune-suppressive medicines. if any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given rixathon. pregnancy and breast-feeding you must tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, think that you might be pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. this is because rixathon can cross the placenta and may affect your baby. if you can get pregnant, you and your partner must use an effective method of contraception while using rixathon. you must also do this for 12 months after your last treatment with rixathon. do not breast-feed while you are being treated with rixathon. also do not breast-feed for 12 months after your last treatment with rixathon. this is because rixathon may pass into breast milk. driving and using machines rituximab may make you feel dizzy and may affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. if you feel dizzy, do not drive or use any tools or machines. rixathon contains sodium this medicine contains 2.3 mmol (or 52.6 mg) sodium per 10 ml vial. this medicine contains 11.5 mmol (or 263.2 mg) sodium per 50 ml vial. to be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text":
