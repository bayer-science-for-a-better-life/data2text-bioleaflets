This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nPortrazza 800 mg concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach 50 mL vial contains 800 mg of necitumumab. \nEach mL of concentrate for solution for infusion contains 16 mg of necitumumab. \nThe concentrate must be diluted before use (see section 6.6). \n \nNecitumumab is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody produced in murine (NS0) cells by recombinant \nDNA technology. \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach 50 mL vial contains approximately 76 mg sodium. \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \n \nClear to slightly opalescent and colourless to slightly yellow liquid, with pH 6.0. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPortrazza in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy is indicated for the treatment \nof adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) \nexpressing squamous non-small cell lung cancer who have not received prior chemotherapy for this \ncondition. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNecitumumab therapy must be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the use \nof anti-cancer chemotherapy. \nAppropriate medical resources for the treatment of severe infusion reactions should be available \nduring necitumumab infusions. Availability of resuscitation equipment must be ensured. \n \nPosology \n \nPortrazza is administered in addition to gemcitabine and cisplatin-based chemotherapy for up to \n6 cycles of treatment followed by Portrazza as a single agent in patients whose disease has not \nprogressed, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \n \nThe recommended dose of Portrazza is 800 mg (flat dose) administered as an intravenous infusion \nover 60 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of each 3-week cycle. If a decreased infusion rate is indicated, the \ninfusion duration should not exceed 2 hours. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nPatients should be monitored during infusion for signs of infusion-related reactions (see section 4.4). \n \nPremedication \nIn patients who have experienced a previous Grade 1-2 hypersensitivity or infusion-related reaction to \nPortrazza, premedication with a corticosteroid and an antipyretic in addition to an antihistamine is \nrecommended. \n \nPrior to each necitumumab infusion, premedication for possible skin reactions must be considered (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nPosology adjustments \nRecommendations for the management of infusion-related and skin reactions are provided in tables 1 \nand 2. \n \nHypersensitivity/Infusion-related reactions \n \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Management recommendations for hypersensitivity/infusion-related \nreactions \n\n \nToxicity \ngradea \n\nManagement recommendations \n(any occurrence) \n\nGrade 1 \u2022 Decrease infusion rate by 50  % for the duration of infusion.b \n\u2022 Monitor patient for worsening of condition. \n\u2022 For subsequent infusions, please see premedication section. \n\nGrade 2 \u2022 Stop the infusion; when the reaction has resolved to Grade \n\u2264 1, resume infusion at a 50  % decreased infusion rate.b \n\n\u2022 Monitor patient for worsening of condition. \n\u2022 For subsequent infusions, please see premedication section. \n\nGrade 3-4 \u2022 Immediately and permanently discontinue treatment with \nnecitumumab. \n\na Grade per NCI-CTCAE, Version 3.0 \nb Once the infusion rate has been reduced for a Grade 1 or 2 hypersensitivity/infusion-related \nreaction, it is recommended that the lower infusion rate be utilized for all subsequent infusions. \nThe infusion duration should not exceed 2 hours. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nSkin reactions \n \nTable 2 \u2013 Management recommendations for skin reactions \n\n \nToxicity \ngradea \n\nManagement recommendations \n(any occurrence) \n\nGrades 1 and 2 \u2022 No dose adjustment necessary \nGrade 3 \u2022 Temporarily withhold, for a maximum of 6 weeks following \n\nDay 1 of the most recent treatment cycle, until symptoms resolve \nto Grade \u2264 2. Permanently discontinue if symptoms do not \nresolve to Grade \u2264 2 after holding for 2 consecutive cycles \n(6 weeks) \n\n\u2022 Following improvement to Grade \u2264 2, resume at reduced dose of \n400 mg. If symptoms worsen at 400 mg, permanently \ndiscontinue. \n\n\u2022 If symptoms do not worsen at 400 mg for at least \n1 treatment cycle, the dose may be increased to 600 mg If \nsymptoms worsen at 600 mg, temporarily withhold, for a \nmaximum of 6 weeks following Day 1 of the most recent \ntreatment cycle, until symptoms resolve to Grade \u2264 2. Following \nimprovement to Grade \u2264 2, resume at reduced dose of 400 mg. \n\n\u2022 If symptoms do not worsen at 600 mg for another \ntreatment cycle, the dose may be further increased to 800 mg. \n\n\u2022 Permanently discontinue if patients experience Grade 3 skin \ninduration/fibrosis. \n\nGrade 4 \u2022 Immediately and permanently discontinue treatment with \nnecitumumab. \n\na Grade per NCI-CTCAE, Version 3.0 \n \n \n\n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of necitumumab in the paediatric population in the non-small cell lung cancer \nindication. \n \nElderly  \nNo dose reductions other than those recommended for all patients are necessary (see sections 4.4 and \n5.1). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustments are required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). \nThere are no data regarding necitumumab administration in patients with severe renal impairment. No \ndose reductions are recommended.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nThere are no data regarding necitumumab administration in patients with moderate or severe hepatic \nimpairment (see section 5.2). No dose reductions are recommended. \n \nMethod of administration  \nPortrazza is for intravenous use only. It is administered as an intravenous infusion over approximately \n60 minutes via an infusion pump. Portrazza must not be administered as an intravenous bolus or push. \nIn case of previous hypersensitivity or infusion-related reaction, recommendations for management of \nhypersensitivity/infusion-related reactions should be followed, as for Table 1. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nOnly sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection should be used as a diluent. Portrazza \ninfusions should not be administered or mixed with glucose solutions. \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nPatients with a history of severe or life-threatening hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of \nthe excipients listed in section 6.1 (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThromboembolic events  \nVenous thromboembolic events (VTE) and arterial thromboembolic events (ATE), including fatal \ncases, were observed with necitumumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin (see also \nsection 4.8).  \nAdministration of necitumumab should be carefully considered in those patients with a history of \nthromboembolic events (such as pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, \nstroke) or preexisting risk factors for thromboembolic events (such as advanced age, patients with \nprolonged periods of immobilisation, severely hypovolemic patients, patients with acquired or \ninherited thrombophilic disorders). The relative risk of VTE or ATE was approximately three-fold \nhigher in patients with a reported history of VTE or ATE. \nNecitumumab should not be administered to patients with multiple risk factors for thromboembolic \nevents unless the benefits outweigh the risks to the patient. \nThromboprophylaxis should be considered after careful assessment of a patient's risk factors \n(including the increased risk of serious bleeding in patients with tumour cavitation or tumour \ninvolvement of large central blood vessels). \nPatients and physicians should be aware of signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. Patients should \nbe instructed to seek medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, \narm or leg swelling.  \nDiscontinuation of necitumumab in patients who experience a VTE or ATE should be considered after \na thorough benefit risk assessment for the individual patient. \n \nIn a clinical trial in advanced non-squamous NSCLC, patients experienced an increased rate of serious \nthromboembolic events (including fatal events) in the necitumumab plus pemetrexed and cisplatin arm \nas compared to the pemetrexed and cisplatin arm (see also section 4.8). The addition of necitumumab \ndid not improve the efficacy outcome over pemetrexed and cisplatin alone in advanced non-squamous \nNSCLC. \n \nCardiorespiratory disorders \nAn increased frequency of cardiorespiratory arrest or sudden death was observed with necitumumab. \nCardiorespiratory arrest or sudden death was reported in 2.8% (15/538) of patients treated with \nnecitumumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin compared to 0.6% (3/541) of patients \ntreated with chemotherapy alone. Twelve of the fifteen patients died within 30 days of the last dose of \nnecitumumab and had comorbid conditions including history of coronary artery disease (n=3), \nhypomagnesemia (n=4), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n=7), and hypertension (n=5). Eleven \nof the 12 patients had an unwitnessed death. Patients with significant coronary artery disease, \nmyocardial infarction within 6 months, uncontrolled hypertension, and uncontrolled congestive heart \nfailure were not enrolled in the pivotal study. The incremental risk of cardiopulmonary arrest or \nsudden death in patients with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or \narrhythmias as compared to those without these comorbid conditions is not known. \n \nHypersensitivity/infusion-related reactions \nHypersensitivity/infusion-related reactions (IRRs) were reported with necitumumab. The onset of \nevents usually occurred after the first or second administration of necitumumab. Monitor patients \nduring and following the infusion for signs of hypersensitivity and infusion-related reactions with \n\n\n\n6 \n\nresuscitation equipment and appropriate medical resources readily available. In patients who have \nexperienced a previous Grade 1 or 2 hypersensitivity or infusion related reaction to Portrazza, \npremedication with a corticosteroid and an antipyretic in addition to an antihistamine is recommended. \nFor management and dose adjustments, see section 4.2.  \n \nSkin reactions \nSkin reactions were reported with necitumumab (see section 4.8). The onset of events occurred mainly \nduring the first cycle of treatment. For management and dose adjustments, see section 4.2.  \nPre-emptive skin treatment including skin moisturiser, sun screen, topical steroid cream (1 % \nhydrocortisone) and an oral antibiotic (e.g. doxycycline) may be useful in the management of \ndermatologic reactions as clinically appropriate. Patients may be advised to apply moisturiser, \nsunscreen and topical steroid cream to face, hands, feet, neck, back and chest. \n \nElectrolyte abnormalities \nProgressively decreasing serum magnesium levels occur frequently (81.3%) and may lead to severe \nHypomagnesaemia (18.7%) (see also section 4.8). Hypomagnesaemia may reoccur at the same grade \nor worse after a dose delay. Patients should be carefully monitored for serum electrolytes, including \nserum magnesium, potassium, and calcium, prior to each necitumumab administration and after \ncompletion of necitumumab treatment, until within normal limits. Prompt electrolyte repletion is \nrecommended, as appropriate. \n \nInfections \nIn a phase 2 clinical trial investigating necitumumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin \nversus paclitaxel and carboplatin alone as the first-line therapy in patients with Stage IV metastatic \nsquamous NSCLC, an increased rate of infections was observed early after start of treatment, which \nled to subsequent infectious complications such as pneumonia and/or sepsis.  A similar observation \nwas made in a clinical trial investigating necitumumab in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin \nversus pemetrexed and cisplatin alone as the first-line therapy in patients with advanced \nnon-squamous NSCLC. \n \nSpecial attention should be given to patients with clinical evidence of concomitant infectious \nconditions including early signs of active infections.  Treatment of any infection should be initiated \naccording to local standards. \n \nElderly \nNo overall differences in efficacy between arms were observed in patients above 70 years of age. \nCardiovascular comorbidities, performance status and the likely tolerability to chemotherapy with \nadd-on necitumumab should therefore be thoroughly evaluated prior to the initiation of treatment in \npatients above 70 years of age.  \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in females \nBased on its mechanism of action and animal models where EGFR expression is disrupted, \nnecitumumab may cause foetal harm or developmental anomalies. Women of childbearing potential \nshould be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while on necitumumab. Effective contraception has to \nbe used during necitumumab treatment and up to 3 months after last administration of necitumumab \ntreatment. Contraceptive measures or abstinence are recommended (see section 4.6). \n \nSodium restricted diet \nThis medicinal product contains 76 mg sodium per dose. To be taken into consideration by patients on \na controlled sodium diet. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo drug-drug interactions were observed between Portrazza and gemcitabine/cisplatin. The \npharmacokinetics of gemcitabine/cisplatin were not affected when co-administered with necitumumab \n\n\n\n7 \n\nand the pharmacokinetics of necitumumab were not affected when co-administered with \ngemcitabine/cisplatin. \n \nNo other formal interaction studies with necitumumab have been performed in humans. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in females \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while on \nnecitumumab and should be informed of the potential hazard to the pregnancy and foetus. Women of \nchildbearing potential have to use effective contraception during necitumumab treatment and up to \n3 months after last administration of necitumumab treatment. Contraceptive measures or abstinence \nare recommended. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of necitumumab in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies have \nnot been conducted with necitumumab. Based on animal models, epidermal growth factor receptor \n(EGFR) is involved in prenatal development and may be essential for normal organogenesis, \nproliferation, and differentiation in the developing embryo. Portrazza should not be used during \npregnancy or in women not using effective contraception, unless the potential benefit justifies the \npotential risk to the foetus.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether necitumumab is excreted in human milk. Excretion in milk and oral absorption \nis expected to be low. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be \ndiscontinued during treatment with Portrazza and for at least 4 months after the last dose. \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on the effect of necitumumab on human fertility. Animal studies to assess fertility \ndirectly have not been conducted (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPortrazza has no known influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If patients experience \ntreatment-related symptoms affecting their ability to concentrate and react, it is recommended that \nthey do not drive or use machines until the effect subsides. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nThe most common serious adverse reactions (Grade \u22653) observed in necitumumab-treated patients are \nskin reactions (6.3 %) and venous thromboembolic events (4.3 %). \n \nThe most common adverse reactions were skin reactions, venous thromboembolic events and \nlaboratory abnormalities (hypomagnesaemia and albumin-corrected hypocalcaemia). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse drug reactions (ADRs) which were reported in patients with squamous non-small cell lung \ncancer are listed below in MedDRA body system organ class, frequency and grade of severity. The \nfollowing convention has been used for classification of frequency: \nVery common (\u22651/10) \nCommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare (<1/10,000) \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, ADRs are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe following table provides the frequency and severity of ADRs based on results from SQUIRE, a \nglobal, multicenter, two-arm, randomized Phase 3 study in adult patients with squamous NSCLC \nrandomised to treatment with necitumumab in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin or \ngemcitabine/cisplatin. \n \nTable 3.

Only patients with baseline and at least one post-baseline result \n\nare included. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nThromboembolic events \nVenous thromboembolic events (VTEs) were reported in approximately 8 % of patients and mainly \npresent as pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. Severe VTEs were reported in \napproximately 4 % of patients. The incidence of fatal VTEs was similar between arms (0.2%).  \nArterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) were reported in approximately 4 % of patients and mainly \npresent as stroke and myocardial infarction. Severe ATEs were reported in 3 % of patients. The \nincidence of fatal ATEs was 0.6% in the experimental arm versus 0.2% in the control arm (see also \nsection 4.4). \n \nIn a clinical trial in advanced non-squamous NSCLC, venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) were \nreported in approximately 11 % of patients treated with necitumumab in combination with pemetrexed \nand cisplatin (versus 8 % in the pemetrexed and cisplatin alone arm) and mainly presented as \npulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. Severe VTEs were reported in approximately 6 % of \npatients treated with necitumumab in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin (versus 4 % in the \npemetrexed and cisplatin alone arm).  \nArterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) were reported in approximately 4 % of patients treated with \nnecitumumab in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin (versus 6 % in the pemetrexed and \ncisplatin alone arm) and mainly present as stroke and myocardial infarction. Severe ATEs were \nreported in approximately 3 % of patients treated with necitumumab in combination with pemetrexed \nand cisplatin (versus 4 % in the pemetrexed and cisplatin alone arm). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nSkin reactions \nSkin reactions were reported in approximately 78 % of patients and mainly presented as acneiform \nrash, dermatitis acneiform, dry skin, pruritus, skin fissures, paronychia and palmar-plantar \nerythrodysaesthesia syndrome. Severe skin rections were reported in approximately 6 % of patients \nwhile 1.7 % of patients discontinued due to skin reactions. The majority of skin reactions developed \nduring the first cycle of treatment and resolved within 17 weeks after onset  (see also section 4.4). \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nInfusion-related reactions were reported in 1.5 % of patients and mainly present as chills, fever or \ndyspnoea. Severe infusion-related reactions were reported in 0.4 % of patients. The majority of \ninfusion-related reactions developed after the first or second administration of necitumumab. \n \nToxicity in the elderly or in patients with ECOG PS 2 \nClinically relevant toxicities with respect to the elderly and those patients with Eastern Cooperative \nOncology Group (ECOG) performance status score 2 (ECOG PS2) were similar to the overall \npopulation in patients receiving necitumumab plus chemotherapy consisting of gemcitabine and \ncisplatin. \n \nEyelash trichomegaly \nIsolated cases of Grade 1 trichomegaly have been reported in patients treated with necitumumab. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere has been limited experience with necitumumab overdose in human clinical trials. The highest \ndose of necitumumab studied clinically in a human dose-escalation Phase 1 study is 1,000 mg once a \nweek or once every other week. Adverse events observed included headache, vomiting and nausea and \nwere consistent with the safety profile at the recommended dose. There is no known antidote for \nnecitumumab overdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC22 \n \nMechanism of action \nNecitumumab is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and \nspecificity to the human epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR) and blocks the ligand binding \nsite, blocking activation by all known ligands and inhibiting relevant biological consequences in vitro. \nActivation of EGFR has been correlated with malignant progression, induction of angiogenesis and \ninhibition of apoptosis or cell death. In addition, necitumumab induces EGFR internalization and \ndegradation in vitro. In vivo studies in cell line-derived xenograft models of human cancer, including \nnon-small cell lung carcinoma, demonstrate that necitumumab has antitumor activity both in \nmonotherapy and in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin. \n \nImmunogenicity \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for immunogenicity.  \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\nOverall, there was a low incidence of both treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies and neutralizing \nantibodies among necitumumab-treated patients, and no correlation with safety outcomes in these \npatients. There was no relationship between immunogenicity and IRRs or treatment emergent adverse \nevents. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nSQUIRE, a global, multicenter, two-arm, randomized study of Portrazza, was conducted in \n1,093 patients with stage IV (American Joint Committee on Cancer Version 7) squamous NSCLC, \nincluding patients with ECOG PS2, who had received no prior anticancer  therapy for metastatic \ndisease. Patients were randomised to receive first-line Portrazza at 800 mg plus chemotherapy \nconsisting of gemcitabine at 1,250 mg/m2 and cisplatin at 75 mg/m2 (Portrazza+GC Arm), or \ngemcitabine-cisplatin chemotherapy alone (GC Arm). Portrazza and gemcitabine were administered \non days 1 and 8 of each 3-week treatment cycle, and cisplatin was administered on day 1 of each \n3-week treatment cycle. There was no premedication for Portrazza mandated by the study. \nPre-emptive treatment for skin reaction was not permitted prior to the beginning of the second \ntreatment cycle. Patients received a maximum of six cycles of chemotherapy in each arm; patients in \nthe Portrazza+GC arm who had no progression continued to receive single-agent Portrazza until \ndisease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. The major efficacy outcome \nmeasure was overall survival (OS) and the supportive efficacy outcome measure was progression-free \nsurvival (PFS). Patients underwent radiographic assessment of disease status every six weeks, until \nradiographic documentation of progressive disease (PD).  \n \nDemographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between arms. Median age was 62 (32-86), \n83 % of patients were men; 83.5 % were Caucasian; and 91 % were smokers. The ECOG PS was 0 for \n31.5 %, 1 for 59.7 %, and 2 for 9 % of patients; over 50 % had metastatic disease at more than 2 sites. \nIn the Portrazza+GC arm, 51 % of patients continued with single-agent Portrazza after completing \nchemotherapy.

A tumour was considered to be EGFR-\nexpressing if at least one stained cell could be identified. The large majority of patients (95.2% of \nevaluable patients; n = 935) had tumor samples expressing EGFR protein; 4.8% (n = 47) were not \ndetectable for EGFR protein expression. There were no relevant differences in the distribution of \ndemographics, disease characteristics, or the use of post-study systemic therapy between the subset of \npatients with detectable EGFR protein expression and the ITT population.  \n \nIn patients with detectable EGFR protein expression (indicated patient population), overall survival \nwas statistically significantly improved in the Portrazza+GC Arm as compared to the GC Arm with an \nestimated reduction in risk of death of  21% (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.79 [0.69, 0.92]; p = 0.002) and a \nmedian OS of 11.7 months in the Portrazza+GC Arm and 10.0 months in the GC Arm.   \nA statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival was also observed (HR = 0.84 \n[0.72, 0.97]; p = 0.018), with a median PFS of 5.7 months in the Portrazza+GC Arm and 5.5 months in \nthe GC Arm. \nIn patients with detectable EGFR protein expression, there was no trend observed for increased \nefficacy with increasing levels of EGFR expression.  \n\n\n\n14 \n\nIn patients with no detectable EGFR protein expression, no improvement in overall survival (hazard \nratio [HR] = 1.52 [0.74, 3.12]) or progression free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.33 [0.65, 2.70] was \nobserved. \n \nIn a phase 2 clinical trial investigating necitumumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin \nversus paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (106 versus 55 patients, 2:1 randomisation) as the first-line \ntherapy in patients with Stage IV metastatic squamous NSCLC, a higher rate of death, including death \ndue to infection, was observed for the necitumumab plus paclitaxel/carboplatin arm during the first \n4 months (see also section 4.4), with a later trend towards improved survival after 4 months.  The \noverall survival hazard ratio [HR] was 0.83 [0.55, 1.52]. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nPortrazza in all subsets of the paediatric population in non-small cell lung cancer (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing the dose regimen of 800 mg necitumumab on day 1 and day 8 of a 21 day schedule, the \ngeometric mean of necitumumab Cmin was 98.5 \u03bcg/mL (Coefficient of Variation 80 %) in serum from \npatients with squamous NSCLC after five cycles of treatment in combination with gemcitabine and \ncisplatin. \n \nAbsorption \nPortrazza is administered as an intravenous infusion. There have been no studies performed with other \nroutes of administration. \n \nDistribution \nDistribution of Portrazza follow a biphasic decline. Based on population pharmacokinetic approach \n(PopPK), the mean volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) for necitumumab was 6.97 L (CV \n31 %). \n \nElimination \nNecitumumab exhibits concentration-dependent clearance. Mean total systemic clearance (CLtot) at \nsteady state following 800 mg on Day 1 and Day 8 of a 21-day cycle was 0.014 l/hr (CV 39 %). This \ncorresponds to a half-life of approximately 14 days. The predicted time to reach steady state was \napproximately 70 days. \n \nSpecial populations \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis suggested age, gender, and race had no effect on the \npharmacokinetics of necitumumab, while CL and volume of distribution had a less than proportional \npositive correlation with body weight. Although modeling results suggest that the disposition of \nnecitumumab was statistically dependent on body weight, simulations indicated that weight-based \ndosing would not significantly decrease PK variability. No dose adjustment is necessary for these sub-\npopulations. \n \nElderly \nBased on the results of the population pharamacokinetic analysis, there was no impact of age on \nnecitumumab exposure. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo formal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the PK of \nnecitumumab. Based on the results of the population pharmacokinetic analysis, there was no impact of \nrenal function as assessed by creatinine clearance [CrCl] on the pharmacokinetics of necitumumab.  \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nHepatic impairment \nNo formal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the PK of \nnecitumumab. Based on the results of the population pharmacokinetic analysis, hepatic status (as \nassessed by alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase and total bilirubin) had no significant \neffect on the pharmacokinetics of necitumumab. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nDose dependent reversible skin toxicity was observed in the 26-week monkey study. The skin effects \nwere consistent with the known class effects of EGFR inhibitors.   \n \nSpecific animal studies to test necitumumab for carcinogenic potential or potential to impair fertility \nhave not been performed. The risk of fertility impairment is unknown. However, no adverse effects on \nmale or female reproductive organs were observed in monkeys treated for 26 weeks with \nnecitumumab. \n \nHuman IgG1 is known to cross the placenta; therefore, necitumumab has the potential to be \ntransmitted from the mother to the developing foetus. No animal studies have been specifically \nconducted to evaluate the effect of necitumumab on reproduction and foetal development; however, \nbased on its mechanism of action and animal models where EGFR expression is disrupted, \nnecitumumab may cause foetal harm or developmental anomalies. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Portrazza is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you are given Portrazza  \n3. How you are given Portrazza \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Portrazza  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Portrazza is and what it is used for \n \nPortrazza contains the active substance necitumumab, which belongs to a group of substances called \nmonoclonal antibodies.  \n \nNecitumumab recognises and binds specifically to a protein on the surface of some cancer cells. The \nprotein is known as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Other body proteins (called growth \nfactors) can attach to the EGFR and stimulate the cancer cell to grow and divide. Necitumumab \nhinders other proteins from binding  to the EGFR and thus prevents the cancer cell from growth and \ndivision.  \n \nPortrazza is used in combination with other anti-cancer medicines for the treatment of adults with \ncertain type of lung cancer at an advanced stage (squamous non-small cell lung cancer), whose cancer \ncells have the EGFR protein on their surface. The anti-cancer medicines it is combined with are \ngemcitabine and cisplatin. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Portrazza  \n \nYou must not be given Portrazza \n- if you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to necitumumab or any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or nurse immediately if any of the following applies to you (or you are not sure) \nduring or after treatment with Portrazza: \n \n\u2013 Blood clots in the arteries or the veins \n\nPortrazza can cause blood clots in your arteries or your veins. Symptoms may include swelling, \npain and tenderness of the limb, difficulty breathing, chest pain, or an abnormal heartbeat and \n\n\n\n28 \n\ndiscomfort. Your doctor will discuss with you whether you need any preventive measures. See \nalso section 4 for the symptoms of blood clots. \n\n \n\u2013 Cardiorespiratory disorders \n\nCases of cardiorespiratory disorders and unexplained death were observed in patients treated \nwith Portrazza in combination with  gemcitabine and cisplatin and in patients treated  with \ngemcitabine and cisplatin alone. The causes of these deaths and their relationship to treatment \nwere not always known. Portrazza may increase this risk. Your doctor will discuss this with \nyou. \n \n\n\u2013 Infusion-related reaction \nInfusion-related reactions may occur during treatment with Portrazza. Such reactions may be \nallergic. Your doctor will discuss with you whether you need any preventive measures or early \ntreatment. Your doctor or nurse will check for side effects during your infusion. If you have a \nsevere infusion-related reaction, your doctor may recommend adjusting the dose of Portrazza, or \nstop your treatment with Portrazza. See section 4 for more details about infusion-related \nreactions which may occur during or after the infusion. \n\n \n\u2013 Skin reactions \n\nPortrazza may cause side effects involving the skin. Your doctor will discuss with you whether \nyou need any preventive measures or early treatment. If you have a severe skin reaction, your \ndoctor may recommend adjusting the dose of Portrazza, or stop your treatment with Portrazza. \nSee section 4 for more details about skin reactions. \n\n \n\u2013 Blood levels of magnesium, calcium, potassium and phosphate \n\nDuring treatment, your  doctor will check your blood periodically for levels of several \nsubstances such as magnesium, calcium, potassium and phosphate. If these levels are too low, \nyour doctor may prescribe appropriate supplements. \n \n\n\u2013 Infections \nIf you have signs of infection before start of treatment please tell your doctor.  \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nPortrazza should not be given to patients under the age of 18 years because there is no information \nabout how it works in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Portrazza \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This \nincludes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nBefore starting treatment you must tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you \nmay be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. \n \nAvoid getting pregnant while receiving this medicine and for at least 3 months after the last dose of \nPortrazza as this medicine may potentially cause harm to your unborn child. Talk to your doctor about \nthe best contraception for you. \n \nDo not breast-feed your baby during treatment with Portrazza and for at least 4 months after you \nreceive the last dose, as this medicine may harm the growth and development of your baby. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIf you experience any symptoms affecting your ability to concentrate and react, do not drive or use \nmachines until the effect goes away. \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nPortrazza contains sodium \nThis medicine contains 76 mg sodium per dose. This should be taken into consideration by patients on \na controlled sodium diet. \n \n \n3. How you are given Portrazza \n \nA doctor experienced in the use of anti-cancer medicines will supervise your Portrazza therapy. \n \nPremedication \nYou may be given medicines to reduce the risk of an infusion-related reaction or a skin reaction before \nyou receive Portrazza.  \n \nDose and administration \nThe recommended dose of Portrazza is 800 mg on days 1 and 8 of each 3-week cycle. Portrazza is \ngiven in combination with the medicines gemcitabine and cisplatin for up to 6 cycles and then it is \ngiven on its own. The number of infusions that you receive will depend on how and for how long you \nrespond to treatment with Portrazza. Your doctor will discuss this with you. \n \nThis medicine is given as an intravenous (into a vein) infusion via a drip. The drip lasts about \n60 minutes. \n \nDetailed instructions for your doctor or your nurse on how to prepare Portrazza infusion are included \nat the end of this package leaflet (see \u2018Handling instructions\u2019). \n \nDose adjustments \nDuring each infusion, your doctor or nurse will check for side effects. If you have an infusion-related \nreaction during treatment, your drip will be slowed down and future doses will also be given more \nslowly. The infusion duration should not exceed 2 hours. See also section 2 under \u201cWarnings and \nprecautions\u201d. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe important side effects of Portrazza are skin reactions and blood clots in the veins. \n \nSeek medical help immediately if you experience any of the following: \n \nBlood clots in the veins \nVenous blood clots are likely to occur in approximately 8 out of 100 patients. In approximately 4 out \nof 100 patients these side effects are likely to be severe. They can lead to a blockage of a blood vessel \nin the leg. Symptoms may include swelling, pain and tenderness of the limb. Blood clots can also lead \nto a blockage in the blood vessels of the lung. Symptoms may include difficulty breathing, chest pain, \nor an abnormal heartbeat and discomfort.  \n \nSkin reactions \nSkin reactions may occur in approximately 80 out of 100 patients who take Portrazza and are usually \nmild to moderate.

If particulate matter or discolouration is identified, \ndiscard the vial.  \n\n \nVials contain 800 mg as a 16 mg/mL solution of necitumumab; one 50 mL vial contains the complete \ndose. Only use sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection as a diluent. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n33 \n\nTo administer using pre-filled intravenous infusion containers   \nAseptically remove 50 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection from the \nprefilled 250 mL container and transfer 50 mL of necitumumab medicine into the container to bring \nthe final volume in the container back to 250 mL. Gently invert the container to mix. DO NOT \nFREEZE OR SHAKE the infusion solution. DO NOT dilute with other solutions or co-infuse with \nother electrolytes or medicines. \n\n \nTo administer using empty intravenous infusion containers \nAseptically transfer 50 mL of necitumumab medicine into an empty intravenous container and add \n200 mL of sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection to the container to bring the \ntotal volume to 250 mL. Gently invert the container to mix. DO NOT FREEZE OR SHAKE the \ninfusion solution.

called monoclonal antibodies. necitumumab recognises and binds specifically to a protein on the surface of some cancer cells. the protein is known as epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr). other body proteins (called growth factors) can attach to the egfr and stimulate the cancer cell to grow and divide. necitumumab hinders other proteins from binding to the egfr and thus prevents the cancer cell from growth and division. portrazza is used in combination with other anti-cancer medicines for the treatment of adults with certain type of lung cancer at an advanced stage (squamous non-small cell lung cancer), whose cancer cells have the egfr protein on their surface. the anti-cancer medicines it is combined with are gemcitabine and cisplatin.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text":

up to 6 cycles and then it is given on its own. the number of infusions that you receive will depend on how and for how long you respond to treatment with portrazza. your doctor will discuss this with you. this medicine is given as an intravenous (into a vein) infusion via a drip. the drip lasts about 60 minutes. detailed instructions for your doctor or your nurse on how to prepare portrazza infusion are included at the end of this package leaflet (see 'handling instructions'). dose adjustments during each infusion, your doctor or nurse will check for side effects. if you have an infusion-related reaction during treatment, your drip will be slowed down and future doses will also be given more slowly. the infusion duration should not exceed 2 hours. see also section 2 under
