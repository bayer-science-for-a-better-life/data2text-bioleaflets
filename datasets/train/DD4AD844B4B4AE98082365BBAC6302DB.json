PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nGastro-resistant hard capsule \n \nTecfidera 120mg gastro-resistant hard capsules \n \nGreen and white gastro-resistant hard capsules, size 0, printed with \u2018BG-12 120 mg\u2019 containing \nmicrotablets. \n \nTecfidera 240mg gastro-resistant hard capsules \n \nGreen gastro-resistant hard capsules, size 0, printed with \u2018BG-12 240 mg\u2019 containing microtablets. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTecfidera is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis \n(see section 5.1 for important information on the populations for which efficacy has been established). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nmultiple sclerosis.  \n \nPosology \n \nThe starting dose is 120 mg twice a day. After 7 days, the dose should be increased to the \nrecommended maintenance dose of 240 mg twice a day (see section 4.4). \n \nIf a patient misses a dose, a double dose should not be taken. The patient may take the missed dose \nonly if they leave 4 hours between doses. Otherwise the patient should wait until the next scheduled \ndose.  \n \nTemporary dose reduction to 120 mg twice a day may reduce the occurrence of flushing and \ngastrointestinal adverse reactions. Within 1 month, the recommended maintenance dose of 240 mg \ntwice a day should be resumed. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nTecfidera should be taken with food (see section 5.2). For those patients who may experience flushing \nor gastrointestinal adverse reactions, taking Tecfidera with food may improve tolerability (see \nsections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nClinical studies of Tecfidera had limited exposure to patients aged 55 years and above, and did not \ninclude sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently \nthan younger patients (see section 5.2). Based on the mode of action of the active substance there are \nno theoretical reasons for any requirement for dose adjustments in the elderly. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nTecfidera has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Based on clinical \npharmacology studies, no dose adjustments are needed (see section 5.2). Caution should be used when \ntreating patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Tecfidera in children and adolescents aged 10 to 18 years have not yet been \nestablished. \nCurrently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. There is no relevant use of Tecfidera in children aged less than 10 years for the \nindication of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nFor oral use. \n \nThe capsule should be swallowed whole. The capsule or its contents should not be crushed, divided, \ndissolved, sucked or chewed as the enteric-coating of the microtablets prevents irritant effects on the \ngut.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nSuspected or confirmed Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nBlood/laboratory tests \n\nChanges in renal laboratory tests have been seen in clinical trials in subjects treated with dimethyl \nfumarate (see section 4.8). The clinical implications of these changes are unknown. Assessment of \nrenal function (e.g. creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and urinalysis) is recommended prior to treatment \ninitiation, after 3 and 6 months of treatment, every 6 to 12 months thereafter and as clinically \nindicated.  \n \nDrug-induced liver injury, including liver enzyme increase (\u2265 3 upper limit of normal (ULN)) and \nelevation of total bilirubin levels (\u2265 2 ULN) can result from treatment with dimethyl fumarate. The \ntime to onset can be directly, several weeks or longer. Resolution of the adverse reactions has been \nobserved after treatment was discontinued. Assessment of serum aminotransferases (e.g. alanine \naminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST)) and total bilirubin levels are \nrecommended prior to treatment initiation and during treatment as clinically indicated. \nPatients treated with Tecfidera may develop lymphopenia (see section 4.8). Prior to initiating \ntreatment with Tecfidera, a current complete blood count, including lymphocytes, must be performed.  \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nIf lymphocyte count is found to be below the normal range, thorough assessment of possible causes \nshould be completed prior to initiation of treatment with Tecfidera. Dimethyl fumarate has not been \nstudied in patients with pre-existing low lymphocyte counts and caution should be exercised when \ntreating these patients. Tecfidera should not be initiated in patients with severe lymphopenia \n(lymphocyte counts <0.5 x 109/L). \n \nAfter starting therapy, complete blood counts, including lymphocytes, must be performed every 3 \nmonths.  \n \nEnhanced vigilance due to an increased risk for Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) \nis recommended in patients with lymphopenia as follows:  \n\n\u2022 Tecfidera should be discontinued in patients with prolonged severe lymphopenia (lymphocyte \ncounts <0.5 x 109/L) persisting for more than 6 months.  \n\n\u2022 In patients with sustained moderate reductions of absolute lymphocyte counts \u22650.5 x 109/L \nand < 0.8 x 109/L for more than six months, the benefit/risk of Tecfidera treatment should be \nre-assessed. \n\n\u2022 In patients with lymphocyte counts below lower limit of normal (LLN) as defined by local \nlaboratory reference range, regular monitoring of absolute lymphocyte counts is \nrecommended. Additional factors that might further augment the individual PML risk should \nbe considered (see subsection on PML below). \n \n\nLymphocyte counts should be followed until recovery. Upon recovery and in the absence of \nalternative treatment options, decisions about whether or not to restart Tecfidera after treatment \ndiscontinuation should be based on clinical judgement. \n \nMagnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) \n\nBefore initiating treatment with Tecfidera, a baseline MRI should be available (usually within 3 \nmonths) as a reference. The need for further MRI scanning should be considered in accordance with \nnational and local recommendations. MRI imaging may be considered as part of increased vigilance in \npatients considered at increased risk of PML. In case of clinical suspicion of PML, MRI should be \nperformed immediately for diagnostic purposes. \n \nProgressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) \n\nPML has been reported in patients treated with Tecfidera (see section 4.8). PML is an opportunistic \ninfection caused by John-Cunningham virus (JCV), which may be fatal or result in severe disability.  \n \nPML cases have occurred with dimethyl fumarate and other medicinal products containing fumarates \nin the setting of lymphopenia (lymphocyte counts below LLN). Prolonged moderate to severe \nlymphopenia appears to increase the risk of PML with Tecfidera, however, risk cannot be excluded in \npatients with mild lymphopenia.  \nAdditional factors that might contribute to an increased risk for PML in the setting of lymphopenia \nare: \n\n- duration of Tecfidera therapy. Cases of PML have occurred after approximately1 to 5 years of \ntreatment, although the exact relationship with duration of treatment is unknown. \n \n\n- profound decreases in CD4+ and especially in CD8+ T cell counts, which are important for \nimmunological defence (see section 4.8), and \n \n\n- prior immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy (see below). \n \n\nPhysicians should evaluate their patients to determine if the symptoms are indicative of neurological \ndysfunction and, if so, whether these symptoms are typical of MS or possibly suggestive of PML.  \n \nAt the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, Tecfidera should be withheld and appropriate \ndiagnostic evaluations, including determination of JCV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by \n\n\n\n5 \n\nquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology, need to be performed. The symptoms of \nPML may be similar to an MS relapse. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress \nover days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, \ndisturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and \npersonality changes. Physicians should be particularly alert to symptoms suggestive of PML that the \npatient may not notice. Patients should also be advised to inform their partner or caregivers about their \ntreatment, since they may notice symptoms that the patient is not aware of. \n \nPML can only occur in the presence of a JCV infection. It should be considered that the influence of \nlymphopenia on the accuracy of serum anti-JCV antibody testing has not been studied in dimethyl \nfumarate treated patients. It should also be noted that a negative anti-JCV antibody test (in the \npresence of normal lymphocyte counts) does not preclude the possibility of subsequent JCV infection.  \n \nIf a patient develops PML, Tecfidera must be permanently discontinued. \n \nPrior treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulating therapies \n\nNo studies have been performed evaluating the efficacy and safety of Tecfidera when switching \npatients from other disease modifying therapies to Tecfidera. The contribution of prior \nimmunosuppressive therapy to the development of PML in dimethyl fumarate treated patients is \npossible.  \n \nPML cases have occurred in patients who had previously been treated with natalizumab, for which \nPML is an established risk. Physicians should be aware that cases of PML occurring following recent \ndiscontinuation of natalizumab may not have lymphopenia. \n\n \nIn addition, a majority of confirmed PML cases with Tecfidera occurred in patients with prior \nimmunomodulatory treatment.  \n \nWhen switching patients from another disease modifying therapy to Tecfidera, the half-life and mode \nof action of the other therapy should be considered in order to avoid an additive immune effect while \nat the same time, reducing the risk of reactivation of MS. A complete blood count is recommended \nprior to initiating Tecfidera and regularly during treatment (see Blood/laboratory tests above).  \n \nSevere renal and hepatic impairment \n \nTecfidera has not been studied in patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment and caution \nshould, therefore, be used in these patients (see section 4.2). \n \nSevere active gastrointestinal disease \n \nTecfidera has not been studied in patients with severe active gastrointestinal disease and caution \nshould, therefore, be used in these patients. \n \nFlushing \n \nIn clinical trials, 34% of Tecfidera treated patients experienced flushing. In the majority of patients \nwho experienced flushing, it was mild or moderate in severity. Data from healthy volunteer studies \nsuggest that dimethyl fumarate-associated flushing is likely to be prostaglandin mediated.  A short \ncourse of treatment with 75 mg non-enteric coated acetylsalicylic acid may be beneficial in patients \naffected by intolerable flushing (see section 4.5).  In two healthy volunteer studies, the occurrence and \nseverity of flushing over the dosing period was reduced. \n \nIn clinical trials, 3 patients out of a total of 2,560 patients treated with dimethyl fumarate experienced \nserious flushing symptoms that were probable hypersensitivity or anaphylactoid reactions. These \nevents were not life-threatening, but led to hospitalisation. Prescribers and patients should be alert to \nthis possibility in the event of severe flushing reactions (see sections 4.2, 4.5 and 4.8). \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nAnaphylactic reactions \n \nCases of anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reaction have been reported following Tecfidera administration in \nthe post-marketing setting. Symptoms may include dyspnoea, hypoxia, hypotension, angioedema, rash \nor urticaria. The mechanism of dimethyl fumarate induced anaphylaxis is unknown. Reactions \ngenerally occur after the first dose, but may also occur at any time during treatment, and may be \nserious and life threatening. Patients should be instructed to discontinue Tecfidera and seek immediate \nmedical care if they experience signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis. Treatment should not be restarted \n(see section 4.8). \n \nInfections \n \nIn phase III placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of infections (60% vs 58%) and serious \ninfections (2% vs 2%) was similar in patients treated with Tecfidera or placebo, respectively. \nHowever, due to Tecfidera immunomodulatory properties (see section 5.1), if a patient develops a \nserious infection, suspending treatment with Tecfidera should be considered and the benefits and risks \nshould be reassessed prior to re-initiation of therapy. Patients receiving Tecfidera should be instructed \nto report symptoms of infections to a physician. Patients with serious infections should not start \ntreatment with Tecfidera until the infection(s) is resolved. \n \nThere was no increased incidence of serious infections observed in patients with lymphocyte counts \n<0.8x109/L or <0.5x109/L (see Section 4.8).  If therapy is continued in the presence of moderate to \nsevere prolonged lymphopenia, the risk of an opportunistic infection, including PML, cannot be ruled \nout (see section 4.4 subsection PML).  \n \nHerpes zoster infections \n \nCases of herpes zoster have occurred with Tecfidera. The majority of cases were non-serious, \nhowever, serious cases, including disseminated herpes zoster, herpes zoster ophthalmicus, herpes \nzoster oticus, herpes zoster infection neurological, herpes zoster meningoencephalitis and herpes \nzoster meningomyelitis have been reported. These events may occur at any time during treatment. \nMonitor patients taking Tecfidera for signs and symptoms of herpes zoster especially when concurrent \nlymphocytopenia is reported.  If herpes zoster occurs, appropriate treatment for herpes zoster should \nbe administered. Consider withholding Tecfidera treatment in patients with serious infections until the \ninfection has resolved (see section 4.8). \n \nTreatment initiation \n \nTecfidera treatment should be started gradually to reduce the occurrence of flushing and \ngastrointestinal adverse reactions (see section 4.2).  \n \nFanconi syndrome \n \nCases of Fanconi syndrome have been reported for a medicinal product containing dimethyl fumarate \nin combination with other fumaric acid esters.  Early diagnosis of Fanconi syndrome and \ndiscontinuation of dimethyl fumarate treatment are important to prevent the onset of renal impairment \nand osteomalacia, as the syndrome is usually reversible. The most important signs are: proteinuria, \nglucosuria (with normal blood sugar levels), hyperaminoaciduria and phosphaturia (possibly \nconcurrent with hypophosphatemia). Progression might involve symptoms such as polyuria, \npolydipsia and proximal muscle weakness. In rare cases hypophosphataemic osteomalacia with non-\nlocalised bone pain, elevated alkaline phosphatase in serum and stress fractures may occur. \nImportantly, Fanconi syndrome can occur without elevated creatinine levels or low glomerular \nfiltration rate. In case of unclear symptoms Fanconi syndrome should be considered and appropriate \nexaminations should be performed. \n \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nTecfidera has not been studied in combination with anti-neoplastic or immunosuppressive therapies \nand caution should, therefore, be used during concomitant administration. In multiple sclerosis clinical \nstudies, the concomitant treatment of relapses with a short course of intravenous corticosteroids was \nnot associated with a clinically relevant increase of infection. \n \nConcomitant administration of non-live vaccines according to national vaccination schedules may be \nconsidered during Tecfidera therapy. In a clinical study involving a total of 71 patients with relapsing \nremitting multiple sclerosis, patients on Tecfidera 240 mg twice daily for at least 6 months (n=38) or \nnon-pegylated interferon for at least 3 months (n=33), mounted a comparable immune response \n(defined as \u22652-fold increase from pre- to post-vaccination titer) to tetanus toxoid (recall antigen) and a \nconjugated meningococcal C polysaccharide vaccine (neoantigen), while the immune response to \ndifferent serotypes of an unconjugated 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (T-cell \nindependent antigen) varied in both treatment groups. A positive immune response defined as a \n\u22654-fold increase in antibody titer to the three vaccines, was achieved by fewer subjects in both \ntreatment groups. Small numerical differences in the response to tetanus toxoid and pneumococcal \nserotype 3 polysaccharide were noted in favour of non-pegylated interferon.  \n \nNo clinical data are available on the efficacy and safety of live attenuated vaccines in patients taking \nTecfidera. Live vaccines might carry an increased risk of clinical infection and should not be given to \npatients treated with Tecfidera unless, in exceptional cases, this potential risk is considered to be \noutweighed by the risk to the individual of not vaccinating. \n \nDuring treatment with Tecfidera, simultaneous use of other fumaric acid derivatives (topical or \nsystemic) should be avoided. \n \nIn humans, dimethyl fumarate is extensively metabolised by esterases before it reaches the systemic \ncirculation and further metabolism occurs through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, with no involvement of \nthe cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. Potential drug interaction risks were not identified from in vitro \nCYP-inhibition and induction studies, a p-glycoprotein study, or studies of the protein binding of \ndimethyl fumarate and monomethyl fumarate (a primary metabolite of dimethyl fumarate). \n  \nCommonly used medicinal products in patients with multiple sclerosis, intramuscular interferon \nbeta-1a and glatiramer acetate, were clinically tested for potential interactions with dimethyl fumarate \nand did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of dimethyl fumarate.  \n \nEvidence from healthy volunteer studies suggests that Tecfidera-associated flushing is likely to be \nprostaglandin mediated. In two healthy volunteer studies, the administration of 325 mg (or equivalent) \nnon-enteric coated acetylsalicylic acid, 30 minutes prior to Tecfidera, dosing over 4 days and over 4 \nweeks, respectively, did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of Tecfidera. Potential risks associated \nwith acetylsalicylic acid therapy should be considered prior to co-administration with Tecfidera in \npatients with Relapsing Remitting MS. Long term (> 4 weeks) continuous use of acetylsalicylic acid \nhas not been studied (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  \n \nConcurrent therapy with nephrotoxic medicinal products (such as aminoglycosides, diuretics, non-\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or lithium) may increase the potential of renal adverse reactions \n(e.g. proteinuria see section 4.8) in patients taking Tecfidera (see section 4.4 Blood/laboratory tests). \n \nConsumption of moderate amounts of alcohol did not alter exposure to dimethyl fumarate and was not \nassociated with an increase in adverse reactions. Consumption of large quantities of strong alcoholic \ndrinks (more than 30% alcohol by volume) should be avoided within an hour of taking Tecfidera, as \nalcohol may lead to increased frequency of gastrointestinal adverse reactions. \n \nIn vitro CYP induction studies did not demonstrate an interaction between Tecfidera and oral \ncontraceptives. In an in vivo study, co-administration of Tecfidera with a combined oral contraceptive \n(norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol) did not elicit any relevant change in oral contraceptive exposure. \n\n\n\n8 \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed with oral contraceptives containing other progestogens, \nhowever an effect of Tecfidera on their exposure is not expected. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of dimethyl fumarate in pregnant women. Animal \nstudies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Tecfidera is not recommended during \npregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using appropriate contraception (see \nsection 4.5). Tecfidera should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed and if the potential \nbenefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether dimethyl fumarate or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding \nor to discontinue Tecfidera therapy. The benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman should be taken into account. \n  \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effects of dimethyl fumarate on human fertility. Data from preclinical studies \ndo not suggest that dimethyl fumarate would be associated with an increased risk of reduced fertility \n(see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTecfidera has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. No studies on the \nability to drive and use machines have been conducted but no effects potentially influencing this \nability were found to be related to dimethyl fumarate in clinical studies. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reactions (incidence \u226510%) for patients treated with dimethyl fumarate \nwere flushing and gastrointestinal events (i.e. diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, abdominal pain \nupper). Flushing and gastrointestinal events tend to begin early in the course of treatment (primarily \nduring the first month) and in patients who experience flushing and gastrointestinal events, these \nevents may continue to occur intermittently throughout treatment with Tecfidera. The most commonly \nreported adverse reactions leading to discontinuation (incidence >1%) in patients treated with \nTecfidera were flushing (3%) and gastrointestinal events (4%). \nIn placebo-controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies, a total of 2,468 patients have received \nTecfidera and been followed for periods up to 4 years with an overall exposure equivalent to \n3,588 person-years. Approximately 1,056 patients have received more than 2 years of treatment with \nTecfidera. The experience in uncontrolled clinical trials is consistent with the experience in the \nplacebo-controlled clinical trials. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions, which were more frequently reported in Tecfidera versus placebo-treated patients, \nare presented in the table below. These data were derived from 2 pivotal Phase 3 placebo-controlled, \n\n\n\n9 \n\ndouble-blind clinical trials with a total of 1,529 patients treated with Tecfidera and for up to 24 months \nwith an overall exposure of 2,371 person-years (see section 5.1). The frequencies described in the \ntable below are based on 769 patients treated with Tecfidera 240 mg twice a day and 771 patients \ntreated with placebo \n \nThe adverse reactions are presented as MedDRA preferred terms under the MedDRA System Organ \nClass. The incidence of the adverse reactions below are expressed according to the following \ncategories: \n- Very common (\u22651/10) \n- Common (\u22651/100 to <1/10) \n- Uncommon (\u22651/1, 000 to <1/100) \n- Rare (\u22651/10, 000 to <1/1,000) \n- Very rare (<1/10,000) \n- Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n \n\nMedDRA System Organ Class Adverse reaction Frequency category \nInfections and infestations Gastroenteritis Common \n\nProgressive multifocal \nleukoencephalopathy (PML)  Not known  \n\nHerpes zoster1 Not known \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nLymphopenia Common \nLeucopenia Common \nThrombocytopenia Uncommon \n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity Uncommon \nAnaphylaxis1 Not known \nDyspnoea1 Not known \nHypoxia1 Not known \nHypotension1 Not known \nAngioedema1 Not known \n\nNervous system disorders Burning sensation Common \nVascular disorders Flushing  Very common \n\nHot flush Common \nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea  Very common \n\nNausea  Very common \nAbdominal pain upper  Very common \nAbdominal pain Very common \nVomiting Common \nDyspepsia Common \nGastritis Common \nGastrointestinal disorder Common \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Aspartate aminotransferase increased Common \nAlanine aminotransferase increased Common \nDrug-induced liver injury1 Not known \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nPruritus Common \nRash Common \nErythema Common \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Proteinuria Common \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions Feeling hot Common \n\nInvestigations Ketones measured in urine Very common \nAlbumin urine present  Common \nWhite blood cell count decreased  Common \n\n \n\n1 Adverse reactions derived only during post marketing experience \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nFlushing  \n \nIn the placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of flushing (34% versus 4%) and hot flush \n(7% versus 2%) was increased in patients treated with Tecfidera compared to placebo, respectively. \nFlushing is usually described as flushing or hot flush, but can include other events (e.g. warmth, \nredness, itching, and burning sensation). Flushing events tend to begin early in the course of treatment \n(primarily during the first month) and in patients who experience flushing, these events may continue \nto occur intermittently throughout treatment with Tecfidera. In patients with flushing, the majority had \nflushing events that were mild or moderate in severity. Overall, 3% of patients treated with Tecfidera \ndiscontinued due to flushing. The incidence of serious flushing, which may be characterised by \ngeneralised erythema, rash and/or pruritus, was seen in less than 1% of patients treated with Tecfidera \n(see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5).  \n \nGastrointestinal \n \nThe incidence of gastrointestinal events (e.g. diarrhoea [14% versus 10%], nausea [12% versus 9%], \nupper abdominal pain [10% versus 6%], abdominal pain [9% versus 4%], vomiting [8% versus 5%] \nand dyspepsia [5% versus 3%]) was increased in patients treated with Tecfidera compared to placebo, \nrespectively. Gastrointestinal events tend to begin early in the course of treatment (primarily during \nthe first month) and in patients who experience gastrointestinal events, these events may continue to \noccur intermittently throughout treatment with Tecfidera. In the majority of patients who experienced \ngastrointestinal events, it was mild or moderate in severity. Four per cent (4%) of patients treated with \nTecfidera discontinued due to gastrointestinal events. The incidence of serious gastrointestinal events, \nincluding gastroenteritis and gastritis, was seen in 1% of patients treated with Tecfidera (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nHepatic function  \n \nBased on data from placebo-controlled studies, the majority of patients with elevations had hepatic \ntransaminases that were <3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). The increased incidence of \nelevations of hepatic transaminases in patients treated with Tecfidera relative to placebo was primarily \nseen during the first 6 months of treatment. Elevations of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate \naminotransferase \u22653 times ULN, respectively, were seen in 5% and 2% of patients treated with \nplacebo and 6% and 2% of patients treated with Tecfidera. Discontinuations due to elevated hepatic \ntransaminases were <1% and similar in patients treated with Tecfidera or placebo. Elevations in \ntransaminases \u22653 times ULN with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin >2 times ULN, were not \nobserved in placebo-controlled studies. \n \nIncrease of liver enzymes and cases of drug-induced liver injury (elevations in transaminases \u22653 times \nULN with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin >2 times ULN), have been reported in post \nmarketing experience following Tecfidera administration, which resolved upon treatment \ndiscontinuation.  \n \nLymphopenia  \n \nIn the placebo-controlled studies most patients (>98%) had normal lymphocyte values prior to \ninitiating treatment. Upon treatment with Tecfidera, mean lymphocyte counts decreased over the first \nyear with a subsequent plateau. On average, lymphocyte counts decreased by approximately 30% of \nbaseline value. Mean and median lymphocyte counts remained within normal limits.  Lymphocyte \ncounts <0.5x109/l were observed in <1% of patients treated with placebo and 6% of patients treated \nwith Tecfidera.  A lymphocyte count <0.2x109/l was observed in 1 patient treated with Tecfidera and \nin no patients treated with placebo. \n \nIn clinical studies (both controlled and uncontrolled), 41% of patients treated with Tecfidera had \nlymphopenia (defined in these studies as <0.91x109/L). Mild lymphopenia (counts \u22650.8x109/L and \n\n\n\n11 \n\n<0.91 x109/L) was observed in 28% of patients; moderate lymphopenia (counts \u22650.5x109/L and \n<0.8x109/L) persisting for at least six months was observed in 10% of patients; severe lymphopenia \n(counts <0.5x109/L) persisting for at least six months was observed in 2% of patients. In the group \nwith severe lymphopenia, the majority of lymphocyte counts remained <0.5x109/L with continued \ntherapy.  \n \n \nIn addition, in an uncontrolled, prospective, post-marketing study, at week 48 of treatment with \nTecfidera (n=185) CD4+ T cells were moderately (counts \u22650.2x109/L to <0.4x109/L) or severely \n(<0.2x109/L) decreased in up to 37 % or 6 % of patients, respectively, while CD8+ T cells were more \nfrequently reduced with up to 59 % of patients at counts <0.2x109/L and 25 % of patients at counts \n<0.1x109/L.Infections, including PML and opportunistic infections \nCases of infections with John Cunningham virus (JCV) causing Progressive Multifocal \nLeukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported with Tecfidera (see section 4.4). PML may be fatal \nor result in severe disability. In one of the clinical trials, one patient taking Tecfidera developed PML \nin the setting of prolonged severe lymphopenia (lymphocyte counts predominantly <0.5x109/L for 3.5 \nyears), with a fatal outcome. In the post-marketing setting, PML has also occurred in the presence of \nmoderate and mild lymphopenia (>0.5x109/L to <LLN, as defined by local laboratory reference \nrange).  \n \nIn several PML cases with determination of T cell subsets at the time of diagnosis of PML, CD8+ \nT cell counts were found to be decreased to <0.1x109/L, whereas reductions in CD4+ T cells counts \nwere variable (ranging from <0.05 to 0.5x109/L) and correlated more with the overall severity of \nlymphopenia (<0.5 x109/L to <LLN). Consequently, the CD4+/CD8+ ratio was increased in these \npatients. \n \nProlonged moderate to severe lymphopenia appears to increase the risk of PML with Tecfidera, \nhowever, PML also occurred in patients with mild lymphopenia. Additionally, the majority of PML \ncases in the post-marketing setting have occurred in patients >50 years. \n \nHerpes zoster infections have been reported with Tecfidera use. In an ongoing long-term extension \nstudy, in which 1736 MS patients are treated with Tecfidera, approximately 5% experienced one or \nmore events of herpes zoster, the majority of which were mild to moderate in severity. Most subjects, \nincluding those who experienced a serious herpes zoster infection, had lymphocyte counts above the \nlower limit of normal. In a majority of subjects with concurrent lymphocyte counts below the LLN, \nlymphopenia was rated moderate or severe.  In the post-marketing setting, most cases of herpes zoster \ninfection were non-serious and resolved with treatment.  Limited data is available on ALC in patients \nwith herpes zoster infection in the post-marketing setting. However, when reported, most patients \nexperienced moderate (<0.8x109/L to 0.5x109/L) or severe (<0.5x109/L to 0.2x109/L) lymphopenia \n(see section 4.4).  \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \n \nIn the placebo-controlled studies, measurement of urinary ketones (1+ or greater) was higher in \npatients treated with Tecfidera (45%) compared to placebo (10%). No untoward clinical consequences \nwere observed in clinical trials. \n \nLevels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D decreased in Tecfidera treated patients relative to placebo (median \npercentage decrease from baseline at 2 years of 25% versus 15%, respectively) and levels of \nparathyroid hormone (PTH) increased in Tecfidera treated patients relative to placebo (median \npercentage increase from baseline at 2 years of 29% versus 15%, respectively). Mean values for both \nparameters remained within normal range. \n \nA transient increase in mean eosinophil counts was seen during the first 2 months of therapy.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nThe safety of Tecfidera in paediatric patients with multiple sclerosis below the age of 18 has not yet \nbeen established. In a small 24-week open-label uncontrolled study in paediatric patients with RRMS \naged 13 to 17 years (120 mg twice a day for 7 days followed by 240 mg twice a day for the remainder \nof treatment; safety population, n=22), followed by a 96 week extension study (240mg twice per day ; \nsafety population n=20), the safety profile appeared similar to that observed in adult patients.   \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nCases of overdose with Tecfidera have been reported. The symptoms described in these cases were \nconsistent with the known adverse reaction profile of Tecfidera. There are no known therapeutic \ninterventions to enhance elimination of Tecfidera nor is there a known antidote. In the event of \noverdose, it is recommended that symptomatic supportive treatment be initiated as clinically indicated. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents, ATC code: L04AX07 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe mechanism by which dimethyl fumarate exerts therapeutic effects in multiple sclerosis is not fully \nunderstood. Preclinical studies indicate that dimethyl fumarate pharmacodynamic responses appear to \nbe primarily mediated through activation of the Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) \ntranscriptional pathway. Dimethyl fumarate has been shown to up regulate Nrf2-dependent antioxidant \ngenes in patients (e.g. NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1; [NQO1]).  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nEffects on the immune system \nIn preclinical and clinical studies, dimethyl fumarate demonstrated anti-inflammatory and \nimmunomodulatory properties. Dimethyl fumarate and monomethyl fumarate, the primary metabolite \nof dimethyl fumarate, significantly reduced immune cell activation and subsequent release of pro-\ninflammatory cytokines in response to inflammatory stimuli in preclinical models. In clinical studies \nwith psoriasis patients, dimethyl fumarate affected lymphocyte phenotypes through a down-regulation \nof pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles (TH1, TH17), and biased towards anti-inflammatory production \n(TH2). Dimethyl fumarate demonstrated therapeutic activity in multiple models of inflammatory and \nneuroinflammatory injury. In Phase 3 studies in MS patients, upon treatment with Tecfidera mean \nlymphocyte counts decreased on average by approximately 30% of their baseline value over the first \nyear with a subsequent plateau.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nTwo, 2-year, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled studies [Study 1 (DEFINE) with \n1234 subjects and Study 2 (CONFIRM) with 1417 subjects] of subjects with relapsing-remitting \nmultiple sclerosis (RRMS) were performed. Subjects with progressive forms of MS were not included \nin these studies. Efficacy (see table below) and safety were demonstrated in subjects with Expanded \nDisability Status Scale (EDSS) scores ranging from 0 to 5 inclusive, who had experienced at least \n1 relapse during the year prior to randomisation, or, in the 6 weeks before randomisation had a brain \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13 \n\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) demonstrating at least one gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesion. \nStudy 2 contained a rater-blinded (i.e. study physician/ investigator assessing the response to study \ntreatment was blinded) reference comparator of glatiramer acetate.  \n \nIn Study 1, patients had the following median baseline characteristics: age 39 years, disease duration \n7.0 years, EDSS score 2.0. In addition, 16% of patients had an EDSS score >3.5, 28% had \u22652 relapses \nin the prior year and 42% had previously received other approved MS treatments. In the MRI cohort \n36% of patients entering the study had Gd+ lesions at baseline (mean number of Gd+ lesions 1.4).  \n \nIn Study 2, patients had the following median baseline characteristics: age 37 years, disease \nduration 6.0 years, EDSS score 2.5. In addition, 17% of patients had an EDSS score >3.5, 32% had \n\u22652 relapses in the prior year and 30% had previously received other approved MS treatments. In the \nMRI cohort 45% of patients entering the study had Gd+ lesions at baseline (mean number of Gd+ \nlesions 2.4).  \n \nCompared to placebo, subjects treated with Tecfidera had a clinically meaningful and statistically \nsignificant reduction on: the primary endpoint in Study 1, proportion of subjects relapsed at 2 years; \nand the primary endpoint in Study 2, annualised relapse rate at 2 years.  \n \nThe annualised relapse rate for glatiramer acetate and placebo was 0.286 and 0.401 respectively in \nStudy 2, corresponding to a reduction of 29% (p=0.013), which is consistent with approved \nprescribing information. \n \n\n DEFINE CONFIRM \n Placebo Tecfidera \n\n240 mg  \ntwice a day \n\nPlacebo Tecfidera \n240 mg \ntwice a day \n\nGlatiramer \nacetate \n\nClinical Endpointsa      \nNo. subjects 408 410 363 359 350 \nAnnualised relapse rate 0.364 0.172*** 0.401 0.224*** 0.286* \n\nRate ratio  \n(95% CI) \n\n 0.47  \n(0.37, 0.61) \n\n 0.56 \n(0.42, 0.74) \n\n0.71 \n(0.55, 0.93) \n\nProportion relapsed 0.461 0.270*** 0.410 0.291** 0.321** \nHazard ratio \n(95% CI) \n\n 0.51  \n(0.40, 0.66) \n\n 0.66 \n(0.51, 0.86) \n\n0.71 \n(0.55, 0.92) \n\nProportion with 12-week \nconfirmed disability \nprogression \n\n0.271 0.164** 0.169 0.128# 0.156# \n\nHazard ratio  \n(95% CI) \n\n 0.62 \n(0.44, 0.87) \n\n 0.79  \n(0.52, 1.19) \n\n0.93 \n(0.63, 1.37) \n\nProportion with 24 week \nconfirmed disability \nprogression \n\n0.169 0.128# 0.125 0.078# 0.108# \n\nHazard ratio  \n(95% CI) \n\n 0.77  \n(0.52, 1.14) \n\n 0.62 \n(0.37, 1.03) \n\n0.87 \n(0.55, 1.38) \n\nMRI Endpointsb      \nNo. subjects 165 152 144 147 161 \nMean (median) number of \nnew or newly enlarging \nT2 lesions over 2 years \n\n16.5 \n(7.0) \n\n3.2 \n(1.0)*** \n\n19.9 \n(11.0) \n\n5.7 \n(2.0)*** \n\n9.6 \n(3.0)*** \n\nLesion mean ratio  \n(95% CI) \n\n 0.15 \n(0.10, 0.23) \n\n 0.29 \n(0.21, 0.41) \n\n0.46 \n(0.33, 0.63) \n\nMean (median) number of \nGd lesions at 2 years  \n\n1.8 \n(0) \n\n0.1 \n(0)***  \n\n2.0 \n(0.0) \n\n0.5 \n(0.0)***  \n\n0.7 \n(0.0)**  \n\nOdds ratio  \n(95% CI) \n\n 0.10 \n(0.05, 0.22) \n\n 0.26 \n(0.15, 0.46) \n\n0.39 \n(0.24, 0.65) \n\n\n\n14 \n\n DEFINE CONFIRM \n Placebo Tecfidera \n\n240 mg  \ntwice a day \n\nPlacebo Tecfidera \n240 mg \ntwice a day \n\nGlatiramer \nacetate \n\nMean (median) number of \nnew T1 hypointense \nlesions over 2 years \n\n5.7 \n(2.0) \n\n2.0 \n(1.0)*** \n\n8.1 \n(4.0) \n\n3.8 \n(1.0)*** \n\n4.5 \n(2.0)** \n\nLesion mean ratio  \n(95% CI) \n\n 0.28  \n(0.20, 0.39) \n\n 0.43 \n(0.30, 0.61) \n\n0.59 \n(0.42, 0.82) \n\naAll analyses of clinical endpoints were intent-to-treat; bMRI analysis used MRI cohort \n*P-value < 0.05; **P-value < 0.01; ***P-value < 0.0001; #not statistically significant \n \nEfficacy in patients with high disease activity:  \nConsistent treatment effect on relapses in a subgroup of patients with high disease activity was \nobserved, whilst the effect on time to 3-month sustained disability progression was not clearly \nestablished. Due to the design of the studies, high disease activity was defined as follows: \n- Patients with 2 or more relapses in one year, and with one or more Gd-enhancing lesions on \n\nbrain MRI (n=42 in DEFINE; n=51 in CONFIRM) or,  \n- Patients who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course (at least one year of treatment) \n\nof beta-interferon, having had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and at \nleast 9 T2-hyperintense lesions in cranial MRI or at least 1 Gd-enhancing lesion, or patients \nhaving an unchanged or increased relapse rate in the prior year as compared to the previous 2 \nyears (n=177 in DEFINE; n=141 in CONFIRM). \n\n \nPaediatric population \n \nTecfidera was evaluated in a prospective open-label, uncontrolled study in 22 paediatric patients with \nRRMS aged 13 to 17 years (4 patients aged \u226414 years). Subjects received Tecfidera 120 mg twice a \nday for 7 days followed by 240 mg twice a day for 24 weeks. The median number of new or newly \nenlarging T2 hyperintense lesions changed from 2 in the 8 week pre-treatment evaluation period to 0 \nin the final 8 weeks of the treatment period (median change -2, n=16).  Patients subsequently entered \nan extension study for a further 96 weeks. Among the 10 patients with MRI data between weeks 64 \nand week 72 of the extension study, the median number of subjects with new or newly enlarging T2 \nhyperintense lesions was 0 (range 0,2).  Over the full treatment period (120-week), ARR was 0.2 \nrepresenting an 84.5% relative reduction in relapses (n=20; 95% CI [66.8, 92.8], p<0.0001), when \ncompared to the year prior to treatment initiation.  These data should be considered cautiously \nregarding limitations of the study design (no control arm, pre- versus post-dose comparison) (see \nsection 4.2). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nOrally administered dimethyl fumarate undergoes rapid presystemic hydrolysis by esterases and is \nconverted to its primary metabolite, monomethyl fumarate, which is also active. Dimethyl fumarate is \nnot quantifiable in plasma following oral administration of Tecfidera. Therefore, all pharmacokinetic \nanalyses related to dimethyl fumarate were performed with plasma monomethyl fumarate \nconcentrations. Pharmacokinetic data were obtained in subjects with multiple sclerosis and healthy \nvolunteers. \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe Tmax of monomethyl fumarate is 2 to 2.5 hours. As Tecfidera gastro-resistant hard capsules \ncontain microtablets, which are protected by an enteric coating, absorption does not commence until \nthey leave the stomach (generally less than 1 hour). Following 240 mg twice a day administered with \nfood, the median peak (Cmax) was 1.72 mg/l and overall area under the curve (AUC) exposure was \n8.02 h.mg/l in subjects with multiple sclerosis. Overall, Cmax and AUC increased approximately dose- \nproportionally in the dose range studied (120 mg to 360 mg). In subjects with multiple sclerosis, two \n240 mg doses were administered 4 hours apart as part of a three times a day dosing regimen. This \n\n\n\n15 \n\nresulted in a minimal accumulation of exposure yielding an increase in the median Cmax of 12% \ncompared to the twice daily dosing (1.72 mg/l for twice daily compared to 1.93 mg/l for three times \ndaily) with no safety implications. \n \nFood does not have a clinically significant effect on exposure of dimethyl fumarate. However, \nTecfidera should be taken with food due to improved tolerability with respect to flushing or \ngastrointestinal adverse events (see section 4.2). \n \nDistribution \n \nThe apparent volume of distribution following oral administration of 240 mg dimethyl fumarate varies \nbetween 60 L and 90 L. Human plasma protein binding of monomethyl fumarate generally ranges \nbetween 27% and 40%. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIn humans, dimethyl fumarate is extensively metabolised with less than 0.1% of the dose excreted as \nunchanged dimethyl fumarate in urine. It is initially metabolised by esterases, which are ubiquitous in \nthe gastrointestinal tract, blood and tissues, before it reaches the systemic circulation. Further \nmetabolism occurs through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, with no involvement of the cytochrome P450 \n(CYP) system. A single 240 mg 14C-dimethyl fumarate dose study identified glucose as the \npredominant metabolite in human plasma. Other circulating metabolites included fumaric acid, citric \nacid and monomethyl fumarate. The downstream metabolism of fumaric acid occurs through the \ntricarboxylic acid cycle, with exhalation of CO2 serving as a primary route of elimination. \n \nElimination \n \nExhalation of CO2 is the primary route of dimethyl fumarate elimination accounting for 60% of the \ndose. Renal and faecal elimination are secondary routes of elimination, accounting for 15.5% and \n0.9% of the dose respectively. \n \nThe terminal half-life of monomethyl fumarate is short (approximately 1 hour) and no circulating \nmonomethyl fumarate is present at 24 hours in the majority of individuals. Accumulation of parent \ndrug or monomethyl fumarate does not occur with multiple doses of dimethyl fumarate at the \ntherapeutic regimen. \n \nLinearity \n \nDimethyl fumarate exposure increases in an approximately dose proportional manner with single and \nmultiple doses in the 120 mg to 360 mg dose range studied. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \n \nBased on the results of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), body weight is the main covariate of \nexposure (by Cmax and AUC) in RRMS subjects, but did not affect safety and efficacy measures \nevaluated in the clinical studies.  \n \nGender and age did not have a clinically significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of dimethyl \nfumarate. The pharmacokinetics in patients aged 65 and over has not been studied. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetic profile of 240 mg dimethyl fumarate twice a day was evaluated in a small, open-\nlabel, uncontrolled study in patients with RRMS aged 13 to 17 years (n=21). The pharmacokinetics of \nTecfidera in these adolescent patients was consistent with that previously observed in adult patients \n(Cmax: 2.00\u00b11.29 mg/l; AUC0-12hr: 3.62\u00b11.16 h.mg/l, which corresponds to an overall daily AUC of \n7.24 h.mg/l). \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nRenal impairment \nSince the renal pathway is a secondary route of elimination for dimethyl fumarate accounting for less \nthan 16% of the dose administered, evaluation of pharmacokinetics in individuals with renal \nimpairment was not conducted. \n  \nHepatic impairment \nAs dimethyl fumarate and monomethyl fumarate are metabolised by esterases, without the \ninvolvement of the CYP450 system, evaluation of pharmacokinetics in individuals with hepatic \nimpairment was not conducted. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe adverse reactions described in the Toxicology and Reproduction toxicity sections below were not \nobserved in clinical studies, but were seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure \nlevels. \n \nMutagenesis  \n \nDimethyl fumarate and mono-methylfumarate were negative in a battery of in vitro assays (Ames, \nchromosomal aberration in mammalian cells). Dimethyl fumarate was negative in the in vivo \nmicronucleus assay in the rat. \n \nCarcinogenesis \n \nCarcinogenicity studies of dimethyl fumarate were conducted for up to 2 years in mice and rats. \nDimethyl fumarate was administered orally at doses of 25, 75, 200 and 400 mg/kg/day in mice, and at \ndoses of 25, 50, 100, and 150 mg/kg/day in rats. In mice, the incidence of renal tubular carcinoma was \nincreased at 75 mg/kg/day, at equivalent exposure (AUC) to the recommended human dose. In rats, \nthe incidence of renal tubular carcinoma was increased at 100 mg/kg/day, approximately 2 times \nhigher exposure than the recommended human dose. The relevance of these findings to human risk is \nunknown. \n \nThe incidence of squamous cell papilloma and carcinoma in the nonglandular stomach (forestomach) \nwas increased at equivalent exposure to the recommended human dose in mice and below exposure to \nthe recommended human dose in rats (based on AUC). The forestomach in rodents does not have a \nhuman counterpart.  \n \nToxicology \n \nNonclinical studies in rodent, rabbits, and monkeys were conducted with a dimethyl fumarate \nsuspension (dimethyl fumarate in 0.8% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose) administered by oral gavage. \nThe chronic dog study was conducted with oral administration of the dimethyl fumarate capsule.  \n \nKidney changes were observed after repeated oral administration of dimethyl fumarate in mice, rats, \ndogs, and monkeys. Renal tubule epithelial regeneration, suggestive of injury, was observed in all \nspecies. Renal tubular hyperplasia was observed in rats with life time dosing (2-year study). In dogs \nthat received daily oral doses of dimethyl fumarate for 11 months, the margin calculated for cortical \natrophy was observed at 3 times the recommended dose based on AUC. In monkeys that received \ndaily oral doses of dimethyl fumarate for 12 months, single cell necrosis was observed at 2 times the \nrecommended dose based on AUC. Interstitial fibrosis and cortical atrophy were observed at 6 times \nthe recommended dose based on AUC. The relevance of these findings to humans is not known.  \n \nIn the testes, degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium was seen in rats and dogs. The findings were \nobserved at approximately the recommended dose in rats and 3 times the recommended dose in dogs \n(AUC basis). The relevance of these findings to humans is not known. \n \nFindings in the forestomach of mice and rats consisted of squamous epithelial hyperplasia and \n\n\n\n17 \n\nhyperkeratosis; inflammation; and squamous cell papilloma and carcinoma in studies of 3 months or \nlonger in duration. The forestomach of mice and rats does not have a human counterpart. \n \nReproduction toxicity \n \nOral administration of dimethyl fumarate to male rats at 75, 250, and 375 mg/kg/day prior to and \nduring mating had no effects on male fertility up to the highest dose tested (at least 2 times the \nrecommended dose on an AUC basis). Oral administration of dimethyl fumarate to female rats at \n25, 100, and 250 mg/kg/day prior to and during mating, and continuing to Day 7 of gestation, induced \nreduction in the number of estrous stages per 14 days and increased the number of animals with \nprolonged diestrus at the highest dose tested (11 times the recommended dose on an AUC basis). \nHowever, these changes did not affect fertility or the number of viable fetuses produced. \n \nDimethyl fumarate has been shown to cross the placental membrane into fetal blood in rats and \nrabbits, with ratios of fetal to maternal plasma concentrations of 0.48 to 0.64 and 0.1 respectively. No \nmalformations were observed at any dose of dimethyl fumarate in rats or rabbits. Administration of \ndimethyl fumarate at oral doses of 25, 100, and 250 mg/kg/day to pregnant rats during the period of \norganogenesis resulted in maternal adverse effects at 4 times the recommended dose on an AUC basis, \nand low fetal weight and delayed ossification (metatarsals and hindlimb phalanges) at 11 times the \nrecommended dose on an AUC basis. The lower fetal weight and delayed ossification were considered \nsecondary to maternal toxicity (reduced body weight and food consumption).  \n \nOral administration of dimethyl fumarate at 25, 75, and 150 mg/kg/day to pregnant rabbits during \norganogenesis had no effect on embryo-fetal development and resulted in reduced maternal body \nweight at 7 times the recommended dose and increased abortion at 16 times the recommended dose, \non an AUC basis. \n \nOral administration of dimethyl fumarate at 25, 100, and 250 mg/kg/day to rats during pregnancy and \nlactation resulted in lower body weights in the F1 offspring, and delays in sexual maturation in F1 \nmales at 11 times the recommended dose on an AUC basis. There were no effects on fertility in the F1 \noffspring. The lower offspring body weight was considered secondary to maternal toxicity. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n \n  \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n\n \nTecfidera 120 mg gastro-resistant hard capsules \nTecfidera 240 mg gastro-resistant hard capsules \n\ndimethyl fumarate \n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Tecfidera is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you take Tecfidera  \n3. How to take Tecfidera \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Tecfidera  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Tecfidera is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Tecfidera is \n \nTecfidera is a medicine that contains the active substance dimethyl fumarate. \n \nWhat Tecfidera is used for \n \nTecfidera is used to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) in adult patients.  \nMS is a long-term condition that affects the central nervous system (CNS), including the brain and the \nspinal cord. Relapsing-remitting MS is characterised by repeated attacks (relapses) of nervous system \nsymptoms. Symptoms vary from patient to patient, but typically include walking difficulties, feeling \noff balance and visual difficulties (e.g. blurred or double vision). These symptoms may disappear \ncompletely when the relapse is over, but some problems may remain. \n \nHow Tecfidera works \n \nTecfidera seems to work by stopping the body\u2019s defence system from damaging your brain and spinal \ncord. This may also help to delay future worsening of your MS.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Tecfidera \n \nDo not take Tecfidera \n \n- if you are allergic to dimethyl fumarate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \n\nin section 6). \n- If you are suspected to suffer from a rare brain infection called progressive multifocal \n\nleukoencephalopathy (PML) or if PML has been confirmed. \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nTecfidera may affect your white blood cell counts, your kidneys and liver. Before you start \nTecfidera, your doctor will do a blood test to count the number of your white blood cells and will \ncheck that your kidneys and liver are working properly. Your doctor will test these periodically during \ntreatment. If your number of white blood cells decreases during treatment, your doctor may consider \nadditional analytic measures or discontinue your treatment. \n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Tecfidera if you have: \n- severe kidney disease \n- severe liver disease \n- a disease of the stomach or bowel \n- a serious infection (such as pneumonia) \n \nHerpes zoster (shingles) may occur with Tecfidera treatment.  In some cases, serious complications \nhave occurred. You should inform your doctor immediately if you suspect you have any symptoms \nof shingles. \n \nIf you believe your MS is getting worse (e.g. weakness or visual changes) or if you notice any new \nsymptoms, talk to your doctor straight away because these may be the symptoms of a rare brain \ninfection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a serious condition that \nmay lead to severe disability or death. \n \nA rare but serious kidney disorder (Fanconi Syndrome) has been reported for a medicine containing \ndimethyl fumarate, in combination with other fumaric acid esters, used to treat psoriasis (a skin \ndisease). If you notice you are passing more urine, are more thirsty and drinking more than normal, \nyour muscles seem weaker, you break a bone, or just have aches and pains, talk to your doctor as soon \nas possible so that this can be investigated further. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nTecfidera is not recommended for use in children and adolescents because there is limited experience \nin the use of Tecfidera in this population. \n \nOther medicines and Tecfidera \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any medicines, in \nparticular:  \n- medicines that contain fumaric acid esters (fumarates) used to treat psoriasis \n- medicines that affect the body\u2019s immune system including other medicines used to treat \n\nMS, such as fingolimod, natalizumab, teriflunomide, alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab or cladribine, \nor some commonly used cancer treatments (rituximab or mitoxantrone). \n\n- medicines that affect the kidneys including some antibiotics (used to treat infections), \u201cwater \ntablets\u201d (diuretics), certain types of painkillers (such as ibuprofen and other similar anti-\ninflammatories and medicines purchased without a doctor\u2019s prescription) and medicines that \ncontain lithium  \n\n- Taking Tecfidera with certain types of vaccines (live vaccines) may cause you to get an \ninfection and should, therefore, be avoided. Your doctor will advise whether other types of \nvaccines (non-live vaccines) should be given.  \n\n \nTecfidera with alcohol \n \nConsumption of more than a small quantity (more than 50 ml) of strong alcoholic drinks (more than \n30% alcohol by volume, e.g. spirits) should be avoided within an hour of taking Tecfidera, as alcohol \ncan interact with this medicine. This could cause inflammation of the stomach (gastritis), especially in \npeople already prone to gastritis. \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nPregnancy \n \nDo not use Tecfidera if you are pregnant unless you have discussed this with your doctor. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether the active substance of Tecfidera passes into breast milk. Tecfidera should not \nbe used during breast-feeding. Your doctor will help you decide whether you should stop breast-\nfeeding, or stop using Tecfidera. This involves balancing the benefit of breast-feeding for your child, \nand the benefit of therapy for you. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nThe effect of Tecfidera on the ability to drive or use machines is not known.  Tecfidera is not expected \nto affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \n \n3. How to take Tecfidera \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \nStarting dose \n \n120 mg twice a day. \nTake this starting dose for the first 7 days, then take the regular dose.  \n \nRegular dose \n \n240 mg twice a day. \n \nTecfidera is for oral use \n \nSwallow each capsule whole, with some water. Do not divide, crush, dissolve, suck or chew the \ncapsule as this may increase some side effects. \n \nTake Tecfidera with food \u2013 it may help to reduce some of the very common side effects (listed in \nsection 4). \n \nIf you take more Tecfidera than you should \n \nIf you have taken too many capsules, talk to your doctor straight away. You may experience side \neffects similar to those described below in section 4. \n \nIf you forget to take Tecfidera \n \nIf you forget or miss a dose, do not take a double dose.  \n \nYou may take the missed dose if you leave at least 4 hours between the doses. Otherwise wait until \nyour next planned dose.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious effects \n \nTecfidera may lower lymphocyte counts (a type of white blood cell). Having a low white blood cell \ncount can increase your risk of infection, including the risk of a rare brain infection called progressive \nmultifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML may lead to severe disability or death. PML has \noccurred after 1 to 5 years of treatment and so your physician should continue to monitor your white \nblood cells throughout your treatment, and you should remain observant of any potential symptoms of \nPML as described below. The risk of PML may be higher if you have previously taken a medicine \nimpairing the functionality of your body\u2019s immune system. \n \nThe symptoms of PML may be similar to an MS relapse. Symptoms may include new or worsening \nweakness on one side of the body; clumsiness; changes in vision, thinking, or memory; or confusion or \npersonality changes, or speech and communication difficulties lasting for more than several days. \nTherefore, if you believe your MS is getting worse or if you notice any new symptoms while you are \non Tecfidera treatment, it is very important that you speak to your doctor as soon as possible. Also \nspeak with your partner or caregivers and inform them about your treatment. Symptoms might arise \nthat you might not become aware of by yourself. \n \n\uf0e0 Call your doctor straight away if you experience any of these symptoms  \n \nSevere Allergic reactions \n \nThe frequency of severe allergic reactions cannot be estimated from the available data (not known).  \n \nReddening of the face or body (flushing) is a very common side effect. However, should flushing be \naccompanied by a red rash or hives and you get any of these symptoms: \n \n- swelling of the face, lips, mouth or tongue (angioedema) \n- wheezing, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath (dyspnoea, hypoxia) \n- dizziness or loss of consciousness (hypotension) \n \nthen this may represent a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) \n \n\uf0e0 Stop taking Tecfidera and call a doctor straight away   \n \nVery common side effects  \n \nThese may affect more than 1 in 10 people: \n- reddening of the face or body feeling warm, hot, burning or itchy (flushing) \n- loose stools (diarrhoea) \n- feeling sick (nausea)  \n- stomach pain or stomach cramps \n \n\uf0e0 Taking your medicine with food can help to reduce the side effects above \n \nSubstances called ketones, which are naturally produced in the body, very commonly show up in urine \ntests while taking Tecfidera. \n \nTalk to your doctor about how to manage these side effects. Your doctor may reduce your dose. Do \nnot reduce your dose unless your doctor tells you to. \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nCommon side effects \n \nThese may affect up to 1 in 10 people: \n- inflammation of the lining of the intestines (gastroenteritis) \n- being sick (vomiting) \n- indigestion (dyspepsia) \n- inflammation of the lining of the stomach (gastritis) \n- gastrointestinal disorder \n- burning sensation \n- hot flush, feeling hot \n- itchy skin (pruritus) \n- rash \n- pink or red blotches on the skin (erythema) \n \nSide effects which may show up in your blood or urine tests \n\n- low levels of white blood cells (lymphopenia, leucopenia) in the blood. Reduced white \nblood cells could mean your body is less able to fight an infection. If you have a serious \ninfection (such as pneumonia), talk to your doctor immediately \n\n- proteins (albumin) in urine \n- increase in levels of liver enzymes (ALT, AST) in the blood \n\n \nUncommon side effects \n \nThese may affect up to 1 in 100 people: \n- Allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) \n- reduction in blood platelets \n \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n \n- liver inflammation and increase in levels of liver enzymes (ALT or AST in combination with \n\nbilirubin) \n- herpes zoster (shingles) with symptoms such as blisters, burning, itching or pain of the skin, \n\ntypically on one side of the upper body or the face, and other symptoms, like fever and \nweakness in the early stages of infection, followed by numbness, itching or red patches with \nsevere pain \n\n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n5. How to store Tecfidera \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the blister and the carton after \u201cEXP\u201d. \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nDo not store above 30\u00baC. \nKeep the blisters in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.

the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). - if you are suspected to suffer from a rare brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml) or if pml has been confirmed. warnings and precautions tecfidera may affect your white blood cell counts, your kidneys and liver. before you start tecfidera, your doctor will do a blood test to count the number of your white blood cells and will check that your kidneys and liver are working properly. your doctor will test these periodically during treatment. if your number of white blood cells decreases during treatment, your doctor may consider additional analytic measures or discontinue your treatment. talk to your doctor before taking tecfidera if you have: - severe kidney disease - severe liver disease - a disease of the stomach or bowel - a serious infection (such as pneumonia) herpes zoster (shingles) may occur with tecfidera treatment. in some cases, serious complications have occurred. you should inform your doctor immediately if you suspect you have any symptoms of shingles. if you believe your ms is getting worse (e.g. weakness or visual changes) or if you notice any new symptoms, talk to your doctor straight away because these may be the symptoms of a rare brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml). pml is a serious condition that may lead to severe disability or death. a rare but serious kidney disorder (fanconi syndrome) has been reported for a medicine containing dimethyl fumarate, in combination with other fumaric acid esters, used to treat psoriasis (a skin disease). if you notice you are passing more urine, are more thirsty and drinking more than normal, your muscles seem weaker, you break a bone, or just have aches and pains, talk to your doctor as soon as possible so that this can be investigated further. children and adolescents tecfidera is not recommended for use in children and adolescents because there is limited experience in the use of tecfidera in this population. other medicines and tecfidera tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any medicines, in particular: - medicines that contain fumaric acid esters (fumarates) used to treat psoriasis - medicines that affect the body's immune system including other medicines used to treat ms, such as fingolimod, natalizumab, teriflunomide, alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab or cladribine, or some commonly used cancer treatments (rituximab or mitoxantrone). - medicines that affect the kidneys including some antibiotics (used to treat infections), \"water tablets\" (diuretics), certain types of painkillers (such as ibuprofen and other similar anti- inflammatories and medicines purchased without a doctor's prescription) and medicines that contain lithium - taking tecfidera with certain types of vaccines (live vaccines) may cause you to get an infection and should, therefore, be avoided. your doctor will advise whether other types of vaccines (non-live vaccines) should be given. tecfidera with alcohol consumption of more than a small quantity (more than 50 ml) of strong alcoholic drinks (more than 30% alcohol by volume, e.g. spirits) should be avoided within an hour of taking tecfidera, as alcohol can interact with this medicine. this could cause inflammation of the stomach (gastritis), especially in people already prone to gastritis. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. pregnancy do not use tecfidera if you are pregnant unless you have discussed this with your doctor. breast-feeding it is not known whether the active substance of tecfidera passes into breast milk. tecfidera should not be used during breast-feeding. your doctor will help you decide whether you should stop breast- feeding, or stop using tecfidera. this involves balancing the benefit of breast-feeding for your child, and the benefit of therapy for you. driving and using machines the effect of tecfidera on the ability to drive or use machines is not known.

tecfidera may lower lymphocyte counts (a type of white blood cell). having a low white blood cell count can increase your risk of infection, including the risk of a rare brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml). pml may lead to severe disability or death. pml has occurred after 1 to 5 years of treatment and so your physician should continue to monitor your white blood cells throughout your treatment, and you should remain observant of any potential symptoms of pml as described below. the risk of pml may be higher if you have previously taken a medicine impairing the functionality of your body's immune system. the symptoms of pml may be similar to an ms relapse. symptoms may include new or worsening weakness on one side of the body; clumsiness; changes in vision, thinking, or memory; or confusion or personality changes, or speech and communication difficulties lasting for more than several days. therefore, if you believe your ms is getting worse or if you notice any new symptoms while you are on tecfidera treatment, it is very important that you speak to your doctor as soon as possible. also speak with your partner or caregivers and inform them about your treatment. symptoms might arise that you might not become aware of by yourself. call your doctor straight away if you experience any of these symptoms severe allergic reactions the frequency of severe allergic reactions cannot be estimated from the available data (not known). reddening of the face or body (flushing) is a very common side effect. however, should flushing be accompanied by a red rash or hives and you get any of these symptoms: - swelling of the face, lips, mouth or tongue (angioedema) - wheezing, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath (dyspnoea, hypoxia) - dizziness or loss of consciousness (hypotension) then this may represent a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) stop taking tecfidera and call a doctor straight away very common side effects these may affect more than 1 in 10 people: - reddening of the face or body feeling warm, hot, burning or itchy (flushing) - loose stools (diarrhoea) - feeling sick (nausea) - stomach pain or stomach cramps taking your medicine with food can help to reduce the side effects above substances called ketones, which are naturally produced in the body, very commonly show up in urine tests while taking tecfidera. talk to your doctor about how to manage these side effects. your doctor may reduce your dose. do not reduce your dose unless your doctor tells you to. common side effects these may affect up to 1 in 10 people: - inflammation of the lining of the intestines (gastroenteritis) - being sick (vomiting) - indigestion (dyspepsia) - inflammation of the lining of the stomach (gastritis) - gastrointestinal disorder - burning sensation - hot flush, feeling hot - itchy skin (pruritus) - rash - pink or red blotches on the skin (erythema) side effects which may show up in your blood or urine tests - low levels of white blood cells (lymphopenia, leucopenia) in the blood. reduced white blood cells could mean your body is less able to fight an infection. if you have a serious infection (such as pneumonia), talk to your doctor immediately - proteins (albumin) in urine - increase in levels of liver enzymes (alt, ast) in the blood uncommon side effects these may affect up to 1 in 100 people: - allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) - reduction in blood platelets not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) - liver inflammation and increase in levels of liver enzymes (alt or ast in combination with bilirubin) - herpes zoster (shingles) with symptoms such as blisters, burning, itching or pain of the skin, typically on one side of the upper body or the face, and other symptoms, like fever and weakness in the early stages of infection, followed by numbness, itching or red patches with severe pain reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by
