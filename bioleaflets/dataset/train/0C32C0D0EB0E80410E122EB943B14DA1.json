NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTRIZIVIR 300 mg/150 mg/300 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 300 mg of abacavir (as sulfate), 150 mg lamivudine and 300 mg \nzidovudine. \n \nFor the full list of excipients see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nBlue-green capsule-shaped film-coated tablets engraved with \u201cGX LL1\u201d on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTrizivir is indicated for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in adults \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.1). This fixed combination replaces the three components (abacavir, \nlamivudine and zidovudine) used separately in similar doses. It is recommended that treatment is \nstarted with abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine separately for the first 6-8 weeks (see section 4.4). \nThe choice of this fixed combination should be based not only on potential adherence criteria, but \nmainly on expected efficacy and risk related to the three nucleoside analogues.  \n \nThe demonstration of the benefit of Trizivir is mainly based on results of studies performed in \ntreatment naive patients or moderately antiretroviral experienced patients with non-advanced disease. \nIn patients with high viral load (> 100,000 copies/ml) choice of therapy needs special consideration \n(see section 5.1).  \n \nOverall, the virologic suppression with this triple nucleoside regimen could be inferior to that \nobtained with other multitherapies notably including boosted Protease inhibitors or non nucleoside \nreverse transcriptase inhibitors, therefore the use of Trizivir should only be considered under special \ncircumstances (e.g. co-infection with tuberculosis). \n \nBefore initiating treatment with abacavir, screening for carriage of the HLA-B*5701 allele should be \nperformed in any HIV-infected patient, irrespective of racial origin(see section 4.4).  Abacavir should \nnot be used in patients known to carry the HLA-B*5701 allele. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nTherapy should be prescribed by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nThe recommended dose of Trizivir in adults (18 years and over) is one tablet twice daily. \n \nTrizivir can be taken with or without food. \n \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nWhere discontinuation of therapy with one of the active substances of Trizivir is indicated, or where \ndose reduction is necessary separate preparations of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine are \navailable. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \n \n Whilst no dose adjustment of abacavir is necessary in patients with renal dysfunction, lamivudine and \nzidovudine concentrations are increased in patients with renal impairment due to decreased clearance. \nTherefore, as dose adjustments of these may be necessary, it is recommended that separate \npreparations of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine be administered to patients with reduced renal \nfunction (creatinine clearance \u2264 50 ml/min). Physicians should refer to the individual summary of \nproduct characteristics of these medicinal products. Trizivir should not be administered to patients \nwith end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment  \n \nAbacavir is primarily metabolised by the liver. No clinical data are available in patients with moderate \nor severe hepatic impairment, therefore the use of Trizivir is not recommended unless judged \nnecessary. In patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5-6) close monitoring is \nrequired, including monitoring of abacavir plasma levels if feasible (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nElderly \n \nNo pharmacokinetic data are currently available in patients over 65 years of age. Special care is \nadvised in this age group due to age associated changes such as the decrease in renal function and \nalteration of haematological parameters. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Trizivir in adolescents and children has not been established. No data are \navailable. \n \nDose adjustments in patients with haematological adverse reactions \n \nDose adjustment of zidovudine may be necessary if the haemoglobin level falls below 9 g/dl or \n5.59 mmol/l or the neutrophil count falls below 1.0 x 109/l (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). As dose \nadjustment of Trizivir is not possible, separate preparations of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine \nshould be used. Physicians should refer to the individual summary of product characteristics of these \nmedicinal products. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. See sections \n4.4 and 4.8 \n \nPatients with end-stage renal disease. \n \n \nDue to the active substance zidovudine, Trizivir is contraindicated in patients with abnormally low \nneutrophil counts (< 0.75 x 109/l), or abnormally low haemoglobin levels (< 7.5 g/dl or 4.65 mmol/l) \n(see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nThe special warnings and precautions relevant to abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine are included in \nthis section. There are no additional precautions or warnings relevant to the combination Trizivir. \n \n\nHypersensitivity Reactions (see also section 4.8 ): \n \nAbacavir is associated with a risk for hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) (see section4.8) characterised \nby fever and/or rash with other symptoms indicating multi-organ involvement. HSRs have been \nobserved with abacavir, some of which have been life-threatening, and in rare cases fatal, when not \nmanaged appropriately. \n \nThe risk for abacavir HSR to occur is high for patients who test positive for the HLA-B*5701 allele. \nHowever, abacavir HSRs have been reported at a lower frequency in patients who do not carry this \nallele.   \n \n\nTherefore the following should be adhered to: \n\n\u2022 HLA-B*5701 status must always be documented prior to initiating therapy. \n\n\u2022 Trizivir should never be initiated in patients with a positive HLA-B*5701 status, nor in \npatients with a negative HLA-B*5701 status who had a suspected abacavir HSR on a previous \nabacavir-containing regimen. (e.g. Kivexa, Ziagen, Triumeq)  \n\n\u2022 Trizivir must be stopped without delay, even in the absence of the HLA-B*5701 allele, if \nan HSR is suspected. Delay in stopping treatment with Trizivir after the onset of \nhypersensitivity may result in a life-threatening reaction.  \n\n\u2022 After stopping treatment with Trizivir for reasons of a suspected HSR, Trizivir or any other \nmedicinal product containing abacavir (e.g. Kivexa, Ziagen, Triumeq) must never be re-\ninitiated.  \n\n\u2022 Restarting abacavir containing products following a suspected abacavir HSR can result in a \nprompt return of symptoms within hours. This recurrence is usually more severe than on \ninitial presentation, and may include life-threatening hypotension and death. \n\n\u2022 In order to avoid restarting abacavir patients who have experienced a suspected HSR should \nbe instructed to dispose of their remaining Trizivir tablets  \n\n\u2022 Clinical description of abacavir HSR \n \nAbacavir HSR has been well characterised through clinical studies and during post marketing follow-\nup. Symptoms usually appeared within the first six weeks (median time to onset 11 days) of initiation \nof treatment with abacavir, although these reactions may occur at any time during therapy. \n \nAlmost all HSR to abacavir include fever and/or rash. Other signs and symptoms that have been \nobserved as part of abacavir HSR are described in detail in section 4.8 (Description of selected \nadverse reactions), including respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Importantly, such symptoms \nmay lead to misdiagnosis of HSR as respiratory disease (pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis), or \ngastroenteritis.  \n \nThe symptoms related to HSR worsen with continued therapy and can be life-threatening. These \nsymptoms usually resolve upon discontinuation of abacavir.  \n \nRarely, patients who have stopped abacavir for reasons other than symptoms of HSR have also \nexperienced life-threatening reactions within hours of re- initiating abacavir therapy (see Section 4.8 \nDescription of selected adverse reactions).  Restarting abacavir in such patients must be done in a \nsetting where medical assistance is readily available. \n\n\n\n 5 \n\n \nLactic acidosis  \nLactic acidosis, usually associated with hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis, has been reported with the \nuse of zidovudine .  Early symptoms (symptomatic hyperlactatemia) include benign digestive \nsymptoms (nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain), non-specific malaise, loss of appetite, weight loss, \nrespiratory symptoms (rapid and/or deep breathing) or neurological symptoms (including motor \nweakness). \n \nLactic acidosis has a high mortality and may be associated with pancreatitis, liver failure, or renal \nfailure. \n \nLactic acidosis generally occurred after a few or several months of treatment. \n \nTreatment with zidovudine should be discontinued in the setting of symptomatic hyperlactatemia and \nmetabolic/lactic acidosis, progressive hepatomegaly, or rapidly elevating aminotransferase levels. \n \nCaution should be exercised when administering  zidovudine to any patient (particularly obese \nwomen) with hepatomegaly, hepatitis or other known risk factors for liver disease and hepatic \nsteatosis (including certain medicinal products and alcohol). Patients co-infected with hepatitis C and \ntreated with alpha interferon and ribavirin may constitute a special risk. \n \nPatients at increased risk should be followed closely.  \n \n \nMitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero \n \nNucleoside and nucleotide  analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which \nis most pronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine. There have been reports of \nmitochondrial dysfunction in HIV-negative infants exposed in utero and/or post-natally to nucleoside \nanalogues; these have predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine. The \nmain adverse reactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic \ndisorders (hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia). These adverse reactions have  often been transitory. Late \nonset neurological disorders have been reported  rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). \nWhether such  neurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown. These findings \nshould be considered for any child exposed in utero to nucleotide and nucleotide  analogues, who \npresents with severe clinical findings of unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings.. These \nfindings do not affect current national recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant \nwomen to prevent vertical transmission of HIV. \n \nLipoatrophy \nTreatment with zidovudine has been associated with loss of subcutaneous fat, which has been linked to \nmitochondrial toxicity. The incidence and severity of lipoatrophy are related to cumulative exposure. \nThis fat loss, which is most evident in the face, limbs and buttocks, may not be reversible when \nswitching to a zidovudine-free regimen. Patients should be regularly assessed for signs of lipoatrophy \nduring therapy with zidovudine and zidovudine-containing products (Combivir and Trizivir). Therapy \nshould be switched to an alternative regimen if there is suspicion of lipoatrophy development. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nHaematological adverse reactions \n \nAnaemia, neutropenia and leucopenia (usually secondary to neutropenia) can be expected to occur in \npatients receiving zidovudine. These occurred more frequently at higher zidovudine doses (1200-\n1500 mg/day) and in patients with poor bone marrow reserve prior to treatment, particularly with \nadvanced HIV disease. Haematological parameters should therefore be carefully monitored (see \nsection 4.3) in patients receiving Trizivir. These haematological effects are not usually observed \nbefore four to six week\u2019s therapy. For patients with advanced symptomatic HIV disease, it is generally \nrecommended that blood tests are performed at least every two weeks for the first three months of \ntherapy and at least monthly thereafter. \n \nIn patients with early HIV disease haematological adverse reactions are infrequent. Depending on the \noverall condition of the patient, blood tests may be performed less often, for example every one to \nthree months. Additionally, dose adjustment of zidovudine may be required if severe anaemia or \nmyelosuppression occurs during treatment with Trizivir, or in patients with pre-existing bone marrow \ncompromise e.g. haemoglobin < 9 g/dl (5.59 mmol/l) or neutrophil count < 1.0 x 109/l (see \nsection 4.2). As dose adjustment of Trizivir is not possible separate preparations of zidovudine, \nabacavir and lamivudine should be used. Physicians should refer to the individual prescribing \ninformation for these medicinal products. \n \nPancreatitis \n \nCases of pancreatitis have occurred rarely in patients treated with abacavir, lamivudine and \nzidovudine. However, it is not clear whether these cases were due to treatment with these medicinal \nproducts or to the underlying HIV disease. Treatment with Trizivir should be stopped immediately if \nclinical signs, symptoms or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur. \n \nLiver disease \n \nIf lamivudine is being used concomitantly for the treatment of HIV and HBV, additional information \nrelating to the use of lamivudine in the treatment of hepatitis B infection is available in the Zeffix \nSmPC. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Trizivir has not been established in patients with significant underlying \nliver disorders. Trizivir is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment \n(see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  \n \nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an \nincreased risk of severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of concomitant antiviral \ntherapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal \nproducts.  \n \nIf Trizivir is discontinued in patients co-infected with hepatitis B virus, periodic monitoring of both \nliver function tests and markers of HBV replication is recommended, as withdrawal of lamivudine \nmay result in an acute exacerbation of hepatitis (see Zeffix SmPC). \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be \nmonitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.  \n \nPatients co-infected with hepatitis  B or C virus \n \nThe concomitant use of ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of \nanaemia (see section 4.5). \n  \nChildren and adolescents \n\n\n\n 7 \n\n \nBecause insufficient data are available, the use of Trizivir in children or adolescents is not \nrecommended. In this patient population, hypersensitivity reactions are particularly difficult to \nidentify. \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterium infections, \nand Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and \ntreatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune \nhepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported \ntime to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nOsteonecrosis \n \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nOpportunistic infections \n \nPatients should be advised that Trizivir or any other antiretroviral therapy does not cure HIV infection \nand that they may still develop opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection. \nTherefore, patients should remain under close clinical observation by physicians experienced in the \ntreatment of these associated HIV diseases. \n\nMyocardial infarction \n\nObservational studies have shown an association between myocardial infarction and the use of \nabacavir. Those studied were mainly antiretroviral experienced patients. Data from clinical trials \nshowed limited numbers of myocardial infarction and could not exclude a small increase in risk.  \nOverall the available data from observational cohorts and from randomised trials show some \ninconsistency so can neither confirm nor refute a causal relationship between abacavir treatment and \nthe risk of myocardial infarction. To date, there is no established biological mechanism to explain a \npotential increase in risk. When prescribing Trizivir, action should be taken to try to minimize all \nmodifiable risk factors (e.g. smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia). \n \nTransmission \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines.  \n \nDrug Interactions: \n \nTo date there are insufficient data on the efficacy and safety of Trizivir given concomitantly with \nNNRTIs or PIs (see section 5.1).  \n \nTrizivir should not be taken with any other medicinal products containing lamivudine or medicinal \nproducts containing emtricitabine.    \n \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nThe concomitant use of stavudine with zidovudine should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \nThe combination of lamivudine with cladribine is not-recommended (see section 4.5). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nTrizivir contains abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine, therefore any interactions identified for these \nindividually are relevant to Trizivir. Clinical studies have shown that there are no clinically significant \ninteractions between abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine. \n \nAbacavir is metabolised by UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UGT) enzymes and alcohol dehydrogenase; \nco-administration of inducers or inhibitors of UGT enzymes or with compounds eliminated through \nalcohol dehydrogenase could alter abacavir exposure.  Zidovudine is primarily metabolised by UGT \nenzymes; co-administration of inducers or inhibitors of UGT enzymes could alter zidovudine \nexposure. Lamivudine is cleared renally. Active renal secretion of lamivudine in the urine is mediated \nthrough organic cation transporters (OCTs); co-administration of lamivudine with OCT inhibitors may \nincrease lamivudine exposure. \n \nAbacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine are not significantly metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes \n(such as CYP 3A4, CYP 2C9 or CYP 2D6) nor do they inhibit or induce this enzyme system. \nTherefore, there is little potential for interactions with antiretroviral protease inhibitors, non-\nnucleosides and other medicinal products metabolised by major P450 enzymes. \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.

The concomitant use of \nribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). \nConsideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination ART regimen if this is \nalready established. This would be particularly important in patients with a known history of \nzidovudine induced anaemia. \n \nConcomitant treatment, especially acute therapy, with potentially nephrotoxic or myelosuppressive \nmedicinal products (e.g. systemic pentamidine, dapsone, pyrimethamine, co-trimoxazole, \namphotericin, flucytosine, ganciclovir, interferon, vincristine, vinblastine and doxorubicin) may also \nincrease the risk of adverse reactions to zidovudine (see section 4.8). If concomitant therapy with \nTrizivir and any of these medicinal products is necessary then extra care should be taken in monitoring \nrenal function and haematological parameters and, if required, the dosage of one or more agents \nshould be reduced. \n \nLimited data from clinical trials do not indicate a significantly increased risk of adverse reactions to \nzidovudine with cotrimoxazole (see interaction information above relating to lamivudine and co-\ntrimoxazole), aerosolised pentamidine, pyrimethamine and acyclovir at doses used in prophylaxis. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nAs a general rule, when deciding to use antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection in \npregnant women and consequently for reducing the risk of HIV vertical transmission to the newborn, \nthe animal data as well as the clinical experience in pregnant women should be taken into account. In \nthe present case, the use in pregnant women of zidovudine, with subsequent treatment of the newborn \ninfants, has been shown to reduce the rate of maternal-foetal transmission of HIV. There are no data \non the use of Trizivir in pregnancy. A moderate amount of data on pregnant women taking the \nindividual actives abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine in combination indicates no malformative \ntoxicity (more than 300 outcomes from first trimester exposures). A large amount of data on pregnant \nwomen taking lamivudine or zidovudine indicate no malformative toxicity (more than 3000 outcomes \nfrom first trimester exposure each, of which over 2000 outcomes involved exposure to both \nlamivudine and zidovudine). Moderate amount of data (more than 600 outcomes from first trimester) \n\nEthanol/Zidovudine Interaction not studied. \nSorbitol solution (3.2 g, 10.2 g, \n13.4 g)/ Lamivudine \n\nSingle dose lamivudine oral \nsolution 300 mg  \n\nLamivudine: \n\nAUC \u2193 14%; 32%; 36%  \n\nCmax \u2193 28%; 52%, 55%. \n\nWhen possible, avoid chronic \ncoadministration of Trizivir \nwith medicinal products \ncontaining sorbitol or other \nosmotic acting poly-alcohols \nor monosaccharide alcohols \n(e.g. xylitol, mannitol, lactitol, \nmaltitol).Consider more \nfrequent monitoring of HIV-1 \nviral load when chronic \ncoadministration cannot be \navoided. \n\n\n\n 13 \n\nindicates no malformative toxicity for abacavir. The malformative risk is unlikely in humans based on \nthe mentioned moderate amount of data. \n \nThe active ingredients of Trizivir may inhibit cellular DNA replication, zidovudine has been shown to \nbe transplacental carcinogen in one animal study and abacavir has been shown to be carcinogenic in \nanimal models (see section 5.3). The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. \n \nFor patients co-infected with hepatitis who are being treated with a lamivudine containing medicinal \nproduct such as Trizivir and subsequently become pregnant, consideration should be given to the \npossibility of a recurrence of hepatitis on discontinuation of lamivudine. \n \nMitochondrial dysfunction \nNucleoside and nucleotide analogues have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo to cause a variable \ndegree of mitochondrial damage. There have been reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV-\nnegative infants exposed in utero and/or post-natally to nucleoside analogues (see section 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAbacavir and its metabolites are excreted into the milk of lactating rats. Abacavir is also excreted into \nhuman milk.  \n \nBased on more than 200 mother/child pairs treated for HIV, serum concentrations of lamivudine in \nbreastfed infants of mothers treated for HIV are very low (< 4% of maternal serum concentrations) and \nprogressively decrease to undetectable levels when breastfed infants reach 24 weeks of age. There are \nno data available on the safety of abacavir and lamivudine when administered to babies less than three \nmonths old.  \n \nAfter administration of a single dose of 200 mg zidovudine to HIV-infected women, the mean \nconcentration of zidovudine was similar in human milk and serum. \n \nIt is recommended that mothers infected by HIV do not breast-feed their infants under any \ncircumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV. \n \nFertility \n \nStudies in animals showed that neither abacavir nor lamivudine nor zidovudine had any effect on \nfertility (see section 5.3). Zidovudine has been shown not to affect the number of sperm, sperm \nmorphology and motility in man. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. The clinical \nstatus of the patient and the adverse event profile of Trizivir should be borne in mind when \nconsidering the patient\u2019s ability to drive or operate machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAdverse reactions have been reported with abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine used separately or in \ncombination for therapy of HIV disease. Because Trizivir contains abacavir, lamivudine and \nzidovudine, the adverse reactions associated with these compounds may be expected.   \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions reported with the individual substances \n \nThe adverse reactions reported with abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine are presented in Table 2. \nThey are listed by body system, organ class and absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined as very \n\n\n\n 14 \n\ncommon (> 1/10), common (> 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (> 1/1000 to < 1/100), rare (> 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1000), very rare (< 1/10,000).  Care must be taken to eliminate the possibility of a hypersensitivity \nreaction if any of these symptoms occur. \n \nTable 1: Adverse reactions reported with the individual components of Trizivir \n \n\nAbacavir Lamivudine Zidovudine \n\nIMPORTANT: for information on abacavir hypersensitivity  see the information  below,  \nunder the  Description of selected adverse reactions \n\nAbacavir hypersensitivity \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\n Uncommon: neutropenia, \nanaemia (both occasionally \nsevere), thrombocytopenia  \nVery rare: pure red cell aplasia \n\nCommon: anaemia, neutropenia \nand leucopenia  \nUncommon: thrombocytopenia \nand pancytopenia with marrow \nhypoplasia \nRare: pure red cell aplasia  \nVery rare: aplastic anaemia \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nCommon: hypersensitivity   \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nCommon: anorexia \n\nVery Rare : lactic acidosis \n\n \n\nVery Rare : lactic acidosis \n\n \nRare: anorexia, lactic acidosis \nin the absence of hypoxaemia  \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\n  Rare: anxiety, depression \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nCommon: headache Common: headache, insomnia Very rare: peripheral \nneuropathy (paraesthesiae) \n\nVery common: headache \nCommon: dizziness  \nRare: insomnia, paraesthesia, \nsomnolence, loss of mental \nacuity, convulsions \n\nCardiac disorders \n\n  Rare: cardiomyopathy \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\n Common: cough, nasal \nsymptoms \n\nUncommon: dyspnoea \nRare: cough \n\n \n\n\n\n 15 \n\nAbacavir Lamivudine Zidovudine \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nCommon: nausea, vomiting, \ndiarrhoea  \nRare: pancreatitis \n\nCommon: nausea, vomiting, \nabdominal pain, diarrhoea \nRare: rises in serum amylase, \npancreatitis \n\nVery common: Nausea  \nCommon: vomiting, abdominal \npain, and diarrhoea \nUncommon: flatulence \nRare: oral mucosa \npigmentation, taste disturbance \ndyspepsia, pancreatitis \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\n Uncommon: transient rises in liver enzymes (AST, ALT) \nRare: hepatitis \n\nCommon: raised blood levels \nof liver enzymes and bilirubin \nRare: liver disorders such as \nsevere hepatomegaly with \nsteatosis, \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nCommon: rash (without \nsystemic symptoms) \nVery rare: erythema \nmultiforme, Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome and toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis \n\nCommon: rash, alopecia Uncommon: rash and pruritus \nRare:  nail and skin \npigmentation, urticaria and \nsweating \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\n Common: arthralgia, muscle \ndisorders  \nRare: rhabdomyolysis \n\nCommon: myalgia \nUncommon: myopathy \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\n  Rare: urinary frequency \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\n  Rare: gynaecomastia \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nCommon: fever, lethargy, \nfatigue \n\nCommon: fatigue, malaise, \nfever \n\nCommon: malaise \nUncommon: fever, generalised \npain and asthenia \nRare: chills, chest pain, and \ninfluenza-like syndrome \n\nMany of the adverse reactions listed in the table  occur commonly (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, \nlethargy, rash) in patients with abacavir hypersensitivity. Therefore, patients with any of these \nsymptoms should be carefully evaluated for the presence of this hypersensitivity (see section 4.4). \nVery rarely cases of erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis \n\n\n\n 16 \n\nhave been reported where abacavir hypersensitivity could not be ruled out. In such cases medicinal \nproducts containing abacavir should be permanently discontinued. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nAbacavir hypersensitivity \nThe signs and symptoms of this HSR are listed below. These have been identified either from clinical \nstudies or post marketing surveillance. Those reported in at least 10% of patients with a \nhypersensitivity reaction are in bold text. \n \nAlmost all patients developing hypersensitivity reactions will have fever and/or rash (usually \nmaculopapular or urticarial) as part of the syndrome, however reactions have occurred without rash or \nfever. Other key symptoms include gastrointestinal, respiratory or constitutional symptoms such as \nlethargy and malaise.  \n \nSkin Rash (usually maculopapular or urticarial) \n\n \nGastrointestinal tract Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, mouth ulceration \n\n \nRespiratory tract Dyspnoea, cough, sore throat, adult respiratory distress syndrome, \n\nrespiratory failure \n \n\nMiscellaneous Fever, lethargy, malaise, oedema, lymphadenopathy, hypotension, \nconjunctivitis, anaphylaxis \n \n\nNeurological/Psychiatry Headache, paraesthesia \n \n\nHaematological Lymphopenia \n \n\nLiver/pancreas Elevated liver function tests, hepatitis, hepatic failure \n \n\nMusculoskeletal Myalgia, rarely myolysis, arthralgia, elevated creatine phosphokinase \n \n\nUrology Elevated creatinine, renal failure \n \n\nSymptoms related to this HSR worsen with continued therapy and can be life- threatening and in rare \ninstance, have been fatal. \n \nRestarting abacavir following an abacavir HSR results in a prompt return of symptoms within hours. \nThis recurrence of the HSR is usually more severe than on initial presentation, and may include life-\nthreatening hypotension and death. Similar reactions have also occurred infrequently after restarting \nabacavir in patients who had only one of the key symptoms of hypersensitivity (see above) prior to \nstopping abacavir; and on very rare occasions have also been seen in patients who have restarted \ntherapy with no preceding symptoms of a HSR (i.e., patients previously considered to be abacavir \ntolerant). \n \n \nHaematological adverse reactions with zidovudine \n \nAnaemia, neutropenia and leucopenia occurred more frequently at higher doses (1,200-1,500 mg/day) \nand in patients with advanced HIV disease (especially when there is poor bone marrow reserve prior to \ntreatment) and particularly in patients with CD4 cell counts less than 100/mm3. Dose reduction or \ncessation of therapy may become necessary (see section 4.4).  The anaemia may necessitate \ntransfusions. \n \nThe incidence of neutropenia was also increased in those patients whose neutrophil counts, \nhaemoglobin levels and serum vitamin B12 levels were low at the start of zidovudine therapy. \n\n\n\n 17 \n\n \nLactic acidosis \n \nTreatment with  zidovudine has been associated with cases of lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, usually \nassociated with severe hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis, (see section 4.4). \n \nLipoatrophy \nTreatment with zidovudine has been associated with loss of subcutaneous fat which is most evident in \nthe face, limbs and buttocks.  Patients receiving Trizivir  should be frequently examined and \nquestioned for signs of lipoatrophy. When such development is found, treatment with Trizivir should \nnot be continued (see section 4.4). \n \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section \n4.4) \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset \nis more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nOsteonecrosis \n \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no experience of overdose with Trizivir. No specific symptoms or signs have been identified \nfollowing acute overdose with zidovudine or lamivudine apart from those listed as adverse reactions. \nNo fatalities occurred, and all patients recovered. Single doses up to 1,200 mg and daily doses up to \n1,800 mg of abacavir have been administered to patients in clinical studies. No unexpected adverse \nreactions were reported. The effects of higher doses are not known. \n \nIf overdose occurs the patient should be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8), and \nstandard supportive treatment applied as necessary. Since lamivudine is dialysable, continuous \nhaemodialysis could be used in the treatment of overdose, although this has not been studied. \nHaemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis appear to have a limited effect on elimination of zidovudine, but \nenhance the elimination of the glucuronide metabolite. It is not known whether abacavir can be \nremoved by peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 18 \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group \nAntivirals for systemic use, antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, combinations. ATC Code: \nJ05AR04.  \n \nMechanism of action \nAbacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine are all NRTIs, and are potent selective inhibitors of HIV-1 and \nHIV-2.All three medicinal products are metabolised sequentially by intracellular kinases to the \nrespective 5\u2032-triphosphate (TP). Lamivudine-TP, carbovir-TP (the active triphosphate form of \nabacavir) and zidovudine-TP are substrates for and competitive inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase \n(RT). However, their main antiviral activity is through incorporation of the monophosphate form into \nthe viral DNA chain, resulting in chain termination. Abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine \ntriphosphates show significantly less affinity for host cell DNA polymerases. \n \n No antagonistic effects in vitro were seen with lamivudine and other antiretrovirals (tested agents: \nabacavir, didanosine and nevirapine). No antagonistic effects in vitro were seen with zidovudine and \nother antiretrovirals (tested agents: didanosine and interferon-alpha). The antiviral activity of abacavir \nin cell culture was not antagonized when combined with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors \n(NRTIs) didanosine, emtricitabine, stavudine  or tenofovir,  the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitor (NNRTI) nevirapine, or the protease inhibitor (PI) amprenavir.  \n \nIn vitro resistance \nHIV-1 resistance to lamivudine involves the development of a M184I or, more commonly, M184V \namino acid change close to the active site of the viral RT. \n \nAbacavir-resistant isolates of HIV-1 have been selected in vitro and are associated with specific \ngenotypic changes in the RT codon region (codons M184V, K65R, L74V and Y115F). Viral \nresistance to abacavir develops relatively slowly in vitro, requiring multiple mutations for a clinically \nrelevant increase in EC50 over wild-type virus.  \n \nIn vivo resistance (therapy na\u00efve patients) \nThe M184V or M184I variants arise in HIV-1 infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing \nantiretroviral therapy. Most patients experiencing virological failure with a regimen containing \nabacavir in a pivotal clinical trial with Combivir (fixed dose combination of lamivudine and \nzidovudine) showed either no NRTI-related changes from baseline (15 %) or only M184V or M184I \nselection (78 %). The overall selection frequency for M184V or M184I was high (85 %), and selection \nof L74V, K65R and Y115F was not observed (see Table). Thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs) \nwhich are selected by zidovudine (ZDV) were also found (8%).  \n \n\nTherapy Abacavir + Combivir  \n\nNumber of Subjects 282 \n\nNumber of Virological Failures 43 \n\nNumber of On-Therapy  Genotypes 40 (100 %) \n\nK65R 0 \n\nL74V 0 \nY115F 0 \n\nM184V/I 34 (85 %) \nTAMs1 3 (8 %) \n\n1. Number of subjects with \u22651 TAM. \n \nTAMs might be selected when thymidine analogs are associated with abacavir. In a meta-analysis of \nsix clinical trials, TAMs were not selected by regimens containing abacavir without zidovudine \n(0/127), but were selected by regimens containing abacavir and the thymidine analogue zidovudine \n\n\n\n 19 \n\n(22/86, 26 %).  In addition, the selection of L74V and K65R was reduced when co-administered with \nZDV (K65R: without ZDV: 13/127, 10 %; with ZDV: 1/86, 1 %; L74V: without ZDV: 51/127, 40 %; \nwith ZDV: 2/86, 2 %). \n \nIn vivo resistance (Therapy experienced patients) \nThe M184V or M184I variants arise in HIV-1 infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing \nantiretroviral therapy and confers high-level resistance to lamivudine. In vitro data tend to suggest that \nthe continuation of lamivudine in anti-retroviral regimen despite the development of M184V might \nprovide residual anti-retroviral activity (likely through impaired viral fitness).  The clinical relevance \nof these findings is not established.  Indeed, the available clinical data are very limited and preclude \nany reliable conclusion in the field.  In any case, initiation of susceptible NRTIs should always be \npreferred to maintenance of lamivudine therapy.  Therefore, maintaining lamivudine therapy despite \nemergence of M184V mutation should only be considered in cases where no other active NRTIs are \navailable. Similarly, the presence of TAMs gives rise to resistance to ZDV. \n \nClinically significant reduction of susceptibility to abacavir has been demonstrated in clinical isolates \nof patients with uncontrolled viral replication, who have been pre-treated with and are resistant to \nother nucleoside inhibitors. In a meta-analysis of five clinical trials where abacavir was added to \nintensify therapy, of 166 subjects, 123 (74 %) had M184V/I, 50 (30 %) had T215Y/F, 45 (27%) had \nM41L, 30 (18 %) had K70R and 25 (15%) had D67N. K65R was absent and L74V and Y115F were \nuncommon (\u22643 %). Logistic regression modelling of the predictive value for genotype (adjusted for \nbaseline plasma HIV-1 RNA [vRNA], CD4+ cell count, number and duration of prior antiretroviral \ntherapies) showed that the presence of 3 or more NRTI resistance-associated mutations was associated \nwith reduced response at Week 4 (p=0.015) or 4 or more mutations at median Week 24 (p\u22640.012). In \naddition, the 69 insertion complex or the Q151M mutation, usually found in combination with A62V, \nV75I, F77L and F116Y, cause a high level of resistance to abacavir. \n \n \n\nBaseline Reverse \nTranscriptase \n\nMutation \n\nWeek 4 \n(n = 166) \n\nn \nMedian \n\nChange vRNA \n(log10 c/mL) \n\nPercent with \n<400 copies/mL vRNA \n\nNone 15 -0.96 40 % \nM184V alone  75 -0.74 64 % \n\nAny one NRTI \nmutation 82 -0.72 65 % \n\nAny two NRTI-\nassociated mutations  22 -0.82 32 % \n\nAny three NRTI-\nassociated mutations 19 -0.30 5 % \n\nFour or more NRTI-\nassociated mutations 28 -0.07 11 % \n\n \nPhenotypic resistance and cross-resistance \nPhenotypic resistance to abacavir requires M184V with at least one other abacavir-selected mutation, \nor M184V with multiple TAMs. Phenotypic cross-resistance to other NRTIs with M184V or M184I \nmutation alone is limited. Zidovudine, didanosine, stavudine and tenofovir maintain their antiretroviral \nactivities against such HIV-1 variants. The presence of M184V with K65R does give rise to cross-\nresistance between abacavir, tenofovir, didanosine and lamivudine, and M184V with L74V gives rise \nto cross-resistance between abacavir, didanosine and lamivudine. The presence of M184V with Y115F \ngives rise to cross-resistance between abacavir and lamivudine. Appropriate use of abacavir can be \nguided using currently recommended resistance algorithms. \n \nCross-resistance between abacavir, lamivudine or zidovudine and antiretrovirals from other classes \ne.g. PIs or NNRTIs is unlikely. \n\n\n\n 20 \n\n \nClinical efficacy and safety  \n \nOne randomised, double blind, placebo controlled clinical study has compared the combination of \nabacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine to the combination of indinavir, lamivudine and zidovudine in \ntreatment naive patients. Due to the high proportion of premature discontinuation (42 % of patients \ndiscontinued randomised treatment by week 48), no definitive conclusion can be drawn regarding the \nequivalence between the treatment regimens at week 48. Although a similar antiviral effect was \nobserved between the abacavir and indinavir containing regimens in terms of proportion of patients \nwith undetectable viral load (\u2264 400 copies/ml; intention to treat analysis (ITT), 47 % versus 49 %; as \ntreated analysis (AT), 86 % versus 94 % for abacavir and indinavir combinations respectively), results \nfavoured the indinavir combination, particularly in the subset of patients with high viral load \n(> 100,000 copies/ml at baseline; ITT, 46 % versus 55 %; AT, 84 % versus 93 % for abacavir and \nindinavir respectively). \n \nACTG5095 was a randomised (1:1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed in 1147 \nantiretroviral na\u00efve HIV-1 infected adults, comparing 3 regimens: zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine \n(3TC), abacavir (ABC), efavirenz (EFV) vs ZDV/3TC/EFV vs ZDV/3TC/ABC. After a median \nfollow-up of 32 weeks, the tritherapy with the three nucleosides ZDV/3TC/ABC was shown to be \nvirologically inferior to the two other arms regardless of baseline viral load (< or > 100 000 copies/ml) \nwith 26 % of subjects on the ZDV/3TC/ABC arm, 16 % on the ZDV/3TC/EFV arm and 13 % on the 4 \ndrug arm categorised as having virological failure (HIV RNA >200 copies/ml). At week 48 the \nproportion of subjects with HIV RNA <50 copies/ml were 63 %, 80 % and 86 % for the \nZDV/3TC/ABC, ZDV/3TC/EFV and ZDV/3TC/ABC/EFV arms, respectively. The study Data Safety \nMonitoring Board stopped the ZDV/3TC/ABC arm at this time based on the higher proportion of \npatients with virologic failure. The remaining arms were continued in a blinded fashion. After a \nmedian follow-up of 144 weeks, 25 % of subjects on the ZDV/3TC/ABC/EFV arm and 26 % on the \nZDV/3TC/EFV arm were categorised as having virological failure. There was no significant \ndifference in the time to first virologic failure (p=0.73, log-rank test) between the 2 arms. In this study, \naddition of ABC to ZDV/3TC/EFV did not significantly improve efficacy. \n \n\n  ZDV/3TC/ABC ZDV/3TC/EFV ZDV/3TC/ABC/EFV \nVirologic failure (HIV \nRNA >200 copies/ml) \n\n32 weeks 26 % 16 % 13 % \n144 weeks - 26 % 25 % \n\nVirologic success (48 \nweeks HIV RNA < 50 \ncopies/ml) \n\n 63 % 80 % 86 % \n\n \nIn antiretroviral-naive patients treated with a combination of abacavir, lamivudine, zidovudine and \nefavirenz in a small, ongoing, open label pilot study, the proportion of patients with undetectable viral \nload (< 400 copies/ml) was approximately 90 % with 80 % having < 50 copies/ml after 24 weeks of \ntreatment. \n \nCurrently there are no data on the use of Trizivir in heavily pre-treated patients, patients failing on \nother therapies or patients with advanced disease (CD4 cells < 50 cells/mm3).  \n \nThe degree of benefit of this nucleoside combination in heavily pre-treated patients will depend on the \nnature and duration of prior therapy that may have selected for HIV-1 variants with cross-resistance to \nabacavir, lamivudine or zidovudine. \n \nTo date there are insufficient data on the efficacy and safety of Trizivir given concomitantly with \nNNRTIs or PIs. \n \n\n\n\n 21 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAbacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine are rapidly and well absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract \nfollowing oral administration. The absolute bioavailability of oral abacavir, lamivudine and \nzidovudine in adults is about 83 %, 80 - 85 % and 60 - 70 % respectively. \n \nIn a pharmacokinetic study in HIV-1 infected patients, the steady state pharmacokinetic parameters of \nabacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine were similar when either Trizivir alone or the combination tablet \nlamivudine/zidovudine and abacavir in combination were administered, and also similar to the values \nobtained in the bioequivalence study of Trizivir in healthy volunteers. \n \nA bioequivalence study compared Trizivir with abacavir 300 mg, lamivudine 150 mg and zidovudine \n300 mg taken together. The effect of food on the rate and extent of absorption was also studied. \nTrizivir was shown to be bioequivalent to abacavir 300 mg, lamivudine 150 mg and zidovudine \n300 mg given as separate tablets for AUC0-\u221e and Cmax. Food decreased the rate of absorption of \nTrizivir (slight decrease Cmax (mean 18 - 32 %) and increase tmax (approximately 1 hour), but not the \nextent of absorption (AUC0-\u221e). These changes are not considered clinically relevant and no food \nrestrictions are recommended for administration of Trizivir. \n \nAt a therapeutic dose (one Trizivir tablet twice daily) in patients, the mean (CV) steady-state Cmax of \nabacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine in plasma are 3.49 \u00b5g/ml (45 %), 1.33 \u00b5g/ml (33 %) and \n1.56 \u00b5g/ml (83 %), respectively.  Corresponding values for Cmin could not be established for abacavir \nand are 0.14 \u00b5g/ml (70 %) for lamivudine and 0.01 \u00b5g/ml (64 %) for zidovudine. The mean (CV) \nAUCs for abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine over a dosing interval of 12 hours are 6.39 \u00b5g.h/ml \n(31 %), 5.73 \u00b5g.h/ml (31 %) and 1.50 \u00b5g.h/ml (47 %), respectively. \n \nA modest increase in Cmax (28 %) was observed for zidovudine when administered with lamivudine, \nhowever overall exposure (AUC) was not significantly altered. Zidovudine has no effect on the \npharmacokinetics of lamivudine. An effect of abacavir is observed on zidovudine (Cmax reduced with \n20 %) and on lamivudine (Cmax reduced with 35 %). \n \nDistribution \n \nIntravenous studies with abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine showed that the mean apparent volume \nof distribution is 0.8, 1.3 and 1.6 l/kg respectively. Lamivudine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over \nthe therapeutic dose range and displays limited binding to the major plasma protein albumin (< 36 % \nserum albumin in vitro). Zidovudine plasma protein binding is 34 % to 38 %. Plasma protein binding \nstudies in vitro indicate that abacavir binds only low to moderately (~ 49 %) to human plasma proteins \nat therapeutic concentrations. This indicates a low likelihood for interactions with other medicinal \nproducts through plasma protein binding displacement. \n \nInteractions involving binding site displacement are not anticipated with Trizivir. \n \nData show that abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine penetrate the central nervous system (CNS) and \nreach the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The mean ratios of CSF/serum lamivudine and zidovudine \nconcentrations 2 - 4 hours after oral administration were approximately 0.12 and 0.5 respectively. The \ntrue extent of CNS penetration of lamivudine and its relationship with any clinical efficacy is \nunknown.  \n \nStudies with abacavir demonstrate a CSF to plasma AUC ratio of between 30 to 44 %. The observed \nvalues of the peak concentrations are 9 fold greater than the IC50 of abacavir of 0.08 \u00b5g/ml or 0.26 \u00b5M \nwhen abacavir is given at 600 mg twice daily.  \n \n \n\n\n\n 22 \n\n \nBiotransformation \n \nMetabolism of lamivudine is a minor route of elimination. Lamivudine is predominately cleared by \nrenal excretion of unchanged lamivudine. The likelihood of metabolic drug interactions with \nlamivudine is low due to the small extent of hepatic metabolism (5 - 10 %) and low plasma binding. \n \nThe 5\u2019-glucuronide of zidovudine is the major metabolite in both plasma and urine, accounting for \napproximately 50 - 80 % of the administered dose eliminated by renal excretion. 3\u2019-amino-3\u2019-\ndeoxythymidine (AMT) has been identified as a metabolite of zidovudine following intravenous \ndosing. \n \nAbacavir is primarily metabolised by the liver with approximately 2 % of the administered dose being \nrenally excreted, as unchanged compound. The primary pathways of metabolism in man are by alcohol \ndehydrogenase and by glucuronidation to produce the 5\u2019-carboxylic acid and 5\u2019-glucuronide which \naccount for about 66 % of the dose excreted in the urine. \n \nElimination \n \nThe observed lamivudine half-life of elimination is 5 to 7 hours. The mean systemic clearance of \nlamivudine is approximately 0.32 l/h/kg, with predominantly renal clearance (> 70 %) via the organic \ncationic transport system. Studies in patients with renal impairment show lamivudine elimination is \naffected by renal dysfunction. Dose reduction is required for patients with creatinine clearance \n\u2264 50 ml/min (see section 4.2).  \n \nFrom studies with intravenous zidovudine, the mean terminal plasma half-life was 1.1 hours and the \nmean systemic clearance was 1.6 l/h/kg. Renal clearance of zidovudine is estimated to be 0.34 l/h/kg, \nindicating glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion by the kidneys. Zidovudine concentrations \nare increased in patients with advanced renal failure. \n \nThe mean half-life of abacavir is about 1.5 hours. Following multiple oral doses of abacavir 300 mg \ntwice a day there is no significant accumulation of abacavir. Elimination of abacavir is via hepatic \nmetabolism with subsequent excretion of metabolites primarily in the urine. The metabolites and \nunchanged abacavir account for about 83 % of the administered abacavir dose in the urine the \nremainder is eliminated in the faeces. \n \n \nSpecial patient populations \n \nHepatic impairment \n. \nPharmacokinetic data has been obtained for abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine separately. Limited \ndata in patients with cirrhosis suggest that accumulation of zidovudine may occur in patients with \nhepatic impairment because of decreased glucuronidation. Data obtained in patients with moderate to \nsevere hepatic impairment show that lamivudine pharmacokinetics are not significantly affected by \nhepatic dysfunction.  \n \nAbacavir is metabolised primarily by the liver. The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have been studied in \npatients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5-6) receiving a single 600 mg dose; the \nmedian (range) AUC value was 24.1 (10.4 to 54.8) ug.h/ml.  The results showed that there was a mean \n(90%CI) increase of 1.89 fold [1.32; 2.70] in the abacavir AUC, and 1.58 [1.22; 2.04] fold in the \nelimination half-life. No definitive recommendation on dose reduction is possible in patients with mild \nhepatic impairment due to substantial variability of abacavir exposure in this patient population.  \nBased on data obtained for abacavir, Trizivir is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe \nhepatic impairment. \n \n\n\n\n 23 \n\nRenal impairment \n \nThe observed lamivudine half-life of elimination is 5 to 7 hours. The mean systemic clearance of \nlamivudine is approximately 0.32 l/h/kg, with predominantly renal clearance (> 70 %) via the organic \ncationic transport system. Studies in patients with renal impairment show lamivudine elimination is \naffected by renal dysfunction. \n \nFrom studies with intravenous zidovudine, the mean terminal plasma half-life was 1.1 hours and the \nmean systemic clearance was 1.6 l/h/kg. Renal clearance of zidovudine is estimated to be 0.34 l/h/kg, \nindicating glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion by the kidneys. Zidovudine concentrations \nare increased in patients with advanced renal failure. \n \nAbacavir is primarily metabolised by the liver with approximately 2 % of abacavir excreted \nunchanged in the urine. The pharmacokinetics of abacavir in patients with end-stage renal disease is \nsimilar to patients with normal renal function, and, therefore, no dose reduction is required in patients \nwith renal impairment. \n \nAs dose adjustments of lamivudine and zidovudine may be necessary it is recommended that separate \npreparations of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine be administered to patients with reduced renal \nfunction (creatinine clearance \u2264 50 ml/min). Trizivir is contraindicated in patients with end-stage renal \ndisease (see section 4.3). \n \nElderly \n \nNo pharmacokinetic data are available in patients over 65 years of age. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThere are no data available on treatment with the combination of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine \nin animals. The clinically relevant toxicological effects of these three medicinal products are anaemia, \nneutropenia and leucopenia. \n \nMutagenicity and carcinogenicity \n \nNeither abacavir, lamivudine nor zidovudine is mutagenic in bacterial tests, but consistent with other \nnucleoside analogues, they inhibit cellular DNA replication in in vitro mammalian tests such as the \nmouse lymphoma assay.  \n \nLamivudine has not shown any genotoxic activity in the in vivo studies at doses that gave plasma \nconcentrations up to 40 - 50 times higher than clinical plasma levels. Zidovudine showed clastogenic \neffects in oral repeated dose micronucleus tests in mice and rats. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from \nAIDS patients receiving zidovudine treatment have also been observed to contain higher numbers of \nchromosome breakages.  \n \nA pilot study has demonstrated that zidovudine is incorporated into leukocyte nuclear DNA of adults, \nincluding pregnant women, taking zidovudine as treatment for HIV-1 infection, or for the prevention \nof mother to child viral transmission.  Zidovudine was also incorporated into DNA from cord blood \nleukocytes of infants from zidovudine-treated mothers.  A transplacental genotoxicity study conducted \nin monkeys compared zidovudine alone with the combination of zidovudine and lamivudine at human-\nequivalent exposures.  The study demonstrated that foetuses exposed in utero to the combination \nsustained a higher level of nucleoside analogue-DNA incorporation into multiple foetal organs, and \nshowed evidence of more telomere shortening than in those exposed to zidovudine alone. The clinical \nsignificance of these findings is unknown.  \n \n\n\n\n 24 \n\nAbacavir has a weak potential to cause chromosomal damage both in vitro and in vivo at high test \nconcentrations and therefore any potential risk to man must be balanced against the expected benefits \nof treatment.  \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of a combination of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine has not been \ntested. In long-term oral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice, lamivudine did not show any \ncarcinogenic potential. In oral carcinogenicity studies with zidovudine in mice and rats, late appearing \nvaginal epithelial tumours were observed.  A subsequent intravaginal carcinogenicity study confirmed \nthe hypothesis that the vaginal tumours were the result of long term local exposure of the rodent \nvaginal epithelium to high concentrations of unmetabolised zidovudine in urine. There were no other  \nzidovudine-related tumours observed in either sex of either species. \n \nIn addition, two transplacental carcinogenicity studies have been conducted in mice. In one study, by \nthe US National Cancer Institute, zidovudine was administered at maximum tolerated doses to \npregnant mice from day 12 to 18 of gestation. One year postnatally, there was an increase in the \nincidence of tumours in the lung, liver and female reproductive tract of offspring exposed to the \nhighest dose level (420 mg/kg term body weight). \n \nIn a second study, mice were administered zidovudine at doses up to 40 mg/kg for 24 months, with \nexposure beginning prenatally on gestation day 10. Treatment related findings were limited to late-\noccurring vaginal epithelial tumours, which were seen with a similar incidence and time of onset as in \nthe standard oral carcinogenicity study. The second study thus provided no evidence that zidovudine \nacts as a transplacental carcinogen. \n \nIt is concluded that as the increase in incidence of tumours in the first transplacental carcinogenicity \nstudy represents a hypothetical risk, this should be balanced against the proven therapeutic benefit. \nCarcinogenicity studies with orally administered abacavir in mice and rats showed an increase in the \nincidence of malignant and non-malignant tumours. Malignant tumours occurred in the preputial gland \nof males and the clitoral gland of females of both species, and in rats in the thyroid gland of males and \nand in the liver, urinary bladder, lymph nodes and the subcutis of females.  \n \nThe majority of these tumours occurred at the highest abacavir dose of 330 mg/kg/day in mice and \n600 mg/kg/day in rats. The exception was the preputial gland tumour which occurred at a dose of \n110 mg/kg in mice. The systemic exposure at the no effect level in mice and rats was equivalent to 3 \nand 7 times the human systemic exposure during therapy.  \n \nWhile the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown, these data suggest that a carcinogenic risk \nto humans is outweighed by the potential clinical benefit. \n \nRepeat-dose toxicity  \n \nIn toxicology studies abacavir was shown to increase liver weights in rats and monkeys. The clinical \nrelevance of this is unknown. There is no evidence from clinical studies that abacavir is hepatotoxic. \nAdditionally, autoinduction of abacavir metabolism or induction of the metabolism of other medicinal \nproducts hepatically metabolised has not been observed in man. \n \nMild myocardial degeneration in the heart of mice and rats was observed following administration of \nabacavir for two years. The systemic exposures were equivalent to 7 to 24 times the expected systemic \nexposure in humans. The clinical relevance of this finding has not been determined. \n \nReproductive toxicology \n \nLamivudine was not teratogenic in animal studies but there were indications of an increase in early \nembryonic deaths in the rabbit at relatively low systemic exposures, comparable to those achieved in \nhumans. A similar effect was not seen in rats even at very high systemic exposure. \n \n\n\n\n 25 \n\nZidovudine had a similar effect in both species, but only at very high systemic exposures. At \nmaternally toxic doses, zidovudine given to rats during organogenesis resulted in an increased \nincidence of malformations, but no evidence of foetal abnormalities was observed at lower doses. \n \nAbacavir demonstrated toxicity to the developing embryo and foetus in rats, but not in rabbits. These \nfindings included decreased foetal body weight, foetal oedema, and an increase in skeletal \nvariations/malformations, early intra-uterine deaths and still births. No conclusion can be drawn with \nregard to the teratogenic potential of abacavir because of this embryo-foetal toxicity. \n \nA fertility study in the rat has shown that abacavir had no effect on male or female fertility. Likewise, \nneither lamivudine nor zidovudine had any effect on fertility. Zidovudine has not been shown to affect \nthe number of sperm, sperm morphology and motility in man. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n\n- If you have any further questions ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm     \nthem, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist immediately. This includes \nany possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \nIMPORTANT \u2014 Hypersensitivity reactions \n\nTrizivir contains abacavir (which is also an active substance in medicines such as Kivexa, Triumeq \nand  Ziagen). Some people who take abacavir may develop a hypersensitivity reaction (a serious \nallergic reaction), which can be life-threatening if they continue to take abacavir containing products . \nYou must carefully read all the information under \u2018Hypersensitivity reactions\u2019 in the panel in \nSection 4. \n\nThe Trizivir pack includes an Alert Card, to remind you and medical staff about abacavir \nhypersensitivity. Detach this card and keep it with you at all times. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet  \n\n1. What Trizivir is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Trizivir \n3. How to take Trizivir \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Trizivir  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n1. What Trizivir is and what it is used for \n\nTrizivir is used to treat HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection in adults. \n \nTrizivir contains three active ingredients that are used to treat HIV infection: abacavir, lamivudine and \nzidovudine. All of these belong to a group of anti-retroviral medicines called nucleoside analogue \nreverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). \n \nTrizivir helps to control your condition. Trizivir does not cure HIV infection; it reduces the amount of \nvirus in your body, and keeps it at a low level. This helps your body to increase  the CD4 cell count in \nyour blood. CD4 cells are a type of white blood cell that are important in helping your body to fight \ninfection. \n  \nNot everyone responds to treatment with Trizivir in the same way. Your doctor will monitor the \neffectiveness of your treatment. \n \n \n\n\n\n 41 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Trizivir  \n \nDo not take Trizivir: \n\u2022 if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to abacavir (or any other medicine containing abacavir \u2014 \n\nKivexa, Triumeq  or Ziagen), lamivudine or zidovudine, or any of the other ingredients of this \nmedicine (listed in Section 6) \n\nCarefully read all the information about hypersensitivity reactions in Section 4. \n\u2022 if you have severe kidney problems \n\u2022 if you have a very low red blood cell count (anaemia) or a very low white blood cell count \n\n(neutropenia) \nCheck with your doctor if you think any of these apply to you. \n\n \nTake special care with Trizivir \n\nSome people taking Trizivir are more at risk of serious side effects. You need to be aware of the extra \nrisks: \n\u2022     if you have moderate or severe liver disease  \n\u2022 if you have ever had liver disease, including hepatitis B or C (if you have hepatitis B infection, do \n\nnot stop Trizivir without your doctor\u2019s advice, as your hepatitis may come back) \n\u2022 if you are seriously overweight (especially if you are a woman) \n\nTalk to your doctor if any of these apply to you before using Trizivir. \nYou may need extra check-ups, including blood tests, while you are taking your medicine. See \nSection 4 for more information.  \n\n \nAbacavir hypersensitivity reactions \nEven patients who don\u2019t have the HLA-B*5701 gene may still develop a hypersensitivity reaction (a \nserious allergic reaction).Carefully read all the information about hypersensitivity reactions in \nSection 4 of this leaflet. \n \nRisk of heart attack \nIt cannot be excluded that abacavir may increase the risk of having a heart attack. \n\nTell your doctor if you have heart problems, if you smoke, or have other illnesses that may \nincrease your risk of heart disease such as high blood pressure, or diabetes. Do not stop taking \nTrizivir unless your doctor advises you to do so. \n\n \nLook out for important symptoms \nSome people taking Trizivir develop other conditions, which can be serious. You need to know about \nimportant signs and symptoms to look out for while you are taking Trizivir. \n\nRead the information \u2018Other possible side effects of Trizivir\u2019 in Section 4 of this leaflet. \n \nProtect other people \nHIV infection is spread by sexual contact with someone who has the infection, or by transfer of \ninfected blood (for example, by sharing injection needles). You can still pass on HIV when taking this \nmedicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your doctor the \nprecautions needed to avoid infecting other people. \n \nOther medicines and Trizivir \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, or if you have taken any \nrecently, including herbal medicines or other medicines you bought without a prescription.  \n\nRemember to tell your doctor or pharmacist if you begin taking a new medicine while you are taking \nTrizivir. \n \n \nThese medicines should not be used with Trizivir: \n\u2022 stavudine or emtricitabine, to treat HIV infection \n\n\n\n 42 \n\n\u2022 other medicinal products containing lamivudine, used to treat HIV infection or hepatitis B \ninfection \n\n\u2022 ribavirin or injections of ganciclovir to treat viral infections \n\u2022 high doses of co-trimoxazole, an antibiotic \n\u2022 cladribine, used to treat hairy cell leukaemia \n\nTell your doctor if you are being treated with any of these. \n \nSome medicines can make it more likely that you will have side effects, or make side \neffects worse  \n\nThese include: \n\u2022 sodium valproate, to treat epilepsy \n\u2022 interferon, to treat viral infections \n\u2022 pyrimethamine, to treat malaria and other parasitic infections \n\u2022 dapsone, to prevent pneumonia and treat skin infections \n\u2022 fluconazole or flucytosine, to treat fungal infections such as candida \n\u2022 pentamidine or atovaquone, to treat parasitic infections such as  Pneumocystis  jirovecii \n\npneumonia (often referred to as PCP)  \n\u2022 amphotericin or co-trimoxazole, to treat fungal and bacterial infections \n\u2022 probenecid, to treat gout and similar conditions, and given with some antibiotics to make them \n\nmore effective \n\u2022 methadone, used as a heroin substitute \n\u2022 vincristine, vinblastine or doxorubicin, to treat cancer \n\nTell your doctor if you\u2019re taking any of these. \n \nSome medicines interact with Trizivir \nThese include: \n\u2022 clarithromycin, an antibiotic \n\nIf you are taking clarithromycin, take your dose at least 2 hours before or after you take your \nTrizivir. \n\n\u2022 phenytoin, for treating epilepsy \nTell your doctor if you are taking phenytoin. Your doctor may need to monitor you while you \nare taking Trizivir. \n \n\n\u2022  medicines (usually liquids) containing sorbitol and other sugar alcohols (such as xylitol, \nmannitol, lactitol or maltitol), if taken regularly. \n\n             Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of these. \n \nMethadone and Trizivir \nAbacavir increases the rate at which methadone is removed from the body. If you are taking \nmethadone, you will be checked for any withdrawal symptoms. Your methadone dose may need to \nbe changed.  \n \nPregnancy \nIf you are pregnant, if you become pregnant or if you are planning to become pregnant, talk to \nyour doctor about the risks and benefits to you and your baby of taking Trizivir during your \npregnancy.  \nTrizivir and similar medicines may cause side effects in unborn babies.  \nIf you have taken Trizivir  during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and \nother diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child. In children whose mothers took \nNRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against HIV outweighed the risk of side \neffects. \n \nBreast-feeding \nWomen who are HIV-positive must not breast-feed, because HIV infection can be passed on to the \nbaby in breast milk. A small amount of the ingredients in Trizivir can also pass into your breast milk. \n\n\n\n 43 \n\nIf you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding: \nTalk to your doctor immediately. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \nTrizivir can make you dizzy and have other side effects that make you less alert. \nDon\u2019t drive or operate machines unless you\u2019re feeling well. \n \n3. How to take Trizivir  \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\nKeep in touch with your doctor, and do not stop taking Trizivir without your doctor\u2019s advice. \n \n\nHow much to take \nThe usual dose of Trizivir for adults is one tablet twice a day.  \n\nTake the tablets at regular times, leaving approximately 12 hours between each tablet. \n \nSwallow the tablets whole, with some water. Trizivir can be taken with or without food. \n \nIf you take more Trizivir than you should \nIf you accidentally take too much Trizivir, tell your doctor or your pharmacist, or contact your nearest \nhospital emergency department for further advice. \n \nIf you forget to take Trizivir \nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then continue your treatment as before.  \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.  \n \nIt is important to take Trizivir regularly, because if you take it at irregular intervals it may not continue \nto work against the HIV infection, and you may be more likely to have a hypersensitivity reaction. \n \nIf you have stopped taking Trizivir \nIf you have stopped taking Trizivir for any reason \u2014 especially because you think you are having side \neffects, or because you have other illness: \n\nTalk to your doctor before you start taking it again. Your doctor will check whether your \nsymptoms were related to a hypersensitivity reaction. If the doctor thinks they may have been \nrelated, you will be told never again to take Trizivir, or any other medicine containing \nabacavir (Kivexa,Triumeq or Ziagen). It is important that you follow this advice. \n\n \nIf your doctor advises that you can start taking Trizivir again, you may be asked to take your first \ndoses in a place where you will have ready access to medical care if you need it. \n \n4. Possible side effects  \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.  \n\n \n\nTreatment with Trizivir often causes a loss of fat from legs, arms and face (lipoatrophy). This loss of \nbody fat has been shown to be not fully reversible after discontinuation of zidovudine. Your doctor \nshould monitor for signs of lipoatrophy. Tell your doctor if you notice any loss of fat from your legs, \narms, and face. When these signs occur, Trizivir should be stopped and your HIV treatment changed. \n\n\n\n 44 \n\n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them. \n  \nWhen you are being treated for HIV, it can be hard to tell whether a symptom is a side effect of \nTrizivir or other medicines you are taking, or an effect of the HIV infection itself. So it is very \nimportant to talk to your doctor about any changes in your health. \n \nEven patients who don\u2019t have the HLA-B*5701 gene may still develop a hypersensitivity reaction (a \nserious allergic reaction), described in this leaflet in the panel headed \u2018Hypersensitivity reactions\u2019. \nIt is very important that you read and understand the information about this serious reaction. \n \nAs well as the side effects listed below for Trizivir, other conditions can develop during treatment.  \n\nIt is important to read the information on the other side of this leaflet under \u2018Other possible side \neffects of Trizivir\u2019. \n \n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n\nTrizivir contains abacavir (which is also an active substance in Kivexa, Triumeq and Ziagen). \nAbacavir can cause a serious allergic reaction known as a hypersensitivity reaction. These \nhypersensitivity reactions have been seen more frequently in people taking medicines that contain \nabacavir.  \nWho gets these reactions? \nAnyone taking Trizivir could develop a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, which could be life \nthreatening if they continue to take Trizivir. \n\nYou are more likely to develop such a reaction if you have a gene called HLA-B*5701 (but you can \nget a reaction even if you do not have this gene). You should have been tested for this gene before \nTrizivir was prescribed for you. If you know you have this gene, tell your doctor before you take \nTrizivir. \n \nAbout 3 to 4 in every 100 patients treated with abacavir in a clinical trial who did not have the HLA-\nB*5701 gene developed a hypersensitivity reaction. \n \nWhat are the symptoms? \nThe most common symptoms are: \n\u2022 fever (high temperature) and skin rash \nOther common symptoms are: \n\u2022 nausea (feeling sick), vomiting (being sick), diarrhoea, abdominal (stomach) pain, severe tiredness \nOther symptoms include: \nPains in the joints or muscles, swelling of the neck, shortness of breath, sore throat, cough, occasional \nheadaches, inflammation of the eye (conjunctivitis), mouth ulcers, low blood pressure, tingling or \nnumbness of the hands or feet. \n \n \nWhen do these reactions happen? \nHypersensitivity reactions can start at any time during treatment with Trizivir, but are more likely \nduring the first 6 weeks of treatment. \n \nContact your doctor immediately: \n1 if you get a skin rash, OR \n2 if you get symptoms from at least 2 of the following groups: \n - fever \n - shortness of breath, sore throat or cough \n - nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea or abdominal pain \n - severe tiredness or achiness, or generally feeling ill \n\n\n\n 45 \n\nYour doctor may advise you to stop taking Trizivir. \n \n\nIf you have stopped taking Trizivir \n\n      If you have stopped taking Trizivir because of a hypersensitivity reaction, you must NEVER \nAGAIN take Trizivir, or any other medicine containing abacavir (Kivexa, Triumeq or \nZiagen). If you do, within hours, your blood pressure could fall dangerously low, which could \nresult in death. \n\n \nIf you have stopped taking Trizivir for any reason \u2014 especially because you think you are having side \neffects, or because you have other illness: \n\n      Talk to your doctor before you start again. Your doctor will check whether your symptoms \nwere related to a hypersensitivity reaction. If the doctor thinks they may have been, you will then be \ntold never again to take Trizivir, or any other medicine containing abacavir (Kivexa, Triumeq \nor Ziagen). It is important that you follow this advice. \n \nOccasionally, hypersensitivity reactions have developed in people who start taking abacavir containing \nproducts again, but who had only one symptom on the Alert Card before they stopped taking it. \n \nVery rarely, patients who have taken medicines containing abacavir in the past without any symptoms \nof hypersensitivity have developed a hypersensitivity reaction when they start taking these medicines \nagain.  \n \nIf your doctor advises that you can start taking Trizivir again, you may be asked to take your first \ndoses in a place where you will have ready access to medical care if you need it. \n \nIf you are hypersensitive to Trizivir, return all your unused Trizivir tablets for safe disposal. \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice. \n\nThe Trizivir pack includes an Alert Card, to remind you and medical staff about hypersensitivity \nreactions. Detach this card and keep it with you at all times. \n \n\n \nVery common side effects \nThese may affect more than 1 in 10 people: \n\u2022 headache \n\u2022 feeling sick (nausea) \n \nCommon side effects \nThese may affect up to 1 in 10 people: \n\u2022 hypersensitivity reaction  \n\u2022 being sick (vomiting) \n\u2022 diarrhoea \n\u2022 stomach pains \n\u2022 loss of appetite \n\u2022 feeling dizzy \n\u2022 tiredness, lack of energy \n\u2022 fever (high temperature) \n\u2022 general feeling of being unwell \n\u2022 difficulty in sleeping (insomnia) \n\u2022 muscle pain and discomfort \n\u2022 joint pain \n\u2022 cough \n\u2022 irritated or runny nose \n\u2022 skin rash \n\n\n\n 46 \n\n\u2022 hair loss \nCommon side effects that may show up in blood tests are: \n\u2022 a low red blood cell count (anaemia) or low white blood cell count (neutropenia or leucopenia) \n\u2022 an increase in the level of liver enzymes \n\u2022 an increased amount in the blood of bilirubin (a substance produced in the liver) which may make \n\nyour skin appear yellow \n \nUncommon side effects \nThese may affect up to 1 in 100 people: \n\u2022 feeling breathless \n\u2022 wind (flatulence) \n\u2022 itching \n\u2022 muscle weakness \nAn uncommon side effect that may show up in blood tests is: \n\u2022 a decrease in the number of cells involved in blood clotting (thrombocytopenia), or in all kinds of \n\nblood cells (pancytopenia) \n \nRare side effects \nThese may affect up to 1 in 1000 people: \n\u2022 liver disorders, such as jaundice, enlarged liver or fatty liver, inflammation (hepatitis) \n\u2022 lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood ; see the next section, \u2018Other possible side effects of \n\nTrizivir\u2019) \n\u2022 inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) \n\u2022 chest pain; disease of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) \n\u2022 fits (convulsions) \n\u2022 feeling depressed or anxious, not being able to concentrate, feeling drowsy \n\u2022 indigestion, taste disturbance \n\u2022 changes in the colour of your nails, your skin, or the skin inside your mouth \n\u2022 a flu-like feeling \u2014 chills and sweating \n\u2022 tingly feelings in the skin (pins and needles) \n\u2022 sensation of weakness in the limbs \n\u2022 breakdown of muscle tissue \n\u2022 numbness \n\u2022 passing urine more often \n\u2022 enlarged breasts in men \nRare side effects that may show up in blood tests are: \n\u2022 increase in an enzyme called amylase \n\u2022 a failure of the bone marrow to produce new red blood cells (pure red cell aplasia) \n \nVery rare side effects \nThese may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people: \n\u2022 skin rash, which may form blisters and  looks like small targets (central dark spots surrounded by \n\na paler area, with a dark ring around the edge) (erythema multiforme) \n\u2022 a widespread rash with blisters and peeling skin, particularly around the mouth, nose, eyes and \n\ngenitals (Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome), and a more severe form causing skin peeling in more than \n30% of the body surface (toxic epidermal necrolysis) \n\nIf you notice any of these symptoms contact a doctor urgently. \n\nA very rare side effect that may show up in blood tests is: \n\uf09f a failure of the bone marrow to produce new red or white blood cells (aplastic anaemia) \n \n \n\nIf you get side effects \n\n\n\n 47 \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects gets severe or troublesome, or if you \nnotice any side effects not listed in this leaflet. \n\n \nOther possible side effects of Trizivir \n\nTrizivir may cause other conditions to develop during HIV treatment. \n \nSymptoms of infection and inflammation  \n\n \n\nOld infections may flare up \n\nPeople with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) have weak immune systems, and are more likely to \ndevelop serious infections (opportunistic infections). When these people start treatment, they may find \nthat old, hidden infections flare up, causing signs and symptoms of inflammation. These symptoms are \nprobably caused by the body\u2019s immune system becoming stronger, so that the body starts to fight these \ninfections. Symptoms usually include fever, plus some of the following: \n\n\u2022 headache \n\u2022 stomach ache \n\u2022 difficulty breathing \n\n \nIn rare cases, as the immune system becomes stronger, it can also attack healthy body tissue \n(autoimmune disorders).  The symptoms of autoimmune disorders may develop many months after \nyou start taking medicine to treat your HIV infection. Symptoms may include: \n\n\u2022 palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat) or tremor \n\u2022 hyperactivity (excessive restlessness and movement) \n\u2022 weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body \n\n \n \nIf you get any symptoms of infection while you\u2019re taking Trizivir: \n\nTell your doctor immediately. Do not take other medicines for the infection without your \ndoctor\u2019s advice. \n\n \nLactic acidosis is a rare but serious side effect \n\nSome people taking Trizivir develop a condition called lactic acidosis, together with an enlarged liver.  \n \nLactic acidosis is caused by a build-up of lactic acid in the body. It is rare; if it happens, it usually \ndevelops after a few months of treatment. It can be life-threatening, causing failure of internal organs. \n \nLactic acidosis is more likely to develop in people who have liver disease, or in obese (very \noverweight) people, especially women. \n\nSigns of lactic acidosis include: \n\u2022 feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) \n\u2022 stomach pain \n\u2022 generally feeling unwell \n\u2022 loss of appetite, weight loss \n\u2022 deep, rapid, difficult breathing \n\u2022 numbness or weakness in the limbs \nDuring your treatment, your doctor will monitor you for signs of lactic acidosis. If you have any of the \nsymptoms listed above or any other symptoms that worry you: \n\nSee your doctor as soon as possible. \n \nYou may have problems with your bones \n\n\n\n 48 \n\nSome people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With this \ncondition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. People may be \nmore likely to get this condition: \n\u2022 if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time \n\u2022 if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids \n\u2022 if they drink alcohol \n\u2022 if their immune systems are very weak \n\u2022 if they are overweight \nSigns of osteonecrosis include: \n\u2022 stiffness in the joints \n\u2022 aches and pains (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) \n\u2022 difficulty moving \nIf you notice any of these symptoms: \n\nTell your doctor. \n \nOther effects may show up in blood tests \n\nTrizivir can also cause: \n\u2022 increased levels of lactic acid in the blood, which on rare occasions can lead to lactic acidosis \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n5.

contains three active ingredients that are used to treat hiv infection: abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine. all of these belong to a group of anti-retroviral medicines called nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nrtis). trizivir helps to control your condition. trizivir does not cure hiv infection; it reduces the amount of virus in your body, and keeps it at a low level. this helps your body to increase the cd4 cell count in your blood. cd4 cells are a type of white blood cell that are important in helping your body to fight infection. not everyone responds to treatment with trizivir in the same way. your doctor will monitor the effectiveness of your treatment.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "trizivir", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0},

this is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the hiv medicines themselves. your doctor will test for these changes. treatment with trizivir often causes a loss of fat from legs, arms and face (lipoatrophy). this loss of body fat has been shown to be not fully reversible after discontinuation of zidovudine. your doctor should monitor for signs of lipoatrophy. tell your doctor if you notice any loss of fat from your legs, arms, and face. when these signs occur, trizivir should be stopped and your hiv treatment changed. like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them. when you are being treated for hiv, it can be hard to tell whether a symptom is a side effect of trizivir or other medicines you are taking, or an effect of the hiv infection itself. so it is very important to talk to your doctor about any changes in your health. even patients who don't have the hla-b*5701 gene may still develop a hypersensitivity reaction (a serious allergic reaction), described in this leaflet in the panel headed 'hypersensitivity reactions'. it is very important that you read and understand the information about this serious reaction. as well as the side effects listed below for trizivir, other conditions can develop during treatment. it is important to read the information on the other side of this leaflet under 'other possible side effects of trizivir'. hypersensitivity reactions trizivir contains abacavir (which is also an active substance in kivexa, triumeq and ziagen). abacavir can cause a serious allergic reaction known as a hypersensitivity reaction. these hypersensitivity reactions have been seen more frequently in people taking medicines that contain abacavir. who gets these reactions? anyone taking trizivir could develop a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, which could be life threatening if they continue to take trizivir. you are more likely to develop such a reaction if you have a gene called hla-b*5701 (but you can get a reaction even if you do not have this gene). you should have been tested for this gene before trizivir was prescribed for you. if you know you have this gene, tell your doctor before you take trizivir. about 3 to 4 in every 100 patients treated with abacavir in a clinical trial who did not have the hla- b*5701 gene developed a hypersensitivity reaction. what are the symptoms? the most common symptoms are: fever (high temperature) and skin rash other common symptoms are: nausea (feeling sick), vomiting (being sick), diarrhoea, abdominal (stomach) pain, severe tiredness other symptoms include: pains in the joints or muscles, swelling of the neck, shortness of breath, sore throat, cough, occasional headaches, inflammation of the eye (conjunctivitis), mouth ulcers, low blood pressure, tingling or numbness of the hands or feet. when do these reactions happen? hypersensitivity reactions can start at any time during treatment with trizivir, but are more likely during the first 6 weeks of treatment. contact your doctor immediately: 1 if you get a skin rash, or 2 if you get symptoms from at least 2 of the following groups: - fever - shortness of breath, sore throat or cough - nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea or abdominal pain - severe tiredness or achiness, or generally feeling ill 45 your doctor may advise you to stop taking trizivir. if you have stopped taking trizivir if you have stopped taking trizivir because of a hypersensitivity reaction, you must never again take trizivir, or any other medicine containing abacavir (kivexa, triumeq or ziagen). if you do, within hours, your blood pressure could fall dangerously low, which could result in death. if you have stopped taking trizivir for any reason \u2014 especially because you think you are having side effects, or because you have other illness: talk to your doctor before you start again. your doctor will check whether your symptoms were related to a hypersensitivity reaction. if the doctor thinks they may have been, you will then be told never again to take trizivir, or any other medicine containing abacavir (kivexa, triumeq or ziagen). it is important that you follow this advice. occasionally, hypersensitivity reactions have developed in people who start taking abacavir containing products again, but who had only one symptom on the alert card before they stopped taking it. very rarely, patients who have taken medicines containing abacavir in the past without any symptoms of hypersensitivity have developed a hypersensitivity reaction when they start taking these medicines again. if your doctor advises that you can start taking trizivir again, you may be asked to take your first doses in a place where you will have ready access to medical care if you need it. if you are hypersensitive to trizivir, return all your unused trizivir tablets for safe disposal. ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. the trizivir pack includes an alert card, to remind you and medical staff about hypersensitivity reactions. detach this card and keep it with you at all times. very common side effects these may affect more than 1 in 10 people: headache feeling sick (nausea) common side effects these may affect up to 1 in 10 people: hypersensitivity reaction being sick (vomiting) diarrhoea stomach pains loss of appetite feeling dizzy tiredness, lack of energy fever (high temperature) general feeling of being unwell difficulty in sleeping (insomnia) muscle pain and discomfort joint pain cough irritated or runny nose skin rash 46 hair loss common side effects that may show up in blood tests are: a low red blood cell count (anaemia) or low white blood cell count (neutropenia or leucopenia) an increase in the level of liver enzymes an increased amount in the blood of bilirubin (a substance produced in the liver) which may make your skin appear yellow uncommon side effects these may affect up to 1 in 100 people: feeling breathless wind (flatulence) itching muscle weakness an uncommon side effect that may show up in blood tests is: a decrease in the number of cells involved in blood clotting (thrombocytopenia), or in all kinds of blood cells (pancytopenia) rare side effects these may affect up to 1 in 1000 people: liver disorders, such as jaundice, enlarged liver or fatty liver, inflammation (hepatitis) lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood ; see the next section, 'other possible side effects of trizivir') inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) chest pain; disease of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) fits (convulsions) feeling depressed or anxious, not being able to concentrate, feeling drowsy indigestion, taste disturbance changes in the colour of your nails, your skin, or the skin inside your mouth a flu-like feeling \u2014 chills and sweating tingly feelings in the skin (pins and needles) sensation of weakness in the limbs breakdown of muscle tissue numbness passing urine more often enlarged breasts in men rare side effects that may show up in blood tests are: increase in an enzyme called amylase a failure of the bone marrow to produce new red blood cells (pure red cell aplasia) very rare side effects these may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people: skin rash, which may form blisters and looks like small targets (central dark spots surrounded by a paler area, with a dark ring around the edge) (erythema multiforme) a widespread rash with blisters and peeling skin, particularly around the mouth, nose, eyes and genitals (stevensjohnson syndrome), and a more severe form causing skin peeling in more than 30% of the body surface (toxic epidermal necrolysis) if you notice any of these symptoms contact a doctor urgently. a very rare side effect that may show up in blood tests is: a failure of the bone marrow to produce new red or white blood cells (aplastic anaemia) if you get side effects 47 tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects gets severe or troublesome, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet. other possible side effects of trizivir trizivir may cause other conditions to develop during hiv treatment. symptoms of infection and inflammation old infections may flare up people with advanced hiv infection (aids) have weak immune systems, and are more likely to develop serious infections (opportunistic infections). when these people start treatment, they may find that old, hidden infections flare up, causing signs and symptoms of inflammation. these symptoms are probably caused by the body's immune system becoming stronger, so that the body starts to fight these infections. symptoms usually include fever, plus some of the following: headache stomach ache difficulty breathing in rare cases, as the immune system becomes stronger, it can also attack healthy body tissue (autoimmune disorders). the symptoms of autoimmune disorders may develop many months after you start taking medicine to treat your hiv infection. symptoms may include: palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat) or tremor hyperactivity (excessive restlessness and movement) weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body if you get any symptoms of infection while you're taking trizivir: tell your doctor immediately. do not take other medicines for the infection without your doctor's advice. lactic acidosis is a rare but serious side effect some people taking trizivir develop a condition called lactic acidosis, together with an enlarged liver. lactic acidosis is caused by a build-up of lactic acid in the body. it is rare; if it happens, it usually develops after a few months of treatment. it can be life-threatening, causing failure of internal organs. lactic acidosis is more likely to develop in people who have liver disease, or in obese (very overweight) people, especially women. signs of lactic acidosis include: feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) stomach pain generally feeling unwell loss of appetite, weight loss deep, rapid, difficult breathing numbness or weakness in the limbs during your treatment, your doctor will monitor you for signs of lactic acidosis. if you have any of the symptoms listed above or any other symptoms that worry you: see your doctor as soon as possible. you may have problems with your bones 48 some people taking combination therapy for hiv develop a condition called osteonecrosis. with this condition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. people may be more likely to get this condition: if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids if they drink alcohol if their
