NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nSebivo 600 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 600 mg telbivudine. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nFilm-coated tablet \n\n \n\nWhite to slightly yellowish, oval film-coated tablet, imprinted with “LDT” on one side. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nSebivo is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adult patients with compensated liver \n\ndisease and evidence of viral replication, persistently elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \n\nlevels and histological evidence of active inflammation and/or fibrosis. \n\n \n\nInitiation of Sebivo treatment should only be considered when the use of an alternative antiviral agent \n\nwith a higher genetic barrier to resistance is not available or appropriate. \n \n\nSee section 5.1 for details of the study and specific patient characteristics on which this indication is \n\nbased. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTherapy must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of chronic hepatitis B \n\ninfection. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nAdults \n\nThe recommended dose of Sebivo is 600 mg (one tablet) once daily. \n\n \n\nSebivo oral solution may be considered for patients who have difficulties swallowing tablets. \n\n \n\nMonitoring during treatment \n\nOn-treatment response at week 24 has been shown to be predictive of longer-term response (see \n\nTable 7 in section 5.1). HBV DNA levels should be monitored at 24 weeks of treatment to assure \n\ncomplete viral suppression (HBV DNA less than 300 copies/ml). For patients with detectable HBV \n\nDNA after 24 weeks of therapy, treatment modification should be considered. \n\n \n\nHBV DNA should be monitored every 6 months to assure continued response. If patients test positive \n\nfor HBV DNA at any time after their initial response, treatment modification should be considered. \n\nOptimal therapy should be guided by resistance testing. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nDuration of therapy \n\nThe optimal treatment duration is unknown. Treatment discontinuation should be considered as \n\nfollows: \n\n In HBeAg-positive patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be administered for at least \n6-12 months after HBeAg seroconversion (HBeAg loss and HBV DNA loss with anti-HBe \n\ndetection) is confirmed or until HBsAg seroconversion or there is evidence of loss of efficacy. \n\nSerum ALT and HBV DNA levels should be followed regularly after treatment discontinuation \n\nto detect any late virological relapse. \n\n In HBeAg-negative patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be administered at least until \nHBsAg seroconversion or until there is evidence of loss of efficacy. With prolonged treatment \n\nfor more than 2 years, regular reassessment is recommended to confirm that continuation of the \n\nselected therapy remains appropriate for the patient. \n\n \n\nMissed doses \n\nIf a dose is missed, the patient may take the missed dose only up to 4 hours prior to the next scheduled \n\ndose. The next dose should be taken at the usual time. \n\n \n\nElderly (age above 65 years) \n\nNo data are available to support a specific dose recommendation for patients over the age of 65 years \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the recommended dose of telbivudine is necessary in patients whose creatinine \n\nclearance is  50 ml/min. Adjustment of the dose is required in patients with creatinine clearance \n\n< 50 ml/min, including those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis. A reduction of \n\nthe daily dose using Sebivo oral solution, as detailed in Table 1 below, is recommended. If use of the \n\noral solution is not possible, Sebivo film-coated tablets could be used as an alternative and dosing \n\nshould be adjusted by increasing the time interval between doses, as detailed in Table 1. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Dosing regimen adjustment of Sebivo in patients with renal impairment \n\n \n\nCreatinine clearance \n\n(ml/min) \n\nTelbivudine 20 mg/ml oral \n\nsolution \n\nDaily dose adjustment \n\nTelbivudine 600 mg film-coated \n\ntablet \n\nAlternative** dose adjustment with \n\nincreased dose intervals \n\n 50 600 mg (30 ml) once daily 600 mg once daily \n\n30-49 400 mg (20 ml) once daily 600 mg once every 48 hours \n\n< 30 (not requiring \n\ndialysis) \n\n200 mg (10 ml) once daily 600 mg once every 72 hours \n\nESRD* 120 mg (6 ml) once daily 600 mg once every 96 hours \n\n* End stage renal disease \n\n** In case use of the oral solution is not possible \n\n \n\nThe proposed dose modifications are based on extrapolation and may not be optimal. The safety and \n\neffectiveness of these dosing adjustment guidelines have not been clinically evaluated. Therefore, \n\nclose clinical monitoring is recommended in these patients. \n\n \n\nEnd-stage renal disease patients \n\nFor patients with ESRD, Sebivo should be administered after haemodialysis (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo adjustment to the recommended dose of Sebivo is necessary in patients with hepatic impairment \n\n(see section 5.2). \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Sebivo in the paediatric population have not yet been established. No data \n\nare available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nSebivo is to be taken orally, with or without food. The tablet should not be chewed, split or crushed. \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nCombination of telbivudine with pegylated or standard interferon alfa (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nSevere acute exacerbations of chronic hepatitis B are relatively frequent, and are characterised by \n\ntransient elevation of serum ALT. Following initiation of antiviral treatment, serum ALT may rise in \n\nsome patients while serum levels of HBV DNA fall (see section 4.8). On average, 4-5 weeks elapsed \n\nprior to the occurrence of an exacerbation in patients treated with telbivudine. Overall, ALT flares \n\noccurred more frequently in HBeAg-positive patients than in HBeAg-negative patients. In patients \n\nwith compensated liver disease, this elevation of serum ALT is generally not accompanied by elevated \n\nlevels of serum bilirubin or by other signs of hepatic decompensation. The risk of hepatic \n\ndecompensation – and of a subsequent exacerbation of hepatitis – may be elevated in patients with \n\ncirrhosis. Such patients should, therefore, be closely monitored. \n\n \n\nExacerbations of hepatitis have also been reported in patients who have terminated treatment of \n\nhepatitis B. Post-treatment ALT flares are normally associated with increases in serum HBV DNA \n\nlevels, and the majority of such cases have proven to be self-limiting. Nonetheless, there have also \n\nbeen reports of severe – and sometimes fatal – post-treatment disease exacerbations. Therefore, \n\nhepatic function should be monitored at regular intervals with both clinical and laboratory follow-up \n\nfor at least 6 months after discontinuation of hepatitis B therapy. \n\n \n\nLactic acidosis \n\n \n\nRare post-marketing cases of lactic acidosis have been reported with telbivudine. Cases were more \n\noften secondary to other serious conditions (e.g. rhabdomyolysis) and/or associated with \n\nmuscle-related events (e.g. myopathy, myositis). When secondary to other conditions, some cases \n\nwere also associated with pancreatitis, liver failure/hepatic steatosis and renal failure. In some cases, \n\nfatal outcomes were reported when lactic acidosis was secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Patients should \n\nbe followed closely. \n\n \n\nTreatment with telbivudine should be discontinued when metabolic/lactic acidosis of unknown \n\naetiology occurs. Benign digestive symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, may be \n\nindicative of lactic acidosis development. \n\n \n\nMuscular effects \n\n \n\nCases of myopathy and myalgia have been reported with telbivudine use several weeks to months after \n\nstarting therapy (see section 4.8). Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported during post-marketing \n\nuse of telbivudine (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nMyopathy, defined as persistent unexplained muscle aches and/or muscle weakness regardless of the \n\ndegree of increases in creatine kinase (CK) levels, should be considered in any patient with diffuse \n\nunexplained myalgias, muscle tenderness, muscle weakness or myositis (defined as myopathy with \n\nhistological evidence of muscle damage). Patients should be advised to report promptly any persistent \n\nunexplained muscle aches, pain, tenderness or weakness. If any of these symptoms are reported, a \n\ndetailed muscle examination should be performed in order to evaluate muscle function. Telbivudine \n\ntherapy should be discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed. \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether the risk of myopathy during treatment with telbivudine is increased with \n\nconcurrent administration of other medicinal products associated with myopathy (e.g. statins, fibrates, \n\nor ciclosporin). Physicians considering concomitant treatment with other agents associated with \n\nmyopathy should weigh carefully the potential benefits and risks and should monitor patients for any \n\nsigns or symptoms suggestive of myopathy. \n\n \n\nPeripheral neuropathy \n\n \n\nPeripheral neuropathy has been uncommonly reported in telbivudine-treated patients. If peripheral \n\nneuropathy is suspected, treatment with telbivudine should be reconsidered (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nAn increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy has been observed in one study when \n\ntelbivudine and pegylated interferon alfa-2a were co-administered (see section 4.5). Such increased \n\nrisk cannot be excluded for other interferon alfa (pegylated or standard). Moreover, the benefit of the \n\ncombination of telbivudine with interferon alfa (pegylated or standard) is not currently established. \n\nTherefore, the combination of telbivudine with pegylated or standard interferon alfa is contraindicated \n\n(see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nRenal function \n\n \n\nTelbivudine is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, therefore dose interval adjustment is \n\nrecommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min, including patients on haemodialysis. \n\nThe effectiveness of dosing interval adjustment has not been clinically evaluated. Therefore, \n\nvirological response should be closely monitored in patients with increased dosage interval (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nPatients with cirrhosis without decompensation \n\n \n\nDue to the limited data available (about 3% of patients enrolled had cirrhosis), telbivudine should be \n\nused with particular caution in cirrhotic patients. These patients should be closely monitored for \n\nclinical, biochemical and virological parameters associated with hepatitis B during treatment and after \n\ntreatment is discontinued. \n\n \n\nPatients with cirrhosis with decompensation \n\n \n\nThere are no adequate efficacy and safety data in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. \n\n \n\nPatients with previous exposure to nucleoside/nucleotide analogues \n\n \n\nIn vitro, telbivudine was not active against the HBV strains containing rtM204V/rtL180M or rtM204I \n\nmutations (see section 5.1). Telbivudine monotherapy is not an option for patients with established \n\nlamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus infection. Patients who failed to achieve virological response \n\nfollowing treatment with lamivudine for more than 24 weeks are unlikely to benefit from telbivudine \n\nmonotherapy. There is currently no clinical data to properly assess the benefit and risk of switching to \n\ntelbivudine for lamivudine-treated patients who achieve complete viral suppression on lamivudine. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nThere are no data on telbivudine treatment in patients with established adefovir-resistant hepatitis B \n\nvirus single mutations of rtN236T or A181V. Results from cell-based assays showed that the adefovir \n\nresistance-associated substitution A181V had 1.5- to approximately 4-fold reduced susceptibility to \n\ntelbivudine. \n\n \n\nLiver transplant recipients \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of telbivudine in liver transplant recipients are unknown. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nClinical studies of telbivudine did not include sufficient numbers of patients  65 years of age to \n\ndetermine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, caution must be \n\nexercised when prescribing Sebivo to older patients in view of the greater frequency of decreased \n\nrenal function due to concomitant disease or concomitant use of other medicinal products. \n\n \n\nOther special populations \n\n \n\nSebivo has not been investigated in co-infected hepatitis B patients (e.g. patients co-infected with \n\nhuman immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hepatitis C virus [HCV] or hepatitis D virus [HDV]). \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\n \n\nPatients should be advised that treatment with Sebivo has not been shown to reduce the risk of \n\ntransmission of HBV to others through sexual contact or blood contamination. \n\n \n\nTelbivudine is not recommended to be used with lamivudine because in a phase II study, the treatment \n\nresponse observed with combination therapy of telbivudine and lamivudine was lower than with \n\ntelbivudine alone. \n\n \nThere are currently no efficacy and safety data for other antiviral combinations with telbivudine. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nSince telbivudine is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, co-administration of Sebivo with \n\nsubstances that affect renal function (such as aminoglycosides, loop diuretics, platinum compounds, \n\nvancomycin, amphotericin B) may affect plasma concentrations of telbivudine and/or the co-\n\nadministered substance. The combination of telbivudine with these medicinal products should be used \n\nwith caution. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of telbivudine were unaltered following multiple dose \n\nadministration in combination with lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, \n\nciclosporin or pegylated interferon alfa-2a. In addition, telbivudine does not alter the pharmacokinetics \n\nof lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or ciclosporin. No definitive \n\nconclusion could be drawn regarding the effects of telbivudine on the pharmacokinetics of pegylated \n\ninterferon due to high interindividual variability of pegylated interferon alfa-2a concentrations. A \n\nclinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon \n\nalfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination \n\nis associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism behind these \n\nevents is not known (see section 4.4). The combination of telbivudine with any interferon alfa-\n\ncontaining product is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \nTelbivudine is not a substrate, inhibitor or inducer of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system \n\n(see section 5.2). Therefore, the potential for CYP450-mediated drug interactions involving Sebivo is \n\nlow. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \n\ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). Studies in pregnant rats and \n\nrabbits showed that telbivudine crosses the placenta. Studies in pregnant rabbits showed early delivery \n\nand/or abortion secondary to maternal toxicity. \n\n \n\nLimited clinical data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) after exposure to telbivudine during the first \n\ntrimester of pregnancy indicate no malformative toxicity and a large amount of data (more than 1000 \n\npregnancy outcomes) after exposure during the second and third trimesters indicate no foetal/neonatal \n\ntoxicity. \n\n \n\nSebivo should be used during pregnancy only if the benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk \n\nto the foetus. \n\n \n\nLiterature shows that exposure to telbivudine in the second and/or third trimester of pregnancy has \n\nbeen shown to reduce the risk of HBV transmission from mother to infant if telbivudine is given in \n\naddition to Hepatitis B immune globulin and Hepatitis B vaccine. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nTelbivudine is excreted in the milk of rats. It is not known whether telbivudine is excreted in human \n\nmilk. Women should not breastfeed if they are taking Sebivo. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no clinical data on the effects of telbivudine on male or female fertility. In reproductive \n\ntoxicology studies in adult animals, fertility was slightly reduced when both male and female rats \n\nreceived telbivudine. The adverse effects on fertility were greater in a separate study in juvenile \n\nanimals when both sexes received telbivudine (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nSebivo has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nAssessment of adverse reactions is mainly based on two studies, NV-02B-007 (GLOBE) and NV-02B-\n\n015, in which 1,699 patients with chronic hepatitis B received double-blind treatment with telbivudine \n\n600 mg/day (n = 847) or lamivudine (n = 852) for 104 weeks. \n\n \n\nIn the 104-week clinical studies, reported adverse reactions were usually classified as mild or \n\nmoderate in severity. The most common adverse reactions were grade 3 or 4 blood creatine kinase \n\nelevations (6.8%), fatigue (4.4%), headache (3.0%) and nausea (2.6%). \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nTable 2 lists the adverse reactions according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency using the \n\nfollowing convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n\n<1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the \n\navailable data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of \n\ndecreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nTable 2 Adverse reactions \n\n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders  \n\n Rare* Lactic acidosis \n\nNervous system disorders  \n\n Common Dizziness, headache \n\n Uncommon Peripheral neuropathy, dysgeusia, hypoaesthesia, \n\nparesthesia, sciatica \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \n\ndisorders \n\n \n\n Common Cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  \n\n Common Diarrhoea, blood lipase increased, nausea, \n\nabdominal pain \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  \n\n Common Rash \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \n\ndisorders \n\n \n\n Uncommon Myopathy/myositis, arthralgia, myalgia, pain in \n\nthe extremities, back pain, muscle spasm, neck \n\npain, flank pain \n\n Rare* Rhabdomyolysis \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \n\nconditions \n\n \n\n Common Fatigue \n\n Uncommon Malaise \n\nInvestigations  \n\n Common Blood creatine phosphokinase increased, blood \n\nalanine aminotransferase increased, blood \n\namylase increased \n\n Uncommon Aspartate aminotransferase increased \n\n* This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not observed in \n\ncontrolled clinical trials.

It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \nThere is no information on intentional overdose of telbivudine, but one subject was given an \n\nunintentional overdose which was asymptomatic. Tested doses up to 1,800 mg/day, three times greater \n\nthan the recommended daily dose, have been well tolerated. A maximum tolerated dose of telbivudine \n\nhas not been determined. In the event of an overdose, Sebivo should be discontinued and appropriate \n\ngeneral supportive treatment applied as necessary. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, nucleoside and nucleotide reverse \n\ntranscriptase inhibitors, ATC code: J05AF11 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nTelbivudine is a synthetic thymidine nucleoside analogue with activity against HBV DNA \n\npolymerase. It is efficiently phosphorylated by cellular kinases to the active triphosphate form, which \n\nhas an intracellular half-life of 14 hours. Telbivudine-5'-triphosphate inhibits HBV DNA polymerase \n\n(reverse transcriptase) by competing with the natural substrate, thymidine 5'-triphosphate. \n\nIncorporation of telbivudine-5'-triphosphate into viral DNA causes DNA chain termination, resulting \n\nin inhibition of HBV replication. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nTelbivudine is an inhibitor of both HBV first strand (EC50 = 0.4-1.3 M) and second strand \n\n(EC50 = 0.12-0.24 M) synthesis, and shows a distinct preference for inhibiting second strand \n\nproduction. By contrast, telbivudine-5'-triphosphate at concentrations up to 100 M did not inhibit \n\ncellular DNA polymerases , , or . In assays relating to mitochondrial structure, function and DNA \n\ncontent, telbivudine lacked appreciable toxic effect at concentrations up to at 10 M and did not \n\nincrease lactic acid production in vitro. \n\n \n\nThe in vitro antiviral activity of telbivudine was assessed in the HBV-expressing human hepatoma cell \n\nline 2.2.15. The concentration of telbivudine that effectively inhibited 50% of viral synthesis (EC50) \n\nwas approximately 0.2 M. The antiviral activity of telbivudine is specific to the hepatitis B virus and \n\nrelated hepadnaviruses. Telbivudine was not active against HIV in vitro. The absence of activity of \n\ntelbivudine against HIV has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Transient reductions in HIV-1 RNA \n\nhave been reported in a small number of patients after administration of telbivudine in the absence of \n\nantiretroviral therapy. The clinical significance of these reductions has not been determined. \n\n \n\nClinical experience \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of long-term (104 weeks) Sebivo treatment were evaluated in two active-\n\ncontrolled clinical studies that included 1,699 patients with chronic hepatitis B (NV-02B-007 \n\n(GLOBE) and NV-02B-015). \n\n \n\nStudy NV-02B-007 (GLOBE) \n\nThe NV-02B-007 (GLOBE) study is a randomised, double-blind, multinational phase III study of \n\ntelbivudine compared to lamivudine for a treatment period of 104 weeks in 1,367 nucleoside-naïve \n\nchronic hepatitis B HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients. The majority of the population \n\nenrolled was Asian. The most common HBV genotypes were B (26%) and C (51%). A small number \n\n(total of 98) of Caucasian patients were treated with telbivudine. The primary data analysis was \n\nconducted after all patients had reached week 52. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nHBeAg-positive patients: The mean age of patients was 32 years, 74% were male, 82% were Asian, \n\n12% were Caucasian, and 6% had previously received alfa-interferon therapy. \n\n \n\nHBeAg-negative patients: The mean age of patients was 43 years, 79% were male, 65% were Asian, \n\n23% were Caucasian, and 11% had previously received alfa-interferon therapy. \n\n \n\nClinical results at week 52 \n\nClinical and virological efficacy endpoints were evaluated separately in the HBeAg-positive and \n\nHBeAg-negative patient populations. The primary endpoint of therapeutic response was a composite \n\nserological endpoint requiring suppression of HBV DNA to < 5 log10 copies/ml in conjunction with \n\neither loss of serum HBeAg or ALT normalised. Secondary endpoints included histological response, \n\nALT normalisation, and various measures of antiviral efficacy. \n\n \n\nRegardless of baseline characteristics, the majority of patients taking Sebivo showed histological, \n\nvirological, biochemical, and serological responses to treatment. Baseline ALT levels > 2x ULN and \n\nbaseline HBV DNA < 9 log10 copies/ml were associated with higher rates of HBeAg seroconversion in \n\nHBeAg-positive patients. Patients who achieve HBV DNA levels < 3 log10 copies/ml by week 24 had \n\noptimal responses to treatment; conversely patients with HBV DNA levels > 4 log10 copies/ml at \n\n24 weeks had less favourable outcomes at week 52. \n\n \n\nIn HBeAg-positive patients, telbivudine was superior to lamivudine in therapeutic response (75.3% vs \n\n67.0% responders; p = 0.0047). In HBeAg-negative patients, telbivudine was non-inferior to \n\nlamivudine (75.2% and 77.2% responders; p = 0.6187). Caucasian ethnicity was associated with lower \n\ntreatment response to both antiviral agents used in the NV-02B-007 (GLOBE) study; however the \n\nCaucasian patient population was very limited (n = 98). \n\n \n\nAt week 24, 203 HBeAg-positive and 177 HBeAg-negative subjects achieved non-detectable HBV \n\nDNA levels. Of those HBeAg-positive subjects, 95% achieved non-detectable HBV DNA, 39% \n\nachieved HBeAg seroconversion, 90% achieved ALT normalisation at week 52 and 0.5% exhibited \n\nresistance at week 48. Similarly of those HBeAg-negative subjects, 96% achieved non-detectable \n\nHBV DNA, 79% achieved ALT normalisation at week 52 and 0% exhibited resistance at week 48. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nSelected virological, biochemical and serological outcome measures are shown in Table 5 and \n\nhistological response in Table 6. \n\n \n\nTable 5 Virological, biochemical and serological endpoints at week 52 in NV-02B-007 \n\n(GLOBE) study \n\n \n\n \n\nResponse parameter  \n\nHBeAg-positive (n = 921) HBeAg-negative (n = 446) \n\nTelbivudine \n\n600 mg \n\n(n = 458) \n\nLamivudine \n\n100 mg \n\n(n = 463) \n\nTelbivudine \n\n600 mg \n\n(n = 222) \n\nLamivudine \n\n100 mg \n\n(n = 224) \n\nMean HBV DNA \n\nreduction from \n\nbaseline (log10 \n\ncopies/ml) ± SEM\n1,2,3 \n\n-6.45 (0.11)\n \n* -5.54 (0.11) -5.23 (0.13)\n\n \n* -4.40 (0.13) \n\n% Patients HBV \n\nDNA undetectable by \n\nPCR \n\n60%* 40% 88%* 71% \n\nALT normalisation\n4 \n\n77% 75% 74% 79% \n\nHBeAg \n\nseroconversion\n4 \n\n23% 22% - - \n\nHBeAg loss\n5 \n\n26% 23% - - \n1\n SEM: Standard error of mean \n\n2\n Roche COBAS Amplicor\n\n®\n PCR Assay (lower limit of quantification  300 copies/ml). \n\n3\n HBeAg-positive n = 443 and 444, HBeAg-negative n = 219 and 219, for both telbivudine and \n\nlamivudine groups, respectively.

Moreover, in \n\nthe subgroup of patients with baseline ALT levels ≥ 2x ULN (320), a significantly higher proportion \n\nof telbivudine patients than lamivudine patients achieved HBeAg seroconversions at week 104 (36% \n\nvs 28%, respectively). \n\n \n\nAmong HBeAg-negative patients, differences in therapeutic response (78% vs 66%) and key \n\nsecondary endpoints (mean log10 HBV DNA reduction: -5.00 vs -4.17, and HBV DNA undetectability: \n\n82% vs 57%; p < 0.0001) were higher for telbivudine up to week 104.

Knodell necroinflammatory score ≤ 3 (no \n\nor minimal necroinflammation) was observed in 98.2% (56/57) of patients. \n\n The mean Ishak score of 2.2 (SD 1.1) at baseline improved (p < 0.0001) to 0.9 (SD 1.0) with a \nmean change of -1.3 (SD 1.3). Ishak fibrosis score ≤ 1 (no or minimal fibrosis) was observed in \n\n84.2% (48/57) of patients. \n\nChanges in Knodell necroinflammatory and Ishak scores were similar for HBeAg-positive and \n\nHBeAg-negative patients. \n\n \n\nCLDT600A2303 - Off-treatment durability of HBeAg responses \n\nStudy CLDT600A2303 included HBeAg-positive patients from studies NV-02B-007 (GLOBE) or \n\nNV-02B-015 for off-treatment follow up. These patients had completed ≥ 52 weeks of telbivudine \n\ntreatment, and had exhibited HBeAg loss for ≥ 24 weeks with HBV DNA < 5 log10 copies/ml at the \n\nlast on-treatment visit. The median treatment duration was 104 weeks. After a median off-treatment \n\nfollow-up period of 120 weeks, the majority of HBeAg-positive telbivudine treated-patients showed \n\nsustained HBeAg loss (83.3%; 25/30), and sustained HBeAg seroconversion (79.2%; 19/24). Patients \n\nwith sustained HBeAg seroconversion had a mean HBV DNA of 3.3 log10 copies/ml; and 73.7% had \n\nHBV DNA < 4 log10 copies/ml. \n\n \nClinical resistance \n\n \n\nGenotypic resistance test was performed in study NV-02B-007 (GLOBE; n = 680) in patients with \n\nvirological rebound (confirmed increase of ≥ 1 log10 copies/ml HBV DNA from nadir). \n\n \n\nAt week 48 among HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients, 5% (23/458) and 2% (5/222), \n\nrespectively, had virological rebound with detectable HBV resistance mutations. \n\n \n\nStudies NV-02B-007 (GLOBE) and CLDT600A2303 - cumulative genotypic resistance rates \n\nThe original analysis for cumulative genotypic resistance at week 104 and 208 was based on the ITT \n\npopulation and included all patients who continued treatment until 4 years, regardless of HBV DNA \n\nlevels. Out of the 680 telbivudine-treated patients initially included in the pivotal study NV-02B-007 \n\n(GLOBE), 517 (76%) enrolled into study CLDT600A2303 for continued telbivudine treatment for up \n\nto 208 weeks. Out of these 517 patients 159 patients (HBeAg-positive=135, HBeAg-negative=24) had \n\ndetectable HBV DNA. \n\n \n\nThe cumulative genotypic rates by week 104 were 25.1% (115/458) for HBeAg-positive patients and \n\n10.8% (24/222) for HBeAg-negative patients. \n\n \n\nIn the overall ITT population the cumulative resistance rates at year 4 for HBeAg-positive and \n\nHBeAg-negative patients, was 40.8% (131/321) and 18.9% (37/196), respectively. \n\n \n\nCumulative genotypic resistance rates were also assessed by applying a mathematical model where \n\nonly patients with undetectable HBV DNA at the beginning of the respective year are considered. \n\nCumulative resistance rates at year 4 were 22.3% for HBeAg-positive patients and 16.0% for HBeAg-\n\nnegative patients in this analysis. \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nWhen considering patients with viral breakthrough by 104 weeks in NV-02B-007 (GLOBE), the rate \n\nof resistance was lower in patients with HBV DNA < 300 copies/ml at week 24 than in patients with \n\nHBV DNA ≥ 300 copies/ml at week 24. In HBeAg-positive patients with HBV DNA < 300 copies/ml \n\nat week 24, resistance was 1% (3/203) at 48 weeks and 9% (18/203) at week 104, whilst in patients \n\nwith HBV DNA ≥ 300 copies/ml resistance was 8% (20/247) at 48 weeks and 39% (97/247) at \n\nweek 104. In HBeAg-negative patients with HBV DNA < 300 copies/ml at week 24, resistance was \n\n0% (0/177) at 48 weeks and 5% (9/177) at week 104, whilst in patients with HBV DNA \n\n≥ 300 copies/ml resistance was 11% (5/44) at 48 weeks and 34% (15/44) at week 104. \n\n \n\nGenotypic mutation pattern and cross-resistance \n\n \n\nGenotypic analysis of 203 evaluable sample pairs with HBV DNA ≥ 1,000 copies/ml at week 104 \n\n(NV-02B-007 (GLOBE)) demonstrated that the primary mutation associated with telbivudine \n\nresistance was rtM204I, often associated with mutations rtL180M and rtL80I/V and infrequently with \n\nrtV27A, rtL82M, rtV173L, rtT184I and rtA200V. Baseline factors associated with development of \n\ngenotypic drug resistance included: lamivudine treatment, higher baseline HBV DNA, lower baseline \n\nserum ALT, and increased body weight/BMI. On-treatment response parameters at week 24 that \n\npredicted emergence of drug resistant virus by week 104 were HBV DNA > 300 copies/ml and \n\nelevation of serum ALT. \n\n \n\nGenotypic analysis of 50 HBV isolates from telbivudine-treated patients at week 208 \n\n(CLDT600A2303) revealed a similar resistance profile as reported at week 104. Conversions at \n\nposition 80, 180 and polymorphic positions 91, 229 were always detected in sequences that harboured \n\nthe M204I mutation that confers genotypic resistance. These mutations most likely are compensatory \n\nmutations. One isolated rtM204V mutation and two rtM204I/V/M mutations were reported in \n\ntelbivudine-treated patients experiencing viral breakthrough up to week 208. No novel mutation was \n\nreported. \n\n \n\nCross-resistance has been observed among HBV nucleoside analogues (see section 4.4). In cell-based \n\nassays, lamivudine-resistant HBV strains containing either the rtM204I mutation or the \n\nrtL180M/rtM204V double mutation had ≥ 1,000-fold reduced susceptibility to telbivudine. HBV \n\nencoding the adefovir resistance-associated substitutions rtN236T or rtA181V had around 0.3- and 4-\n\nfold change in susceptibility to telbivudine in cell culture, respectively (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nThe single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of telbivudine were evaluated in healthy subjects and \n\nin patients with chronic hepatitis B. The pharmacokinetics of telbivudine were not evaluated with the \n\nrecommended dose of 600 mg in patients with chronic hepatitis B. However telbivudine \n\npharmacokinetics are similar between both populations. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nFollowing oral administration of a 600 mg single dose of telbivudine to healthy subjects (n = 42), the \n\npeak plasma concentration (Cmax) of telbivudine was 3.2  1.1 g/ml (mean  SD) and occurred at \n\nmedian 3.0 hours post dose. The telbivudine area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) \n\nwas 28.0  8.5 gh/ml (mean  SD). Inter-subject variability (CV%) for measures of systemic \n\nexposures (Cmax, AUC) was typically approximately 30%. \n\n \n\nEffect of food on oral absorption \n\nTelbivudine absorption and exposure were unaffected when a single 600 mg dose was administered \n\nwith food. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nIn vitro binding of telbivudine to human plasma proteins is low (3.3%). \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nNo metabolites of telbivudine were detected following administration of \n14\n\nC-telbivudine in humans. \n\nTelbivudine is not a substrate, inhibitor or inducer of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nAfter reaching peak concentration, plasma disposition of telbivudine declined in a bi-exponential \n\nmanner with a terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 41.8 ± 11.8 hours. Telbivudine is eliminated \n\nprimarily by urinary excretion of unchanged substance. The renal clearance of telbivudine approaches \n\nnormal glomerular filtration rate, suggesting that filtration is the main mechanism of excretion. \n\nApproximately 42% of the dose is recovered in the urine over 7 days following a single 600 mg oral \n\ndose of telbivudine. As renal excretion is the predominant route of elimination, patients with moderate \n\nto severe renal dysfunction and those undergoing haemodialysis require a dose interval adjustment \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nTelbivudine pharmacokinetics are dose proportional over the range of 25 to 1,800 mg. Steady state \n\nwas achieved after 5 to 7 days of once-daily administration with an approximate 1.5-fold accumulation \n\nin systemic exposure, suggesting an effective accumulation half-life of approximately 15 hours. \n\nFollowing once-daily administration of telbivudine 600 mg, steady-state trough plasma concentrations \n\nwere approximately 0.2-0.3 g/ml. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nGender \n\nThere are no significant gender-related differences in telbivudine pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nRace \n\nThere are no significant race-related differences in telbivudine pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nPaediatrics and elderly (65 years age and above) \n\nPharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted in paediatric or elderly subjects. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe single-dose pharmacokinetics of telbivudine (200, 400 and 600 mg) have been evaluated in \n\npatients (without chronic hepatitis B) with various degrees of renal impairment (as assessed by \n\ncreatinine clearance). Based on the results shown in Table 9, adjustment of the dose interval for \n\ntelbivudine is recommended in patients with creatinine clearance of  50 ml/min (see sections 4.2 and \n\n4.4). \n\n \n\nTable 9 Pharmacokinetic parameters (mean  SD) of telbivudine in subjects with various \n\ndegrees of renal function \n\n \n\n Renal function (creatinine clearance in ml/min) \n\nNormal \n\n(> 80) \n\n(n = 8) \n\n600 mg \n\nMild (50-80) \n\n(n = 8) \n\n600 mg \n\nModerate \n\n(30-49) \n\n(n = 8) \n\n400 mg \n\nSevere (< 30) \n\n(n = 6) \n\n200 mg \n\nESRD/ \n\nHaemodialysis \n\n(n = 6) \n\n200 mg \n\nCmax (g/ml) 3.4 ± 0.9 3.2 ± 0.9 2.8 ± 1.3 1.6 ± 0.8 2.1 ± 0.9 \n\nAUC0-∞ \n(g•h/ml) \n\n28.5 ± 9.6 32.5 ± 10.1 36.0 ± 13.2 32.5 ± 13.2 67.4 ± 36.9 \n\nCLRENAL \n\n(ml/min) \n\n126.7 ± 48.3 83.3 ± 20.0 43.3 ± 20.0 11.7 ± 6.7 - \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nRenally impaired patients on haemodialysis \n\nHaemodialysis (up to 4 hours) reduces systemic telbivudine exposure by approximately 23%. \n\nFollowing dose interval adjustment for creatinine clearance, no additional dose modification is \n\nnecessary during routine haemodialysis (see section 4.2). Telbivudine should be administered after \n\nhaemodialysis. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of telbivudine have been studied in patients (without chronic hepatitis B) with \n\nvarious degrees of hepatic impairment and in some patients with decompensated liver disease. There \n\nwere no significant changes in telbivudine pharmacokinetics in hepatically impaired subjects \n\ncompared to unimpaired subjects. Results of these studies indicate that no dosage adjustment is \n\nnecessary for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. Telbivudine did not show any carcinogenic \n\npotential. No evidence of a direct toxic effect of telbivudine was seen in standard tests of reproduction \n\ntoxicology. In rabbits doses of telbivudine providing exposure levels of 37 times those observed in \n\nhumans at the therapeutic dose (600 mg) were associated with an increased incidence of abortion and \n\nearly delivery. This effect was considered to be secondary to maternal toxicity. \n\n \n\nFertility was assessed in conventional studies performed in adult rats, and as part of a juvenile \n\ntoxicology study. \n\n \n\nIn adult rats, fertility was reduced when both male and female rats were treated with telbivudine at \n\ndoses of 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day (lower fertility index compared to concurrent controls). There were \n\nno abnormalities in sperm morphology or function, and the testes and ovaries were histologically \n\nunremarkable. \n\n \n\nNo evidence of impaired fertility was seen in other studies when either male or female rats were \n\ntreated at doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day and mated with untreated rats (systemic exposure levels \n\napproximately 6-14 times higher than those achieved in humans). \n\n \n\nIn the juvenile toxicology study, rats were treated from day 14 to day 70 post-partum and were mated \n\nwith rats receiving the same treatment (no sibling mating). Fertility was reduced in pairs given \n\n≥ 1000 mg/kg/day as shown by decreases in fertility and mating indices, and reduced conception rate. \n\nHowever the ovarian and uterine parameters of those females mating successfully were unaffected. \n\n \n\nThe no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for effects on fertility or mating parameters amounted \n\nto 250 mg/kg/day, which provided exposure levels 2.5 to 2.8 times higher than those achieved in \n\nhumans with normal renal function at the therapeutic dose. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nSebivo 20 mg/ml oral solution \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nOne ml contains 20 mg telbivudine. \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect: A 600 mg dose (30 ml) of oral solution contains approximately 47 mg \n\nsodium. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nOral solution \n\n \n\nClear, colourless to pale yellow solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nSebivo is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adult patients with compensated liver \n\ndisease and evidence of viral replication, persistently elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \n\nlevels and histological evidence of active inflammation and/or fibrosis. \n\n \n\nInitiation of Sebivo treatment should only be considered when the use of an alternative antiviral agent \n\nwith a higher genetic barrier to resistance is not available or appropriate. \n \n\nSee section 5.1 for details of the study and specific patient characteristics on which this indication is \n\nbased. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTherapy must be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of chronic hepatitis B \n\ninfection. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nAdults \n\nThe recommended dose of Sebivo is 30 ml, providing a dose equivalent to 600 mg, once daily. \n\n \n\nMonitoring during treatment \n\nOn-treatment response at week 24 has been shown to be predictive of longer-term response (see \n\nTable 7 in section 5.1). HBV DNA levels should be monitored at 24 weeks of treatment to assure \n\ncomplete viral suppression (HBV DNA less than 300 copies/ml). For patients with detectable HBV \n\nDNA after 24 weeks of therapy, treatment modification should be considered. \n\n \n\nHBV DNA should be monitored every 6 months to assure continued response. If patients test positive \n\nfor HBV DNA at any time after their initial response, treatment modification should be considered. \n\nOptimal therapy should be guided by resistance testing. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nDuration of therapy \n\nThe optimal treatment duration is unknown. Treatment discontinuation should be considered as \n\nfollows: \n\n In HBeAg-positive patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be administered for at least \n6-12 months after HBeAg seroconversion (HBeAg loss and HBV DNA loss with anti-HBe \n\ndetection) is confirmed or until HBsAg seroconversion or there is evidence of loss of efficacy. \n\nSerum ALT and HBV DNA levels should be followed regularly after treatment discontinuation \n\nto detect any late virological relapse. \n\n In HBeAg-negative patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be administered at least until \nHBsAg seroconversion or until there is evidence of loss of efficacy. With prolonged treatment \n\nfor more than 2 years, regular reassessment is recommended to confirm that continuation of the \n\nselected therapy remains appropriate for the patient. \n\n \n\nMissed doses \n\nIf a dose is missed, the patient may take the missed dose only up to 4 hours prior to the next scheduled \n\ndose. The next dose should be taken at the usual time. \n\n \n\nElderly (age above 65 years) \n\nNo data are available to support a specific dose recommendation for patients over the age of 65 years \n\n(see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo adjustment of the recommended dose of telbivudine is necessary in patients whose creatinine \n\nclearance is  50 ml/min. Adjustment of the dose is required in patients with creatinine clearance \n\n< 50 ml/min, including those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis. A reduction of \n\nthe daily dose using Sebivo oral solution, as detailed in Table 1 below, is recommended. If use of the \n\noral solution is not possible, Sebivo film-coated tablets could be used as an alternative and dosing \n\nshould be adjusted by increasing the time interval between doses, as detailed in Table 1. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Dosing regimen adjustment of Sebivo in patients with renal impairment \n\n \n\nCreatinine clearance \n\n(ml/min) \n\nTelbivudine 20 mg/ml oral \n\nsolution \n\nDaily dose adjustment \n\nTelbivudine 600 mg film-coated tablet \n\nAlternative** dose adjustment with \n\nincreased dose intervals \n\n 50 600 mg (30 ml) once daily 600 mg once daily \n\n30-49 400 mg (20 ml) once daily 600 mg once every 48 hours \n\n< 30 (not requiring \n\ndialysis) \n\n200 mg (10 ml) once daily 600 mg once every 72 hours \n\nESRD* 120 mg (6 ml) once daily 600 mg once every 96 hours \n\n* End stage renal disease \n\n** In case use of the oral solution is not possible \n\n \n\nThe proposed dose modifications are based on extrapolation and may not be optimal. The safety and \n\neffectiveness of these dosing adjustment guidelines have not been clinically evaluated. Therefore, \n\nclose clinical monitoring is recommended in these patients. \n\n \n\nEnd-stage renal disease patients \n\nFor patients with ESRD, Sebivo should be administered after haemodialysis (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo adjustment to the recommended dose of Sebivo is necessary in patients with hepatic impairment \n\n(see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Sebivo in the paediatric population have not yet been established. No data \n\nare available. \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nSebivo is to be taken orally, with or without food. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\nCombination of telbivudine with pegylated or standard interferon alfa (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nSevere acute exacerbations of chronic hepatitis B are relatively frequent, and are characterised by \n\ntransient elevation of serum ALT. Following initiation of antiviral treatment, serum ALT may rise in \n\nsome patients while serum levels of HBV DNA fall (see section 4.8). On average, 4-5 weeks elapsed \n\nprior to the occurrence of an exacerbation in patients treated with telbivudine. Overall, ALT flares \n\noccurred more frequently in HBeAg-positive patients than in HBeAg-negative patients. In patients \n\nwith compensated liver disease, this elevation of serum ALT is generally not accompanied by elevated \n\nlevels of serum bilirubin or by other signs of hepatic decompensation. The risk of hepatic \n\ndecompensation – and of a subsequent exacerbation of hepatitis – may be elevated in patients with \n\ncirrhosis. Such patients should, therefore, be closely monitored. \n\n \n\nExacerbations of hepatitis have also been reported in patients who have terminated treatment of \n\nhepatitis B. Post-treatment ALT flares are normally associated with increases in serum HBV DNA \n\nlevels, and the majority of such cases have proven to be self-limiting. Nonetheless, there have also \n\nbeen reports of severe – and sometimes fatal – post-treatment disease exacerbations. Therefore, \n\nhepatic function should be monitored at regular intervals with both clinical and laboratory follow-up \n\nfor at least 6 months after discontinuation of hepatitis B therapy. \n\n \n\nLactic acidosis \n\n \n\nRare post-marketing cases of lactic acidosis have been reported with telbivudine. Cases were more \n\noften secondary to other serious conditions (e.g. rhabdomyolysis) and/or associated with \n\nmuscle-related events (e.g. myopathy, myositis). When secondary to other conditions, some cases \n\nwere also associated with pancreatitis, liver failure/hepatic steatosis and renal failure. In some cases, \n\nfatal outcomes were reported when lactic acidosis was secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Patients should \n\nbe followed closely. \n\n \n\nTreatment with telbivudine should be discontinued when metabolic/lactic acidosis of unknown \n\naetiology occurs. Benign digestive symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, may be \n\nindicative of lactic acidosis development. \n\n \n\nMuscular effects \n\n \n\nCases of myopathy and myalgia have been reported with telbivudine use several weeks to months after \n\nstarting therapy (see section 4.8). Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported during post-marketing \n\nuse of telbivudine (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nMyopathy, defined as persistent unexplained muscle aches and/or muscle weakness regardless of the \n\ndegree of increases in creatine kinase (CK) levels, should be considered in any patient with diffuse \n\nunexplained myalgias, muscle tenderness, muscle weakness or myositis (defined as myopathy with \n\nhistological evidence of muscle damage). Patients should be advised to report promptly any persistent \n\nunexplained muscle aches, pain, tenderness or weakness. If any of these symptoms are reported, a \n\ndetailed muscle examination should be performed in order to evaluate muscle function. Telbivudine \n\ntherapy should be discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed. \n\n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nIt is not known whether the risk of myopathy during treatment with telbivudine is increased with \n\nconcurrent administration of other medicinal products associated with myopathy (e.g. statins, fibrates, \n\nor ciclosporin). Physicians considering concomitant treatment with other agents associated with \n\nmyopathy should weigh carefully the potential benefits and risks and should monitor patients for any \n\nsigns or symptoms suggestive of myopathy. \n\n \n\nPeripheral neuropathy \n\n \n\nPeripheral neuropathy has been uncommonly reported in telbivudine-treated patients. If peripheral \n\nneuropathy is suspected, treatment with telbivudine should be reconsidered (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nAn increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy has been observed in one study when \n\ntelbivudine and pegylated interferon alfa-2a were co-administered (see section 4.5). Such increased \n\nrisk cannot be excluded for other interferon alfa (pegylated or standard). Moreover, the benefit of the \n\ncombination of telbivudine with interferon alfa (pegylated or standard) is not currently established. \n\nTherefore, the combination of telbivudine with pegylated or standard interferon alfa is contraindicated \n\n(see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nRenal function \n\n \n\nTelbivudine is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, therefore dose interval adjustment is \n\nrecommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min, including patients on haemodialysis. \n\nThe effectiveness of dosing interval adjustment has not been clinically evaluated. Therefore, \n\nvirological response should be closely monitored in patients with increased dosage interval (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nPatients with cirrhosis without decompensation \n\n \n\nDue to the limited data available (about 3% of patients enrolled had cirrhosis), telbivudine should be \n\nused with particular caution in cirrhotic patients. These patients should be closely monitored for \n\nclinical, biochemical and virological parameters associated with hepatitis B during treatment and after \n\ntreatment is discontinued. \n\n \n\nPatients with cirrhosis with decompensation \n\n \n\nThere are no adequate efficacy and safety data in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. \n\n \n\nPatients with previous exposure to nucleoside/nucleotide analogues \n\n \n\nIn vitro, telbivudine was not active against the HBV strains containing rtM204V/rtL180M or rtM204I \n\nmutations (see section 5.1). Telbivudine monotherapy is not an option for patients with established \n\nlamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus infection. Patients who failed to achieve virological response \n\nfollowing treatment with lamivudine for more than 24 weeks are unlikely to benefit from telbivudine \n\nmonotherapy. There is currently no clinical data to properly assess the benefit and risk of switching to \n\ntelbivudine for lamivudine-treated patients who achieve complete viral suppression on lamivudine. \n\n \n\nThere are no data on telbivudine treatment in patients with established adefovir-resistant hepatitis B \n\nvirus single mutations of rtN236T or A181V. Results from cell-based assays showed that the adefovir \n\nresistance-associated substitution A181V had 1.5- to approximately 4-fold reduced susceptibility to \n\ntelbivudine. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\nLiver transplant recipients \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of telbivudine in liver transplant recipients are unknown. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nClinical studies of telbivudine did not include sufficient numbers of patients  65 years of age to \n\ndetermine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, caution must be \n\nexercised when prescribing Sebivo to older patients in view of the greater frequency of decreased \n\nrenal function due to concomitant disease or concomitant use of other medicinal products. \n\n \n\nOther special populations \n\n \n\nSebivo has not been investigated in co-infected hepatitis B patients (e.g. patients co-infected with \n\nhuman immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hepatitis C virus [HCV] or hepatitis D virus [HDV]). \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\n \n\nPatients should be advised that treatment with Sebivo has not been shown to reduce the risk of \n\ntransmission of HBV to others through sexual contact or blood contamination. \n\n \n\nTelbivudine is not recommended to be used with lamivudine because in a phase II study, the treatment \n\nresponse observed with combination therapy of telbivudine and lamivudine was lower than with \n\ntelbivudine alone. \n\n \n\nThere are currently no efficacy and safety data for other antiviral combinations with telbivudine. \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\n \n\nSebivo oral solution contains approximately 47 mg sodium per 600 mg dose (30 ml), which should be \n\ntaken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nSince telbivudine is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, co-administration of Sebivo with \n\nsubstances that affect renal function (such as aminoglycosides, loop diuretics, platinum compounds, \n\nvancomycin, amphotericin B) may affect plasma concentrations of telbivudine and/or the co-\n\nadministered substance. The combination of telbivudine with these medicinal products should be used \n\nwith caution. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of telbivudine were unaltered following multiple dose \n\nadministration in combination with lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, \n\nciclosporin or pegylated interferon alfa-2a. In addition, telbivudine does not alter the pharmacokinetics \n\nof lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or ciclosporin. No definitive \n\nconclusion could be drawn regarding the effects of telbivudine on the pharmacokinetics of pegylated \n\ninterferon due to high interindividual variability of pegylated interferon alfa-2a concentrations. A \n\nclinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon \n\nalfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination \n\nis associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism behind these \n\nevents is not known (see section 4.4). The combination of telbivudine with any interferon alfa-\n\ncontaining product is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nTelbivudine is not a substrate, inhibitor or inducer of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system \n\n(see section 5.2). Therefore, the potential for CYP450-mediated drug interactions involving Sebivo is \n\nlow. \n\n \n\n\n\n26 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \n\ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). Studies in pregnant rats and \n\nrabbits showed that telbivudine crosses the placenta. Studies in pregnant rabbits showed early delivery \n\nand/or abortion secondary to maternal toxicity. \n\n \n\nLimited clinical data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) after exposure to telbivudine during the first \n\ntrimester of pregnancy indicate no malformative toxicity and a large amount of data (more than 1000 \n\npregnancy outcomes) after exposure during the second and third trimesters indicate no foetal/neonatal \n\ntoxicity. \n\n \n\nSebivo should be used during pregnancy only if the benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk \n\nto the foetus. \n\n \n\nLiterature shows that exposure to telbivudine in the second and/or third trimester of pregnancy has \n\nbeen shown to reduce the risk of HBV transmission from mother to infant if telbivudine is given in \n\naddition to Hepatitis B immune globulin and Hepatitis B vaccine. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nTelbivudine is excreted in the milk of rats. It is not known whether telbivudine is excreted in human \n\nmilk. Women should not breastfeed if they are taking Sebivo. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no clinical data on the effects of telbivudine on male or female fertility. In reproductive \n\ntoxicology studies in adult animals, fertility was slightly reduced when both male and female rats \n\nreceived telbivudine. The adverse effects on fertility were greater in a separate study in juvenile \n\nanimals when both sexes received telbivudine (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nSebivo has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nAssessment of adverse reactions is mainly based on two studies, NV-02B-007 (GLOBE) and NV-02B-\n\n015, in which 1,699 patients with chronic hepatitis B received double-blind treatment with telbivudine \n\n600 mg/day (n = 847) or lamivudine (n = 852) for 104 weeks. \n\n \n\nIn the 104-week clinical studies, reported adverse reactions were usually classified as mild or \n\nmoderate in severity. The most common adverse reactions were grade 3 or 4 blood creatine kinase \n\nelevations (6.8%), fatigue (4.4%), headache (3.0%) and nausea (2.6%). \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nTable 2 lists the adverse reactions according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency using the \n\nfollowing convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n\n<1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the \n\navailable data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of \n\ndecreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nTable 2 Adverse reactions \n\n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders  \n\n Rare* Lactic acidosis \n\nNervous system disorders  \n\n Common Dizziness, headache \n\n Uncommon Peripheral neuropathy, dysgeusia, hypoaesthesia, \n\nparesthesia, sciatica \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \n\ndisorders \n\n \n\n Common Cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  \n\n Common Diarrhoea, blood lipase increased, nausea, \n\nabdominal pain \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  \n\n Common Rash \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \n\ndisorders \n\n \n\n Uncommon Myopathy/myositis, arthralgia, myalgia, pain in \n\nthe extremities, back pain, muscle spasm, neck \n\npain, flank pain \n\n Rare* Rhabdomyolysis \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \n\nconditions \n\n \n\n Common Fatigue \n\n Uncommon Malaise \n\nInvestigations  \n\n Common Blood creatine phosphokinase increased, blood \n\nalanine aminotransferase increased, blood \n\namylase increased \n\n Uncommon Aspartate aminotransferase increased \n\n* This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not observed in \n\ncontrolled clinical trials.

The long-term safety \n\npopulation consisted of 655 patients including 518 from NV-02B-007 (GLOBE) and 137 from NV-\n\n02B-015.

It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nThere is no information on intentional overdose of telbivudine, but one subject was given an \n\nunintentional overdose which was asymptomatic. Tested doses up to 1,800 mg/day, three times greater \n\nthan the recommended daily dose, have been well tolerated. A maximum tolerated dose of telbivudine \n\nhas not been determined. In the event of an overdose, Sebivo should be discontinued and appropriate \n\ngeneral supportive treatment applied as necessary. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, nucleoside and nucleotide reverse \n\ntranscriptase inhibitors, ATC code: J05AF11 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nTelbivudine is a synthetic thymidine nucleoside analogue with activity against HBV DNA \n\npolymerase. It is efficiently phosphorylated by cellular kinases to the active triphosphate form, which \n\nhas an intracellular half-life of 14 hours. Telbivudine-5'-triphosphate inhibits HBV DNA polymerase \n\n(reverse transcriptase) by competing with the natural substrate, thymidine 5'-triphosphate. \n\nIncorporation of telbivudine-5'-triphosphate into viral DNA causes DNA chain termination, resulting \n\nin inhibition of HBV replication. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nTelbivudine is an inhibitor of both HBV first strand (EC50 = 0.4-1.3 M) and second strand \n\n(EC50 = 0.12-0.24 M) synthesis, and shows a distinct preference for inhibiting second strand \n\nproduction. By contrast, telbivudine-5'-triphosphate at concentrations up to 100 M did not inhibit \n\ncellular DNA polymerases , , or . In assays relating to mitochondrial structure, function and DNA \n\ncontent, telbivudine lacked appreciable toxic effect at concentrations up to at 10 M and did not \n\nincrease lactic acid production in vitro. \n\n \n\nThe in vitro antiviral activity of telbivudine was assessed in the HBV-expressing human hepatoma cell \n\nline 2.2.15. The concentration of telbivudine that effectively inhibited 50% of viral synthesis (EC50) \n\nwas approximately 0.2 M. The antiviral activity of telbivudine is specific to the hepatitis B virus and \n\nrelated hepadnaviruses. Telbivudine was not active against HIV in vitro. The absence of activity of \n\ntelbivudine against HIV has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Transient reductions in HIV-1 RNA \n\nhave been reported in a small number of patients after administration of telbivudine in the absence of \n\nantiretroviral therapy. The clinical significance of these reductions has not been determined. \n\n \n\nClinical experience \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of long-term (104 weeks) Sebivo treatment were evaluated in two active-\n\ncontrolled clinical studies that included 1,699 patients with chronic hepatitis B (NV-02B-007 \n\n(GLOBE) and NV-02B-015). \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nStudy NV-02B-007 (GLOBE) \n\nThe NV-02B-007 (GLOBE) study is a randomised, double-blind, multinational phase III study of \n\ntelbivudine compared to lamivudine for a treatment period of 104 weeks in 1,367 nucleoside-naïve \n\nchronic hepatitis B HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients. The majority of the population \n\nenrolled was Asian. The most common HBV genotypes were B (26%) and C (51%). A small number \n\n(total of 98) of Caucasian patients were treated with telbivudine. The primary data analysis was \n\nconducted after all patients had reached week 52. \n\n \n\nHBeAg-positive patients: The mean age of patients was 32 years, 74% were male, 82% were Asian, \n\n12% were Caucasian, and 6% had previously received alfa-interferon therapy. \n\n \n\nHBeAg-negative patients: The mean age of patients was 43 years, 79% were male, 65% were Asian, \n\n23% were Caucasian, and 11% had previously received alfa-interferon therapy. \n\n \n\nClinical results at week 52 \n\nClinical and virological efficacy endpoints were evaluated separately in the HBeAg-positive and \n\nHBeAg-negative patient populations. The primary endpoint of therapeutic response was a composite \n\nserological endpoint requiring suppression of HBV DNA to < 5 log10 copies/ml in conjunction with \n\neither loss of serum HBeAg or ALT normalised. Secondary endpoints included histological response, \n\nALT normalisation, and various measures of antiviral efficacy. \n\n \n\nRegardless of baseline characteristics, the majority of patients taking Sebivo showed histological, \n\nvirological, biochemical, and serological responses to treatment. Baseline ALT levels > 2x ULN and \n\nbaseline HBV DNA < 9 log10 copies/ml were associated with higher rates of HBeAg seroconversion in \n\nHBeAg-positive patients. Patients who achieve HBV DNA levels < 3 log10 copies/ml by week 24 had \n\noptimal responses to treatment; conversely patients with HBV DNA levels > 4 log10 copies/ml at \n\n24 weeks had less favourable outcomes at week 52. \n\n \n\nIn HBeAg-positive patients, telbivudine was superior to lamivudine in therapeutic response (75.3% vs \n\n67.0% responders; p = 0.0047). In HBeAg-negative patients, telbivudine was non-inferior to \n\nlamivudine (75.2% and 77.2% responders; p = 0.6187).

These patients had completed ≥ 52 weeks of telbivudine \n\ntreatment, and had exhibited HBeAg loss for ≥ 24 weeks with HBV DNA < 5 log10 copies/ml at the \n\nlast on-treatment visit. The median treatment duration was 104 weeks. After a median off-treatment \n\nfollow-up period of 120 weeks, the majority of HBeAg-positive telbivudine treated-patients showed \n\nsustained HBeAg loss (83.3%; 25/30), and sustained HBeAg seroconversion (79.2%; 19/24). Patients \n\nwith sustained HBeAg seroconversion had a mean HBV DNA of 3.3 log10 copies/ml; and 73.7% had \n\nHBV DNA < 4 log10 copies/ml. \n\n \nClinical resistance \n\n \n\nGenotypic resistance test was performed in study NV-02B-007 (GLOBE; n = 680) in patients with \n\nvirological rebound (confirmed increase of ≥ 1 log10 copies/ml HBV DNA from nadir). \n\n \n\nAt week 48 among HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients, 5% (23/458) and 2% (5/222), \n\nrespectively, had virological rebound with detectable HBV resistance mutations. \n\n \n\nStudies NV-02B-007 (GLOBE) and CLDT600A2303 - cumulative genotypic resistance rates \n\nThe original analysis for cumulative genotypic resistance at week 104 and 208 was based on the ITT \n\npopulation and included all patients who continued treatment until 4 years, regardless of HBV DNA \n\nlevels. Out of the 680 telbivudine-treated patients initially included in the pivotal study NV-02B-007 \n\n(GLOBE), 517 (76%) enrolled into study CLDT600A2303 for continued telbivudine treatment for up \n\nto 208 weeks. Out of these 517 patients 159 patients (HBeAg-positive=135, HBeAg-negative=24) had \n\ndetectable HBV DNA. \n\n \n\nThe cumulative genotypic rates by week 104 were 25.1% (115/458) for HBeAg-positive patients and \n\n10.8% (24/222) for HBeAg-negative patients. \n\n \n\nIn the overall ITT population the cumulative resistance rates at year 4 for HBeAg-positive and \n\nHBeAg-negative patients, was 40.8% (131/321) and 18.9% (37/196), respectively. \n\n \n\nCumulative genotypic resistance rates were also assessed by applying a mathematical model where \n\nonly patients with undetectable HBV DNA at the beginning of the respective year are considered. \n\nCumulative resistance rates at year 4 were 22.3% for HBeAg-positive patients and 16.0% for HBeAg-\n\nnegative patients in this analysis. \n\n \n\nWhen considering patients with viral breakthrough by 104 weeks in NV-02B-007 (GLOBE), the rate \n\nof resistance was lower in patients with HBV DNA < 300 copies/ml at week 24 than in patients with \n\nHBV DNA ≥ 300 copies/ml at week 24. In HBeAg-positive patients with HBV DNA < 300 copies/ml \n\nat week 24, resistance was 1% (3/203) at 48 weeks and 9% (18/203) at week 104, whilst in patients \n\nwith HBV DNA ≥ 300 copies/ml resistance was 8% (20/247) at 48 weeks and 39% (97/247) at \n\nweek 104. In HBeAg-negative patients with HBV DNA < 300 copies/ml at week 24, resistance was \n\n0% (0/177) at 48 weeks and 5% (9/177) at week 104, whilst in patients with HBV DNA \n\n≥ 300 copies/ml resistance was 11% (5/44) at 48 weeks and 34% (15/44) at week 104. \n\n \n\nGenotypic mutation pattern and cross-resistance \n\n \n\nGenotypic analysis of 203 evaluable sample pairs with HBV DNA ≥ 1,000 copies/ml at week 104 \n\n(NV-02B-007 (GLOBE)) demonstrated that the primary mutation associated with telbivudine \n\nresistance was rtM204I, often associated with mutations rtL180M and rtL80I/V and infrequently with \n\nrtV27A, rtL82M, rtV173L, rtT184I and rtA200V. Baseline factors associated with development of \n\ngenotypic drug resistance included: lamivudine treatment, higher baseline HBV DNA, lower baseline \n\nserum ALT, and increased body weight/BMI. On-treatment response parameters at week 24 that \n\npredicted emergence of drug resistant virus by week 104 were HBV DNA > 300 copies/ml and \n\nelevation of serum ALT. \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nGenotypic analysis of 50 HBV isolates from telbivudine-treated patients at week 208 \n\n(CLDT600A2303) revealed a similar resistance profile as reported at week 104. Conversions at \n\nposition 80, 180 and polymorphic positions 91, 229 were always detected in sequences that harboured \n\nthe M204I mutation that confers genotypic resistance. These mutations most likely are compensatory \n\nmutations. One isolated rtM204V mutation and two rtM204I/V/M mutations were reported in \n\ntelbivudine-treated patients experiencing viral breakthrough up to week 208. No novel mutation was \n\nreported. \n\n \n\nCross-resistance has been observed among HBV nucleoside analogues (see section 4.4). In cell-based \n\nassays, lamivudine-resistant HBV strains containing either the rtM204I mutation or the \n\nrtL180M/rtM204V double mutation had ≥ 1,000-fold reduced susceptibility to telbivudine. HBV \n\nencoding the adefovir resistance-associated substitutions rtN236T or rtA181V had around 0.3- and 4-\n\nfold change in susceptibility to telbivudine in cell culture, respectively (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nThe single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of telbivudine were evaluated in healthy subjects and \n\nin patients with chronic hepatitis B. The pharmacokinetics of telbivudine were not evaluated with the \n\nrecommended dose of 600 mg in patients with chronic hepatitis B. However telbivudine \n\npharmacokinetics are similar between both populations. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nFollowing oral administration of a 600 mg single dose of telbivudine to healthy subjects (n = 42), the \n\npeak plasma concentration (Cmax) of telbivudine was 3.2  1.1 g/ml (mean  SD) and occurred at \n\nmedian 3.0 hours post dose. The telbivudine area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) \n\nwas 28.0  8.5 gh/ml (mean  SD). Inter-subject variability (CV%) for measures of systemic \n\nexposures (Cmax, AUC) was typically approximately 30%. Film-coated tablets containing 600 mg \n\ntelbivudine are bioequivalent to 30 ml telbivudine oral solution (20 mg/ml). \n\n \n\nEffect of food on oral absorption \n\nTelbivudine absorption and exposure were unaffected when a single 600 mg dose was administered \n\nwith food. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nIn vitro binding of telbivudine to human plasma proteins is low (3.3%). \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nNo metabolites of telbivudine were detected following administration of \n14\n\nC-telbivudine in humans. \n\nTelbivudine is not a substrate, inhibitor or inducer of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nAfter reaching peak concentration, plasma disposition of telbivudine declined in a bi-exponential \n\nmanner with a terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 41.8 ± 11.8 hours. Telbivudine is eliminated \n\nprimarily by urinary excretion of unchanged substance. The renal clearance of telbivudine approaches \n\nnormal glomerular filtration rate, suggesting that filtration is the main mechanism of excretion. \n\nApproximately 42% of the dose is recovered in the urine over 7 days following a single 600 mg oral \n\ndose of telbivudine. As renal excretion is the predominant route of elimination, patients with moderate \n\nto severe renal dysfunction and those undergoing haemodialysis require a dose interval adjustment \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nTelbivudine pharmacokinetics are dose proportional over the range of 25 to 1,800 mg. Steady state \n\nwas achieved after 5 to 7 days of once-daily administration with an approximate 1.5-fold accumulation \n\nin systemic exposure, suggesting an effective accumulation half-life of approximately 15 hours. \n\nFollowing once-daily administration of telbivudine 600 mg, steady-state trough plasma concentrations \n\nwere approximately 0.2-0.3 g/ml. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nGender \n\nThere are no significant gender-related differences in telbivudine pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nRace \n\nThere are no significant race-related differences in telbivudine pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nPaediatrics and elderly (65 years age and above) \n\nPharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted in paediatric or elderly subjects. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe single-dose pharmacokinetics of telbivudine (200, 400 and 600 mg) have been evaluated in \n\npatients (without chronic hepatitis B) with various degrees of renal impairment (as assessed by \n\ncreatinine clearance). Based on the results shown in Table 9, adjustment of the dose interval for \n\ntelbivudine is recommended in patients with creatinine clearance of  50 ml/min (see sections 4.2 and \n\n4.4). \n\n \n\nTable 9 Pharmacokinetic parameters (mean  SD) of telbivudine in subjects with various \n\ndegrees of renal function \n\n \n\n Renal function (creatinine clearance in ml/min) \n\nNormal \n\n(> 80) \n\n(n = 8) \n\n600 mg \n\nMild (50-80) \n\n(n = 8) \n\n600 mg \n\nModerate \n\n(30-49) \n\n(n = 8) \n\n400 mg \n\nSevere (< 30) \n\n(n = 6) \n\n200 mg \n\nESRD/ \n\nHaemodialysis \n\n(n = 6) \n\n200 mg \n\nCmax (g/ml) 3.4 ± 0.9 3.2 ± 0.9 2.8 ± 1.3 1.6 ± 0.8 2.1 ± 0.9 \n\nAUC0-∞ \n(g•h/ml) \n\n28.5 ± 9.6 32.5 ± 10.1 36.0 ± 13.2 32.5 ± 13.2 67.4 ± 36.9 \n\nCLRENAL \n\n(ml/min) \n\n126.7 ± 48.3 83.3 ± 20.0 43.3 ± 20.0 11.7 ± 6.7 - \n\n \n\nRenally impaired patients on haemodialysis \n\nHaemodialysis (up to 4 hours) reduces systemic telbivudine exposure by approximately 23%. \n\nFollowing dose interval adjustment for creatinine clearance, no additional dose modification is \n\nnecessary during routine haemodialysis (see section 4.2).

Telbivudine did not show any carcinogenic \n\npotential. No evidence of a direct toxic effect of telbivudine was seen in standard tests of reproduction \n\ntoxicology. In rabbits doses of telbivudine providing exposure levels of 37 times those observed in \n\nhumans at the therapeutic dose (600 mg) were associated with an increased incidence of abortion and \n\nearly delivery. This effect was considered to be secondary to maternal toxicity. \n\n \n\nFertility was assessed in conventional studies performed in adult rats, and as part of a juvenile \n\ntoxicology study. \n\n \n\nIn adult rats, fertility was reduced when both male and female rats were treated with telbivudine at \n\ndoses of 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day (lower fertility index compared to concurrent controls). There were \n\nno abnormalities in sperm morphology or function, and the testes and ovaries were histologically \n\nunremarkable. \n\n \n\nNo evidence of impaired fertility was seen in other studies when either male or female rats were \n\ntreated at doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day and mated with untreated rats (systemic exposure levels \n\napproximately 6-14 times higher than those achieved in humans). \n\n \n\nIn the juvenile toxicology study, rats were treated from day 14 to day 70 post-partum and were mated \n\nwith rats receiving the same treatment (no sibling mating). Fertility was reduced in pairs given \n\n≥ 1000 mg/kg/day as shown by decreases in fertility and mating indices, and reduced conception rate. \n\nHowever the ovarian and uterine parameters of those females mating successfully were unaffected. \n\n \n\nThe no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for effects on fertility or mating parameters amounted \n\nto 250 mg/kg/day, which provided exposure levels 2.5 to 2.8 times higher than those achieved in \n\nhumans with normal renal function at the therapeutic dose. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nSebivo 600 mg film-coated tablets \n\nTelbivudine \n\n \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Sebivo is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Sebivo \n\n3. How to take Sebivo \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Sebivo \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Sebivo is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nSebivo contains the active substance telbivudine. Sebivo belongs to a group of medicines called \n\nantiviral medicines, which are used to treat infections caused by viruses. \n\n \n\nSebivo is used to treat adults with chronic hepatitis B. Starting treatment with Sebivo should only be \n\nconsidered when it is not possible or appropriate to use an alternative medicine to which the hepatitis \n\nB virus is less likely to develop resistance. Your doctor will decide which treatment is most \n\nappropriate for you. \n\n \n\nHepatitis B is caused by infection with the hepatitis B virus, which multiplies in the liver and causes \n\nliver damage. Treatment with Sebivo reduces the amount of hepatitis B virus in the body by blocking \n\nits growth, resulting in less liver damage and improved liver function. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Sebivo \n\n \n\nDo not take Sebivo \n- if you are allergic to telbivudine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n- if you are being treated with pegylated or standard interferon alfa (see “Taking other \nmedicines”). \n\nIf this applies to you, do not take Sebivo. Talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\n\n\n50 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Sebivo: \n\n- if you have or have had any kidney problems. Your doctor may order laboratory tests to check \nyour kidneys are working properly before and during treatment. Depending on the results of \n\nthese tests your doctor may advise you to change how often you take Sebivo. \n\n- if you suffer from cirrhosis of the liver (a serious condition which causes liver “scarring”). In \nthis case your doctor will want to monitor you more closely. \n\n- if you have had a liver transplant. \n- if you are taking any medicines that may cause muscle problems (talk to your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are unsure). \n\n- if you are infected with HIV, hepatitis C or D, or are being treated with any antiviral medicines. \nIf any of these applies to you, tell your doctor before you take Sebivo. \n\n \n\nDuring the treatment with Sebivo: \n\n- Sebivo can cause persistent unexplained muscle weakness or muscle pain (myopathy). Muscle \nsymptoms may progress and become serious, sometimes leading to muscle breakdown \n\n(rhabdomyolysis) which can cause kidney damage. \n\n- Uncommonly Sebivo can induce numbness, tingling, pain and/or burning sensations in the arms \nand/or legs (peripheral neuropathy). \n\nIf you experience any of these symptoms during your treatment with Sebivo, call your doctor \n\nimmediately. \n\n \n\nOther side effects of this type of medicine \n\nSebivo can cause an excess of lactic acid in the blood (lactic acidosis) which is usually associated with \n\nan enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly). Lactic acidosis is a rare but serious side effect which can \n\noccasionally be fatal. Your doctor will monitor you regularly while you are receiving Sebivo. If you \n\nexperience muscle pain, severe and persistent stomach pain with nausea and vomiting, severe and \n\npersistent trouble breathing, tiredness or abdominal discomfort while taking Sebivo, call your doctor \n\nimmediately. \n\n \n\nSome people may get very serious hepatitis symptoms when they stop taking medicines like Sebivo. \n\nYour doctor will monitor your health and do regular blood tests to check your liver after you stop \n\ntreatment with Sebivo. Tell your doctor immediately about any new or unusual symptoms that you \n\nnotice after stopping treatment (see “If you stop taking Sebivo” in section 3 of this leaflet). \n\n \n\nTake care not to infect other people \n\nEven if you take Sebivo, you may still infect others with hepatitis B virus (HBV) through sexual \n\ncontact or exposure to contaminated blood or other body fluids. If you have sexual intercourse with a \n\npartner who is not immune against hepatitis B, always use condoms and avoid any other exchange of \n\nbody fluids. Never share needles. Do not share personal items that could have blood or body fluids on \n\nthem, such as toothbrushes or razor blades. A vaccine is available to prevent infection with HBV. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nSebivo is not recommended for use in children and adolescents. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Sebivo \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nYour doctor or pharmacist needs to know about other medicines because some medicines could affect \n\nyour kidneys and because Sebivo mainly leaves the body via the kidneys in the urine. \n\n \n\nDo not take Sebivo if you are using pegylated or standard interferon alfa (see “Do not take Sebivo”), \n\nbecause the combination of these medicines may increase your risk of developing peripheral \n\nneuropathy (numbness, tingling, and/or burning sensations in the arms and/or legs). Tell your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are being treated with interferon. \n\n \n\n\n\n51 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n- Do not use Sebivo during pregnancy unless your doctor recommends it. If you are pregnant, \nthink you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before \n\ntaking this medicine. Your doctor will discuss with you the potential risks of taking Sebivo \n\nduring pregnancy. \n\n \n\n- If you have hepatitis B and become pregnant, talk to your doctor about how you can best protect \nyour baby. Sebivo may reduce the risk of passing your hepatitis B virus on to your unborn baby \n\nif taken in combination with Hepatitis B immune globulin and Hepatitis B vaccine. \n\n \n\n- Do not breast-feed during treatment with Sebivo. Tell your doctor if you are breast- feeding. \n \n\nDriving and using machines \nSebivo has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If you feel dizzy while taking this \n\nmedicine, do not drive a vehicle or use any tools or machines. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Sebivo \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nHow much Sebivo to take \n\nThe recommended dose of Sebivo is one 600 mg tablet once a day. Take the tablet at about the same \n\ntime each day. \n\n \n\nThe tablet can be taken with or without food. Swallow it whole with some water. Do not chew, split or \n\ncrush it. \n\n \n\nYou may need to take Sebivo less frequently if you have kidney problems. Tell your doctor if you \n\nhave, or have ever had, any kidney problems. \n\n \n\nHow long to take Sebivo \n\nContinue taking Sebivo every day for as long as your doctor tells you. Do not change your dose or \n\nstop taking Sebivo without talking to your doctor. This medicine is intended for long-term treatment, \n\npossibly lasting for months or years. Your doctor will regularly monitor your condition to check that \n\nthe treatment is having the desired effect. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Sebivo than you should \n\nIf you have taken too much Sebivo, or if someone else accidentally takes your tablets, go to your \n\ndoctor or hospital for advice straight away. Take the pack of tablets with you and show it to your \n\ndoctor. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Sebivo \n\n- If you forget to take Sebivo, take it as soon as you remember and then take your next dose at its \nregular time. \n\n- However, if it is within 4 hours before your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take the \nnext one at the usual time. \n\n \n\nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. This may increase the chance of you \n\ngetting unwanted side effects. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure what to do. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Sebivo \n\nStopping treatment with Sebivo may result in a worsening of your hepatitis B infection i.e. progression \n\nof the disease and abnormal test results (increase of viral load, ALT increase). Do not stop Sebivo \n\nunless your doctor tells you to. While you are taking Sebivo, make sure you do not run out of Sebivo. \n\n \n\n\n\n52 \n\nYour doctor will monitor your health and do regular blood tests to check your liver after you stop \n\ntreatment with Sebivo since your hepatitis B infection may get worse or become very serious after \n\nstopping treatment. Tell your doctor immediately about any new or unusual symptoms that you notice \n\nafter stopping treatment. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Sebivo is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Sebivo \n\n3. How to take Sebivo \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Sebivo \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Sebivo is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nSebivo contains the active substance telbivudine. Sebivo belongs to a group of medicines called \n\nantiviral medicines, which are used to treat infections caused by viruses. \n\n \n\nSebivo is used to treat adults with chronic hepatitis B. Starting treatment with Sebivo should only be \n\nconsidered when it is not possible or appropriate to use an alternative medicine to which the hepatitis \n\nB virus is less likely to develop resistance. Your doctor will decide which treatment is most \n\nappropriate for you. \n\n \n\nHepatitis B is caused by infection with the hepatitis B virus, which multiplies in the liver and causes \n\nliver damage. Treatment with Sebivo reduces the amount of hepatitis B virus in the body by blocking \n\nits growth, resulting in less liver damage and improved liver function. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Sebivo \n\n \n\nDo not take Sebivo \n- if you are allergic to telbivudine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n- if you are being treated with pegylated or standard interferon alfa (see “Taking other \nmedicines”). \n\nIf this applies to you, do not take Sebivo. Talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\n\n\n56 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Sebivo: \n\n- if you have or have had any kidney problems. Your doctor may order laboratory tests to check \nyour kidneys are working properly before and during treatment. Depending on the results of \n\nthese tests your doctor may advise you to change how often you take Sebivo. \n\n- if you suffer from cirrhosis of the liver (a serious condition which causes liver “scarring”). In \nthis case your doctor will want to monitor you more closely. \n\n- if you have had a liver transplant. \n- if you are taking any medicines that may cause muscle problems (talk to your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are unsure). \n\n- if you are infected with HIV, hepatitis C or D, or are being treated with any antiviral medicines. \nIf any of these applies to you, tell your doctor before you take Sebivo. \n\n \n\nDuring the treatment with Sebivo: \n\n- Sebivo can cause persistent unexplained muscle weakness or muscle pain (myopathy). Muscle \nsymptoms may progress and become serious, sometimes leading to muscle breakdown \n\n(rhabdomyolysis) which can cause kidney damage. \n\n- Uncommonly Sebivo can induce numbness, tingling, pain and/or burning sensations in the arms \nand/or legs (peripheral neuropathy). \n\nIf you experience any of these symptoms during your treatment with Sebivo, call your doctor \n\nimmediately. \n\n \n\nOther side effects of this type of medicine \n\nSebivo can cause an excess of lactic acid in the blood (lactic acidosis) which is usually associated with \n\nan enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly). Lactic acidosis is a rare but serious side effect which can \n\noccasionally be fatal. Your doctor will monitor you regularly while you are receiving Sebivo. If you \n\nexperience muscle pain, severe and persistent stomach pain with nausea and vomiting, severe and \n\npersistent trouble breathing, tiredness or abdominal discomfort while taking Sebivo, call your doctor \n\nimmediately. \n\n \n\nSome people may get very serious hepatitis symptoms when they stop taking medicines like Sebivo. \n\nYour doctor will monitor your health and do regular blood tests to check your liver after you stop \n\ntreatment with Sebivo. Tell your doctor immediately about any new or unusual symptoms that you \n\nnotice after stopping treatment (see “If you stop taking Sebivo” in section 3 of this leaflet). \n\n \n\nTake care not to infect other people \n\nEven if you take Sebivo, you may still infect others with hepatitis B virus (HBV) through sexual \n\ncontact or exposure to contaminated blood or other body fluids. If you have sexual intercourse with a \n\npartner who is not immune against hepatitis B, always use condoms and avoid any other exchange of \n\nbody fluids. Never share needles. Do not share personal items that could have blood or body fluids on \n\nthem, such as toothbrushes or razor blades. A vaccine is available to prevent infection with HBV. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nSebivo is not recommended for use in children and adolescents. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Sebivo \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nYour doctor or pharmacist needs to know about other medicines because some medicines could affect \n\nyour kidneys and because Sebivo mainly leaves the body via the kidneys in the urine. \n\n \n\nDo not take Sebivo if you are using pegylated or standard interferon alfa (see “Do not take Sebivo”), \n\nbecause the combination of these medicines may increase your risk of developing peripheral \n\nneuropathy (numbness, tingling, and/or burning sensations in the arms and/or legs). Tell your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are being treated with interferon. \n\n \n\n\n\n57 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n- Do not use Sebivo during pregnancy unless your doctor recommends it. If you are pregnant, \nthink you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before \n\ntaking this medicine. Your doctor will discuss with you the potential risks of taking Sebivo \n\nduring pregnancy. \n\n \n\n- If you have hepatitis B and become pregnant, talk to your doctor about how you can best protect \nyour baby. Sebivo may reduce the risk of passing your hepatitis B virus on to your unborn baby \n\nif taken in combination with Hepatitis B immune globulin and Hepatitis B vaccine. \n\n \n\n- Do not breast-feed during treatment with Sebivo. Tell your doctor if you are breast- feeding. \n \n\nDriving and using machines \nSebivo has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If you feel dizzy while taking this \n\nmedicine, do not drive a vehicle or use any tools or machines. \n\n \n\nSebivo contains sodium \n\nSebivo oral solution contains approximately 47 mg of sodium per 600 mg dose (30 ml). If you are on a \n\ncontrolled sodium diet, ask your doctor for advice. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Sebivo \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nHow much Sebivo to take \n\nThe recommended dose of Sebivo is 30 ml of oral solution (600 mg telbivudine) once a day. Take \n\nSebivo at about the same time each day. It can be taken with or without food. \n\n \n\nFor full instructions on how to take Sebivo, see section “Instructions for use” at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nRemove the dosing cup and open the bottle. Slowly and carefully pour the solution from the bottle into \n\nthe dosing cup until it reaches the prescribed amount. Swallow the entire contents of the dosing cup \n\nimmediately. \n\n \n\nIf you cannot measure the prescribed amount precisely using the dosing cup alone, you should use the \n\noral syringe. Detailed instructions on how to use this are given in the section “Instructions for use”. \n\n \n\nYour dose may be reduced if you have kidney problems. Tell your doctor if you have, or have ever \n\nhad, any kidney problems. \n\n \n\nHow long to take Sebivo \n\nContinue taking Sebivo every day for as long as your doctor tells you. Do not change your dose or \n\nstop taking Sebivo without talking to your doctor. This medicine is intended for long-term treatment, \n\npossibly lasting for months or years. Your doctor will regularly monitor your condition to check that \n\nthe treatment is having the desired effect. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Sebivo than you should \n\nIf you have taken too much Sebivo, or if someone else accidentally takes your oral solution, go to your \n\ndoctor or hospital for advice straight away. Take the pack with you and show it to the doctor. \n\n \n\n\n\n58 \n\nIf you forget to take Sebivo \n\n- If you forget to take Sebivo, take it as soon as you remember and then take your next dose at its \nregular time. \n\n- However, if it is within 4 hours before your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take the \nnext one at the usual time. \n\n \n\nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. This may increase the chance of you \n\ngetting unwanted side effects. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure what to do. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Sebivo \n\nStopping treatment with Sebivo may result in a worsening of your hepatitis B infection i.e. progression \n\nof the disease and abnormal test results (increase of viral load, ALT increase). Do not stop Sebivo \n\nunless your doctor tells you to. While you are taking Sebivo, make sure you do not run out of Sebivo. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will monitor your health and do regular blood tests to check your liver after you stop \n\ntreatment with Sebivo since your hepatitis B infection may get worse or become very serious after \n\nstopping treatment. Tell your doctor immediately about any new or unusual symptoms that you notice \n\nafter stopping treatment. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.
