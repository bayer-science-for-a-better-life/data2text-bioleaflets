PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSuspension for injection.\n\nUniform, cloudy, white to off-white suspension.\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nVaxelis (DTaP-HB-IPV-Hib) is indicated for primary and booster vaccination in infants and toddlers \nfrom the age of 6 weeks, against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and invasive \ndiseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib).\n\nThe use of Vaxelis should be in accordance with official recommendations.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nPrimary vaccination:\n\nThe primary vaccination schedule consists of two or three doses, with an interval of at least 1 month \nbetween doses, and may be given from 6 weeks of age, in accordance with the official \nrecommendations. \n\nWhere a dose of hepatitis B vaccine is given at birth, Vaxelis can be used for supplementary doses of \nhepatitis B vaccine from the age of 6 weeks. If a second dose of hepatitis B vaccine is required before \nthis age, monovalent hepatitis B vaccine should be used. Vaxelis can be used for a mixed \nhexavalent/pentavalent/hexavalent combined vaccine immunisation schedule.\n\nBooster vaccination:\n\nAfter a 2-dose or a 3-dose primary series vaccination with Vaxelis, a booster dose should be given at \nleast 6 months after the last priming dose. Booster dose should be given in accordance with the official \nrecommendations. As a minimum, a dose of Hib vaccine must be administered.\n\nOther paediatric population\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Vaxelis in infants less than 6 weeks of age have not been established. No \ndata are available.\n\nNo data are available in older children (see sections 4.8 and 5.1)\n\nMethod of administration \n\nVaxelis should only be administered by intramuscular (IM) injection. The recommended injection sites \nare the anterolateral area of the thigh (preferred site for infants under one year of age) or the deltoid \nmuscle of the upper arm. \n\nFor instructions on handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHistory of an anaphylactic reaction after a previous administration of Vaxelis or a vaccine containing \nthe same components or constituents.\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to trace \nresiduals (glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, neomycin, streptomycin, polymyxin B, and bovine serum \nalbumin).\n\nEncephalopathy of unknown aetiology, occurring within 7 days following prior vaccination with a \npertussis containing vaccine. In these circumstances, pertussis vaccination should be discontinued, and\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nthe vaccination course should be continued with diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis, and Hib \nvaccines.\nUncontrolled neurologic disorder or uncontrolled epilepsy: pertussis vaccination should not be \nadministered until treatment for the condition has been established, the condition has stabilised, and \nthe benefit clearly outweighs the risk.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nVaxelis will not prevent disease caused by pathogens other than Corynebacterium diphtheriae,\nClostridium tetani, Bordetella pertussis, hepatitis B virus, poliovirus or Haemophilus influenzae type \nb. However, it can be expected that hepatitis D will be prevented by immunisation as hepatitis D \n(caused by the delta agent) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection.\n\nVaxelis will not protect against hepatitis infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, hepatitis \nC and hepatitis E or by other liver pathogens.\n\nBecause of the long incubation period of hepatitis B, it is possible for unrecognised hepatitis B \ninfection to be present at the time of vaccination. The vaccine may not prevent hepatitis B infection in \nsuch cases.\n\nVaxelis does not protect against disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae other than type b or by \nother microorganisms that cause invasive disease such as meningitis or sepsis, including N. \nmeningitidis.\n\nAs with any vaccine, a protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees.\n\nPrior to immunisation\n\nVaccination should be preceded by a review of the individual's medical history (in particular, previous \nvaccinations and possible adverse reactions). \n\nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should be readily \navailable for immediate use in case of a rare anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the \nvaccine (see section 4.3).\n\nAs with other vaccines, administration of Vaxelis should be postponed in children suffering from \nmoderate to severe acute disease, with or without fever. The presence of a minor illness and /or low-\ngrade fever does not constitute a contraindication.\n\nIf any of the following events have occurred after administration of a pertussis-containing vaccine, the \ndecision to administer further doses of a pertussis-containing vaccine should be carefully considered:\n\n Temperature of 40.5°C within 48 hours, not attributable to another identifiable cause\n Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode [HHE]) within 48 hours of \n\nvaccination\n Persistent crying lasting ≥3 hours, occurring within 48 hours of vaccination\n Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination.\nThere may be some circumstances, such as high incidence of pertussis, when the potential benefits \noutweigh possible risks.\n\nIf Guillain-Barré syndrome has occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of prior vaccine containing tetanus \ntoxoid, the decision to give any vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, including Vaxelis, should be based \non careful consideration of the potential benefits and possible risks. \n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nA history of febrile convulsions, a family history of convulsions, or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome\n(SIDS) do not constitute a contraindication for the use of Vaxelis. Individuals with a history of febrile \nconvulsions should be closely followed up as febrile convulsions may occur within 2 to 3 days post \nvaccination.\n\nDo not administer by intravascular, intradermal or subcutaneous injection.\n\nData from a clinical study indicate that, when Vaxelis is co-administered with pneumococcal \nconjugate vaccine (PCV13), the rate of fever is higher following the booster dose in the second year of \nlife compared to the primary series. Almost all fevers were mild or moderate (<39.5°C) and transient \n(duration of ≤2 days) (see section 4.8).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nPremature infants\nLimited data from 111 pre-term newborn infants in clinical trials indicate that Vaxelis can be given to \npremature infants. The immune responses to Vaxelis in these infants were generally similar to those of \nthe overall study population. However, a lower immune response may be observed, and the level of \nclinical protection is unknown.\n\nThe potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72 hours should be \nconsidered when administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born \n≤28 weeks of gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. \nAs the benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or \ndelayed.\n\nGenetic Polymorphism\nImmune responses to the vaccine have not been studied in the context of genetic polymorphism.\n\nImmunocompromised children\nThe immunogenicity of the vaccine may be reduced by immunosuppressive treatment or \nimmunodeficiency. It is recommended to postpone vaccination until the end of such treatment or \ndisease. Nevertheless, vaccination of individuals with chronic immunodeficiency such as HIV infection\nis recommended even if the antibody response may be limited.\n\nBlood disorders\nAs with all injectable vaccines, the vaccine must be administered with caution to individuals with \nthrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular \nadministration.\n\nInterference with laboratory testing\nSince the Hib capsular polysaccharide antigen is excreted in the urine, a positive urine test can be \nobserved using sensitive tests, for at least 30 days following vaccination. Other tests should be\nperformed in order to confirm Hib infection during this period.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nVaxelis may be administered simultaneously with pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccines, \nrotavirus vaccines, measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and varicella containing vaccines and \nmeningococcal C conjugate vaccines.\nData from a clinical study indicate that, when Vaxelis is co-administered with pneumococcal \nconjugate vaccine (PCV13), the rate of fever is higher following the booster dose in the second year of \nlife compared to the primary series. Almost all fevers were mild or moderate (<39.5°C) and transient \n(duration of ≤2 days) (see section 4.8).\n\nCo-administration of Vaxelis with other injectable vaccines must be carried out at separate injection \n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nsites and, preferably, separate limbs.\n\nVaxelis should not be mixed with any other vaccine or other parenterally administered medicinal \nproducts.\n\nImmunosuppressive therapy may interfere with the development of expected immune response (see \nsection 4.4).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nThis vaccine is not intended for administration to women of child-bearing age.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNot relevant.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\na- Summary of the safety profile\n\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions after Vaxelis administration were irritability, crying, \nsomnolence, injection site reactions (pain, erythema, swelling), pyrexia (≥38°C), decreased appetite, \nand vomiting.\n\nThe safety of Vaxelis in children over 15 months of age has not been studied in clinical trials.\n\nIn a clinical study where Vaxelis was administered concomitantly with Prevenar 13 (PCV13) as a \nbooster dose of both vaccines, fever ≥38.0°C was reported in 54.3% of children, compared to 33.1% to \n40.7% of children during the primary series. Fever ≥39.5°C was observed in 3.7% of children (post-\nbooster) and 0.2% to 0.8% of children (post-primary) receiving Vaxelis with PCV13 (see sections 4.4 \nand 4.5). Almost all fevers after primary and booster doses were mild or moderate (<39.5°C) and \ntransient (duration of ≤2 days).\n\nb- Tabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe following convention has been used for the classification of adverse reactions:\nVery common (1/10)\nCommon (1/100 to <1/10)\nUncommon (1/1,000 to <1/100)\nRare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000)\nVery rare (<1/10,000)\n\nTable 1: List of Adverse Reactions\n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse Reactions\nInfections and infestations Uncommon Rhinitis\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders\n\nUncommon Lymphadenopathy\n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders\n\nVery Common Decreased appetite\nUncommon Increased appetite\n\nPsychiatric disorders Uncommon Sleep disorders including insomnia, \nrestlessness\n\nNervous system disorders Very Common Somnolence\nUncommon Hypotonia\n\nVascular disorders Uncommon Pallor\nRespiratory, thoracic and Uncommon Cough\n\n \n\n\n\n7\n\nmediastinal disorders\nGastrointestinal disorders Very Common Vomiting\n\nCommon Diarrhoea\nUncommon Abdominal pain\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nUncommon Rash, hyperhidrosis\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nVery Common\n\nCrying, irritability\nInjection site erythema, injection site pain, \ninjection site swelling\nPyrexia\n\nCommon Injection site bruising, injection site \ninduration, injection site nodule\n\nUncommon Injection site rash, injection site warmth, \nfatigue\n\nPost-Marketing Surveillance\n\nThe following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing use. Because these events \nwere reported from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their \nfrequency or to establish, a causal relationship to the vaccine.\n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse Event\nNervous system disorders Unknown Hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode (HHE) \n\n(see section 4.4)\n\nc- Description of selected adverse reactions\n\nThe following adverse events have been reported with other vaccines containing the components or \nconstituents of Vaxelis without regard to causality or frequency.\n\nImmune system disorders\nHypersensitivity (such as rash, urticaria, dyspnea, erythema multiforme), anaphylactic reaction (such \nas urticaria, angioedema, edema, face edema, shock).\n\nNervous system disorders\nConvulsion, febrile convulsion.\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\nExtensive swelling of the vaccinated limb from the injection site beyond one or both joints, has been \nreported in children. These reactions start within 24 to 72 hours after vaccination, may be associated \nwith erythema, warmth, tenderness or pain at the injection site and resolve spontaneously within 3 to \n5 days. The risk appears to be dependent on the number of prior doses of acellular pertussis containing \nvaccine, with a greater risk following the 4th and 5th doses.\n\nd- Premature infants\n\nApnoea in very premature infants (≤28 weeks of gestation) (see section 4.4).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmaco-therapeutic group: Vaccines, Bacterial and viral vaccines combined, ATC code: J07CA09\n\nImmunogenicity after primary series and booster doses\n\nThe primary vaccination schedules used in clinical studies were: 2, 4 months of age without hepatitis B\nvaccination at birth; 2, 3, 4 months of age without hepatitis B vaccination at birth; and 2, 4, 6 months of \nage with and without hepatitis B vaccination at birth. The booster dose in clinical studies was given at \n11-12 months after a 2-dose primary series, at 12 months of age after a 3-dose primary series (2, 3, \n4 months), and at 15 months of age after a 3-dose primary series (2, 4, 6 months).

LLOQ = 4 EU/mL are for anti-PT, anti-PRN and anti-FIM; and LLOQ = 3 EU/mL for \nanti-FHA\n\nbDid not receive hepatitis B vaccine at birth\n\nRegarding PT and FIM, similar response rates and higher GMCs were observed both post-primary and \npost-booster in comparison to control vaccine. Lower FHA, PRN, IPV1 and IPV3 immune responses \nwere observed after a 2-dose primary schedule (2, 4 months), although the clinical relevance of these \ndata remains uncertain. Pertussis response rates were similar to the control vaccine for all pertussis \nantigens after the booster dose.\n\nThe immunogenicity of Vaxelis administered to children over 15 months of age has not been studied \nin clinical trials.\n\nPersistence of the immune response\nLong-term persistence of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen \n\nThe persistence of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) was measured in children 4 or \n5 years of age who had received Vaxelis either at 2, 4 and 11-12 months or at 2, 3, 4 and 12 months of \nage. The proportion of children seroprotected (anti-HBsAg ≥ 10 mIU/mL) after those vaccination \nschedules was 98.1% and 99.6%, respectively, and decreased to 65.7% and 70.2% approximately 4 \nyears later. Considerable study data suggest that individuals who have ever had a seroprotective \nresponse to hepatitis B vaccination will have a memory response that is protective against clinical \ndisease if exposed to the hepatitis B virus.\n\nLong-term persistence of antibodies to pertussis antigens\nThe persistence of pertussis antibodies was measured in children 4 or 5 years of age who had received \nVaxelis at 2, 4 and 11-12 months of age. After approximately 4 years, the percentages of children with \nanti-pertussis antibodies above LLOQ were as follows: anti-PT 58.4%, anti-FHA 80.9%, anti-PRN \n66.1% and anti-FIM 94.3%.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nNo pharmacokinetic studies have been performed.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies.\n\n6.

What is Vaxelis and what it is used for\n\nVaxelis is a vaccine, which helps to protect your child against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis \nB, poliomyelitis and serious diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. Vaxelis is given to \nchildren from the age of six weeks.\n\nThe vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the bacteria \nand viruses that cause the following diseases:\n Diphtheria: a bacterial infection that usually first affects the throat, causing pain and swelling \n\nwhich can lead to suffocation. The bacteria also make a toxin (poison) that can damage the \nheart, kidneys and nerves.\n\n Tetanus (often called lock jaw): caused by the tetanus bacteria entering a deep wound.

What is Vaxelis and what it is used for\n\nVaxelis is a vaccine, which helps to protect your child against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis \nB, poliomyelitis and serious diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. Vaxelis is given to \nchildren from the age of six weeks.\n\nThe vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the bacteria \nand viruses that cause the following diseases:\n Diphtheria: a bacterial infection that usually first affects the throat, causing pain and swelling \n\nwhich can lead to suffocation. The bacteria also make a toxin (poison) that can damage the \nheart, kidneys and nerves.\n\n Tetanus (often called lock jaw): caused by the tetanus bacteria entering a deep wound. The \nbacteria make a toxin (poison) that causes spasms of the muscles, leading to inability to breathe \nand the possibility of suffocation.\n\n Pertussis (often called whooping cough): a highly infectious illness that affects the airways. It \ncauses severe coughing that may lead to problems with breathing. The coughing often has a \n“whooping” sound. The cough may last for one to two months or longer. Whooping cough can \nalso cause ear infections, chest infections (bronchitis) which may last a long time, lung \ninfections (pneumonia), fits, brain damage and even death.\n\n Hepatitis B: caused by the hepatitis B virus. It causes the liver to become swollen (inflamed). In \nsome people, the virus can stay in the body for a long time, and can eventually lead to serious \nliver problems, including liver cancer.\n\n Poliomyelitis (often just called polio): caused by viruses that affect the nerves. It can lead to \nparalysis or muscle weakness most commonly of the legs. Paralysis of the muscles that control \nbreathing and swallowing can be fatal.\n\n Haemophilus influenzae type b infections (often just called Hib infections): serious bacterial \ninfections causing meningitis (inflammation of the outer covering of the brain), which can lead \nto brain damage, deafness, epilepsy, or partial blindness. Infection can also cause inflammation \nand swelling of the throat, leading to difficulties in swallowing and breathing, and infection can \n\n \n\n\n\n40\n\naffect other parts of the body such as the blood, lungs, skin, bones, and joints.\n\nImportant information about the protection provided\n Vaxelis will only help to prevent these diseases caused by the bacteria and viruses targeted by \n\nthe vaccine.
