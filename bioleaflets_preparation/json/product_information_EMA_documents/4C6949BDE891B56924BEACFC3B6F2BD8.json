NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nNUEDEXTA 15 mg/9 mg hard capsules\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach capsule contains dextromethorphan hydrobromide monohydrate, equivalent to 15.41 mg \ndextromethorphan and quinidine sulfate dihydrate, equivalent to 8.69 mg quinidine.\n\nExcipient with known effect: \n\nEach hard capsule contains 119.1 mg of lactose (as monohydrate).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nHard capsule\n\nBrick red gelatin capsule, size 1, with “DMQ / 20-10” printed in white ink on the capsule. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nNUEDEXTA is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of pseudobulbar affect (PBA) in adults (see \nsection 4.4). Efficacy has only been studied in patients with underlying Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis \nor Multiple Sclerosis (see section 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended starting dose is NUEDEXTA 15 mg/9 mg once daily. The recommended dose \ntitration schedule is outlined below: \n\n Week 1 (day 1-7):\n\nThe patient should take one NUEDEXTA 15 mg/9 mg capsule once daily, in the morning, for \nthe initial 7 days.\n\n Weeks 2-4 (day 8-28):\n\nThe patient should take one NUEDEXTA 15 mg/9 mg capsule, two times per day, one in the \nmorning and one in the evening, 12-hours apart, for 21 days.\n\n From Week 4 on:\n\nIf the clinical response with NUEDEXTA 15 mg/9 mg is adequate, the dose taken in weeks 2-4 \nshould be continued.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n3\n\nIf the clinical response with NUEDEXTA 15 mg/9 mg is inadequate, NUEDEXTA 23 mg/9 mg \nshould be prescribed, taken two times per day, one in the morning and one in the evening, 12 \nhours apart. \n\nThe maximum daily dose from week 4 onwards is NUEDEXTA 23 mg/9 mg, twice daily. \n\nIn case a dose is missed, patients should not take an additional dose, but take the prescribed next dose \nat the usual time. No more than 2 capsules should be taken in any 24-hour period, with 12 hours \nbetween each dose.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly patients\nClinical studies did not include a sufficient number of patients aged ≥65 years to conclusively \ndetermine whether they respond differently in terms of efficacy and safety. A population \npharmacokinetic analysis revealed similar pharmacokinetics in patients <65 years and those ≥65 years \nof age (see section 5.2).\n\nPatients with renal and hepatic impairment \nDose adjustment is not required in patients with mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment (see \nsection 4.4). However, as there was a trend toward increased incidence of adverse reactions in patients \nwith moderate hepatic impairment, additional monitoring of adverse reactions is advised in these \npatients. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) or severe renal impairment \n(Creatinine Clearance < 30 mL/min/1.73m2), the potential risks associated with the use of this \nmedicine should be assessed against the medical need (see section 5.2). \n\nCYP2D6 genotype\nDose adjustment is not required in patients with a non-functional CYPD2D6 enzyme, referred to as \npoor metabolisers (PMs). Dose adjustment is not required in patients with increased CYP2D6 activity, \nreferred to as ultra-rapid metabolisers (UMs), see section 5.2. In the event of inadequate clinical \nresponse, see recommended dose titration schedule.\n\nPaediatric population\nThere is no relevant use of NUEDEXTA in the paediatric population for the symptomatic treatment of \npseudobulbar affect. \n\nMethod of administration \n\nThe capsules should be taken orally at about the same time each day. When taking two capsules within \n24 hours, the recommended dose interval is 12 hours. The capsules can be taken either with or without \nfood. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nPatients with a history of quinidine-, quinine-, mefloquine-induced thrombocytopenia, hepatitis, bone \nmarrow depression or lupus-like syndrome (see section 4.4). \n\nPatients receiving concomitant treatment with quinidine, quinine, or mefloquine (see section 4.5).\n\nPatients with a prolonged QT interval, congenital long QT syndrome or a history suggestive of \ntorsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia (see section 4.4).\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n4\n\nPatients receiving concomitant treatment with thioridazine, a medicinal product that both significantly \nprolongs QT interval and is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. Interaction with NUEDEXTA may \nresult in an increased effect on QT interval (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nPatients with complete atrioventricular (AV) block without implanted pacemakers, or in patients who \nare at high risk of complete AV block (see section 4.4).\n\nPatients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or who have taken MAOIs within the \npreceding 14 days due to the risk of serious and possibly fatal drug interactions, including serotonin \nsyndrome. Treatment with an MAOI should not be initiated until at least 14 days after stopping \nNUEDEXTA (see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nNuedexta is suitable only for the treatment of PBA, not for other  causes of emotional lability. PBA is \na consequence of neurological diseases affecting the brain, or brain, injury and is defined by episodes \nof involuntary, uncontrollable emotional expressions of laughing and/or crying that are incongruous or \ndisproportionate to the patient's emotional state or mood. Before treatment with Nuedexta is initiated \npatients must be fully evaluated to confirm the diagnosis of PBA. Central to the diagnosis are the \npresence of an underlying neurological condition known to cause PBA, and confirmation that the \nepisodes of emotional expression do not reflect the patient's emotional state or mood.\n\nThrombocytopenia \nQuinidine at higher doses than in NUEDEXTA can cause immune-mediated thrombocytopenia that \ncan be severe or fatal. The risk of thrombocytopenia in association with the lower dose of quinidine in \nNUEDEXTA is unknown. Non-specific symptoms, such as light-headedness, chills, fever, nausea, and \nvomiting, can precede or occur with thrombocytopenia. NUEDEXTA should be discontinued \nimmediately if thrombocytopenia occurs, unless the thrombocytopenia is clearly not drug-related. \nLikewise, this medicinal product should not be restarted in sensitised patients, because more rapid and \nmore severe thrombocytopenia than the original episode can occur. It should not be used if immune-\nmediated thrombocytopenia from structurally related active substances including quinine and \nmefloquine is suspected, as cross-sensitivity can occur. Quinidine-associated thrombocytopenia \nusually, but not always, resolves within a few days of discontinuation of the sensitising medicinal \nproduct. \n\nOther hypersensitivity reactions  \nQuinidine at higher doses has also been associated with a lupus-like syndrome involving polyarthritis, \nsometimes with a positive antinuclear antibody test. Other associations include rash, bronchospasm, \nlymphadenopathy, haemolytic anaemia, vasculitis, uveitis, angioedema, agranulocytosis, the sicca \nsyndrome, myalgia, elevation in serum levels of skeletal-muscle enzymes, and pneumonitis. \nDextromethorphan can also be associated with hypersensitivity reactions, including uticaria, \nangioedema, and shortness of breath.\n\nHepatotoxicity \nHepatitis, including granulomatous hepatitis, has been reported in patients receiving quinidine, \ngenerally during the first few weeks of therapy. Fever may be a presenting symptom, and \nthrombocytopenia or other signs of hypersensitivity may also occur. NUEDEXTA should be \ndiscontinued if hepatitis occurs unless it is clearly not treatment related. Most cases remit when \nquinidine is withdrawn. \n\nCardiac effects \nNUEDEXTA has the potential to cause QTc prolongation and hence torsades de pointes-type \nventricular tachycardia. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia should be corrected prior to initiation of \ntherapy, and serum potassium and serum magnesium levels should be monitored during treatment if \nclinically indicated. When initiating treatment with NUEDEXTA in patients at risk of QT \nprolongation, electrocardiographic (ECG) evaluation of the QT interval should be conducted at \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n5\n\nbaseline and at 2 hours after the first dose administered in the fasted state (approximates to quinidine \nTmax). This includes patients with a family history of QT abnormality, concomitant medicinal products \nthat prolong the QT interval, and patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and/or left \nventricular dysfunction (LVD). LVH and LVD are more likely to be present in patients with chronic \nhypertension, known coronary artery disease or history of stroke. \n\nConcomitant medicinal products that both prolong the QT interval and are primarily metabolised by \nCYP2D6 (see below) are of particular potential concern. The concomitant use of thioridazine is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). Caution is required when administering NUEDEXTA in \ncombination with flecainide, chlorpromazine and haloperidol. The effect of the combination on the \npatient’s QTc interval should be evaluated with pre- and post-dose ECGs. \n\nECG should be re-evaluated if risk factors for QTc prolongation change significantly during treatment \nwith NUEDEXTA. If patients experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of cardiac \narrhythmias, e.g. syncope or palpitations, NUEDEXTA should be discontinued pending further \nevaluation of the patient. \n\nConcomitant use of CYP2D6 substrates/inhibitors \nThe quinidine in NUEDEXTA inhibits CYP2D6 in patients in whom CYP2D6 is not otherwise \ngenetically absent or of low activity (“CYP2D6 Poor Metabolisers” see “Pharmacogenomics” in \nsection 5.2). Because of this effect on CYP2D6, accumulation of parent drug substances and/or failure \nof active metabolite formation may affect the safety and/or the efficacy of medicinal products used \nconcomitantly with NUEDEXTA that are metabolised by CYP2D6 (see section 4.5). Medicinal \nproducts that are dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism, especially those with a relatively narrow \ntherapeutic index, should generally be avoided during treatment with NUEDEXTA, and patients must \nbe instructed accordingly. When concomitant use of a CYP2D6 substrate drug is considered \nnecessary, the dose of the CYP2D6 substrate should be reduced as appropriate according to the \npharmacokinetics of the substrate involved (see section 4.5). A review of the patient’s current \nmedicines is an essential part of the evaluation of patients for whom treatment with NUEDEXTA is \nproposed. \n\nSerotonin syndrome \nWhen NUEDEXTA is used with other serotoninergic medicines, the risk of “serotonin syndrome” \nmay be increased due to pharmacodynamic interaction. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome include \naltered mental status, hypertension, restlessness, myoclonus, hyperthermia, hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, \nshivering, and tremor. Treatment should be discontinued if these symptoms occur. Combination with \nMAOIs is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs e.g. desipramine, \nnortriptyline, imipramine, amitriptyline) are metabolised by CYP2D6 and therefore are also subject to \npharmacokinetic interaction with quinidine. Given the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic \ninteractions, concomitant use of NUEDEXTA and TCAs is not recommended due to the elevated risk \nof serotonin syndrome (see section 4.5). Caution should be exercised if patients are treated with \nconcomitant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\n\nDizziness \nNUEDEXTA may cause dizziness (see section 4.8). Precautions to reduce the risk of falls should be \ntaken, particularly for patients with motor impairment affecting gait or a history of falls. \n\nAnticholinergic effects of quinidine \nPatients should be monitored for worsening clinical condition in myasthenia gravis and other \nconditions that may be adversely affected by anticholinergic effects. \n\nDrug abuse and dependence \nDextromethorphan is a low-affinity uncompetitive NMDA antagonist and sigma-1 receptor agonist \nthat has not been systematically studied in animals or humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or \nphysical dependence. However, cases of dextromethorphan abuse have been reported, predominately \nin adolescents. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n6\n\nDue to the possibility of dextromethorphan abuse, physicians should evaluate patients for a history of \ndrug abuse, and observe such patients closely for signs of misuse or abuse (e.g. development of \ntolerance, increases in dose, drug-seeking behaviour). \n\nIn addition, the maintenance of the clinical effect of NUEDEXTA in the patient should be regularly \nmonitored in the long-term against its tolerability, in order to ascertain the continued benefit of the \nproduct.\n\nLactose warning\nNUEDEXTA contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the \nLapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nMAOIs \nNUEDEXTA must not be used with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as phenelzine and \nmoklobemide, or in patients who have taken MAOIs within the preceding 14 days due to the risk of \nserotonin syndrome (see section 4.3).\n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors \nQuinidine is metabolised by CYP3A4.  Concomitant administration of medicines that inhibit CYP3A4 \ncan be expected to increase plasma levels of quinidine, which could increase risk relating to QTc \nprolongation. Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided during treatment with \nNUEDEXTA. They include, but are not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, \nketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, amprenavir, aprepitant, \ndiltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil. If concomitant \ntreatment with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors is considered necessary, it is recommended that \nelectrocardiographic (ECG) evaluation of the QT interval be carried out before NUEDEXTA is \nadministered and at appropriate time point(s) subsequently. \n\nLiver enzyme inducers\nQuinidine is metabolised by CYP3A4. Potent CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, phenytoin, \nphenobarbital, carbamazepine, St John's wort/Hypericum perforatum) may accelerate the metabolism \nof quinidine, resulting in lower plasma concentrations and hence decreased inhibition of CYP2D6.  \nThis may lead to lower, potentially subtherapeutic plasma concentrations of dextromethorphan and \ndecreased efficacy of NUEDEXTA.\n\nCYP2D6 substrates \nQuinidine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6. Treatment with NUEDEXTA may therefore result in \nelevated plasma levels and accumulation of co-administered medicinal products that undergo \nextensive CYP2D6 metabolism. CYP2D6 substrates include certain beta-blockers such as metoprolol, \nantipsychotics such as haloperidol, perphenazine and aripiprazole, antidepressants such as \nnortriptyline, imipramine, amitriptyline  and desipramine, the chemotherapeutic tamoxifen, and the \nnoradrenaline transporter inhibitor atomoxetine. Thioridazine, a CYP2D6 substrates that also prolong \nthe QT interval is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  Concomitant use of flecainide, chlorpromazine or \nhaloperidol, CYP2D6 substrates that also prolong QT interval, requires caution (see section 4.4).\n\nIn the case of pro-drugs whose actions are mediated by the CYP2D6-produced metabolites (for \nexample, codeine and hydrocodone, whose analgesic and antitussive effects appear to be mediated by \nmorphine and hydromorphone, respectively), efficacy may be substantially reduced by NUEDEXTA \ndue to inhibition of CYP2D6 and hence impaired formation of the active metabolite. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n7\n\nDrug interactions with desipramine and paroxetine have been studied in controlled clinical trials with a \nhigher dose combination of dextromethorphan/quinidine (dextromethorphan 23 mg/ quinidine 26 mg) \nthan in this medicinal product; study results are described below. No other drug interactions with \nCYP2D6 substrates have been systematically investigated. \n\nDesipramine (CYP2D6 substrate)\nThe tricyclic antidepressant desipramine is metabolized primarily by CYP2D6. A drug-drug \ninteraction study was conducted between a higher combination dose of dextromethorphan/quinidine \n(dextromethorphan 23 mg/quinidine 26 mg) and desipramine 25 mg. The combination dose of \ndextromethorphan/quinidine increased steady state desipramine levels approximately 8-fold. \nConcomitant use of NUEDEXTA and TCAs is not recommended (see section 4.4).\n\nParoxetine (CYP2D6 inhibitor and substrate)\nThe selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine is metabolized primarily by CYP2D6 and \nis also a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor. In a drug-drug interaction study, a higher combination dose of \ndextromethorphan/quinidine (dextromethorphan 23 mg/quinidine 26 mg) was added to paroxetine at \nsteady state. Paroxetine exposure (AUC0-24) increased by 1.7 fold and Cmax increased by 1.5 fold. If \nNUEDEXTA and paroxetine are prescribed concomitantly, the initial dose of paroxetine should be \nreduced. The dose of paroxetine can then be adjusted based on clinical response; however, dosage \nabove 35 mg/day is not recommended. \n\nNMDA receptor antagonists (memantine)\nBoth dextromethorphan and memantine are antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor \nwhich could theoretically result in an additive effect at NMDA receptors and potentially an increased \nincidence of adverse reactions. A drug-drug interaction study was conducted between a higher \ncombination dose of dextromethorphan/quinidine (dextromethorphan 23 mg/quinidine 26 mg) and \nmemantine 20 mg/day. There was no significant difference in the plasma concentrations of \ndextromethorphan and dextrorphan before and after the administration of memantine, and there was no \neffect on the plasma concentrations of memantine before and after the administration of \ndextromethorphan/quinidine. Plasma concentrations of quinidine increased 20-30% when memantine \nwas added. No pharmacodynamic interactions were apparent.\n\nDigoxin and other P-glycoprotein substrates\nQuinidine is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. Concomitant administration of quinidine with digoxin, a \nP-glycoprotein substrate, results in serum digoxin levels that may be as much as doubled. Plasma \ndigoxin concentrations should be closely monitored in patients taking NUEDEXTA concomitantly, \nand the digoxin dose reduced, as necessary. Other P-gp substrates for which a dose reduction may be \nconsidered include ticagrelor and dabigatran-etexilate.\n\nAlcohol \nCaution should be used when this medicinal product is taken in combination with alcohol or other \ncentrally acting medicinal products that might increase the risk of adverse reactions such as \nsomnolence and dizziness.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of NUEDEXTA in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals (rats and rabbits) have shown developmental toxicity, including teratogenicity and embryo-\nlethality (see section 5.3).\n\nAs this medicinal product may cause foetal harm, it is not recommended during pregnancy and in \nwomen of childbearing potential not using contraception.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n8\n\nBreast-feeding\nQuinidine is excreted in human milk and it is unknown whether dextromethorphan is excreted in \nhuman milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \nNUEDEXTA therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\nIn pre-clinical studies no effect on fertility was observed in male and female rats (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNUEDEXTA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should \nbe warned about the potential for CNS-related effects like somnolence, dizziness and syncope or \nimpaired vision (see section 4.8), and advised not to drive or operate machinery if these symptoms \noccur.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe safety of NUEDEXTA was investigated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, \nmulticenter study over 12 weeks in 326 PBA patients with underlying ALS (60%) or MS (40%) and in \na follow-up open-label extension phase with a patient subgroup of this study (253 patients) for an \nadditional 84 days.\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are gastrointestinal disorders (such as diarrhoea, \nnausea), nervous system disorders (such as dizziness, headache, somnolence) and fatigue.\n\nSerious adverse reactions have been reported for NUEDEXTA; these are muscle spasticity, respiratory \ndepression and decreased oxygen saturation in the blood. \n\nTen patients discontinued study treatment due to ADRs, one of these patients due to a serious ADR \n(worsening muscle spasticity).\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nThe adverse reactions considered at least possibly related to treatment with NUEDEXTA in the \nplacebo-controlled and the open-label extension phase of the above mentioned clinical study are listed \nbelow by body system organ class and frequency.\n very common (≥1/10)\n common (≥1/100 to <1/10)\n uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100)\n rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000)\n very rare (<1/10,000)\n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse Reaction\n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nUncommon Decreased appetite \n\nRare Anorexia \n\nPsychiatric disorders Uncommon Anxiety\n\nRare\n\n Bruxism, Confusional state, Depressed mood, \nDepression, Disorientation, Early morning awakening, \nFlat affect, Hallucination, Impulsive behaviour, \nIndifference, Insomnia, Restlessness, Sleep disorder\n\nNervous system \ndisorders\n\nCommon Dizziness, Headache, Somnolence\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n9\n\nUncommon Dysgeusia, Hypersomnia, Muscle spasticity, Syncope, Fall\n\nRare\nBalance disorder, Coordination abnormal, Dysarthria, Motor \ndysfunction, Paraesthesia, Paraparesis, Sedation\n\nEye disorders Rare Diplopia, Vision blurred\n\nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders\n\nUncommon Motion sickness, Tinnitus\n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon\nAtrioventricular block first degree, Electrocardiogram QT \nprolonged\n\nRare\n Myocardial infarction, Palpitations, Ventricular \n\nextrasystoles\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders\n\nRare\n Epistaxis, Pharyngolaryngeal pain, Respiratory \n\ndepression, Rhinorrhoea, Yawning\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nCommon Diarrhoea, Nausea\n\nUncommon\nAbdominal pain, Constipation, Dry mouth, Flatulence, \nStomach discomfort, Vomiting\n\nRare\n Abnormal faeces, Dyspepsia, Gastritis, Hypoaesthesia \n\noral, Paraesthesia oral, Proctalgia, Tongue dry\n\nHepatobiliary disorders Uncommon Increased hepatic enzymes (GGT, AST, ALT)\n\nRare\nCholelithiasis, blood bilirubin increased, Liver function test \nabnormal,  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nUncommon Rash\n\nRare Erythema, Hyperhidrosis, Hypoaesthesia facial, Night sweats\n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders\n\nUncommon Muscle spasms\n\nRare\nMusculoskeletal stiffness, Myalgia, Neck pain, Pain in \nextremity\n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders\n\nRare Pollakiuria\n\nReproductive system \nand breast disorders\n\nRare Sexual dysfunction\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions\n\nCommon Fatigue\n\nUncommon Asthenia, Irritability\n\nRare \nChest discomfort, Chest pain, Chills, Feeling hot, Gait \ndisturbance, Influenza like illness, Pyrexia,  Oxygen \nsaturation decreased\n\nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural \ncomplications \n\nRare Skeletal injury \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.

Metabolism of dextromethorphan is inhibited by quinidine, such that \nadverse reactions of overdose due to NUEDEXTA might be more severe or more persistent compared \nto overdose of dextromethorphan alone. \n\nDuring development of this medicinal product, dose combinations of dextromethorphan/quinidine \ncontaining up to 6-times higher dextromethorphan dose and 12-times higher quinidine dose were \nstudied. The most common adverse reactions were mild to moderate nausea, dizziness, and headache. \n\nDextromethorphan\nAdverse reactions of dextromethorphan overdose include nausea, vomiting, stupor, coma, respiratory \ndepression, seizures, tachycardia, hyperexcitability, and toxic psychosis. Other adverse reactions \ninclude ataxia, nystagmus, dystonia, blurred vision, and changes in muscle reflexes. \nDextromethorphan may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, and this risk is increased by overdose, \nparticularly if taken with other serotonergic agents, SSRIs or tricyclic antidepressants.\n\nQuinidine\nThe most important effects of acute overdoses are ventricular arrhythmias and hypotension. Other \nsigns and symptoms of overdose may include vomiting, diarrhoea, tinnitus, high-frequency hearing \nloss, vertigo, blurred vision, diplopia, photophobia, headache, confusion, and delirium.\n\nWhile therapeutic doses of quinidine for treatment of cardiac arrhythmia or malaria are generally ≥10-\nfold higher than the dose of quinidine in this medicinal product, potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmia, \nincluding torsades de pointes, can occur at quinidine exposures that are possible from NUEDEXTA \noverdose.\n\nTreatment of overdose \nQuinidine\nThe treatment of cardiac effects (haemodynamically unstable polymorphic ventricular tachycardia \n(including torsades de pointes)) is either immediate cardioversion or immediate overdrive pacing. \nOther antiarrhythmics with Class I (procainamide) or Class III activities should (if possible) be \navoided. Treatment of hypotension and of other signs and symptoms should be directed at \nsymptomatic and supportive measures. Administration of activated charcoal in conventional dose of \n1 g/kg, administered every 2 to 6 hours as a slurry with 8 mL/kg of tap water may enhance the \nsystemic elimination of quinidine; this measures should be avoided if an ileus is present. Methods as \nto acidify the urine and dialysis are of no demonstrated benefit. Drugs that delay elimination of \nquinidine (cimetidine, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, thiazide diuretics) should be withdrawn unless \nabsolutely required. \n\nDextromethorphan\nTreatment of dextromethorphan overdose should be directed at symptomatic and supportive measures.\nGastric lavage may be of use. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs; ATC code: N07XX59\n\nDextromethorphan hydrobromide is the pharmacologically active ingredient that acts on the central \nnervous system (CNS).  Quinidine sulfate is a specific inhibitor of CYP2D6-dependent oxidative \nmetabolism used to increase the systemic bioavailability of dextromethorphan. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n11\n\nMechanism of action\nThe exact mechanism by which dextromethorphan exerts therapeutic effects in patients with \npseudobulbar affect is unknown.  Quinidine increases plasma levels of dextromethorphan by \ncompetitively inhibiting cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), which catalyses a major biotransformation \npathway for dextromethorphan.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nDextromethorphan is a sigma-1 receptor agonist and an uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist.  In \naddition it shows affinity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) and for the 5-HT1B/D receptor. \nThrough its binding to the NMDA, sigma-1, SERT and 5-HT1B/D receptors, dextromethorphan is \nthought to have a modulatory effect on neurotransmission involving glutamate, monoamines \n(including serotonin), as well as ion channel function. \n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nThe efficacy of dextromethorphan/quinidine for the treatment of PBA was demonstrated in three \nrandomised, controlled, double-blind, multicentre clinical trials in PBA subjects with underlying \namyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or multiple sclerosis (MS). Eligible patients had a diagnosis of \nPBA defined by episodes of involuntary, uncontrollable emotional expressions of laughing and/or \ncrying that are incongruous or disproportionate to their emotional state or mood.\n\nIn all studies, the efficacy endpoints were “Count of episodes of laughing and crying” (PBA episodes) \nand subject scores on the Center for Neurologic Studies - Lability Scale (CNS-LS), a validated 7-item, \nself-administered questionnaire that provides a quantitative measure of the frequency and severity of \nPBA. CNS-LS scores range from a minimum of 7 (no symptoms) to a maximum of 35.\n\n Pivotal study (07-AVR-123)\n\nIn this placebo-controlled 12-week study, 326 PBA subjects with underlying ALS or MS were \nrandomized to receive NUEDEXTA 15 mg / 9 mg, (n=107), NUEDEXTA 23 mg / 9 mg (n=110), or \nplacebo (n=109) for 12 weeks. \n\nSubjects were 25 to 80 years of age with a mean age of approximately 51 years. Approximately 74% \nwere Caucasian, 4% were Black, 1% were Asian and 19% were of Hispanic origin. 60% of subjects \nhad underlying ALS and 40% of subjects had underlying MS. All subjects had clinically relevant PBA \nsymptoms, quantified as CNS-LS score of 13 or more.\n\nMean baseline daily PBA episode rates (calculated from the total number of episodes reported for up \nto 7 pre-treatment days) were 4.7 in the NUEDEXTA 23 mg/9 mg group, 6.8 in the NUEDEXTA 15\nmg/9 mg group, and 4.5 in the placebo group.\n\nMean baseline CNS-LS scores were 19.8 in the NUEDEXTA 23 mg /9 mg group, 21.0 in the \nNUEDEXTA 15 mg /9 mg group, and 19.9 in the placebo group.\n\nTo evaluate long-term data, 253 subjects who completed the double-blind study phase had the option \nof entering an open-label extension phase, receiving NUEDEXTA 23 mg /9 mg for another 84 days.\n\nThe frequency of PBA episodes as measured by “Count of Episodes” in both NUEDEXTA treatment \ngroups decreased significantly throughout the course of the study by an incremental reduction of 47% \nand 49% relative to placebo, respectively (p <0.0001 for both comparisons). \n\nThe least-squares mean CNS-LS scores were significantly reduced at the end of treatment in both \ntreatment groups compared to placebo (8.2 point reduction for NUEDEXTA 23 mg /9 mg, 7.5 point \nreduction for NUEDEXTA 15 mg /9 mg, 5.7 point reduction for placebo). The p-value for \nNUEDEXTA 23 mg /9 mg vs placebo was p=0.0002 and for NUEDEXTA 15 mg /9 mg  vs placebo \nwas p=0.008.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n12\n\nThe 12-week open-label phase of the study (during which all subjects received NUEDEXTA 23 mg /\n9 mg) showed persistence of the effect observed in the placebo controlled period.\n\n• Studies with Higher Dose Combinations of dextromethorphan / quinidine\n\nTwo additional phase III studies were conducted using a higher dose combination of \ndextromethorphan 23 mg/quinidine 26 mg. The higher dose of quinidine used in these studies would \nhave resulted in approximately a 1.6 fold greater exposure to of dextromethorphan than with \nNUEDEXTA 23 mg/ 9 mg.\n\nThe first was a 4-week study in PBA subjects with underlying ALS, and the second was a 12-week \nstudy in subjects with underlying MS. In both studies the primary outcome measure, CNS-LS, and the \nsecondary outcome measure, “count of episodes of laughing and crying”, were statistically \nsignificantly decreased by the dextromethorphan/quinidine combination.\n\nA 12 month open-label safety study, also using the higher dose combination of dextromethorphan \n23 mg /quinidine 26 mg, included 553 subjects with PBA associated with thirty-four different \nneurological conditions. Approximately 30% of study participants carried diagnoses other than ALS \nand MS, including stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and other \ndementia, primary lateral sclerosis, progressive bulbar palsy, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Only \nsafety data were collected in this study; no new safety signals were identified.\n\n• Studies to Assess Cardiac Effects\n\nThe effect of NUEDEXTA 23 mg / 9 mg (for 7 consecutive doses) on QTc prolongation was \nevaluated in a randomised, double-blind (except for moxifloxacin), placebo- and positive-controlled \n(400 mg moxifloxacin) crossover thorough QT study in 50 fasted normal healthy men and women \nwith CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer (EM) genotype. Mean changes in QTcF were 6.8 ms for \nNUEDEXTA 23 mg/ 9 mg and 9.1 ms for the reference positive control (moxifloxacin). The \nmaximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference from placebo after baseline correction was \n10.2 (12.6) ms. This test dose is adequate to represent the steady state exposure in patients with \nCYP2D6 extensive metabolizer phenotype.\n\nThe effects of supra-therapeutic doses of dextromethorphan /quinidine (23 mg /26 mg and 46 mg /\n53 mg, for 7 consecutive doses) on QTc prolongation were evaluated in a randomised, placebo-\ncontrolled, double-blind, crossover design with an additional open-label positive control (400 mg \nmoxifloxacin) arm in 36 healthy volunteers. The maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) \ndifferences from placebo after baseline-correction were 10.2 (14.6) and 18.4 (22.7) ms following \ndextromethorphan/quinidine doses of 23 mg /26 mg and 46 mg /53 mg, respectively. The supra-\ntherapeutic doses are adequate to represent quinidine exposure increases due to drug-drug interactions \nand organ dysfunctions.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nNUEDEXTA in all subsets of the paediatric population in PBA (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing single and repeated combination doses of NUEDEXTA 23 mg / 9 mg, subjects had an \napproximately 20-fold increase in dextromethorphan exposure compared to subjects given \ndextromethorphan without quinidine. \n\nFollowing repeated doses of NUEDEXTA 23 mg / 9 mg and NUEDEXTA 15 mg / 9 mg, maximal \nplasma concentrations (Cmax) of dextromethorphan are reached approximately 3 to 4 hours after dosing \nand maximal plasma concentrations of quinidine are reached approximately 2 hours after dosing. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n13\n\nIn extensive metabolizers, mean Cmax and AUC0-12 values of dextromethorphan and dextrorphan \nincreased as doses of dextromethorphan increased from 15 mg to 23 mg and mean Cmax and AUC0-12 \nvalues of quinidine were similar. \n\nThe mean plasma Cmax of quinidine following NUEDEXTA 15 mg / 9 mg twice daily in subjects with \nPBA was 1 to 3% of the therapeutic concentrations associated with antiarrhythmic efficacy (2 to \n5 µg/mL). \n\nNUEDEXTA may be taken without regard to meals as food does not affect the exposure of \ndextromethorphan and quinidine significantly.\n\nDistribution\nAfter administration of the combination product, protein binding remains essentially the same as that \nafter administration of the individual components; dextromethorphan is approximately 60-70% protein \nbound, and quinidine is approximately 80-89% protein bound. \n\nBiotransformation and elimination\nDextromethorphan is rapidly metabolized by CYP2D6 to its primary metabolite, dextrorphan, which is \nrapidly glucuronidated and renally eliminated. The quinidine component of NUEDEXTA serves to \nselectively inhibit CYP2D6-dependent oxidative metabolism of dextromethorphan, thus increasing \ndextromethorphan plasma concentrations. In the presence of quinidine, CYP3A4-dependent oxidative \nmetabolism is believed to play a greater role in dextromethorphan elimination.\n\nAfter administration of NUEDEXTA 23 mg/9 mg to 14 extensive metabolizers, the elimination half-\nlife of dextromethorphan was 18.8 hours and the elimination half-life of quinidine was 9.6 hours. \n\nQuinidine is metabolized by CYP3A4. There are several hydroxylated metabolites of quinidine. The \nmajor metabolite is 3-hydroxyquinidine, which is considered to be at least half as pharmacologically \nactive as quinidine with respect to cardiac effects such as QT prolongation. There are currently limited \ndata on the magnitude of the effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetic parameters of \nquinidine and its metabolites, including the potential for accumulation at steady state. \n\nWhen the urine pH is less than 7, about 20% of administered quinidine appears unchanged in the \nurine, but this fraction drops to as little as 5% when the urine is more alkaline. Renal clearance \ninvolves both glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, moderated by (pH-dependent) tubular \nreabsorption.\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\nPlasma concentrations of dextromethorphan and dextrorphan are proportional to dextromethorphan \ndose in the presence of a fixed dose of quinidine such as that contained in NUEDEXTA. Quinidine \nplasma concentrations are proportional to quinidine dose. \n\nIn vitro CYP P450 interaction studies \nThe potential for dextromethorphan and quinidine to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 in vitro were \nevaluated in human microsomes. Dextromethorphan did not inhibit (<20% inhibition) any of the tested \nisoenzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or \nCYP3A4 in human liver microsomes at concentrations up to 5 µM. Quinidine did not inhibit (<30% \ninhibition) CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4 in \nhuman microsomes at concentrations up to 5 µM. Quinidine inhibited CYP2D6 with a half maximal \ninhibitory concentration (IC50) of less than 0.05 µM. Neither dextromethorphan nor quinidine induced \nCYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 in human hepatocytes at concentrations up to 4.8 µM. \n\nIn vitro transporter interaction studies\nBased on the results of transporter inhibition studies drug-drug interactions related to \ndextromethorphan inhibition of P-gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3 or BSEP are not \nexpected during treatment withNUEDEXTA. Dextromethorphan has been shown to be a \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n14\n\nmild/moderate inhibitor of the OCT1 transporter in vitro. The clinical relevance of this observation to \ndrugs that are OCT1 substrates, such as metformin, is unknown.\n\nBased on literature citations, drug-drug interactions as a result of quinidine inhibition of OATP1B1, \nOCT1, OCT2, OAT3, BSEP, MATE1, and MATE2-K are not expected.\n\nSpecial Populations \n\nElderly patients\nThe pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan/quinidine have not been investigated systematically in \nelderly subjects (aged >65 years) although such subjects were included in the clinical programme \n(14% ≥65 years, 2% ≥75 years). \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis of 170 subjects (148 subjects <65 years old and 22 subjects \n≥65 years old) administered dextromethorphan 23 mg / quinidine 26 mg revealed similar \npharmacokinetics in subjects <65 years and those ≥65 years of age. \n\nGender \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis based on data from 109 subjects (75 male; 34 female) showed \nno apparent gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan/quinidine.\n\nRace \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis of race with 109 subjects (21 Caucasian; 71 Hispanic; 18 \nBlack) revealed no apparent racial differences in the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan/quinidine. \n\nRenal impairment \nIn a study of a combination dose of dextromethorphan 23 mg / quinidine 26 mg twice daily in 12 \nsubjects with mild (CLCR 50-80 mL/min) or moderate (CLCR 30-50 mL/min) renal impairment (6 \neach) compared to 9 healthy subjects (matched in gender, age, and weight range to impaired subjects), \nsubjects showed little difference in quinidine or dextromethorphan pharmacokinetics compared to \nhealthy subjects. Dose adjustment is therefore not required in mild or moderate renal impairment. \nDextromethorphan / quinidine has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment. \n\nHepatic impairment \nIn a study of a combination dose of dextromethorphan 23 mg / quinidine 26 mg twice daily in 12 \nsubjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (as indicated by the Child-Pugh method; 6 each) \ncompared to 9 healthy subjects (matched in gender, age, and weight range to impaired subjects), \nsubjects with moderate hepatic impairment showed similar dextromethorphan AUC and Cmax and \nclearance compared to healthy subjects. Mild to moderate hepatic impairment had little effect on \nquinidine pharmacokinetics. Quinidine clearance is unaffected, although there is an increased volume \nof distribution that leads to an increase in the elimination half-life. Patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment showed an increased frequency of adverse reactions. Therefore, dosage adjustment is not \nrequired in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, although additional monitoring for \nadverse reactions should be considered in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Dose increase, if \nwarranted, should be undertaken with caution in these patients. Neither dextromethorphan alone nor \ndextromethorphan/quinidine has been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\n\nPharmacogenomics \nThe quinidine component is intended to inhibit CYP2D6 so that higher exposure to dextromethorphan \ncan be achieved compared to when dextromethorphan is given alone. Approximately 7-8% of \nindividuals of Caucasian descent, 3-6% of Black African descent, 2-3% of Arab descent and 1-2% of \nAsian descent generally lack the capacity to metabolize CYP2D6 substrates and are classified as Poor \nMetabolizer (PMs). The quinidine component is not expected to contribute to the effectiveness of \nNUEDEXTA in PMs, but adverse reactions of the quinidine component are still possible. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n15\n\nApproximately 1-10% of individuals of Caucasian descent, 5-30% of Black African descent, 12-40% \nof Arab descent and 1% of Asian descent exhibit increased metabolic activity for CYP2D6 substrates \nand are classified as Ultra-rapid Metabolizer (UMs). In such UM patients, dextromethorphan is rapidly \nmetabolised, leading to lower, potentially subtherapeutic concentrations. \n\nPaediatric population\nThe pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan/quinidine in paediatric patients has not been studied (see \nsection 5.1). \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for a genotoxicity or carcinogenic potential, nor for fertility \nimpairment.\n\nIn embryo-fetal and developmental toxicity studies (rats and rabbits) with dextromethorphan \nhydrobromide/quinidine sulfate, abnormalities were observed at mid and high dose with reduced \nossification from the lowest dose in rats which is approximately 1 and 50 times the human dose of \n30/18 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis, respectively.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nNUEDEXTA 23 mg/9 mg hard capsules\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach capsule contains dextromethorphan hydrobromide monohydrate, equivalent to 23.11 mg \ndextromethorphan and quinidine sulfate dihydrate, equivalent to 8.69 mg quinidine.\n\nExcipient with known effect: \n\nEach hard capsule contains 109.2 mg of lactose (as monohydrate).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nHard capsule\n\nBrick red gelatin capsule, size 1, with “DMQ / 30-10” printed in white ink on the capsule and three \nwhite bands around the circumference. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nNUEDEXTA is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of pseudobulbar affect (PBA) in adults (see \nsection 4.4). Efficacy has only been studied in patients with underlying Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis \nor Multiple Sclerosis (see section 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended starting dose is NUEDEXTA 15 mg/9 mg once daily. The recommended dose \ntitration schedule is outlined below: \n\n Week 1 (day 1-7):\n\nThe patient should take one NUEDEXTA 15 mg/9 mg capsule once daily, in the morning, for \nthe initial 7 days.\n\n Weeks 2-4 (day 8-28):\n\nThe patient should take one NUEDEXTA 15 mg/9 mg capsule, two times per day, one in the \nmorning and one in the evening, 12-hours apart, for 21 days.\n\n From Week 4 on:\n\nIf the clinical response with NUEDEXTA 15 mg/9 mg is adequate, the dose taken in weeks 2-4 \nshould be continued.  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n18\n\nIf the clinical response with NUEDEXTA 15 mg/9 mg is inadequate, NUEDEXTA 23 mg/9 mg \nshould be prescribed, taken two times per day, one in the morning and one in the evening, 12 \nhours apart. \n\nThe maximum daily dose from week 4 onwards is NUEDEXTA 23 mg/9 mg, twice daily. \n\nIn case a dose is missed, patients should not take an additional dose, but take the prescribed next dose \nat the usual time. No more than 2 capsules should be taken in any 24-hour period, with 12 hours \nbetween each dose.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly patients\nClinical studies did not include a sufficient number of patients aged ≥65 years to conclusively \ndetermine whether they respond differently in terms of efficacy and safety. A population \npharmacokinetic analysis revealed similar pharmacokinetics in patients <65 years and those ≥65 years \nof age (see section 5.2).\n\nPatients with renal and hepatic impairment \nDose adjustment is not required in patients with mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment (see \nsection 4.4). However, as there was a trend toward increased incidence of adverse reactions in patients \nwith moderate hepatic impairment, additional monitoring of adverse reactions is advised in these \npatients. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) or severe renal impairment \n(Creatinine Clearance < 30 mL/min/1.73m2), the potential risks associated with the use of this \nmedicine should be assessed against the medical need (see section 5.2). \n\nCYP2D6 genotype\nDose adjustment is not required in patients with a non-functional CYPD2D6 enzyme, referred to as \npoor metabolisers (PMs). Dose adjustment is not required in patients with increased CYP2D6 activity, \nreferred to as ultra-rapid metabolisers (UMs), see section 5.2. In the event of inadequate clinical \nresponse, see recommended dose titration schedule.\n\nPaediatric population\nThere is no relevant use of NUEDEXTA in the paediatric population for the symptomatic treatment of \npseudobulbar affect. \n\nMethod of administration \n\nThe capsules should be taken orally at about the same time each day. When taking two capsules within\n24 hours, the recommended dose interval is 12 hours. The capsules can be taken either with or without \nfood. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nPatients with a history of quinidine-, quinine-, mefloquine-induced thrombocytopenia, hepatitis, bone \nmarrow depression or lupus-like syndrome (see section 4.4). \n\nPatients receiving concomitant treatment with quinidine, quinine, or mefloquine (see section 4.5).\n\nPatients with a prolonged QT interval, congenital long QT syndrome or a history suggestive of \ntorsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia (see section 4.4).\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n19\n\nPatients receiving concomitant treatment with thioridazine, a medicinal product that both significantly \nprolongs QT interval and is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. Interaction with NUEDEXTA may \nresult in an increased effect on QT interval (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nPatients with complete atrioventricular (AV) block without implanted pacemakers, or in patients who \nare at high risk of complete AV block (see section 4.4).\n\nPatients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or who have taken MAOIs within the \npreceding 14 days due to the risk of serious and possibly fatal drug interactions, including serotonin \nsyndrome. Treatment with an MAOI should not be initiated until at least 14 days after stopping \nNUEDEXTA (see section 4.5).\n\n4.3 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nNuedexta is suitable only for the treatment of PBA, not for other  causes of emotional lability. PBA is \na consequence of neurological diseases affecting the brain, or brain, injury and is defined by episodes \nof involuntary, uncontrollable emotional expressions of laughing and/or crying that are incongruous or \ndisproportionate to the patient's emotional state or mood. Before treatment with Nuedexta is initiated \npatients must be fully evaluated to confirm the diagnosis of PBA. Central to the diagnosis are the \npresence of an underlying neurological condition known to cause PBA, and confirmation that the \nepisodes of emotional expression do not reflect the patient's emotional state or mood.\n\nThrombocytopenia \nQuinidine at higher doses than in NUEDEXTA can cause immune-mediated thrombocytopenia that \ncan be severe or fatal. The risk of thrombocytopenia in association with the lower dose of quinidine in \nNUEDEXTA is unknown. Non-specific symptoms, such as light-headedness, chills, fever, nausea, and \nvomiting, can precede or occur with thrombocytopenia. NUEDEXTA should be discontinued \nimmediately if thrombocytopenia occurs, unless the thrombocytopenia is clearly not drug-related. \nLikewise, this medicinal product should not be restarted in sensitised patients, because more rapid and \nmore severe thrombocytopenia than the original episode can occur. It should not be used if immune-\nmediated thrombocytopenia from structurally related active substances including quinine and \nmefloquine is suspected, as cross-sensitivity can occur. Quinidine-associated thrombocytopenia \nusually, but not always, resolves within a few days of discontinuation of the sensitising medicinal \nproduct. \n\nOther hypersensitivity reactions  \nQuinidine at higher doses has also been associated with a lupus-like syndrome involving polyarthritis, \nsometimes with a positive antinuclear antibody test. Other associations include rash, bronchospasm, \nlymphadenopathy, haemolytic anaemia, vasculitis, uveitis, angioedema, agranulocytosis, the sicca \nsyndrome, myalgia, elevation in serum levels of skeletal-muscle enzymes, and pneumonitis. \nDextromethorphan can also be associated with hypersensitivity reactions, including uticaria, \nangioedema, and shortness of breath.\n\nHepatotoxicity \nHepatitis, including granulomatous hepatitis, has been reported in patients receiving quinidine, \ngenerally during the first few weeks of therapy. Fever may be a presenting symptom, and \nthrombocytopenia or other signs of hypersensitivity may also occur. NUEDEXTA should be \ndiscontinued if hepatitis occurs unless it is clearly not treatment related. Most cases remit when \nquinidine is withdrawn. \n\nCardiac effects \nNUEDEXTA has the potential to cause QTc prolongation and hence torsades de pointes-type \nventricular tachycardia. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia should be corrected prior to initiation of \ntherapy, and serum potassium and serum magnesium levels should be monitored during treatment if \nclinically indicated. When initiating treatment with NUEDEXTA in patients at risk of QT \nprolongation, electrocardiographic (ECG) evaluation of the QT interval should be conducted at \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n20\n\nbaseline and at 2 hours after the first dose administered in the fasted state (approximates to quinidine \nTmax). This includes patients with a family history of QT abnormality, concomitant medicinal products \nthat prolong the QT interval, and patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and/or left \nventricular dysfunction (LVD). LVH and LVD are more likely to be present in patients with chronic \nhypertension, known coronary artery disease or history of stroke. \n\nConcomitant medicinal products that both prolong the QT interval and are primarily metabolised by \nCYP2D6 (see below) are of particular potential concern. The concomitant use of thioridazine is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). Caution is required when administering NUEDEXTA in \ncombination with flecainide, chlorpromazine and haloperidol. The effect of the combination on the \npatient’s QTc interval should be evaluated with pre- and post-dose ECGs. \n\nECG should be re-evaluated if risk factors for QTc prolongation change significantly during treatment \nwith NUEDEXTA. If patients experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of cardiac \narrhythmias, e.g. syncope or palpitations, NUEDEXTA should be discontinued pending further \nevaluation of the patient. \n\nConcomitant use of CYP2D6 substrates/inhibitors \nThe quinidine in NUEDEXTA inhibits CYP2D6 in patients in whom CYP2D6 is not otherwise \ngenetically absent or of low activity (“CYP2D6 Poor Metabolisers” see “Pharmacogenomics” in \nsection 5.2). Because of this effect on CYP2D6, accumulation of parent drug substances and/or failure \nof active metabolite formation may affect the safety and/or the efficacy of medicinal products used \nconcomitantly with NUEDEXTA that are metabolised by CYP2D6 (see section 4.5). Medicinal \nproducts that are dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism, especially those with a relatively narrow \ntherapeutic index, should generally be avoided during treatment with NUEDEXTA, and patients must \nbe instructed accordingly. When concomitant use of a CYP2D6 substrate drug is considered \nnecessary, the dose of the CYP2D6 substrate should be reduced as appropriate according to the \npharmacokinetics of the substrate involved (see section 4.5). A review of the patient’s current \nmedicines is an essential part of the evaluation of patients for whom treatment with NUEDEXTA is \nproposed. \n\nSerotonin syndrome \nWhen NUEDEXTA is used with other serotoninergic medicines, the risk of “serotonin syndrome” \nmay be increased due to pharmacodynamic interaction. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome include \naltered mental status, hypertension, restlessness, myoclonus, hyperthermia, hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, \nshivering, and tremor. Treatment should be discontinued if these symptoms occur. Combination with \nMAOIs is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs e.g. desipramine, \nnortriptyline, imipramine, amitriptyline) are metabolised by CYP2D6 and therefore are also subject to \npharmacokinetic interaction with quinidine. Given the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic \ninteractions, concomitant use of NUEDEXTA and TCAs is not recommended due to the elevated risk \nof serotonin syndrome (see section 4.5). Caution should be exercised if patients are treated with \nconcomitant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\n\nDizziness \nNUEDEXTA may cause dizziness (see section 4.8). Precautions to reduce the risk of falls should be \ntaken, particularly for patients with motor impairment affecting gait or a history of falls. \n\nAnticholinergic effects of quinidine \nPatients should be monitored for worsening clinical condition in myasthenia gravis and other \nconditions that may be adversely affected by anticholinergic effects. \n\nDrug abuse and dependence \nDextromethorphan is a low-affinity uncompetitive NMDA antagonist and sigma-1 receptor agonist \nthat has not been systematically studied in animals or humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or \nphysical dependence. However, cases of dextromethorphan abuse have been reported, predominately \nin adolescents. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n21\n\nDue to the possibility of dextromethorphan abuse, physicians should evaluate patients for a history of \ndrug abuse, and observe such patients closely for signs of misuse or abuse (e.g. development of \ntolerance, increases in dose, drug-seeking behaviour). \n\nIn addition, the maintenance of the clinical effect of NUEDEXTA in the patient should be regularly \nmonitored in the long-term against its tolerability, in order to ascertain the continued benefit of the \nproduct.\n\nLactose warning\nNUEDEXTA contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the \nLapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nMAOIs \nNUEDEXTA must not be used with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as phenelzine and \nmoklobemide, or in patients who have taken MAOIs within the preceding 14 days due to the risk of \nserotonin syndrome (see section 4.3).\n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors \nQuinidine is metabolised by CYP3A4.  Concomitant administration of medicines that inhibit CYP3A4 \ncan be expected to increase plasma levels of quinidine, which could increase risk relating to QTc \nprolongation. Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided during treatment with \nNUEDEXTA. They include, but are not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, \nketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, amprenavir, aprepitant, \ndiltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil. If concomitant \ntreatment with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors is considered necessary, it is recommended that \nelectrocardiographic (ECG) evaluation of the QT interval be carried out before NUEDEXTA is \nadministered and at appropriate time point(s) subsequently. \n\nLiver enzyme inducers\nQuinidine is metabolised by CYP3A4. Potent CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, phenytoin, \nphenobarbital, carbamazepine, St John's wort/Hypericum perforatum) may accelerate the metabolism \nof quinidine, resulting in lower plasma concentrations and hence decreased inhibition of CYP2D6.  \nThis may lead to lower, potentially subtherapeutic plasma concentrations of dextromethorphan and \ndecreased efficacy of NUEDEXTA.\n\nCYP2D6 substrates \nQuinidine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6. Treatment with NUEDEXTA may therefore result in \nelevated plasma levels and accumulation of co-administered medicinal products that undergo \nextensive CYP2D6 metabolism. CYP2D6 substrates include certain beta-blockers such as metoprolol, \nantipsychotics such as haloperidol, perphenazine and aripiprazole, antidepressants such as \nnortriptyline, imipramine, amitriptyline  and desipramine, the chemotherapeutic tamoxifen, and the \nnoradrenaline transporter inhibitor atomoxetine. Thioridazine, a CYP2D6 substrates that also prolong \nthe QT interval is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  Concomitant use of flecainide, chlorpromazine or \nhaloperidol, CYP2D6 substrates that also prolong QT interval, requires caution (see section 4.4).\n\nIn the case of pro-drugs whose actions are mediated by the CYP2D6-produced metabolites (for \nexample, codeine and hydrocodone, whose analgesic and antitussive effects appear to be mediated by \nmorphine and hydromorphone, respectively), efficacy may be substantially reduced by NUEDEXTA \ndue to inhibition of CYP2D6 and hence impaired formation of the active metabolite. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n22\n\nDrug interactions with desipramine and paroxetine have been studied in controlled clinical trials with a \nhigher dose combination of dextromethorphan/quinidine (dextromethorphan 23 mg/ quinidine 26 mg) \nthan in this medicinal product; study results are described below. No other drug interactions with \nCYP2D6 substrates have been systematically investigated. \n\nDesipramine (CYP2D6 substrate)\nThe tricyclic antidepressant desipramine is metabolized primarily by CYP2D6. A drug-drug \ninteraction study was conducted between a higher combination dose of dextromethorphan/quinidine \n(dextromethorphan 23 mg/quinidine 26 mg) and desipramine 25 mg. The combination dose of \ndextromethorphan/quinidine increased steady state desipramine levels approximately 8-fold. \nConcomitant use of NUEDEXTA and TCAs is not recommended (see section 4.4).\n\nParoxetine (CYP2D6 inhibitor and substrate)\nThe selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine is metabolized primarily by CYP2D6 and \nis also a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor. In a drug-drug interaction study, a higher combination dose of \ndextromethorphan/quinidine (dextromethorphan 23 mg/quinidine 26 mg) was added to paroxetine at \nsteady state. Paroxetine exposure (AUC0-24) increased by 1.7 fold and Cmax increased by 1.5 fold. If \nNUEDEXTA and paroxetine are prescribed concomitantly, the initial dose of paroxetine should be \nreduced. The dose of paroxetine can then be adjusted based on clinical response; however, dosage \nabove 35 mg/day is not recommended. \n\nNMDA receptor antagonists (memantine)\nBoth dextromethorphan and memantine are antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor \nwhich could theoretically result in an additive effect at NMDA receptors and potentially an increased \nincidence of adverse reactions. A drug-drug interaction study was conducted between a higher \ncombination dose of dextromethorphan/quinidine (dextromethorphan 23 mg/quinidine 26 mg) and \nmemantine 20 mg/day. There was no significant difference in the plasma concentrations of \ndextromethorphan and dextrorphan before and after the administration of memantine, and there was no \neffect on the plasma concentrations of memantine before and after the administration of \ndextromethorphan/quinidine. Plasma concentrations of quinidine increased 20-30% when memantine \nwas added. No pharmacodynamic interactions were apparent.\n\nDigoxin and other P-glycoprotein substrates\nQuinidine is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. Concomitant administration of quinidine with digoxin, a \nP-glycoprotein substrate, results in serum digoxin levels that may be as much as doubled. Plasma \ndigoxin concentrations should be closely monitored in patients taking NUEDEXTA concomitantly, \nand the digoxin dose reduced, as necessary. Other P-gp substrates for which a dose reduction may be \nconsidered include ticagrelor and dabigatran-etexilate.\n\nAlcohol \nCaution should be used when this medicinal product is taken in combination with alcohol or other \ncentrally acting medicinal products that might increase the risk of adverse reactions such as \nsomnolence and dizziness.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of NUEDEXTA in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals (rats and rabbits) have shown developmental toxicity, including teratogenicity and embryo-\nlethality (see section 5.3).\n\nAs this medicinal product may cause foetal harm, it is not recommended during pregnancy and in \nwomen of childbearing potential not using contraception.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n23\n\nBreast-feeding\nQuinidine is excreted in human milk and it is unknown whether dextromethorphan is excreted in \nhuman milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \nNUEDEXTA therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\nIn pre-clinical studies no effect on fertility was observed in male and female rats (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNUEDEXTA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should \nbe warned about the potential for CNS-related effects like somnolence, dizziness and syncope or \nimpaired vision (see section 4.8), and advised not to drive or operate machinery if these symptoms \noccur.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe safety of NUEDEXTA was investigated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, \nmulticenter study over 12 weeks in 326 PBA patients with underlying ALS (60%) or MS (40%) and in \na follow-up open-label extension phase with a patient subgroup of this study (253 patients) for an \nadditional 84 days.\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are gastrointestinal disorders (such as diarrhoea, \nnausea), nervous system disorders (such as dizziness, headache, somnolence) and fatigue.\n\nSerious adverse reactions have been reported for NUEDEXTA; these are muscle spasticity, respiratory \ndepression and decreased oxygen saturation in the blood. \n\nTen patients discontinued study treatment due to ADRs, one of these patients due to a serious ADR \n(worsening muscle spasticity).\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nThe adverse reactions considered at least possibly related to treatment with NUEDEXTA in the \nplacebo-controlled and the open-label extension phase of the above mentioned clinical study are listed \nbelow by body system organ class and frequency.\n very common (≥1/10)\n common (≥1/100 to <1/10)\n uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100)\n rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000)\n very rare (<1/10,000)\n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse Reaction\n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nUncommon Decreased appetite \n\nRare Anorexia \n\nPsychiatric disorders Uncommon Anxiety\n\nRare\n\n Bruxism, Confusional state, Depressed mood, \nDepression, Disorientation, Early morning awakening, \nFlat affect, Hallucination, Impulsive behaviour, \nIndifference, Insomnia, Restlessness, Sleep disorder\n\nNervous system \ndisorders\n\nCommon Dizziness, Headache, Somnolence\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n24\n\nUncommon Dysgeusia, Hypersomnia, Muscle spasticity, Syncope, Fall\n\nRare\nBalance disorder, Coordination abnormal, Dysarthria, Motor \ndysfunction, Paraesthesia, Paraparesis, Sedation\n\nEye disorders Rare Diplopia, Vision blurred\n\nEar and labyrinth \ndisorders\n\nUncommon Motion sickness, Tinnitus\n\nCardiac disorders Uncommon\nAtrioventricular block first degree, Electrocardiogram QT \nprolonged\n\nRare\n Myocardial infarction, Palpitations, Ventricular \n\nextrasystoles\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders\n\nRare\n Epistaxis, Pharyngolaryngeal pain, Respiratory \n\ndepression, Rhinorrhoea, Yawning\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nCommon Diarrhoea, Nausea\n\nUncommon\nAbdominal pain, Constipation, Dry mouth, Flatulence, \nStomach discomfort, Vomiting\n\nRare\n Abnormal faeces, Dyspepsia, Gastritis, Hypoaesthesia \n\noral, Paraesthesia oral, Proctalgia, Tongue dry\n\nHepatobiliary disorders Uncommon Increased hepatic enzymes (GGT, AST, ALT)\n\nRare\nCholelithiasis, blood bilirubin increased, Liver function test \nabnormal,  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders\n\nUncommon Rash\n\nRare Erythema, Hyperhidrosis, Hypoaesthesia facial, Night sweats\n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders\n\nUncommon Muscle spasms\n\nRare\nMusculoskeletal stiffness, Myalgia, Neck pain, Pain in \nextremity\n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders\n\nRare Pollakiuria\n\nReproductive system \nand breast disorders\n\nRare Sexual dysfunction\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions\n\nCommon Fatigue\n\nUncommon Asthenia, Irritability\n\nRare \nChest discomfort, Chest pain, Chills, Feeling hot, Gait \ndisturbance, Influenza like illness, Pyrexia,  Oxygen \nsaturation decreased\n\nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural \ncomplications \n\nRare Skeletal injury \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.

Metabolism of dextromethorphan is inhibited by quinidine, such that \nadverse reactions of overdose due to NUEDEXTA might be more severe or more persistent compared \nto overdose of dextromethorphan alone. \n\nDuring development of this medicinal product, dose combinations of dextromethorphan/quinidine \ncontaining up to 6-times higher dextromethorphan dose and 12-times higher quinidine dose were \nstudied. The most common adverse reactions were mild to moderate nausea, dizziness, and headache. \n\nDextromethorphan\nAdverse reactions of dextromethorphan overdose include nausea, vomiting, stupor, coma, respiratory \ndepression, seizures, tachycardia, hyperexcitability, and toxic psychosis. Other adverse reactions \ninclude ataxia, nystagmus, dystonia, blurred vision, and changes in muscle reflexes. \nDextromethorphan may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, and this risk is increased by overdose, \nparticularly if taken with other serotonergic agents, SSRIs or tricyclic antidepressants.\n\nQuinidine\nThe most important effects of acute overdoses are ventricular arrhythmias and hypotension. Other \nsigns and symptoms of overdose may include vomiting, diarrhoea, tinnitus, high-frequency hearing \nloss, vertigo, blurred vision, diplopia, photophobia, headache, confusion, and delirium.\n\nWhile therapeutic doses of quinidine for treatment of cardiac arrhythmia or malaria are generally ≥10-\nfold higher than the dose of quinidine in this medicinal product, potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmia, \nincluding torsades de pointes, can occur at quinidine exposures that are possible from NUEDEXTA \noverdose.\n\nTreatment of overdose \nQuinidine\nThe treatment of cardiac effects (haemodynamically unstable polymorphic ventricular tachycardia \n(including torsades de pointes)) is either immediate cardioversion or immediate overdrive pacing. \nOther antiarrhythmics with Class I (procainamide) or Class III activities should (if possible) be \navoided. Treatment of hypotension and of other signs and symptoms should be directed at \nsymptomatic and supportive measures. Administration of activated charcoal in conventional dose of \n1 g/kg, administered every 2 to 6 hours as a slurry with 8 mL/kg of tap water may enhance the \nsystemic elimination of quinidine; this measures should be avoided if an ileus is present. Methods as \nto acidify the urine and dialysis are of no demonstrated benefit. Drugs that delay elimination of \nquinidine (cimetidine, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, thiazide diuretics) should be withdrawn unless \nabsolutely required. \n\nDextromethorphan\nTreatment of dextromethorphan overdose should be directed at symptomatic and supportive measures.\nGastric lavage may be of use. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs; ATC code: N07XX59\n\nDextromethorphan hydrobromide is the pharmacologically active ingredient that acts on the central \nnervous system (CNS).  Quinidine sulfate is a specific inhibitor of CYP2D6-dependent oxidative \nmetabolism used to increase the systemic bioavailability of dextromethorphan. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n26\n\nMechanism of action\nThe exact mechanism by which dextromethorphan exerts therapeutic effects in patients with \npseudobulbar affect is unknown.  Quinidine increases plasma levels of dextromethorphan by \ncompetitively inhibiting cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), which catalyses a major biotransformation \npathway for dextromethorphan.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nDextromethorphan is a sigma-1 receptor agonist and an uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist.  In \naddition it shows affinity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) and for the 5-HT1B/D receptor. \nThrough its binding to the NMDA, sigma-1, SERT and 5-HT1B/D receptors, dextromethorphan is \nthought to have a modulatory effect on neurotransmission involving glutamate, monoamines \n(including serotonin), as well as ion channel function. \n\nClinical efficacy and safety\nThe efficacy of dextromethorphan/quinidine for the treatment of PBA was demonstrated in three \nrandomised, controlled, double-blind, multicentre clinical trials in PBA subjects with underlying \namyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or multiple sclerosis (MS). Eligible patients had a diagnosis of \nPBA defined by episodes of involuntary, uncontrollable emotional expressions of laughing and/or \ncrying that are incongruous or disproportionate to their emotional state or mood.\n\nIn all studies, the efficacy endpoints were “Count of episodes of laughing and crying” (PBA episodes) \nand subject scores on the Center for Neurologic Studies - Lability Scale (CNS-LS), a validated 7-item, \nself-administered questionnaire that provides a quantitative measure of the frequency and severity of \nPBA. CNS-LS scores range from a minimum of 7 (no symptoms) to a maximum of 35.\n\n Pivotal study (07-AVR-123)\n\nIn this placebo-controlled 12-week study, 326 PBA subjects with underlying ALS or MS were \nrandomized to receive NUEDEXTA 15 mg / 9 mg, (n=107), NUEDEXTA 23 mg / 9 mg (n=110), or \nplacebo (n=109) for 12 weeks. \n\nSubjects were 25 to 80 years of age with a mean age of approximately 51 years. Approximately 74% \nwere Caucasian, 4% were Black, 1% were Asian and 19% were of Hispanic origin. 60% of subjects \nhad underlying ALS and 40% of subjects had underlying MS. All subjects had clinically relevant PBA \nsymptoms, quantified as CNS-LS score of 13 or more.\n\nMean baseline daily PBA episode rates (calculated from the total number of episodes reported for up \nto 7 pre-treatment days) were 4.7 in the NUEDEXTA 23 mg/9 mg group, 6.8 in the NUEDEXTA 15\nmg/9 mg group, and 4.5 in the placebo group.\n\nMean baseline CNS-LS scores were 19.8 in the NUEDEXTA 23 mg /9 mg group, 21.0 in the \nNUEDEXTA 15 mg /9 mg group, and 19.9 in the placebo group.\n\nTo evaluate long-term data, 253 subjects who completed the double-blind study phase had the option \nof entering an open-label extension phase, receiving NUEDEXTA 23 mg /9 mg for another 84 days.\n\nThe frequency of PBA episodes as measured by “Count of Episodes” in both NUEDEXTA treatment \ngroups decreased significantly throughout the course of the study by an incremental reduction of 47% \nand 49% relative to placebo, respectively (p <0.0001 for both comparisons). \n\nThe least-squares mean CNS-LS scores were significantly reduced at the end of treatment in both \ntreatment groups compared to placebo (8.2 point reduction for NUEDEXTA 23 mg /9 mg, 7.5 point \nreduction for NUEDEXTA 15 mg /9 mg, 5.7 point reduction for placebo). The p-value for \nNUEDEXTA 23 mg /9 mg vs placebo was p=0.0002 and for NUEDEXTA 15 mg /9 mg  vs placebo \nwas p=0.008.\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n27\n\nThe 12-week open-label phase of the study (during which all subjects received NUEDEXTA 23 mg /\n9 mg) showed persistence of the effect observed in the placebo controlled period.\n\n• Studies with Higher Dose Combinations of dextromethorphan / quinidine\n\nTwo additional phase III studies were conducted using a higher dose combination of \ndextromethorphan 23 mg/quinidine 26 mg. The higher dose of quinidine used in these studies would \nhave resulted in approximately a 1.6 fold greater exposure to of dextromethorphan than with \nNUEDEXTA 23 mg/ 9 mg.\n\nThe first was a 4-week study in PBA subjects with underlying ALS, and the second was a 12-week \nstudy in subjects with underlying MS. In both studies the primary outcome measure, CNS-LS, and the \nsecondary outcome measure, “count of episodes of laughing and crying”, were statistically \nsignificantly decreased by the dextromethorphan/quinidine combination.\n\nA 12 month open-label safety study, also using the higher dose combination of dextromethorphan \n23 mg /quinidine 26 mg, included 553 subjects with PBA associated with thirty-four different \nneurological conditions. Approximately 30% of study participants carried diagnoses other than ALS \nand MS, including stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and other \ndementia, primary lateral sclerosis, progressive bulbar palsy, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Only \nsafety data were collected in this study; no new safety signals were identified.\n\n• Studies to Assess Cardiac Effects\n\nThe effect of NUEDEXTA 23 mg / 9 mg (for 7 consecutive doses) on QTc prolongation was \nevaluated in a randomised, double-blind (except for moxifloxacin), placebo- and positive-controlled \n(400 mg moxifloxacin) crossover thorough QT study in 50 fasted normal healthy men and women \nwith CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer (EM) genotype. Mean changes in QTcF were 6.8 ms for \nNUEDEXTA 23 mg/ 9 mg and 9.1 ms for the reference positive control (moxifloxacin). The \nmaximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference from placebo after baseline correction was \n10.2 (12.6) ms. This test dose is adequate to represent the steady state exposure in patients with \nCYP2D6 extensive metabolizer phenotype.\n\nThe effects of supra-therapeutic doses of dextromethorphan /quinidine (23 mg /26 mg and 46 mg /\n53 mg, for 7 consecutive doses) on QTc prolongation were evaluated in a randomised, placebo-\ncontrolled, double-blind, crossover design with an additional open-label positive control (400 mg \nmoxifloxacin) arm in 36 healthy volunteers. The maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) \ndifferences from placebo after baseline-correction were 10.2 (14.6) and 18.4 (22.7) ms following \ndextromethorphan/quinidine doses of 23 mg /26 mg and 46 mg /53 mg, respectively. The supra-\ntherapeutic doses are adequate to represent quinidine exposure increases due to drug-drug interactions \nand organ dysfunctions.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nNUEDEXTA in all subsets of the paediatric population in PBA (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing single and repeated combination doses of NUEDEXTA 23 mg / 9 mg, subjects had an \napproximately 20-fold increase in dextromethorphan exposure compared to subjects given \ndextromethorphan without quinidine. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n28\n\nFollowing repeated doses of NUEDEXTA 23 mg / 9 mg and NUEDEXTA 15 mg / 9 mg, maximal \nplasma concentrations (Cmax) of dextromethorphan are reached approximately 3 to 4 hours after dosing \nand maximal plasma concentrations of quinidine are reached approximately 2 hours after dosing. \n\nIn extensive metabolizers, mean Cmax and AUC0-12 values of dextromethorphan and dextrorphan \nincreased as doses of dextromethorphan increased from 15 mg to 23 mg and mean Cmax and AUC0-12 \nvalues of quinidine were similar. \n\nThe mean plasma Cmax of quinidine following NUEDEXTA 15 mg / 9 mg twice daily in subjects with \nPBA was 1 to 3% of the therapeutic concentrations associated with antiarrhythmic efficacy (2 to \n5 µg/mL). \n\nNUEDEXTA may be taken without regard to meals as food does not affect the exposure of \ndextromethorphan and quinidine significantly.\n\nDistribution\nAfter administration of the combination product, protein binding remains essentially the same as that \nafter administration of the individual components; dextromethorphan is approximately 60-70% protein \nbound, and quinidine is approximately 80-89% protein bound. \n\nBiotransformation and elimination\nDextromethorphan is rapidly metabolized by CYP2D6 to its primary metabolite, dextrorphan, which is \nrapidly glucuronidated and renally eliminated. The quinidine component of NUEDEXTA serves to \nselectively inhibit CYP2D6-dependent oxidative metabolism of dextromethorphan, thus increasing \ndextromethorphan plasma concentrations. In the presence of quinidine, CYP3A4-dependent oxidative \nmetabolism is believed to play a greater role in dextromethorphan elimination.\n\nAfter administration of NUEDEXTA 23 mg/9 mg to 14 extensive metabolizers, the elimination half-\nlife of dextromethorphan was 18.8 hours and the elimination half-life of quinidine was 9.6 hours. \n\nQuinidine is metabolized by CYP3A4. There are several hydroxylated metabolites of quinidine. The \nmajor metabolite is 3-hydroxyquinidine, which is considered to be at least half as pharmacologically \nactive as quinidine with respect to cardiac effects such as QT prolongation. There are currently limited \ndata on the magnitude of the effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetic parameters of \nquinidine and its metabolites, including the potential for accumulation at steady state. \n\nWhen the urine pH is less than 7, about 20% of administered quinidine appears unchanged in the \nurine, but this fraction drops to as little as 5% when the urine is more alkaline. Renal clearance \ninvolves both glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, moderated by (pH-dependent) tubular \nreabsorption. \n\nLinearity/non-linearity\nPlasma concentrations of dextromethorphan and dextrorphan are proportional to dextromethorphan \ndose in the presence of a fixed dose of quinidine such as that contained in NUEDEXTA. Quinidine \nplasma concentrations are proportional to quinidine dose. \n\nIn vitro CYP P450 interaction studies \nThe potential for dextromethorphan and quinidine to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 in vitro were \nevaluated in human microsomes. Dextromethorphan did not inhibit (<20% inhibition) any of the tested \nisoenzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or \nCYP3A4 in human liver microsomes at concentrations up to 5 µM. Quinidine did not inhibit (<30% \ninhibition) CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4 in \nhuman microsomes at concentrations up to 5 µM. Quinidine inhibited CYP2D6 with a half maximal \ninhibitory concentration (IC50) of less than 0.05 µM. Neither dextromethorphan nor quinidine induced \nCYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 in human hepatocytes at concentrations up to 4.8 µM. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n29\n\nIn vitro transporter interaction studies\nBased on the results of transporter inhibition studies drug-drug interactions related to \ndextromethorphan inhibition of P-gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3 or BSEP are not \nexpected during treatment withNUEDEXTA. Dextromethorphan has been shown to be a \nmild/moderate inhibitor of the OCT1 transporter in vitro. The clinical relevance of this observation to \ndrugs that are OCT1 substrates, such as metformin, is unknown.\n\nBased on literature citations, drug-drug interactions as a result of quinidine inhibition of OATP1B1, \nOCT1, OCT2, OAT3, BSEP, MATE1, and MATE2-K are not expected.\n\nSpecial Populations \n\nElderly patients\nThe pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan/quinidine have not been investigated systematically in \nelderly subjects (aged >65 years) although such subjects were included in the clinical programme \n(14% ≥65 years, 2% ≥75 years). \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis of 170 subjects (148 subjects <65 years old and 22 subjects \n≥65 years old) administered dextromethorphan 23 mg / quinidine 26 mg revealed similar \npharmacokinetics in subjects <65 years and those ≥65 years of age. \n\nGender \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis based on data from 109 subjects (75 male; 34 female) showed \nno apparent gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan/quinidine.\n\nRace \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis of race with 109 subjects (21 Caucasian; 71 Hispanic; 18 \nBlack) revealed no apparent racial differences in the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan/quinidine. \n\nRenal impairment \nIn a study of a combination dose of dextromethorphan 23 mg / quinidine 26 mg twice daily in 12 \nsubjects with mild (CLCR 50-80 mL/min) or moderate (CLCR 30-50 mL/min) renal impairment (6 \neach) compared to 9 healthy subjects (matched in gender, age, and weight range to impaired subjects), \nsubjects showed little difference in quinidine or dextromethorphan pharmacokinetics compared to \nhealthy subjects. Dose adjustment is therefore not required in mild or moderate renal impairment. \nDextromethorphan / quinidine has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment. \n\nHepatic impairment \nIn a study of a combination dose of dextromethorphan 23 mg / quinidine 26 mg twice daily in 12 \nsubjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (as indicated by the Child-Pugh method; 6 each) \ncompared to 9 healthy subjects (matched in gender, age, and weight range to impaired subjects), \nsubjects with moderate hepatic impairment showed similar dextromethorphan AUC and Cmax and \nclearance compared to healthy subjects. Mild to moderate hepatic impairment had little effect on \nquinidine pharmacokinetics. Quinidine clearance is unaffected, although there is an increased volume \nof distribution that leads to an increase in the elimination half-life. Patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment showed an increased frequency of adverse reactions. Therefore, dosage adjustment is not \nrequired in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, although additional monitoring for \nadverse reactions should be considered in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Dose increase, if \nwarranted, should be undertaken with caution in these patients. Neither dextromethorphan alone nor \ndextromethorphan/quinidine has been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\n\nPharmacogenomics \nThe quinidine component is intended to inhibit CYP2D6 so that higher exposure to dextromethorphan \ncan be achieved compared to when dextromethorphan is given alone. Approximately 7-8% of \nindividuals of Caucasian descent, 3-6% of Black African descent, 2-3% of Arab descent and 1-2% of \nAsian descent generally lack the capacity to metabolize CYP2D6 substrates and are classified as Poor \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n30\n\nMetabolizer (PMs). The quinidine component is not expected to contribute to the effectiveness of \nNUEDEXTA in PMs, but adverse reactions of the quinidine component are still possible. \n\nApproximately 1-10% of individuals of Caucasian descent, 5-30% of Black African descent, 12-40% \nof Arab descent and 1% of Asian descent exhibit increased metabolic activity for CYP2D6 substrates \nand are classified as Ultra-rapid Metabolizer (UMs). In such UM patients, dextromethorphan is rapidly \nmetabolised, leading to lower, potentially subtherapeutic concentrations. \n\nPaediatric population\nThe pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan/quinidine in paediatric patients has not been studied (see \nsection 5.1). \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for a genotoxicity or carcinogenic potential, nor for fertility \nimpairment.\n\nIn embryo-fetal and developmental toxicity studies (rats and rabbits) with dextromethorphan \nhydrobromide/quinidine sulfate, abnormalities were observed at mid and high dose with reduced \nossification from the lowest dose in rats which is approximately 1 and 50 times the human dose of \n30/18 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis, respectively. The no effect dose in rabbits is 2 and 60 times higher \nthan the RHD.\n\nIn the pre and post-natal developmental study, slight developmental delay was seen in offspring at the \nmid- and high-doses. Pup survival and pup weight were slightly decreased from the lowest dose \ncorresponding approximately to 1and 50 times the human dose of 30/18 mg/kg on a mg/m2 basis, for \ndextromethorphan hydrobromide and quinidine sulfate, respectively.\n\n6.
