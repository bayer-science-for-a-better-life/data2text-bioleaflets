This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nDovprela 200 mg tablet \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 200 mg pretomanid. \n \nExcipient with known effect \n \nEach tablet contains 294 mg lactose (as monohydrate) and 5 mg sodium. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablets. \n \nWhite to off-white oval tablet debossed with M on one side and P200 on the other side. \nTablet dimensions: 18 × 9 mm. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDovprela is indicated in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid, in adults, for the treatment of \npulmonary extensively drug resistant (XDR), or treatment-intolerant or nonresponsive multidrug-\nresistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB), see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1.  \n \nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with pretomanid should be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the \nmanagement of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. \n \nPretomanid should be administered by directly observed therapy (DOT) or in accordance with local \npractice. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dosage is 200 mg (one tablet) pretomanid once daily, for 26 weeks. \n \nA longer duration of therapy may be considered in patients who have not responded adequately to \ntreatment at 26 weeks on a case by case basis (see section 5.1). \n \nPretomanid should be administered only in combination with bedaquiline (400 mg once daily for \n2 weeks followed by 200 mg 3 times per week [with at least 48 hours between doses] orally for a total \nof 26 weeks) and linezolid (1,200 mg daily orally for up to 26 weeks).  \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \nThe product information for bedaquiline and linezolid should be consulted for additional information \non the use of these medicinal products.  \n \nIn addition, see section 4.4 for information on the dose modification of linezolid that was applied \nduring the Nix-TB clinical study and see section 5.1 for details of the study. \n \nDiscontinuation of the pretomanid-bedaquiline-linezolid treatment regimen (see also sections 4.4, \n4.8 and 5.1) \n If either bedaquiline or pretomanid is discontinued for any reason, the entire combination \n\nregimen should be discontinued.  \n If linezolid is permanently discontinued during the initial four consecutive weeks of \n\ntreatment, the entire combination regimen should be discontinued.  \n If linezolid is discontinued after the initial four weeks of consecutive treatment, the regimen \n\nmay be continued with only bedaquiline and pretomanid. \n \nMissed doses \nAny missed doses of pretomanid and bedaquiline should be made up at the end of treatment. Doses of \nlinezolid that are missed due to linezolid adverse reactions should not be made up at the end of \ntreatment. \nRefer to the product information of bedaquiline and linezolid for additional information on these \nmedicinal products. \n \nTreatment duration \nThe total duration of treatment with pretomanid in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid is \n26 weeks. Data on longer treatment duration is limited. A longer duration of therapy may be \nconsidered in patients who have not responded adequately to treatment at 26 weeks on a case by case \nbasis (see section 5.1). \n \nElderly population (≥ 65 years of age) \nThere is limited clinical data on the use of pretomanid in elderly patients. Hence, the safety and \nefficacy of pretomanid in elderly patients have not been established. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe safety and efficacy of pretomanid in populations with hepatic impairment have not been \nestablished (see section 4.4). \n \nRenal impairment \nThe safety and efficacy of pretomanid in populations with renal impairment have not been established. \nNo data are available. Use in patients with renal impairment is not recommended.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of pretomanid in children and adolescents have not yet been established.  \nNo data are available.  \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nFor oral use. \nPretomanid should be taken with food (see section 5.2). \nTablets should be swallowed with water.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, other nitroimidazoles, or to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSafety and effectiveness of pretomanid have not been established for its use in combination with \nmedicinal products other than bedaquiline and linezolid as part of the recommended dosing regimen, \nand thus pretomanid should not be used as part of any other regimen. \n \nHepatotoxicity \n \nHepatotoxicity may occur with use of the regimen consisting of pretomanid, bedaquiline and linezolid. \nLiver-related laboratory tests should be monitored. Alcohol and hepatotoxic medicinal products \n(including herbal supplements), other than those specified in the indication statement (see section 4.1), \nshould be avoided while on the regimen, especially in patients with impaired hepatic function.  \nSymptoms and signs (such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, liver tenderness and \nhepatomegaly) should be addressed throughout treatment. Laboratory tests (alanine aminotransferase \n[ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) should be monitored at \ninitiation of treatment, and at a minimum once every week during the first month of treatment, every \nother week during month 2, and monthly thereafter while on treatment, and as needed. If evidence of \nnew or worsening liver dysfunction occurs, a test for viral hepatitis should be performed and other \nhepatotoxic medicinal products should be discontinued. Treatment with the entire regimen should be \ninterrupted if: \n Aminotransferase elevations are accompanied by total bilirubin elevation greater than 2 times \n\nthe upper limit of normal. \n Aminotransferase elevations are greater than 8 times the upper limit of normal. \n Aminotransferase elevations are greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal and persist \n\nbeyond 2 weeks. \nTreatment may be re-initiated under close surveillance when hepatic enzymes and clinical symptoms \nnormalize. \n \nModification/interruption due to linezolid adverse reactions \n \nModification or interruption of linezolid dosing may be needed during the course of therapy to manage \nthe known linezolid toxicities. The recommendations below reflect the procedures used in the Nix-TB \nstudy (section 5.1). \n \nMyelosuppression  \nComplete blood counts should be monitored at a minimum at start of treatment, at two weeks, and \nthen monthly in patients receiving linezolid as part of the combination regimen. Haematologic \nparameters are variable from measurement to measurement, and decreases should be evaluated in the \ncontext of the patient’s overall medical condition. Guidelines below may be considered when it is \nlikely that linezolid has caused the decrease in blood count. Consider pausing or reducing the dose of \nlinezolid in the following situations.  \n Anaemia - if haemoglobin falls below 80 g/l or more than 25% below the start of treatment.  \n Leukopenia - if the Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) falls below 0.75 × 109/l or significantly \n\nbelow baseline. Confirm with a repeat test before making further decisions as ANCs can have \ndiurnal and other variability. \n\n Thrombocytopenia - if platelets fall below 50 × 109/l or significantly below baseline. Ideally \nconfirm with a repeat test before making further decisions. \n\nWhen improvement in the myelosuppression is observed, consider resuming linezolid at the initial \ndose or at half the initial dose. \n \nPeripheral neuropathy and optic neuropathy \nPeripheral neuropathy associated with linezolid is generally reversible or improved with interruption, \ndose reduction, or discontinuation of linezolid dosing. When improvement in the peripheral \nneuropathy is observed, consider resuming linezolid at half the initial dose. In the Nix-TB study \n(section 5.1), the incidence of interruption/reduction/discontinuation of linezolid due to peripheral \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nneuropathy increased steadily from around 2 months of therapy throughout the completion of therapy. \nMonitor visual symptoms in all patients receiving the combination regimen of pretomanid, \nbedaquiline, and linezolid. If a patient experiences symptoms of visual impairment, interrupt linezolid \ndosing and obtain prompt ophthalmologic examination to evaluate for signs of optic neuropathy. \n \nLactic acidosis \nLactic acidosis is a known adverse reaction of linezolid. Patients who develop recurrent nausea or \nvomiting should receive immediate medical evaluation, including evaluation of bicarbonate and lactic \nacid levels, and interruption of linezolid should be considered. Linezolid may be reinitiated at a lower \ndose with close monitoring when signs and symptoms of lactic acidosis resolve.  \n \nQT prolongation \n \nQT prolongation was reported with the combination regimen of pretomanid, bedaquiline, and \nlinezolid. QT prolongation is a known adverse reaction of bedaquiline. Bedaquiline in combination \nwith pretomanid appears to result in a higher QT prolongation than expected with bedaquiline alone. \nHowever, the impact of pretomanid has not been fully characterized. \nAn ECG should be obtained before initiation of treatment, and at least monthly during treatment with \nthe combination regimen of pretomanid, bedaquiline, and linezolid. Serum potassium, calcium, and \nmagnesium should be obtained at baseline and corrected if abnormal. Follow-up monitoring of \nelectrolytes should be performed if QT prolongation is detected.  \nThe following may increase the risk for QT prolongation:  \n a history of Torsade de Pointes,  \n a personal or family history of congenital long QT syndrome,  \n a history of or ongoing hypothyroidism,  \n ongoing bradyarrhythmia,  \n heart failure or known structural heart disease,  \n QT-interval as corrected by the Fridericia method (QTcF) > 450 ms (confirmed by repeat \n\nelectrocardiogram) or \n serum calcium, magnesium, or potassium levels below the lower limits of normal. \n \nThe entire regimen of pretomanid, bedaquiline, and linezolid must be discontinued if the patient \ndevelops clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia or a QTcF interval of greater than 500 ms \n(confirmed by repeat ECG). If syncope occurs, an ECG should be obtained to detect QT prolongation. \n \nThe QT prolongation risk for the combination regimen has not been established at exposures higher \nthan therapeutic levels. The risk may be increased if the systemic exposure of pretomanid is elevated \n(see sections 4.5 and 5.2).  \n \nExcipients \n \nDovprela contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems such as galactose intolerance, total \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \nDovprela contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially “sodium-free”.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on pretomanid \n \nCYP3A4 inducers \nPretomanid is metabolized in part by CYP3A4. In consequence, exposure to pretomanid may be \nreduced during co-administration with inducers of CYP3A4. In interaction studies of multiple-dose \npretomanid with multiple-dose rifampicin or efavirenz, the AUC0-24h of pretomanid was reduced by \n66% or 35%, respectively. Due to the possibility of a reduction of the therapeutic effect of pretomanid \ndue to a decrease in systemic exposure, co-administration of pretomanid and moderate or strong \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nCYP3A4 inducers (e.g. efavirenz, etravirine, rifamycins including rifampicin, rifapentine and \nrifabutin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)) used systemically \nshould be avoided (see section 4.4). \n \nIn an interaction study of multiple-dose pretomanid with multiple-dose ritonavir-boosted-lopinavir, the \nAUC0-24h of pretomanid was reduced by 17%.  \n \nEffects of pretomanid on other medicinal products \n \nOAT3 substrates \nPretomanid is an inhibitor of the OAT3 transporter in vitro, which could result in increased \nconcentrations of OAT3 substrate medicinal products clinically and may increase the risk of adverse \nreactions of these medicines.  \nIf pretomanid is co-administered with OAT3 substrate medicinal products (e.g., methotrexate, \nbenzylpenicillin, indomethacin, ciprofloxacin), monitoring for OAT3 substrate drug-related adverse \nreactions should be performed and dosage reductions for OAT3 medicinal product should be \nconsidered, if needed (see section 4.4).  \n \nSubstrates of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 \nPretomanid has been shown to inhibit CYP2C8 and CYP2C19 in a time dependent manner in vitro. \nInduction of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 by pretomanid has not been studied. Therefore, the net \neffect of pretomanid on CYP2C8 and/or CYP2C19 substrates is unknown. Consequently concomitant \ntreatment with substrates of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 should be closely monitored. \n \nSubstrates of Pgp, OATP1B3, OCT2 and BCRP \nThe potential of pretomanid to inhibit Pgp, OATP1B3, OCT2 and BCRP in vivo is unknown. Caution \nis recommended for concomitant treatment with pretomanid and transporter substrates with a narrow \ntherapeutic index. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are very limited amount of data from the use of pretomanid in pregnant women. Animal studies \ndo not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to embryo-fetal development (see section \n5.3).  \n \nPretomanid should be used during pregnancy only if the benefit to the patient is considered to \noutweigh the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether pretomanid/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of pretomanid in milk (see \nsection 5.3). A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to \ndiscontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue pretomanid therapy, taking into account the benefit of \nbreastfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of pretomanid on fertility are available. Oral administration of \npretomanid caused markedly reduced fertility in male rats (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nPretomanid may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness has been \nreported in some patients taking pretomanid and some patients experienced visual impairment. This \nshould be considered when assessing a patient’s ability to drive or operate machinery (see section 4.8).  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe most frequent adverse drug reactions during treatment with pretomanid in combination with \nbedaquiline and linezolid were nausea (36%), vomiting (28%) and transaminases increased (21%). \n81% and 37% of patients experienced peripheral neuropathy and anaemia, which are known adverse \nreactions to linezolid, respectively. Nausea, vomiting and transaminases increased are possible adverse \nreactions to all three medicinal products in the regimen. Refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics of bedaquiline and linezolid for more information on adverse reactions caused by these \ntwo medicinal products. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported from the uncontrolled phase 3 trial in 109 patients treated with \npretomanid in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid are summarized in the table below by system \norgan class and frequency.

Except for one patient who died due to pneumonia and sepsis, all patients who experienced \nincreased transaminases were able to continue or resume therapy after interruption, and complete the \nfull course of treatment. \n \nECG QT interval prolongation \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nQT prolongation is a known adverse reaction of bedaquiline. Bedaquiline in combination with \npretomanid appears to result in a higher QT prolongation than expected with bedaquiline alone. \nHowever, the impact of pretomanid has not been fully characterised. In the Nix-TB trial, 6 patients \n(5.5%, common) experienced QT prolongation. In the entire Nix-TB trial, no subject was reported to \nhave a treatment emergent QTcF exceeding 480 ms. One subject was reported to have a change from \nbaseline of QTcF exceeding 60 ms.  \n \nMyelosuppression \nMyelosuppression is a known adverse reaction of linezolid. In the Nix-TB trial, 37% (very common) \nof patients experienced anaemia, as the most common ADR of hematopoietic cytopenia attributed to \nlinezolid. The majority of cytopenias began after 2 weeks of treatment. Overall, three patients \nexperienced cytopenias that were considered serious: neutropenia in 1 patient and anaemia in \n2 patients. All 3 serious adverse events resulted either in interruption of linezolid or in interruption of \npretomanid, bedaquiline, and linezolid, and all resolved. \n \nPeripheral neuropathy \nPeripheral neuropathy is a known ADR of linezolid. In the Nix-TB trial, 81% (very common) of \npatients experienced peripheral neuropathy. Most of these adverse reactions occurred after 8 weeks of \ntreatment and resulted in dosing interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of linezolid. No \nadverse reactions related to peripheral neuropathy led to a discontinuation of the entire study regimen. \n \nOptic neuropathy \nOptic neuropathy is a known adverse reaction of linezolid. Two patients (2%, common) in the Nix-TB \ntrial developed optic neuropathy, both after 16 weeks of treatment. Both were serious, confirmed on \nretinal examination as optic neuropathy/neuritis, and resulted in discontinuation of linezolid; both \nadverse reactions resolved. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no experience of acute overdose with pretomanid. General measures should be taken to \nsupport basic vital functions including monitoring of vital signs and ECG in case of deliberate or \naccidental overdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycobacterials, drugs for treatment of tuberculosis, ATC code: not \nyet assigned. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe mechanism of action of pretomanid is thought to involve inhibition of the synthesis of cell wall \nlipids under aerobic conditions and generation of reactive nitrogen species under anaerobic conditions. \nReductive activation of pretomanid by a mycobacterial deazaflavin (F420)-dependent nitro-reductase \nis required for activity under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (see also mechanism of resistance, \nbelow). \n \nResistance \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n \nThe activation of pretomanid, which takes place within the bacterial cell, is dependent on enzymes \nencoded by 5 genes: a co-factor F420-dependent nitroreductase named Ddn; a glucose-6-phosphate \ndehydrogenase named Fgd1; and the enzymes of the F420 biosynthetic pathway (FbiA, FbiB, and \nFbiC). Mutations in the 5 genes encoding these enzymes (ddn, fgd1, fbiA, fbiB, fbiC) have been \nassociated with high level pretomanid resistance in vitro. \nNot all isolates with increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) have mutations in these \ngenes, suggesting the existence of at least one other mechanism of resistance. \nPretomanid does not show cross-resistance with any currently used anti-tuberculosis drugs, except for \ndelamanid where cross-resistance has been demonstrated in vitro. This is likely to be due to \npretomanid and delamanid being activated via the same pathway, see above. Only one case of \nacquisition of pretomanid resistance has been observed thus far in trials sponsored by TB Alliance. \n \nSusceptibility testing breakpoint \n \nBased on the limited information available, a critical concentration for pretomanid is provisionally set \nat 1 μg/ml for testing using the MGIT System. Over 99% of clinical isolates surveyed showed MIC \nvalues at or below 1 μg/ml. Conversely, all Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates with known \nmechanisms of resistance to pretomanid had MIC values above this concentration \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nPretomanid was evaluated in a multicenter, open-label study conducted in subjects with XDR, \ntreatment-intolerant MDR or non-responsive MDR pulmonary tuberculosis. The subjects received the \nindicated pretomanid-bedaquiline-linezolid regimen for 6 months (extendable to 9 months) with \n24 months of follow-up; linezolid starting dose was either 600 mg twice daily or 1200 mg once daily. \nA total of 109 patients was treated during the course of the study. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint for the study was treatment failure, defined as the incidence of \nbacteriologic failure, bacteriological relapse (culture conversion to positive status after completion of \ntherapy with same Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain, after conversion to negative during therapy), or \nclinical failure through follow-up until 6 months after the End of Treatment. Subjects considered \ntreatment failures were categorised as having an unfavourable outcome.  \nThe mean age of the patients was 35.6 years with 48% being female and 52% male. The mean \nduration since initial TB diagnosis was 24 months. 47%/38% of patients had unilateral/bilateral \ncavities and 51% of patients were HIV-positive (with a mean CD4 cell count of 396 cells/µl). \nOutcome of the primary efficacy analysis is presented in the table below. \n \n\n Total XDR TI/NR MDR \n\nN 109 71 (65%) 38 (35%) \n\nUnassessable 2 1 1 \n\nTotal Assessable 107 70 37 \n\nFavourable 98 (92%) 63 (90%) 35 (95%) \n\nUnfavourable 9 (8%) 7 (10%) 2 (5%) \n\nXDR: extensively drug resistant \nTI/NR MDR: treatment-intolerant or nonresponsive multidrug-resistant \n \nThe outcomes were similar in both HIV negative and HIV positive subjects. Of the 9 unfavourable \noutcomes, 6 were deaths while receiving treatment. Two additional subjects relapsed in follow-up \nafter the End of Treatment; one of those subjects later died. \n \nPaediatric population \n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \npretomanid in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of multi-drug-resistant \ntuberculosis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nConditional approval \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This \nmeans that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. \nThe European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every \nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of pretomanid are similar in adult healthy subjects and in adult \ntuberculosis-infected patients. \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe absolute bioavailability of pretomanid has not been established. Two mass balance studies have \nindicated that the absolute bioavailability is greater than 53% and 64%.  \n \nThe median tmax values range from 4 to 5 hours.  \nAdministration of 200 mg pretomanid with a high-fat, high-calorie meal increased mean Cmax by 76% \nand mean AUC0-inf by 88% as compared with administration in the fasted state. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe binding of pretomanid to human plasma proteins is 86.4%, so the fraction unbound (fu) is 13.6%. \nHuman serum albumin binding was similar (82.7%), indicating that binding to albumin is responsible \nfor the human plasma protein binding of pretomanid. \nThe mean apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) after a single dose of 200 mg in the fed state was \n97 L when the mean weight was 72 kg.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nThe metabolic profile of pretomanid has not been completely elucidated. Pretomanid is extensively \nmetabolised with over 19 metabolites identified through multiple metabolic pathways. In the mass-\nbalance study, pretomanid had a half-life of 16 hours, while that of total radioactivity was 18 days, \nindicating the presence of partially unidentified long-lived metabolites.  \n \nIn vitro, pretomanid was moderately metabolized by CYP3A4. A role of CYP3A4 was further \nsupported by a clinical drug interaction study with CYP3A4 inducers. Nitro-reduction within \nMycobacterium tuberculosis and potentially in gastrointestinal microflora is also involved in the \nmetabolism of pretomanid. \n \nPretomanid is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9, 2C19 or 2D6 in vitro. \n \nElimination \n \nThe recovery of total radioactivity following a single dose of 14C-preotmanid was approximately 90% \nwith about 53-65% excreted in the urine and 26-38% in faeces. \n \nPretomanid, at clinically relevant concentrations, is not a substrate or inhibitor for the transporters, bile \nsalt export pump (BSEP), multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE)1, MATE2-K, organic anion \ntransporter (OAT)1, OAT1B1 and organic cation transporter (OCT)1. Pretomanid is not a substrate of \nOAT3, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), P-glycoprotein (P gp), OCT2 and organic anion-\n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\ntransporting polypeptide (OATP)1B3. The potential of pretomanid to inhibit P gp, OATP1B3, OCT2 \nand BCRP has not been investigated at clinically relevant concentrations.. \nApparent clearance (CL/F) after a single dose was 7.6 and 3.9 l/h in the fasted and fed states, \nrespectively. The elimination half-life was 17 hours. \n \nNon-linearity \nIn the fasted state, bioavailability decreased with increasing doses (50 to 1500 mg/day), with \nabsorption saturation above 1000 mg. In the fed state, there were no significant changes in \nbioavailability across doses of 50 mg through 200 mg. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of pretomanid has not been established in patients with impaired hepatic \nfunction. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of pretomanid has not been established in patients with impaired renal function. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of pretomanid have not been established in the paediatric population. \n \nElderly  \nThere is limited clinical data (n=5) on the use of pretomanid in elderly subjects (≥65 years).  \n \nRace \nThere were no clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of pretomanid between Black \nand Caucasian subjects. The pharmacokinetics of pretomanid have not been established in other racial \npopulations. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nCataracts developed in rats given pretomanid at 300 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks with 7-fold the \nmaximum recommended human dose (MRHD) exposure and at 100 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks with \n3-4-fold MRHD exposure. The cataracts were not present at the end of dosing in monkeys given oral \npretomanid at 450 mg/kg/day (10.5-fold of MRHD exposure) for 4 weeks and 300 mg/kg/day \n(5.4-fold MRHD exposure) for 12 more weeks, but observed in 2 of 12 monkeys during the 13-week \npost treatment recovery period. In a subsequent study in monkeys, cataracts were not observed \nfollowing 13 weeks treatment with up to 300 mg/kg/day oral pretomanid (5-fold of MRHD exposure) \nor during the 20 week post treatment recovery period. Additionally, no cataracts were observed in \nrepeat-dose toxicity studies of up to 9 months in monkeys (approximately 2-3-fold of MRHD \nexposure). Taken together, these studies suggest that the no-effect level for cataracts was \n30 mg/kg/day observed in rats (26-week study), which is 2-fold the exposure at the MRHD of \n200 mg/day.  \n \nIn repeat dose studies in rats, convulsions were observed at systemic exposures 4- to 10-fold higher \nthan the clinical exposure at the MHRD of 200 mg/day (Cmax = 3.1 µg/ml and AUC0-24 = 57 h×µg/ml). \nIn repeat dose studies in monkeys, convulsions were seen at exposures 2- to 8-fold higher than \nexposure at the MHRD. In both species, convulsions were observed at lower exposures during the \nlonger duration studies (6-month rat and 9-month monkey). The mechanism of convulsions in \nnonclinical studies with pretomanid is unknown. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. \n \nPretomanid has the potential to affect cardiac repolarisation via blockade of hERG potassium channels \nand/or other cardiac ion channels including Nav1.5 and KCNQ1/minK. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nTesticular toxicity was observed in rats and mice without exposure margin to the MRHD. Decreased \nfertility to complete infertility was observed in male rats treated with oral pretomanid. There were no \ndirect effects of pretomanid on reproductive organs in monkeys given oral pretomanid for 3-months \nand 9-months. Decreased sperm motility, total sperm count and increased abnormal sperm ratio were \nobserved in monkeys. Based upon the preclinical data, rodents are susceptible to pretomanid-induced \ntesticular injury. Serum levels of the male reproductive hormones are biomarkers that are altered in \nassociation with this injury. In the preclinical study of primates, no pretomanid-related alterations in \ntestis or male reproductive hormones were observed.  \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of embryo-foetal \ndevelopment and peri-postnatal development.  \n \nTransfer of pretomanid from dam to pup via breast milk was studied in rats. After 14 days dosing of \n20 mg/kg/day, the mean maternal plasma concentration 6 hours post dose was 2.84 μg/ml, which is \nsimilar to the mean steady state Cmax for 200 mg pretomanid in humans. At the same time, the mean \nconcentration in milk was 4.07 μg/ml, and the mean plasma concentration in rat pups was 0.119 μg/ml. \nThe concentration of pretomanid in rat milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of \npretomanid in human milk. \n \nNo mutagenic or clastogenic effects were detected in conventional genotoxicity studies with \npretomanid. A circulating metabolite of pretomanid, M50, was mutagenic in a bacterial reverse \nmutation assay. No carcinogenic potential was revealed in a 6-month study in transgenic mice where \nthis metabolite is produced.  \n \n \n6.

What Dovprela is and what it is used for \n \nDovprela contains the active substance pretomanid, a type of antibiotic. Antibiotics are medicines used \nto kill bacteria that cause diseases. \n \nDovprela is used in combination with two other medicines called linezolid and bedaquiline to treat \ntuberculosis that affects the lungs, when the disease has become resistant to many other antibiotics: \n extensively drug resistant tuberculosis or \n treatment-intolerant or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis \nIt is used in adults 18 years and over. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Dovprela \n \nDo not take Dovprela \n \n if you are allergic to pretomanid, antibiotics of the group called nitroimidazoles, or any of the \n\nother ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n \nSince pretomanid must be used in combination with other medicines against tuberculosis – linezolid \nand bedaquiline – please make sure that you read the “Do not take” section of the package leaflets for \nthese medicines as well. If you are unsure of any information in the package leaflets, please contact \nyour doctor or pharmacist. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Dovprela if you: \n have reduced liver function  \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\n drink alcohol on a regular basis \n have reduced kidney function \n have or have had disturbances of the heart rhythm, or if someone in your family has a heart \n\nrhythm problem \n have heart failure \n have or have had an underactive thyroid \n have reduced blood levels of calcium, magnesium or potassium \n \nLiver damage \nThere is a risk of liver damage when you are treated with Dovprela, linezolid and bedaquiline. Your \ndoctor will therefore monitor you for signs of liver damage and take blood samples before the start of \ntreatment and regularly during treatment. \nTell your doctor if you experience symptoms such as: \n fatigue \n lack or loss of appetite \n nausea \n yellowing of the skin and eyes \n dark urine \n abdominal pain \nThe doctor will adjust your treatment if your liver is affected. \n \nReduced number of blood cells \nTreatment with Dovprela, linezolid and bedaquiline can severely reduce the number of blood cells, \nsuch as blood platelets, red blood cells and white blood cells called neutrophils. Contact your doctor \nimmediately about any signs of bruising, bleeding or infections. \nYour doctor will monitor complete blood counts before the start of treatment and regularly during \ntreatment. The doctor will adjust your treatment if your blood cell count is reduced. \n \nNerve disorders in hands, feet or eyes \nNerve disorders in hands, feet or eyes may occur during treatment. Contact your doctor if you have \nvisual problems, or numbness, tingling or burning in your hands or feet during treatment. Your doctor \nwill adjust your treatment in these cases. If visual problems occur contact a doctor for a prompt eye \nexamination. \n \nIncreased blood level of lactic acid \nA disorder of blood over-acidification called lactic acidosis may occur during treatment. Contact your \ndoctor if you have recurrent nausea or vomiting. Your doctor may adjust your treatment in these cases. \n \nHeart problems \nA certain heartbeat abnormality known as QT prolongation may occur during treatment. Your doctor \nwill therefore perform an ECG before the start of treatment and regularly during treatment. Your \ntreatment will be adjusted if heartbeat abnormalities occur. In addition, potassium, calcium and \nmagnesium levels will be monitored and corrected if abnormal. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Dovprela has not been studied in combination with medicines other than \nlinezolid and bedaquiline and therefore it should not be used as part of any other treatment \ncombination. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nThis medicine is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years. This is because it has \nnot been studied in this age group. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\nOther medicines and Dovprela \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines, including herbal therapies. These may affect the way Dovprela works or increase the risk \nof side effects. \n \nAvoid treatment with Dovprela and any of the following medicines at the same time. These may \nlower the effect of Dovprela so your treatment may not work; therefore, inform your doctor \nimmediately about these: \n rifampicin, rifamycin, rifapentine, rifabutin: other medicines to treat tuberculosis or certain \n\nother infections \n efavirenz, etravirine: medicines to treat HIV infection \n carbamazipine, phenytoin: medicines to treat epilepsy and certain pain conditions \n St John’s wort: a herbal medicine to treat depression and anxiety \n \nYou should also avoid the use of medicines that may have a damaging effect on your liver (other than \nbedaquiline and linezolid). Talk to you doctor who will be able to tell you which medicines this \napplies to. \n  \nInform your doctor if you are using: \n methotrexate: a medicine to treat severe joint inflammation, cancer and the skin disease \n\npsoriasis \n benzylpenicillin, ciprofloxacin: medicines to treat bacterial infections \n indomethacin: a medicine to treat pain and inflammation \n ritonavir: a medicine to treat HIV infection \n \nDovprela with alcohol \n \nAvoid drinking alcohol while being treated with Dovprela since this increases the risk of serious liver \ndamage. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \n Pregnancy \n\nVery limited knowledge exists about the use of Dovprela during pregnancy. Therefore, \nDovprela is used during pregnancy only if the benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk \nto the foetus. Your doctor will decide whether you should be treated with Dovprela. \n\n Breast-feeding \nIt is not known if pretomanid is passed into human milk. Your doctor has to decide if you \nshould discontinue breast-feeding or avoid treatment with Dovprela.  \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nYou may feel dizzy after taking Dovprela or you may experience problems with your vision. Do not \ndrive or operate machinery if this happens. \n \nDovprela contains lactose and sodium \n \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n3. How to take Dovprela \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nDovprela is used in combination with linezolid and bedaquiline. Please also read the package leaflets \nfrom these medicines. If you have any questions ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nThe recommended dose is  \n Dovprela: 1 tablet once daily \n linezolid: 1,200 mg daily \n bedaquiline: 400 mg once daily for 2 weeks, followed by 200 mg 3 times per week (with at least \n\n48 hours between doses). For example you may take bedaquiline on Monday, Wednesday and \nFriday every week from week 3 onwards. \n\n \nMethod of use \nTake Dovprela at the same time as linezolid and bedaquiline. Swallow the tablets with a glass of water \nand take them with food. \nThe tablets are taken under direct observation of a healthcare professional or in accordance with local \npractice.  \n \nDuration of use \nThe duration of treatment with the combination Dovprela, linezolid and bedaquiline is 26 weeks. Your \ndoctor may decide to expand this period or to interrupt dosing to ensure that the treatment is safe and \neffective for you. \n \nIf you take more Dovprela than you should \n \nContact your doctor straight away and take the medicine pack with you. \n \nIf you forget to take Dovprela \n \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nAny missed dose of pretomanid and bedaquiline is recommended to be made up at the end of \ntreatment. Doses of linezolid missed due to linezolid adverse reactions are not recommended to be \nmade up. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have missed a dose and you are not sure what to do. \n \nIf you stop taking Dovprela \n \nDo not stop taking Dovprela or its combination medicines linezolid or bedaquiline without your \ndoctor’s permission. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may make treatment \nineffective and your tuberculosis could get worse. In addition, this would increase the chance that \nbacteria become resistant to these medicines. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4.
