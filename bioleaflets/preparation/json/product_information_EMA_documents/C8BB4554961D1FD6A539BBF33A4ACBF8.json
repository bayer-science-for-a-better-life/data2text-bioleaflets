NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd. 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal patch \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach transdermal patch releases 4.6 mg of rivastigmine per 24 hours. Each transdermal patch of \n4.15 cm2 contains 7.17 mg of rivastigmine. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTransdermal patch \n \nRectangular patches, approximately 2.5 cm by 1.8 cm with rounded corners. Each patch consists of a \ncombination of a removable, transparent, split release liner, a functional layer containing drug-in-\nadhesive (DIA) matrix, and a protective backing layer. The backing layer is transparent to translucent, \nlabelled with “R5”  in a repeated pattern. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer’s dementia. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment \nof Alzheimer’s dementia. Diagnosis should be made according to current guidelines. Similar to any \ntreatment initiated in patients with dementia, therapy with rivastigmine should only be started if a \ncaregiver is available to regularly administer and monitor the treatment. \n \nPosology \n \nTransdermal patches Rivastigmine in vivo release \n\nrates per 24 h\nRivastigmine 4.6 mg/24 h 4.6 mg \nRivastigmine 9.5 mg/24 h 9.5 mg \nRivastigmine 13.3 mg/24 h* 13.3 mg \n \n*A marketing authorisation for Rivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd. 13.3 mg/24 h transdermal patch is \ncurrently not available, this presentation may although be available from other marketing authorisation \nholders. \n \nInitial dose \nTreatment is started with 4.6 mg/24 h. \n \nMaintenance dose \nAfter a minimum of four weeks of treatment and if well tolerated according to the treating physician, the \ndose of 4.6 mg/24 h should be increased to 9.5 mg/24 h, the daily recommended effective dose, which \nshould be continued for as long as the patient continues to demonstrate therapeutic benefit. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nDose escalation \n9.5 mg/24 h is the recommended daily effective dose which should be continued for as long as the patient \ncontinues to demonstrate therapeutic benefit. If well tolerated and only after a minimum of six months \nof treatment at 9.5 mg/24 h, the treating physician may consider increasing the dose to 13.3 mg/24 h in \npatients who have demonstrated a meaningful cognitive deterioration (e.g. decrease in the MMSE) \nand/or functional decline (based on physician judgement) while on the recommended daily effective \ndose of 9.5 mg/24 h (see section 5.1). \n \nThe clinical benefit of rivastigmine should be reassessed on a regular basis. Discontinuation should also \nbe considered when evidence of a therapeutic effect at the optimal dose is no longer present. \n \nTreatment should be temporarily interrupted if gastrointestinal adverse reactions are observed until \nthese adverse reactions resolve. Transdermal patch treatment can be resumed at the same dose if \ntreatment is not interrupted for more than three days. Otherwise treatment should be re-initiated with \n4.6 mg/24 h. \n \nSwitching from capsules or oral solution to transdermal patches \nBased on comparable exposure between oral and transdermal rivastigmine (see section 5.2), patients \ntreated with rivastigmine capsules or oral solution can be switched to Rivastigmine 3M Health Care \nLtd. transdermal patches as follows: \n- A patient on a dose of 3 mg/day oral rivastigmine can be switched to 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal \n\npatches. \n- A patient on a dose of 6 mg/day oral rivastigmine can be switched to 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal \n\npatches. \n- A patient on a stable and well tolerated dose of 9 mg/day oral rivastigmine can be switched to \n\n9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patches. If the oral dose of 9 mg/day has not been stable and well \ntolerated, a switch to 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal patches is recommended. \n\n- A patient on a dose of 12 mg/day oral rivastigmine can be switched to 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal \npatches. \n\n \nAfter switching to 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal patches, provided these are well tolerated after a minimum of \nfour weeks of treatment, the dose of 4.6 mg/24 h should be increased to 9.5 mg/24 h, which is the \nrecommended effective dose. \n \nIt is recommended to apply the first transdermal patch on the day following the last oral dose. \n \nSpecial populations \n- Paediatric population: There is no relevant use of Rivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd. in the \n\npaediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. \n- Patients with body weight below 50 kg: Particular caution should be exercised in titrating \n\npatients with body weight below 50 kg above the recommended effective dose of 9.5 mg/24 h \n(see section 4.4). They may experience more adverse reactions and may be more likely to \ndiscontinue due to adverse reactions. \n\n- Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment. \nHowever, due to increased exposure in these populations as observed with the oral forms, dosing \nrecommendations to titrate according to individual tolerability should be closely followed as \npatients with clinically significant hepatic impairment might experience more adverse reactions. \nPatients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n- Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment. \nHowever, due to increased exposure in these populations as observed with the oral forms, dosing \nrecommendations to titrate according to individual tolerability should be closely followed as \npatients with clinically significant renal impairment might experience more adverse reactions \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \nMethod of administration \nTransdermal patches should be applied once a day to clean, dry, hairless, intact healthy skin on the upper \nor lower back, upper arm or chest, in a place which will not be rubbed by tight clothing. It is not \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nrecommended to apply the transdermal patch to the thigh or to the abdomen due to decreased \nbioavailability of rivastigmine observed when the transdermal patch is applied to these areas of the body. \n \nThe transdermal patch should not be applied to skin that is red, irritated or cut. Reapplication to the exact \nsame skin location within 14 days should be avoided to minimise the potential risk of skin irritation. \n \nPatients and caregivers should be instructed on important administration instructions: \n- The previous day’s patch must be removed before applying a new one every day (see section 4.9). \n- The patch should be replaced by a new one after 24 hours. Only one patch should be worn at a \n\ntime (see section 4.9). \n- The patch should be pressed down firmly for at least 30 seconds using the palm of the hand until \n\nthe edges stick well. \n- If the patch falls off, a new one should be applied for the rest of the day, then it should be replaced \n\nat the same time as usual the next day. \n- The patch can be used in everyday situations, including bathing and during hot weather. \n- The patch should not be exposed to any external heat sources (e.g. excessive sunlight, saunas, \n\nsolarium) for long periods of time. \n- The patch should not be cut into pieces. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nThe use of this medicinal product is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the active \nsubstance rivastigmine, to other carbamate derivatives or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nPrevious history of application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis with rivastigmine \npatch (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe incidence and severity of adverse reactions generally increase with increasing doses, particularly \nat dose changes. If treatment is interrupted for more than three days, it should be re-initiated with \n4.6 mg/24 h. \n \nMisuse of the medicinal product and dosing errors resulting in overdose \nMisuse of the medicinal product and dosing errors with rivastigmine transdermal patches have resulted \nin serious adverse reactions; some cases have required hospitalisation, and rarely led to death (see \nsection 4.9). Most cases of misuse of the medicinal product and dosing errors have involved not \nremoving the old patch when putting on a new one and the use of multiple patches at the same time. \nPatients and their caregivers must be instructed on important administration instructions for \nRivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd. transdermal patch (see section 4.2). \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nGastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are dose-related, and may occur \nwhen initiating treatment and/or increasing the dose (see section 4.8). These adverse reactions occur \nmore commonly in women. Patients who show signs or symptoms of dehydration resulting from \nprolonged vomiting or diarrhoea can be managed with intravenous fluids and dose reduction or \ndiscontinuation if recognised and treated promptly. Dehydration can be associated with serious \noutcomes. \n \nWeight loss \nPatients with Alzheimer’s disease may lose weight whilst taking cholinesterase inhibitors, including \nrivastigmine. The patient’s weight should be monitored during therapy with Rivastigmine 3M Health \nCare Ltd. transdermal patches. \n \nOther adverse reactions \nCare must be taken when prescribing Rivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd. transdermal patches: \n- to patients with sick sinus syndrome or conduction defects (sino-atrial block, atrio-ventricular \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nblock) (see section 4.8) \n- to patients with active gastric or duodenal ulcers or patients predisposed to these conditions \n\nbecause rivastigmine may cause increased gastric secretions (see section 4.8) \n- to patients predisposed to urinary obstruction and seizures because cholinomimetics may induce \n\nor exacerbate these diseases. \n- to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease. \n \nSkin application site reactions \nSkin application site reactions may occur with rivastigmine patch and are usually mild or moderate in \nintensity. Patients and caregivers should be instructed accordingly. \n \nThese reactions are not in themselves an indication of sensitisation. However, use of rivastigmine patch \nmay lead to allergic contact dermatitis. \n \nAllergic contact dermatitis should be suspected if application site reactions spread beyond the patch size, \nif there is evidence of a more intense local reaction (e.g. increasing erythema, oedema, papules, vesicles) \nand if symptoms do not significantly improve within 48 hours after patch removal. In these cases, \ntreatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3). \n \nPatients who develop application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis to rivastigmine \npatch and who still require rivastigmine treatment should only be switched to oral rivastigmine after \nnegative allergy testing and under close medical supervision. It is possible that some patients sensitised to \nrivastigmine by exposure to rivastigmine patch may not be able to take rivastigmine in any form. \n \nThere have been rare post-marketing reports of patients experiencing disseminated skin hypersensitivity \nreactions when administered rivastigmine irrespective of the route of administration (oral, transdermal). \nIn these cases, treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3). \n \nOther warnings and precautions \n \nRivastigmine may exacerbate or induce extrapyramidal symptoms. \n \nContact with the eyes should be avoided after handling Rivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd. transdermal \npatches (see section 5.3). Hands should be washed with soap and water after removing the patch. In case \nof contact with eyes or if the eyes become red after handling the patch, rinse immediately with plenty of \nwater and seek medical advice if symptoms do not resolve. \n \nSpecial populations: \n- Patients with body weight below 50 kg may experience more adverse reactions and may be \n\nmore likely to discontinue due to adverse reactions (see section 4.2). Carefully titrate and \nmonitor these patients for adverse reactions (e.g. excessive nausea or vomiting) and consider \nreducing the maintenance dose to the 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal patch if such adverse reactions \ndevelop. \n\n- Hepatic impairment: Patients with clinically significant hepatic impairment might experience \nmore adverse reactions (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Consider using the 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal \npatch both as initial and maximum dose in these patients. \n\n- Renal impairment: Patients with clinically significant renal impairment might experience more \nadverse reactions (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Consider using the 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal patch \nboth as initial and maximum dose in these patients. \n\n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo specific interaction studies have been performed with Rivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd. transdermal \npatches. \n \nAs a cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine may exaggerate the effects of succinylcholine-type muscle \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nrelaxants during anaesthesia. Caution is recommended when selecting anaesthetic agents. Possible dose \nadjustments or temporarily stopping treatment can be considered if needed. \n \nIn view of its pharmacodynamic effects, rivastigmine should not be given concomitantly with other \ncholinomimetic substances and might interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medicinal products. \n \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between oral rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam \nor fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is \nnot affected by administration of oral rivastigmine. No untoward effects on cardiac conduction were \nobserved following concomitant administration of digoxin and oral rivastigmine. \n \nConcomitant administration of rivastigmine with commonly prescribed medicinal products, such as \nantacids, antiemetics, antidiabetics, centrally acting antihypertensives, beta blockers, calcium channel \nblockers, inotropic agents, antianginals, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, oestrogens, analgesics, \nbenzodiazepines and antihistamines, was not associated with an alteration in the kinetics of rivastigmine \nor an increased risk of clinically relevant untoward effects. \n \nAccording to its metabolism, metabolic interactions with other medicinal products appear unlikely, \nalthough rivastigmine may inhibit the butyrylcholinesterase mediated metabolism of other substances. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nNo clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. In peri/postnatal studies in rats, an increased \ngestation time was observed. Rivastigmine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIn animals, rivastigmine is excreted into milk. It is not known if rivastigmine is excreted into human \nmilk. Therefore, women on rivastigmine should not breast-feed. \n \nFertility \nNo effects on fertility or embryofoetal development were observed in rats and rabbits, except at doses \nrelated to maternal toxicity. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAlzheimer’s disease may cause gradual impairment of driving performance or compromise the ability to \nuse machines. Furthermore, rivastigmine may induce syncope or delirium. As a consequence, \nrivastigmine has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Therefore, in \npatients with dementia treated with rivastigmine, the ability to continue driving or operating complex \nmachines should be routinely evaluated by the treating physician. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nApplication site skin reactions (usually mild to moderate application site erythema), are the most \nfrequent adverse reactions observed with the use of rivastigmine transdermal patch. The next most \ncommon adverse reactions are gastrointestinal in nature including nausea and vomiting. \n \nAdverse reactions in Table 1 are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency \ncategory. Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); \ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\nTable 1 displays the adverse reactions reported in 854 patients with Alzheimer’s dementia treated in \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo and active-controlled clinical studies with rivastigmine transdermal \npatches for a duration of 24-48 weeks and from post-marketing data. \n \nTable 1 \n \nInfections and infestations \n Common Urinary tract infection \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n Common Anorexia, decreased appetite \n Uncommon Dehydration \nPsychiatric disorders\n Common Anxiety, depression, delirium, agitation \n Uncommon Aggression \n Not known Hallucinations, restlessness \nNervous system disorders \n Common Headache, syncope, dizziness \n Uncommon Psychomotor hyperactivity \n Very rare Extrapyramidal symptoms \n Not known Worsening of Parkinson’s disease, seizure \nCardiac disorders \n Uncommon Bradycardia \n Not known Atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, sick sinus \n\nsyndrome \nVascular disorders \n Not known Hypertension \nGastrointestinal disorders \n Common Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain \n Uncommon Gastric ulcer \n Not known Pancreatitis \nHepatobiliary disorders \n Not known Hepatitis, elevated liver function tests \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\n Common Rash \n Not known Pruritus, erythema, urticaria, vesicles, allergic dermatitis, disseminated \n\ncutaneous hypersensitivity reactions \nRenal and urinary disorders \n Common Urinary incontinence \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\n Common Application site skin reactions (e.g. application site erythema, \n\napplication site pruritus, application site oedema, application site \ndermatitis, application site irritation), asthenic conditions (e.g. fatigue, \nasthenia), pyrexia, weight decreased \n\n Rare Fall \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nWhen doses higher than 13.3 mg/24 h were used in the above-mentioned placebo-controlled study, \ninsomnia and cardiac failure were observed more frequently than with 13.3 mg/24 h or placebo, \nsuggesting a dose effect relationship. However, these events did not occur at a higher frequency with \nrivastigmine 13.3 mg/24 h transdermal patches than with placebo. \n \nThe following adverse reactions have only been observed with rivastigmine capsules and oral solution \nand not in clinical studies with rivastigmine transdermal patches: somnolence, malaise, tremor, \nconfusion, sweating increased (common); duodenal ulcers, angina pectoris (rare); gastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage (very rare); and some cases of severe vomiting were associated with oesophageal rupture \n(not known). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\nSkin irritation \nIn a 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, skin reactions were measured at each visit \nusing a skin irritation rating scale that rated the degree of erythema, oedema, scaling, fissures, pruritus \nand pain/stinging/burning at the application site. The most commonly observed symptom was \nerythema which disappeared within 24 hours in the vast majority of patients. In the 24-week double-\nblind study, the most commonly observed symptoms (skin irritation rating scale) with rivastigmine \n9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patches were very slight (21.8%), mild (12.5%) or moderate (6.5%) erythema \nor very slight (11.9%), mild (7.3%) or moderate (5.0%) pruritus. The most commonly observed severe \nsymptoms with rivastigmine 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patches were pruritus (1.7%) and erythema \n(1.1%). Most skin reactions were limited to the application site and resulted in discontinuation in only \n2.4% of the patients in the rivastigmine 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patch group. \n \nIn a 48-week active-controlled clinical trial, cases of skin irritation were captured as patient or \ncaregiver reported adverse reactions. The most commonly reported skin irritation events during the \nfirst 24 weeks of the double-blind period with rivastigmine 13.3 mg/24 h transdermal patches and \nrivastigmine 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patches, respectively were application site erythema (5.7% vs \n4.6%) and application site pruritus (3.6% vs 2.8%). The percentages decreased in both rivastigmine \n13.3 mg/24 h transdermal patch and rivastigmine 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patch treatment groups over \ntime (>24 weeks): application site erythema (0.8% vs. 1.6%) and application site pruritus (0.4% vs. \n1.2%), respectively. Application site pruritus led to discontinuation in 1.1% of the patients from each \nof the treatment groups during the total 48-week double-blind treatment phase. Application site \nreactions were mostly mild to moderate in severity and were rated as severe in less than 2% of \npatients. \n \nA direct comparison of the rate of skin irritation events reported in each of these studies cannot be \nmade due to the difference in data collection methods employed. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nMost cases of accidental overdose of oral rivastigmine have not been associated with any clinical signs or \nsymptoms and almost all of the patients concerned continued rivastigmine treatment. Where symptoms \nhave occurred, they have included nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, hypertension or hallucinations. Due to \nthe known vagotonic effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on heart rate, bradycardia and/or syncope may \nalso occur. Ingestion of 46 mg of oral rivastigmine occurred in one case; following conservative \nmanagement the patient fully recovered within 24 hours. Overdose with rivastigmine transdermal patches \nresulting from misuse/dosing errors (application of multiple patches at a time) has been reported in the \npost-marketing setting. The typical symptoms reported among these cases are similar to those seen with \ncases of overdose associated with rivastigmine oral formulations. \n \nTreatment \nAs rivastigmine has a plasma half-life of about 3.4 hours and a duration of acetylcholinesterase inhibition \nof about 9 hours, it is recommended that in cases of asymptomatic overdose all Rivastigmine 3M Health \nCare Ltd. transdermal patches should be removed immediately and no further transdermal patch should \nbe applied for the next 24 hours. In overdose accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting, the use of \nantiemetics should be considered. Symptomatic treatment for other adverse reactions should be given as \nnecessary. \n \nIn massive overdose, atropine can be used. An initial dose of 0.03 mg/kg intravenous atropine sulphate is \nrecommended, with subsequent doses based on clinical response. Use of scopolamine as an antidote is \nnot recommended. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: psychoanaleptics, anticholinesterases, ATC code: N06DA03 \n \nRivastigmine is an acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor of the carbamate type, thought to \nfacilitate cholinergic neurotransmission by slowing the degradation of acetylcholine released by \nfunctionally intact cholinergic neurones. Thus, rivastigmine may have an ameliorative effect on \ncholinergic-mediated cognitive deficits in dementia associated with Alzheimer’s disease. \n \nRivastigmine interacts with its target enzymes by forming a covalently bound complex that \ntemporarily inactivates the enzymes. In healthy young men, an oral 3 mg dose decreases \nacetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in CSF by approximately 40% within the first 1.5 hours after \nadministration. Activity of the enzyme returns to baseline levels about 9 hours after the maximum \ninhibitory effect has been achieved. In patients with Alzheimer’s disease, inhibition of AChE in CSF \nby oral rivastigmine was dose-dependent up to 6 mg given twice daily, the highest dose tested. \nInhibition of butyrylcholinesterase activity in CSF of 14 Alzheimer patients treated by oral \nrivastigmine was similar to the inhibition of AChE activity. \n \nClinical studies in Alzheimer’s dementia \nThe efficacy of rivastigmine transdermal patches in patients with Alzheimer’s dementia has been \ndemonstrated in a 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled core study and its open-label extension \nphase and in a 48-week double-blind comparator study.  \n \n24-week placebo-controlled study \nPatients involved in the placebo-controlled study had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) \nscore of 10–20. Efficacy was established by the use of independent, domain-specific assessment tools \nwhich were applied at regular intervals during the 24-week treatment period. These include the \nADAS-Cog (Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive subscale, a performance-based \nmeasure of cognition) and the ADCS-CGIC (Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – Clinician’s \nGlobal Impression of Change, a comprehensive global assessment of the patient  by the physician \nincorporating caregiver input), and the ADCS-ADL (Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – \nActivities of Daily Living, a caregiver-rated assessment of the activities of daily living including \npersonal hygiene, feeding, dressing, household chores such as shopping, retention of ability to orient \noneself to surroundings as well as involvement in activities related to finances). The 24-week results \nfor the three assessment tools are summarised in Table 2. \n \nTable 2 \n \n Rivastigmine \n\ntransdermal patches \n9.5 mg/24 h \n\nRivastigmine \ncapsules \n\n12 mg/day \n\nPlacebo \n\nITT-LOCF population N = 251 N = 256 N = 282 \nADAS-Cog    \n (n=248) (n=253) (n=281) \nMean baseline  SD 27.0  10.3 27.9  9.4 28.6  9.9 \nMean change at week 24  SD -0.6  6.4 -0.6  6.2 1.0  6.8 \np-value versus placebo 0.005*1 0.003*1  \nADCS-CGIC    \n (n=248) (n=253) (n=278) \nMean score  SD 3.9  1.20 3.9  1.25 4.2  1.26 \np-value versus placebo 0.010*2 0.009*2  \nADCS-ADL    \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\n (n=247) (n=254) (n=281) \nMean baseline  SD 50.1  16.3 49.3  15.8 49.2  16.0 \nMean change at week 24  SD -0.1  9.1 -0.5  9.5 -2.3  9.4 \np-value versus placebo 0.013*1 0.039*1  \n* p≤0.05 versus placebo \nITT: Intent-To-Treat; LOCF: Last Observation Carried Forward \n1 Based on ANCOVA with treatment and country as factors and baseline value as a covariate. \nNegative ADAS-Cog changes indicate improvement.

The study was designed to compare the efficacy of the 13.3 mg/24 h transdermal patch against \nthe 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patch during a 48-week double-blind treatment phase in Alzheimer’s \ndisease patients who demonstrated functional and cognitive decline after an initial 24-48 week open-\nlabel treatment phase while on a maintenance dose of 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patch. Functional \ndecline was assessed by the investigator and cognitive decline was defined as a decrease in the MMSE \nscore of >2 points from the previous visit or a decrease of >3 points from baseline. Efficacy was \nestablished by the use of ADAS-Cog (Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive subscale, a \nperformance-based measure of cognition) and the ADCS-IADL (Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative \nStudy – Instrumental Activities of Daily Living) assessing instrumental activities which include \nmaintaining finances, meal preparation, shopping, ability to orient oneself to surroundings, ability to \nbe left unattended.

After the first dose, \ndetectable plasma concentrations are observed after a lag time of 0.5-1 hour. Cmax is reached after \n10-16 hours. After the peak, plasma concentrations slowly decrease over the remainder of the 24-hour \nperiod of application. With multiple dosing (such as at steady state), after the previous transdermal \npatch is replaced with a new one, plasma concentrations initially decrease slowly for about 40 minutes \non average, until absorption from the newly applied transdermal patch becomes faster than \nelimination, and plasma levels begin to rise again to reach a new peak at approximately 8 hours. At \nsteady state, trough levels are approximately 50% of peak levels, in contrast to oral administration, \nwith which concentrations fall off to virtually zero between doses. Although less pronounced than \nwith the oral formulation, exposure to rivastigmine (Cmax and AUC) increased over-proportionally by a \nfactor of 2.6 and 4.9 when escalating from 4.6 mg/24 h to 9.5 mg/24 h and to 13.3 mg/24 h, \nrespectively. The fluctuation index (FI), a measure of the relative difference between peak and trough \nconcentrations ((Cmax-Cmin)/Cavg), was 0.58 for rivastigmine 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal patches, 0.77 for \nrivastigmine 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patches and 0.72 for rivastigmine 13.3 mg/24 h transdermal \npatches, thus demonstrating a much smaller fluctuation between trough and peak concentrations than \nfor the oral formulation (FI = 3.96 (6 mg/day) and 4.15 (12 mg/day)). \n \nThe dose of rivastigmine released from the transdermal patch over 24 hours (mg/24 h) cannot be \ndirectly equated to the amount (mg) of rivastigmine contained in a capsule with respect to plasma \nconcentration produced over 24 hours. \n \nThe single-dose inter-subject variability in rivastigmine pharmacokinetic parameters (normalised to \ndose/kg bodyweight) was 43% (Cmax) and 49% (AUC0-24h) after transdermal administration versus \n74% and 103%, respectively, after the oral form. The inter-patient variability in a steady-state study in \nAlzheimer’s dementia was at most 45% (Cmax) and 43% (AUC0-24h) after use of the transdermal patch, \nand 71% and 73%, respectively, after administration of the oral form. \n \nA relationship between active substance exposure at steady state (rivastigmine and metabolite \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n12 \n\nNAP226-90) and bodyweight was observed in Alzheimer’s dementia patients. Compared to a patient \nwith a body weight of 65 kg, the rivastigmine steady-state concentrations in a patient with a body \nweight of 35 kg would be approximately doubled, while for a patient with a body weight of 100 kg the \nconcentrations would be approximately halved. The effect of bodyweight on active substance \nexposure suggests special attention to patients with very low body weight during up-titration (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nExposure (AUC∞) to rivastigmine (and metabolite NAP266-90) was highest when the transdermal \npatch was applied to the upper back, chest, or upper arm and approximately 20–30% lower when \napplied to the abdomen or thigh. \n \nThere was no relevant accumulation of rivastigmine or the metabolite NAP226-90 in plasma in patients \nwith Alzheimer’s disease, except that plasma levels were higher on the second day of transdermal patch \ntherapy than on the first. \n \nDistribution \nRivastigmine is weakly bound to plasma proteins (approximately 40%). It readily crosses the blood-brain \nbarrier and has an apparent volume of distribution in the range of 1.8-2.7 l/kg. \n \nBiotransformation \nRivastigmine is rapidly and extensively metabolised with an apparent elimination half-life in plasma of \napproximately 3.4 hours after removal of the transdermal patch. Elimination was absorption rate limited \n(flip-flop kinetics), which explains the longer t½ after transdermal patch (3.4 h) versus oral or intravenous \nadministrations (1.4 to 1.7 h). Metabolism is primarily via cholinesterase-mediated hydrolysis to the \nmetabolite NAP226-90. In vitro, this metabolite shows minimal inhibition of acetylcholinesterase \n(<10%). Based on evidence from in vitro and animal studies, the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are \nminimally involved in rivastigmine metabolism. Total plasma clearance of rivastigmine was \napproximately 130 litres/h after a 0.2 mg intravenous dose and decreased to 70 litres/h after a 2.7 mg \nintravenous dose, which is consistent with the non-linear, over-proportional pharmacokinetics of \nrivastigmine due to saturation of its elimination. \n \nThe metabolite-to-parent AUC∞ ratio was around 0.7 after transdermal patch administration versus 3.5 \nafter oral administration, indicating that much less metabolism occurred after dermal compared to oral \ntreatment. Less NAP226-90 is formed following application of the transdermal patch, presumably \nbecause of the lack of presystemic (hepatic first pass) metabolism, in contrast to oral administration. \n \nElimination \nUnchanged rivastigmine is found in trace amounts in the urine; renal excretion of the metabolites is the \nmajor route of elimination after transdermal patch administration. Following administration of oral 14C-\nrivastigmine, renal elimination was rapid and essentially complete (>90%) within 24 hours. Less than 1% \nof the administered dose is excreted in the faeces. \n \nElderly population \nAge had no impact on the exposure to rivastigmine in Alzheimer’s disease patients treated with \nrivastigmine transdermal patches. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo study was conducted with rivastigmine transdermal patches in subjects with hepatic impairment. \nAfter oral administration, the Cmax of rivastigmine was approximately 60% higher and the AUC of \nrivastigmine was more than twice as high in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment than in \nhealthy subjects. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo study was conducted with rivastigmine transdermal patches in subjects with renal impairment. After \noral administration, Cmax and AUC of rivastigmine were more than twice as high in Alzheimer patients \nwith moderate renal impairment compared with healthy subjects; however there were no changes in Cmax \nand AUC of rivastigmine in Alzheimer patients with severe renal impairment. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nOral and topical repeated-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and minipigs revealed only \neffects associated with an exaggerated pharmacological action. No target organ toxicity was observed. \nOral and topical dosing in animal studies was limited due to the sensitivity of the animal models used. \n \nRivastigmine was not mutagenic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests, except in a \nchromosomal aberration test in human peripheral lymphocytes at a dose exceeding 104 times the foreseen \nclinical exposure. The in vivo micronucleus test was negative. \n \nNo evidence of carcinogenicity was found in oral and topical studies in mice and in an oral study in \nrats at the maximum tolerated dose. The exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was \napproximately equivalent to human exposure with highest doses of rivastigmine capsules and \ntransdermal patches. \n \nIn animals, rivastigmine crosses the placenta and is excreted into milk. Oral studies in pregnant rats and \nrabbits gave no indication of teratogenic potential on the part of rivastigmine. Specific dermal studies in \npregnant animals have not been conducted. \n \nRivastigmine transdermal patches were not phototoxic. In some other dermal toxicity studies, a mild \nirritant effect on the skin of laboratory animals, including controls, was observed. This may indicate a \npotential for rivastigmine transdermal patches to induce mild erythema in patients. When administered to \nrabbit eyes in primary eye irritation studies, rivastigmine caused reddening and swelling of the \nconjunctiva, corneal opacities and miosis which persisted for 7 days. Therefore, the patient/caregiver \nshould avoid contact with the eyes after handling of the patch (see section 4.4). \n \n \n6.

Similar to any \ntreatment initiated in patients with dementia, therapy with rivastigmine should only be started if a \ncaregiver is available to regularly administer and monitor the treatment. \n \nPosology \n \nTransdermal patches Rivastigmine in vivo release \n\nrates per 24 h\nRivastigmine 4.6 mg/24 h 4.6 mg \nRivastigmine 9.5 mg/24 h 9.5 mg \nRivastigmine 13.3 mg/24 h* 13.3 mg \n \n*A marketing authorisation for Rivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd. 13.3 mg/24 h transdermal patch is \ncurrently not available, this presentation may although be available from other marketing authorisation \nholders.  \n \nInitial dose \nTreatment is started with 4.6 mg/24 h. \n \nMaintenance dose \nAfter a minimum of four weeks of treatment and if well tolerated according to the treating physician, the \ndose of 4.6 mg/24 h should be increased to 9.5 mg/24 h, the daily recommended effective dose, which \nshould be continued for as long as the patient continues to demonstrate therapeutic benefit. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n16 \n\n \nDose escalation \n9.5 mg/24 h is the recommended daily effective dose which should be continued for as long as the patient \ncontinues to demonstrate therapeutic benefit. If well tolerated and only after a minimum of six months \nof treatment at 9.5 mg/24 h, the treating physician may consider increasing the dose to 13.3 mg/24 h in \npatients who have demonstrated a meaningful cognitive deterioration (e.g. decrease in the MMSE) \nand/or functional decline (based on physician judgement) while on the recommended daily effective \ndose of 9.5 mg/24 h (see section 5.1). \n \nThe clinical benefit of rivastigmine should be reassessed on a regular basis. Discontinuation should also \nbe considered when evidence of a therapeutic effect at the optimal dose is no longer present. \n \nTreatment should be temporarily interrupted if gastrointestinal adverse reactions are observed until \nthese adverse reactions resolve. Transdermal patch treatment can be resumed at the same dose if \ntreatment is not interrupted for more than three days. Otherwise treatment should be re-initiated with \n4.6 mg/24 h. \n \nSwitching from capsules or oral solution to transdermal patches \nBased on comparable exposure between oral and transdermal rivastigmine (see section 5.2), patients \ntreated with rivastigmine capsules or oral solution can be switched to Rivastigmine 3M Health Care \nLtd. transdermal patches as follows: \n- A patient on a dose of 3 mg/day oral rivastigmine can be switched to 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal \n\npatches. \n- A patient on a dose of 6 mg/day oral rivastigmine can be switched to 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal \n\npatches. \n- A patient on a stable and well tolerated dose of 9 mg/day oral rivastigmine can be switched to \n\n9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patches. If the oral dose of 9 mg/day has not been stable and well \ntolerated, a switch to 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal patches is recommended. \n\n- A patient on a dose of 12 mg/day oral rivastigmine can be switched to 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal \npatches. \n\n \nAfter switching to 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal patches, provided these are well tolerated after a minimum of \nfour weeks of treatment, the dose of 4.6 mg/24 h should be increased to 9.5 mg/24 h, which is the \nrecommended effective dose. \n \nIt is recommended to apply the first transdermal patch on the day following the last oral dose. \n \nSpecial populations \n- Paediatric population: There is no relevant use of Rivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd. in the \n\npaediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. \n- Patients with body weight below 50 kg: Particular caution should be exercised in titrating \n\npatients with body weight below 50 kg above the recommended effective dose of 9.5 mg/24 h \n(see section 4.4). They may experience more adverse reactions and may be more likely to \ndiscontinue due to adverse reactions. \n\n- Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment. \nHowever, due to increased exposure in these populations as observed with the oral forms, dosing \nrecommendations to titrate according to individual tolerability should be closely followed as \npatients with clinically significant hepatic impairment might experience more adverse reactions. \nPatients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n- Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment. \nHowever, due to increased exposure in these populations as observed with the oral forms, dosing \nrecommendations to titrate according to individual tolerability should be closely followed as \npatients with clinically significant renal impairment might experience more adverse reactions \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \nMethod of administration \nTransdermal patches should be applied once a day to clean, dry, hairless, intact healthy skin on the upper \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n17 \n\nor lower back, upper arm or chest, in a place which will not be rubbed by tight clothing. It is not \nrecommended to apply the transdermal patch to the thigh or to the abdomen due to decreased \nbioavailability of rivastigmine observed when the transdermal patch is applied to these areas of the body. \n \nThe transdermal patch should not be applied to skin that is red, irritated or cut. Reapplication to the exact \nsame skin location within 14 days should be avoided to minimise the potential risk of skin irritation. \n \nPatients and caregivers should be instructed on important administration instructions: \n- The previous day’s patch must be removed before applying a new one every day (see section 4.9). \n- The patch should be replaced by a new one after 24 hours. Only one patch should be worn at a \n\ntime (see section 4.9). \n- The patch should be pressed down firmly for at least 30 seconds using the palm of the hand until \n\nthe edges stick well. \n- If the patch falls off, a new one should be applied for the rest of the day, then it should be replaced \n\nat the same time as usual the next day. \n- The patch can be used in everyday situations, including bathing and during hot weather. \n- The patch should not be exposed to any external heat sources (e.g. excessive sunlight, saunas, \n\nsolarium) for long periods of time. \n- The patch should not be cut into pieces. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nThe use of this medicinal product is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the active \nsubstance rivastigmine, to other carbamate derivatives or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nPrevious history of application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis with rivastigmine \npatch (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe incidence and severity of adverse reactions generally increase with increasing doses, particularly \nat dose changes. If treatment is interrupted for more than three days, it should be re-initiated with \n4.6 mg/24 h. \n \nMisuse of the medicinal product and dosing errors resulting in overdose \nMisuse of the medicinal product and dosing errors with rivastigmine transdermal patches have resulted \nin serious adverse reactions; some cases have required hospitalisation, and rarely led to death (see \nsection 4.9). Most cases of misuse of the medicinal product and dosing errors have involved not \nremoving the old patch when putting on a new one and the use of multiple patches at the same time. \nPatients and their caregivers must be instructed on important administration instructions for \nRivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd. transdermal patch (see section 4.2). \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nGastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are dose-related, and may occur \nwhen initiating treatment and/or increasing the dose (see section 4.8). These adverse reactions occur \nmore commonly in women. Patients who show signs or symptoms of dehydration resulting from \nprolonged vomiting or diarrhoea can be managed with intravenous fluids and dose reduction or \ndiscontinuation if recognised and treated promptly. Dehydration can be associated with serious \noutcomes. \n \nWeight loss \nPatients with Alzheimer’s disease may lose weight whilst taking cholinesterase inhibitors, including \nrivastigmine. The patient’s weight should be monitored during therapy with Rivastigmine 3M Health \nCare Ltd. transdermal patches. \n \nOther adverse reactions \nCare must be taken when prescribing Rivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd. transdermal patches: \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n18 \n\n- to patients with sick sinus syndrome or conduction defects (sino-atrial block, atrio-ventricular \nblock) (see section 4.8) \n\n- to patients with active gastric or duodenal ulcers or patients predisposed to these conditions \nbecause rivastigmine may cause increased gastric secretions (see section 4.8) \n\n- to patients predisposed to urinary obstruction and seizures because cholinomimetics may induce \nor exacerbate these diseases. \n\n- to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease. \n \nSkin application site reactions \nSkin application site reactions may occur with rivastigmine patch and are usually mild or moderate in \nintensity. Patients and caregivers should be instructed accordingly. \n \nThese reactions are not in themselves an indication of sensitisation. However, use of rivastigmine patch \nmay lead to allergic contact dermatitis. \n \nAllergic contact dermatitis should be suspected if application site reactions spread beyond the patch size, \nif there is evidence of a more intense local reaction (e.g. increasing erythema, oedema, papules, vesicles) \nand if symptoms do not significantly improve within 48 hours after patch removal. In these cases, \ntreatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3). \n \nPatients who develop application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis to rivastigmine \npatch and who still require rivastigmine treatment should only be switched to oral rivastigmine after \nnegative allergy testing and under close medical supervision. It is possible that some patients sensitised to \nrivastigmine by exposure to rivastigmine patch may not be able to take rivastigmine in any form. \n \nThere have been rare post-marketing reports of patients experiencing disseminated skin hypersensitivity \nreactions when administered rivastigmine irrespective of the route of administration (oral, transdermal). \nIn these cases, treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3). \n \nOther warnings and precautions \n \nRivastigmine may exacerbate or induce extrapyramidal symptoms. \n \nContact with the eyes should be avoided after handling Rivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd. transdermal \npatches (see section 5.3). Hands should be washed with soap and water after removing the patch. In case \nof contact with eyes or if the eyes become red after handling the patch, rinse immediately with plenty of \nwater and seek medical advice if symptoms do not resolve. \n \nSpecial populations: \n- Patients with body weight below 50 kg may experience more adverse reactions and may be \n\nmore likely to discontinue due to adverse reactions (see section 4.2). Carefully titrate and \nmonitor these patients for adverse reactions (e.g. excessive nausea or vomiting) and consider \nreducing the maintenance dose to the 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal patch if such adverse reactions \ndevelop. \n\n- Hepatic impairment: Patients with clinically significant hepatic impairment might experience \nmore adverse reactions (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Consider using the 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal \npatch both as initial and maximum dose in these patients. \n\n- Renal impairment: Patients with clinically significant renal impairment might experience more \nadverse reactions (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Consider using the 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal patch \nboth as initial and maximum dose in these patients. \n\n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo specific interaction studies have been performed with Rivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd. transdermal \npatches. \n \nAs a cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine may exaggerate the effects of succinylcholine-type muscle \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n19 \n\nrelaxants during anaesthesia. Caution is recommended when selecting anaesthetic agents. Possible dose \nadjustments or temporarily stopping treatment can be considered if needed. \n \nIn view of its pharmacodynamic effects, rivastigmine should not be given concomitantly with other \ncholinomimetic substances and might interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medicinal products. \n \nNo pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between oral rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam \nor fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is \nnot affected by administration of oral rivastigmine. No untoward effects on cardiac conduction were \nobserved following concomitant administration of digoxin and oral rivastigmine. \n \nConcomitant administration of rivastigmine with commonly prescribed medicinal products, such as \nantacids, antiemetics, antidiabetics, centrally acting antihypertensives, beta blockers, calcium channel \nblockers, inotropic agents, antianginals, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, oestrogens, analgesics, \nbenzodiazepines and antihistamines, was not associated with an alteration in the kinetics of rivastigmine \nor an increased risk of clinically relevant untoward effects. \n \nAccording to its metabolism, metabolic interactions with other medicinal products appear unlikely, \nalthough rivastigmine may inhibit the butyrylcholinesterase mediated metabolism of other substances. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nNo clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. In peri/postnatal studies in rats, an increased \ngestation time was observed. Rivastigmine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIn animals, rivastigmine is excreted into milk. It is not known if rivastigmine is excreted into human \nmilk. Therefore, women on rivastigmine should not breast-feed. \n \nFertility \nNo effects on fertility or embryofoetal development were observed in rats and rabbits, except at doses \nrelated to maternal toxicity. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAlzheimer’s disease may cause gradual impairment of driving performance or compromise the ability to \nuse machines. Furthermore, rivastigmine may induce syncope or delirium. As a consequence, \nrivastigmine has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Therefore, in \npatients with dementia treated with rivastigmine, the ability to continue driving or operating complex \nmachines should be routinely evaluated by the treating physician. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nApplication site skin reactions (usually mild to moderate application site erythema), are the most \nfrequent adverse reactions observed with the use of rivastigmine transdermal patch. The next most \ncommon adverse reactions are gastrointestinal in nature including nausea and vomiting. \n \nAdverse reactions in Table 1 are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency \ncategory. Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); \ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n20 \n\nTable 1 displays the adverse reactions reported in 854 patients with Alzheimer’s dementia treated in \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo and active-controlled clinical studies with rivastigmine transdermal \npatches for a duration of 24-48 weeks and from post-marketing data. \n \nTable 1 \n \nInfections and infestations \n Common Urinary tract infection \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n Common Anorexia, decreased appetite \n Uncommon Dehydration \nPsychiatric disorders\n Common Anxiety, depression, delirium, agitation \n Uncommon Aggression \n Not known Hallucinations, restlessness \nNervous system disorders \n Common Headache, syncope, dizziness \n Uncommon Psychomotor hyperactivity \n Very rare Extrapyramidal symptoms \n Not known Worsening of Parkinson’s disease, seizure \nCardiac disorders \n Uncommon Bradycardia \n Not known Atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, sick sinus \n\nsyndrome \nVascular disorders \n Not known Hypertension \nGastrointestinal disorders \n Common Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain \n Uncommon Gastric ulcer \n Not known Pancreatitis \nHepatobiliary disorders \n Not known Hepatitis, elevated liver function tests \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\n Common Rash \n Not known Pruritus, erythema, urticaria, vesicles, allergic dermatitis, disseminated \n\ncutaneous hypersensitivity reactions \nRenal and urinary disorders \n Common Urinary incontinence \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\n Common Application site skin reactions (e.g. application site erythema, \n\napplication site pruritus, application site oedema, application site \ndermatitis, application site irritation), asthenic conditions (e.g. fatigue, \nasthenia), pyrexia, weight decreased \n\n Rare Fall \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nWhen doses higher than 13.3 mg/24 h were used in the above-mentioned placebo-controlled study, \ninsomnia and cardiac failure were observed more frequently than with 13.3 mg/24 h or placebo, \nsuggesting a dose effect relationship. However, these events did not occur at a higher frequency with \nrivastigmine 13.3 mg/24 h transdermal patches than with placebo. \n \nThe following adverse reactions have only been observed with rivastigmine capsules and oral solution \nand not in clinical studies with rivastigmine transdermal patches: somnolence, malaise, tremor, \nconfusion, sweating increased (common); duodenal ulcers, angina pectoris (rare); gastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage (very rare); and some cases of severe vomiting were associated with oesophageal rupture \n(not known). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n21 \n\nSkin irritation \nIn a 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, skin reactions were measured at each visit \nusing a skin irritation rating scale that rated the degree of erythema, oedema, scaling, fissures, pruritus \nand pain/stinging/burning at the application site. The most commonly observed symptom was \nerythema which disappeared within 24 hours in the vast majority of patients. In the 24-week double-\nblind study, the most commonly observed symptoms (skin irritation rating scale) with rivastigmine \n9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patches were very slight (21.8%), mild (12.5%) or moderate (6.5%) erythema \nor very slight (11.9%), mild (7.3%) or moderate (5.0%) pruritus. The most commonly observed severe \nsymptoms with rivastigmine 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patches were pruritus (1.7%) and erythema \n(1.1%). Most skin reactions were limited to the application site and resulted in discontinuation in only \n2.4% of the patients in the rivastigmine 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patch group. \n \nIn a 48-week active-controlled clinical trial, cases of skin irritation were captured as patient or \ncaregiver reported adverse reactions. The most commonly reported skin irritation events during the \nfirst 24 weeks of the double-blind period with rivastigmine 13.3 mg/24 h transdermal patches and \nrivastigmine 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patches, respectively were application site erythema (5.7% vs \n4.6%) and application site pruritus (3.6% vs 2.8%). The percentages decreased in both rivastigmine \n13.3 mg/24 h transdermal patch and rivastigmine 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patch treatment groups over \ntime (>24 weeks): application site erythema (0.8% vs. 1.6%) and application site pruritus (0.4% vs. \n1.2%), respectively. Application site pruritus led to discontinuation in 1.1% of the patients from each \nof the treatment groups during the total 48-week double-blind treatment phase. Application site \nreactions were mostly mild to moderate in severity and were rated as severe in less than 2% of \npatients. \n \nA direct comparison of the rate of skin irritation events reported in each of these studies cannot be \nmade due to the difference in data collection methods employed. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nMost cases of accidental overdose of oral rivastigmine have not been associated with any clinical signs or \nsymptoms and almost all of the patients concerned continued rivastigmine treatment. Where symptoms \nhave occurred, they have included nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, hypertension or hallucinations. Due to \nthe known vagotonic effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on heart rate, bradycardia and/or syncope may \nalso occur. Ingestion of 46 mg of oral rivastigmine occurred in one case; following conservative \nmanagement the patient fully recovered within 24 hours. Overdose with rivastigmine transdermal patches \nresulting from misuse/dosing errors (application of multiple patches at a time) has been reported in the \npost-marketing setting. The typical symptoms reported among these cases are similar to those seen with \ncases of overdose associated with rivastigmine oral formulations. \n \nTreatment \nAs rivastigmine has a plasma half-life of about 3.4 hours and a duration of acetylcholinesterase inhibition \nof about 9 hours, it is recommended that in cases of asymptomatic overdose all Rivastigmine 3M Health \nCare Ltd. transdermal patches should be removed immediately and no further transdermal patch should \nbe applied for the next 24 hours. In overdose accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting, the use of \nantiemetics should be considered. Symptomatic treatment for other adverse reactions should be given as \nnecessary. \n \nIn massive overdose, atropine can be used. An initial dose of 0.03 mg/kg intravenous atropine sulphate is \nrecommended, with subsequent doses based on clinical response. Use of scopolamine as an antidote is \nnot recommended. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: psychoanaleptics, anticholinesterases, ATC code: N06DA03 \n \nRivastigmine is an acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor of the carbamate type, thought to \nfacilitate cholinergic neurotransmission by slowing the degradation of acetylcholine released by \nfunctionally intact cholinergic neurones. Thus, rivastigmine may have an ameliorative effect on \ncholinergic-mediated cognitive deficits in dementia associated with Alzheimer’s disease. \n \nRivastigmine interacts with its target enzymes by forming a covalently bound complex that \ntemporarily inactivates the enzymes. In healthy young men, an oral 3 mg dose decreases \nacetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in CSF by approximately 40% within the first 1.5 hours after \nadministration. Activity of the enzyme returns to baseline levels about 9 hours after the maximum \ninhibitory effect has been achieved. In patients with Alzheimer’s disease, inhibition of AChE in CSF \nby oral rivastigmine was dose-dependent up to 6 mg given twice daily, the highest dose tested. \nInhibition of butyrylcholinesterase activity in CSF of 14 Alzheimer patients treated by oral \nrivastigmine was similar to the inhibition of AChE activity. \n \nClinical studies in Alzheimer’s dementia \nThe efficacy of rivastigmine transdermal patches in patients with Alzheimer’s dementia has been \ndemonstrated in a 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled core study and its open-label extension \nphase and in a 48-week double-blind comparator study.  \n \n24-week placebo-controlled study \nPatients involved in the placebo-controlled study had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) \nscore of 10–20. Efficacy was established by the use of independent, domain-specific assessment tools \nwhich were applied at regular intervals during the 24-week treatment period. These include the \nADAS-Cog (Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive subscale, a performance-based \nmeasure of cognition) and the ADCS-CGIC (Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – Clinician’s \nGlobal Impression of Change, a comprehensive global assessment of the patient  by the physician \nincorporating caregiver input), and the ADCS-ADL (Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – \nActivities of Daily Living, a caregiver-rated assessment of the activities of daily living including \npersonal hygiene, feeding, dressing, household chores such as shopping, retention of ability to orient \noneself to surroundings as well as involvement in activities related to finances). The 24-week results \nfor the three assessment tools are summarised in Table 2. \n \nTable 2 \n \n Rivastigmine \n\ntransdermal patches \n9.5 mg/24 h \n\nRivastigmine \ncapsules \n\n12 mg/day \n\nPlacebo \n\nITT-LOCF population N = 251 N = 256 N = 282 \nADAS-Cog    \n (n=248) (n=253) (n=281) \nMean baseline  SD 27.0  10.3 27.9  9.4 28.6  9.9 \nMean change at week 24  SD -0.6  6.4 -0.6  6.2 1.0  6.8 \np-value versus placebo 0.005*1 0.003*1  \nADCS-CGIC    \n (n=248) (n=253) (n=278) \nMean score  SD 3.9  1.20 3.9  1.25 4.2  1.26 \np-value versus placebo 0.010*2 0.009*2  \nADCS-ADL    \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n23 \n\n (n=247) (n=254) (n=281) \nMean baseline  SD 50.1  16.3 49.3  15.8 49.2  16.0 \nMean change at week 24  SD -0.1  9.1 -0.5  9.5 -2.3  9.4 \np-value versus placebo 0.013*1 0.039*1  \n* p≤0.05 versus placebo \nITT: Intent-To-Treat; LOCF: Last Observation Carried Forward \n1 Based on ANCOVA with treatment and country as factors and baseline value as a covariate. \nNegative ADAS-Cog changes indicate improvement.

The study was designed to compare the efficacy of the 13.3 mg/24 h transdermal patch against \nthe 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patch during a 48-week double-blind treatment phase in Alzheimer’s \ndisease patients who demonstrated functional and cognitive decline after an initial 24-48 week open-\nlabel treatment phase while on a maintenance dose of 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patch. Functional \ndecline was assessed by the investigator and cognitive decline was defined as a decrease in the MMSE \nscore of >2 points from the previous visit or a decrease of >3 points from baseline. Efficacy was \nestablished by the use of ADAS-Cog (Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive subscale, a \nperformance-based measure of cognition) and the ADCS-IADL (Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative \nStudy – Instrumental Activities of Daily Living) assessing instrumental activities which include \nmaintaining finances, meal preparation, shopping, ability to orient oneself to surroundings, ability to \nbe left unattended.

After the first dose, \ndetectable plasma concentrations are observed after a lag time of 0.5-1 hour. Cmax is reached after \n10-16 hours. After the peak, plasma concentrations slowly decrease over the remainder of the 24-hour \nperiod of application. With multiple dosing (such as at steady state), after the previous transdermal \npatch is replaced with a new one, plasma concentrations initially decrease slowly for about 40 minutes \non average, until absorption from the newly applied transdermal patch becomes faster than \nelimination, and plasma levels begin to rise again to reach a new peak at approximately 8 hours. At \nsteady state, trough levels are approximately 50% of peak levels, in contrast to oral administration, \nwith which concentrations fall off to virtually zero between doses. Although less pronounced than \nwith the oral formulation, exposure to rivastigmine (Cmax and AUC) increased over-proportionally by a \nfactor of 2.6 and 4.9 when escalating from 4.6 mg/24 h to 9.5 mg/24 h and to 13.3 mg/24 h, \nrespectively. The fluctuation index (FI), a measure of the relative difference between peak and trough \nconcentrations ((Cmax-Cmin)/Cavg), was 0.58 for rivastigmine 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal patches, 0.77 for \nrivastigmine 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patches and 0.72 for rivastigmine 13.3 mg/24 h transdermal \npatches, thus demonstrating a much smaller fluctuation between trough and peak concentrations than \nfor the oral formulation (FI = 3.96 (6 mg/day) and 4.15 (12 mg/day)). \n \nThe dose of rivastigmine released from the transdermal patch over 24 hours (mg/24 h) cannot be \ndirectly equated to the amount (mg) of rivastigmine contained in a capsule with respect to plasma \nconcentration produced over 24 hours. \n \nThe single-dose inter-subject variability in rivastigmine pharmacokinetic parameters (normalised to \ndose/kg bodyweight) was 43% (Cmax) and 49% (AUC0-24h) after transdermal administration versus \n74% and 103%, respectively, after the oral form. The inter-patient variability in a steady-state study in \nAlzheimer’s dementia was at most 45% (Cmax) and 43% (AUC0-24h) after use of the transdermal patch, \nand 71% and 73%, respectively, after administration of the oral form. \n \nA relationship between active substance exposure at steady state (rivastigmine and metabolite \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n25 \n\nNAP226-90) and bodyweight was observed in Alzheimer’s dementia patients. Compared to a patient \nwith a body weight of 65 kg, the rivastigmine steady-state concentrations in a patient with a body \nweight of 35 kg would be approximately doubled, while for a patient with a body weight of 100 kg the \nconcentrations would be approximately halved. The effect of bodyweight on active substance \nexposure suggests special attention to patients with very low body weight during up-titration (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nExposure (AUC∞) to rivastigmine (and metabolite NAP266-90) was highest when the transdermal \npatch was applied to the upper back, chest, or upper arm and approximately 20–30% lower when \napplied to the abdomen or thigh. \n \nThere was no relevant accumulation of rivastigmine or the metabolite NAP226-90 in plasma in patients \nwith Alzheimer’s disease, except that plasma levels were higher on the second day of transdermal patch \ntherapy than on the first. \n \nDistribution \nRivastigmine is weakly bound to plasma proteins (approximately 40%). It readily crosses the blood-brain \nbarrier and has an apparent volume of distribution in the range of 1.8-2.7 l/kg. \n \nBiotransformation \nRivastigmine is rapidly and extensively metabolised with an apparent elimination half-life in plasma of \napproximately 3.4 hours after removal of the transdermal patch. Elimination was absorption rate limited \n(flip-flop kinetics), which explains the longer t½ after transdermal patch (3.4 h) versus oral or intravenous \nadministrations (1.4 to 1.7 h). Metabolism is primarily via cholinesterase-mediated hydrolysis to the \nmetabolite NAP226-90. In vitro, this metabolite shows minimal inhibition of acetylcholinesterase \n(<10%). Based on evidence from in vitro and animal studies, the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are \nminimally involved in rivastigmine metabolism. Total plasma clearance of rivastigmine was \napproximately 130 litres/h after a 0.2 mg intravenous dose and decreased to 70 litres/h after a 2.7 mg \nintravenous dose, which is consistent with the non-linear, over-proportional pharmacokinetics of \nrivastigmine due to saturation of its elimination. \n \nThe metabolite-to-parent AUC∞ ratio was around 0.7 after transdermal patch administration versus 3.5 \nafter oral administration, indicating that much less metabolism occurred after dermal compared to oral \ntreatment. Less NAP226-90 is formed following application of the transdermal patch, presumably \nbecause of the lack of presystemic (hepatic first pass) metabolism, in contrast to oral administration. \n \nElimination \nUnchanged rivastigmine is found in trace amounts in the urine; renal excretion of the metabolites is the \nmajor route of elimination after transdermal patch administration. Following administration of oral 14C-\nrivastigmine, renal elimination was rapid and essentially complete (>90%) within 24 hours. Less than 1% \nof the administered dose is excreted in the faeces. \n \nElderly population \nAge had no impact on the exposure to rivastigmine in Alzheimer’s disease patients treated with \nrivastigmine transdermal patches. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo study was conducted with rivastigmine transdermal patches in subjects with hepatic impairment. \nAfter oral administration, the Cmax of rivastigmine was approximately 60% higher and the AUC of \nrivastigmine was more than twice as high in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment than in \nhealthy subjects. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo study was conducted with rivastigmine transdermal patches in subjects with renal impairment. After \noral administration, Cmax and AUC of rivastigmine were more than twice as high in Alzheimer patients \nwith moderate renal impairment compared with healthy subjects; however there were no changes in Cmax \nand AUC of rivastigmine in Alzheimer patients with severe renal impairment. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nOral and topical repeated-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and minipigs revealed only \neffects associated with an exaggerated pharmacological action. No target organ toxicity was observed. \nOral and topical dosing in animal studies was limited due to the sensitivity of the animal models used. \n \nRivastigmine was not mutagenic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests, except in a \nchromosomal aberration test in human peripheral lymphocytes at a dose exceeding 104 times the foreseen \nclinical exposure. The in vivo micronucleus test was negative. \n \nNo evidence of carcinogenicity was found in oral and topical studies in mice and in an oral study in \nrats at the maximum tolerated dose. The exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was \napproximately equivalent to human exposure with highest doses of rivastigmine capsules and \ntransdermal patches. \n \nIn animals, rivastigmine crosses the placenta and is excreted into milk. Oral studies in pregnant rats and \nrabbits gave no indication of teratogenic potential on the part of rivastigmine. Specific dermal studies in \npregnant animals have not been conducted. \n \nRivastigmine transdermal patches were not phototoxic. In some other dermal toxicity studies, a mild \nirritant effect on the skin of laboratory animals, including controls, was observed. This may indicate a \npotential for rivastigmine transdermal patches to induce mild erythema in patients. When administered to \nrabbit eyes in primary eye irritation studies, rivastigmine caused reddening and swelling of the \nconjunctiva, corneal opacities and miosis which persisted for 7 days. Therefore, the patient/caregiver \nshould avoid contact with the eyes after handling of the patch (see section 4.4). \n \n \n6.

What Rivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd. is and what it is used for \n \nThe active substance of Rivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd. is rivastigmine. \n \nRivastigmine belongs to a class of substances called cholinesterase inhibitors. In patients with \nAlzheimer’s dementia, certain nerve cells die in the brain, resulting in low levels of the \nneurotransmitter acetylcholine (a substance that allows nerve cells to communicate with each other). \nRivastigmine works by blocking the enzymes that break down acetylcholine: acetylcholinesterase and \nbutyrylcholinesterase. By blocking these enzymes, Rivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd. allows levels of \nacetylcholine to be increased in the brain, helping to reduce the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. \n \nRivastigmine 3M Health Care Ltd. is used for the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderately \nsevere Alzheimer’s dementia, a progressive brain disorder that gradually affects memory, intellectual \nability and behaviour. \n \n \n2.
