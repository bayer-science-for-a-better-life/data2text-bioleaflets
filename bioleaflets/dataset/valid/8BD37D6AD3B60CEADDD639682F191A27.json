CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAtazanavir Krka capsules, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, are indicated for the treatment of \nHIV-1 infected adults and paediatric patients 6 years of age and older in combination with other \nantiretroviral medicinal products (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nBased on available virological and clinical data from adult patients, no benefit is expected in patients \nwith strains resistant to multiple protease inhibitors (\u2265 4 PI mutations). \n \nThe choice of Atazanavir Krka in treatment experienced adult and paediatric patients should be based \non individual viral resistance testing and the patient\u2019s treatment history (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \nAdults \nThe recommended dose of Atazanavir Krka capsules is 300 mg once daily taken with ritonavir 100 \nmg once daily and with food. Ritonavir is used as a booster of atazanavir pharmacokinetics (see \nsections 4.5 and 5.1). (See also section 4.4 Withdrawal of ritonavir only under restrictive conditions). \n \nPaediatric patients (6 years to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 15 kg) \nThe dose of atazanavir capsules for paediatric patients is based on body weight as shown in Table 1 \nand should not exceed the recommended adult dose. Atazanavir Krka capsules must be taken with \nritonavir and have to be taken with food. \n \nTable 1: Dose for paediatric patients (6 years to less than 18 years of age and weighing \n\nat least 15 kg) for Atazanavir Krka capsules with ritonavir \nBody Weight (kg) Atazanavir Krka once daily dose ritonavir once daily dosea \n15 to less than 35 200 mg 100 mg \nat least 35 300 mg 100 mg \na \nRitonavir capsules, tablets or oral solution. \n\n \nPaediatric patients (at least 3 months of age and weighing at least 5 kg):  \nOther formulations of this medicine may be available for paediatric patients at least 3 months of age \nand weighing at least 5 kg (see relevant Summary of Product Characteristics for alternative forms).  \nSwitching to capsules from other formulations is encouraged as soon as patients are able to \nconsistently swallow capsules. \n \nWhen transitioning between formulations, a change in dose may be needed. Consult the dosing table \nfor the specific formulation (see Summary of Product Characteristics for other formulations). \n \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is needed. Atazanavir Krka with ritonavir is not recommended in \npatients undergoing haemodialysis (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nAtazanavir with ritonavir has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Atazanavir Krka \nwith ritonavir should be used with caution in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Atazanavir Krka \nwith ritonavir must not be used in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see sections \n4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nIn case of withdrawal of ritonavir from the initial recommended ritonavir boosted regimen (see section \n4.4), unboosted Atazanavir Krka could be maintained in patients with mild hepatic impairment at a \ndose of 400 mg, and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment with a reduced dose of 300 mg once \ndaily with food (see section 5.2). Unboosted Atazanavir Krka must not be used in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment. \n \nPregnancy and Postpartum \nDuring the second and third trimesters of pregnancy: \n\n\n\n4 \n\nAtazanavir Krka 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg may not provide sufficient exposure to atazanavir, \nespecially when the activity of atazanavir or the whole regimen may be compromised due to drug \nresistance. Since there are limited data available and due to inter-patient variability during pregnancy, \nTherapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) may be considered to ensure adequate exposure. \n \nThe risk of a further decrease in atazanavir exposure is expected when atazanavir is given with \nmedicinal products known to reduce its exposure (e.g., tenofovir disoproxil or H2-receptor \nantagonists). \n- If tenofovir disoproxil or an H2-receptor antagonist is needed, a dose increase to Atazanavir Krka \n\n400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg with TDM may be considered (see sections 4.6 and 5.2). \n- It is not recommended to use Atazanavir Krka with ritonavir for pregnant patients who are \n\nreceiving both tenofovir disoproxil and an H2-receptor antagonist. \n \n(See section 4.4 Withdrawal of ritonavir only under restrictive conditions). \n \nDuring postpartum: \nFollowing a possible decrease in atazanavir exposure during the second and third trimester, atazanavir \nexposures might increase during the first two months after delivery (see section 5.2). Therefore, \npostpartum patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. \n- During this time, postpartum patients should follow the same dose recommendation as for \n\nnon- pregnant patients, including those for co-administration of medicinal products known to \naffect atazanavir exposure (see section 4.5). \n\n \nPaediatric patients (less than 3 months of age) \nAtazanavir Krka should not be used in children less than 3 months because of safety concerns \nespecially taking into account the potential risk of kernicterus. \n \nMethod of administration \nFor oral use. The capsules should be swallowed whole. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nAtazanavir Krka is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (see \nsections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). Atazanavir Krka with ritonavir is contraindicated in patients \nwith moderate hepatic insufficiency (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nCo-administration with simvastatin or lovastatin (see section 4.5).  \n \nCombination of rifampicin (see section 4.5). \n \nCombination of the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial \nhypertension (PAH) only (see section 4.5). For co-administration of sildenafil for the treatment of \nerectile dysfunction see sections 4.4 and 4.5. \n \nCo-administration with medicinal products that are substrates of the CYP3A4 isoform of cytochrome \nP450 and have narrow therapeutic windows (e.g., quetiapine, lurasidone, alfuzosin, astemizole, \nterfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil, triazolam, midazolam administered orally (for \ncaution on parenterally administered midazolam, see section 4.5), and ergot alkaloids, particularly, \nergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine) (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration with grazoprevir-containing products, including elbasvir/grazoprevir fixed dose \ncombination (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed dose combination (see section 4.5) \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nCo-administration with products containing St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission \nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nCo-administration of atazanavir with ritonavir at doses greater than 100 mg once daily has not been \nclinically evaluated. The use of higher ritonavir doses may alter the safety profile of atazanavir \n(cardiac effects, hyperbilirubinaemia) and therefore is not recommended. Only when atazanavir with \nritonavir is co-administered with efavirenz, a dose increase of ritonavir to 200 mg once daily could be \nconsidered. In this instance, close clinical monitoring is warranted (see Interaction with other \nMedicinal Products below). \n \nPatients with coexisting conditions \n \nHepatic impairment: Atazanavir is primarily hepatically metabolised and increased plasma \nconcentrations were observed in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). The \nsafety and efficacy of atazanavir has not been established in patients with significant underlying \nliver disorders. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral \ntherapy are at an increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case \nof concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant Summary \nof Product Characteristics for these medicinal products (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be \nmonitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n \nRenal impairment: No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment. However, \nAtazanavir Krka is not recommended in patients undergoing haemodialysis (see sections 4.2 and \n5.2). \n \nQT prolongation: Dose related asymptomatic prolongations in PR interval with atazanavir have been \nobserved in clinical studies. Caution should be used with medicinal products known to induce PR \nprolongations. In patients with pre-existing conduction problems (second degree or higher \natrioventricular or complex bundle-branch block), Atazanavir Krka should be used with caution and \nonly if the benefits exceed the risk (see section 5.1). Particular caution should be used when \nprescribing Atazanavir Krka in association with medicinal products which have the potential to \nincrease the QT interval and/or in patients with pre-existing risk factors (bradycardia, long congenital \nQT, electrolyte imbalances (see sections 4.8 and 5.3). \n \nHaemophiliac patients: There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin \nhaematomas and haemarthroses, in type A and B haemophiliac patients treated with protease \ninhibitors. In some patients additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, \ntreatment with protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. \nA causal relationship has been suggested, although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated. \nHaemophiliac patients should therefore be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to the disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nIn clinical studies, atazanavir (with or without ritonavir) has been shown to induce dyslipidaemia to a \nlesser extent than comparators. \n \nHyperbilirubinaemia \nReversible elevations in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin related to inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyl \ntransferase (UGT) have occurred in patients receiving atazanavir (see section 4.8). Hepatic \ntransaminase elevations that occur with elevated bilirubin in patients receiving atazanavir should be \nevaluated for alternative aetiologies. Alternative antiretroviral therapy to Atazanavir Krka may be \nconsidered if jaundice or scleral icterus is unacceptable to a patient. Dose reduction of atazanavir is not \nrecommended because it may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. \n \nIndinavir is also associated with indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinaemia due to inhibition of UGT. \nCombinations of atazanavir and indinavir have not been studied and co-administration of these \nmedicinal products is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nWithdrawal of ritonavir only under restrictive conditions \nThe recommended standard treatment is Atazanavir Krka boosted with ritonavir, ensuring \noptimal pharmacokinetic parameters and level of virologic suppression. \nThe withdrawal of ritonavir from the boosted regimen of Atazanavir Krka is not recommended, but \nmay be considered in adults patients at the dose of 400 mg once daily with food only under the \nfollowing combined restrictive conditions: \n- absence of prior virologic failure \n- undetectable viral load during the last 6 months under current regimen \n- viral strains not harbouring HIV resistance associated mutations (RAMs) to current regimen. \n \nAtazanavir Krka given without ritonavir should not be considered in patients treated with a backbone \nregimen containing tenofovir disoproxil and with other concomitant medications that reduce \natazanavir bioavailability (see section 4.5 In case of withdrawal of ritonavir from the recommended \natazanavir boosted regimen) or in case of perceived challenging compliance. \n \nAtazanavir Krka given without ritonavir should not be used in pregnant patients given that it could \nresult of suboptimal exposure of particular concern for the mother infection and vertical transmission. \n \nCholelithiasis \nCholelithiasis has been reported in patients receiving atazanavir (see section 4.8). Some patients \nrequired hospitalization for additional management and some had complications. If signs or symptoms \nof cholelithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of treatment may be considered. \n \nChronic kidney disease  \nChronic kidney disease in HIV-infected patients treated with atazanavir, with or without ritonavir, has \nbeen reported during postmarketing surveillance. A large prospective observational study has shown \nan association between an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease and cumulative exposure to \natazanavir/ritonavir-containing regimen in HIV-infected patients with an initially normal eGFR. This \nassociation was observed independently of exposure to tenofovir disoproxil. Regular monitoring of the \nrenal function of patients should be maintained throughout the treatment duration (see section 4.8). \n \nNephrolithiasis \nNephrolithiasis has been reported in patients receiving atazanavir (see section 4.8). Some patients \nrequired hospitalization for additional management and some had complications. In some cases, \nnephrolithiasis has been associated with acute renal failure or renal insufficiency. If signs or symptoms \nof nephrolithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of treatment may be considered. \n \nImmune reactivation syndrome \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. \n\n\n\n7 \n\nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, \nand Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and \ntreatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune \nhepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the \nreported time to onset is more variable and these events can occurs many months after initiation of \ntreatment. \n \nOsteonecrosis \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nRash and associated syndromes \nRashes are usually mild -to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 3 weeks \nof starting therapy with atazanavir. \n \nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme, toxic skin eruptions and drug rash with \neosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported in patients receiving \natazanavir. Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for skin \nreactions. Atazanavir Krka should be discontinued if severe rash develops. \n \nThe best results in managing these events come from early diagnosis and immediate interruption of \nany suspect medicines. If the patient has developed SJS or DRESS associated with the use of \nAtazanavir Krka, Atazanavir Krka may not be restarted. \n \nInteractions with other medicinal products \nThe combination of Atazanavir Krka with atorvastatin is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration of Atazanavir Krka with nevirapine or efavirenz is not recommended (see section \n4.5). If the co-administration of Atazanavir Krka with an NNRTI is required, an increase in the dose \nof both Atazanavir Krka and ritonavir to 400 mg and 200 mg, respectively, in combination with \nefavirenz could be considered with close clinical monitoring. \n \nAtazanavir is metabolised principally by CYP3A4. Co-administration of Atazanavir Krka and \nmedicinal products that induce CYP3A4 is not recommended (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nPDE5 inhibitors used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction: particular caution should be used when \nprescribing PDE5-inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil) for the treatment of erectile \ndysfunction in patients receiving Atazanavir Krka. Co-administration of Atazanavir Krka with these \nmedicinal products is expected to substantially increase their concentrations and may result in PDE5-\nassociated adverse reactions such as hypotension, visual changes and priapism (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration of voriconazole and Atazanavir Krka with ritonavir is not recommended, \nunless an assessment of the benefit/risk justifies the use of voriconazole. \n \nIn the majority of patients, a reduction in both voriconazole and atazanavir exposures are expected. In \na small number of patients without a functional CYP2C19 allele, significantly increased voriconazole \nexposures are expected (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of Atazanavir Krka /ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are \nmetabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the \nrisk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of salmeterol and Atazanavir Krka may result in increased cardiovascular adverse \n\n\n\n8 \n\nevents associated with salmeterol. Co-administration of salmeterol and Atazanavir Krka is not \nrecommended (see section 4.5). \n \nThe absorption of atazanavir may be reduced in situations where gastric pH is increased irrespective of \ncause. \n \nCo-administration of Atazanavir Krka with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended (see \nsection 4.5). If the combination of Atazanavir Krka with a proton pump inhibitor is judged \nunavoidable, close clinical monitoring is recommended in combination with an increase in the \ndose of Atazanavir Krka to 400 mg with 100 mg of ritonavir; doses of proton pump inhibitors \ncomparable to omeprazole 20 mg should not be exceeded. \n \nCo-administration of Atazanavir Krka with other hormonal contraceptives or oral \ncontraceptives containing progestogens other than norgestimate or norethindrone has not been \nstudied, and therefore should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n \nPaediatric population \nSafety \nAsymptomatic PR interval prolongation was more frequent in paediatric patients than adults. \nAsymptomatic first- and second-degree AV block was reported in paediatric patients (see \nsection 4.8). \nCaution should be used with medicinal products known to induce PR prolongations. In paediatric \npatients with pre-existing conduction problems (second degree or higher atrioventricular or complex \nbundle-branch block), Atazanavir Krka should be used with caution and only if the benefits exceed the \nrisk. Cardiac monitoring is recommended based on the presence of clinical findings (e.g., bradycardia). \n \nEfficacy \nAtazanavir/ritonavir is not effective in viral strains harbouring multiple mutations of resistance. \n \nExcipients \nLactose \nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-\ngalactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nWhen Atazanavir Krka and ritonavir are co-administered, the metabolic drug interaction profile for \nritonavir may predominate because ritonavir is a more potent CYP3A4 inhibitor than atazanavir. The \nSummary of Product Characteristics for ritonavir must be consulted before initiation of therapy with \nAtazanavir Krka and ritonavir. \n \nAtazanavir is metabolised in the liver through CYP3A4. It inhibits CYP3A4. Therefore, Atazanavir \nKrka is contraindicated with medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A4 and have a narrow \ntherapeutic index: quetiapine, lurasidone, alfuzosin, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, \nquinidine, bepridil, triazolam, orally administered midazolam, and ergot alkaloids, particularly \nergotamine and dihydroergotamine (see section 4.3). \n \nCo-administration of atazanavir with grazoprevir-containing products, including elbasvir/grazoprevir \nfixed dose combination is contraindicated because of the increase in grazoprevir and elbasvir plasma \nconcentrations and potential for the increase in risk of ALT elevations associated with increased \ngrazoprevir concentrations (see section 4.3). Co-administration of atazanavir with \nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed dose combination is contraindicated because of the potential increase in \nthe risk of ALT elevations due to a significant increase in glecaprevir and pibrentasvir plasma \nconcentrations (see section 4.3). \n \nOther interactions \nInteractions between atazanavir and other medicinal products are listed in the table below (increase is \n\n\n\n9 \n\nindicated as \u201c\u2191\u201d, decrease as \u201c\u2193\u201d, no change as \u201c\u2194\u201d). If available, 90% confidence intervals (CI) are \nshown in parentheses. The studies presented in Table 2 were conducted in healthy subjects unless \notherwise noted.

As a general rule, it is recommended that HIV infected \nwomen not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid transmission of HIV. \n \nFertility \nIn a nonclinical fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, atazanavir altered oestrus \ncycling with no effects on mating or fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPatients should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with regimens \ncontaining atazanavir (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nAtazanavir has been evaluated for safety in combination therapy with other antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts in controlled clinical trials in 1,806 adult patients receiving atazanavir 400 mg once daily \n(1,151 patients, 52 weeks median duration and 152 weeks maximum duration) or atazanavir 300 mg \nwith ritonavir 100 mg once daily (655 patients, 96 weeks median duration and 108 weeks maximum \nduration). \n \nAdverse reactions were consistent between patients who received atazanavir 400 mg once daily and \npatients who received atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily, except that jaundice and \nelevated total bilirubin levels were reported more frequently with atazanavir plus ritonavir. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nAmong patients who received atazanavir 400 mg once daily or atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 \nmg once daily, the only adverse reactions of any severity reported very commonly with at least a \npossible relationship to regimens containing atazanavir and one or more NRTIs were nausea (20%), \ndiarrhoea (10%), and jaundice (13%). Among patients receiving atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 \nmg, the frequency of jaundice was 19%. In the majority of cases, jaundice was reported within a few \ndays to a few months after the initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nChronic kidney disease in HIV-infected patients treated with atazanavir, with or without ritonavir, has \nbeen reported during postmarketing surveillance. A large prospective observational study has shown \nan association between an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease and cumulative exposure to \natazanavir/ritonavir-containing regimen in HIV-infected patients with an initially normal eGFR. This \nassociation was observed independently of exposure to tenofovir disoproxil. Regular monitoring of the \nrenal function of patients should be maintained throughout the treatment duration (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAssessment of adverse reactions for atazanavir is based on safety data from clinical studies and post- \nmarketing experience. Frequency is defined using the following convention: very common (\u2265 1/10), \ncommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \nImmune system disorders: uncommon: hypersensitivity \nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nuncommon: weight decreased, weight gain, anorexia, appetite increased \n\nPsychiatric disorders: uncommon: depression, disorientation, anxiety, insomnia, sleep disorder, \nabnormal dream \n\nNervous system disorders: common: headache; \nuncommon: peripheral neuropathy, syncope, amnesia, dizziness, \nsomnolence, dysgeusia \n\nEye disorders: common: ocular icterus \nCardiac disorders: uncommon: torsades de pointesa \n\nrare: QTc prolongationa, oedema, palpitation \nVascular disorders: uncommon: hypertension \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmeadiastinal disorders \n\nuncommon: dyspnoea \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: common: vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, dyspepsia; \nuncommon: pancreatitis, gastritis, abdominal distension, stomatitis \naphthous, flatulence, dry mouth \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: common: jaundice; \nuncommon: hepatitis, cholelithiasisa, cholestasisa; \nrare: hepatosplenomegaly, cholecystitisa \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders: \n\ncommon: rash; \nuncommon: erythemia multiformea,b, toxic skin eruptionsa,b, drug rash \nwith eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndromea,b, \nangioedemaa, urticaria, alopecia, pruritus; \nrare: Stevens-Johnson syndromea,b, vesiculobullous rash, eczema, \nvasodilatation \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nuncommon: muscle atrophy, arthralgia, myalgia; \nrare: myopathy \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: uncommon: nephrolithiasisa, haematuria, proteinuria, pollakiuria, \ninterstitial nephritis; chronic kidney diseasea \nrare: kidney pain \n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders: \n\nuncommon: gynaecomastia \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\ncommon: fatigue; \nuncommon: chest pain, malaise, pyrexia, asthenia; \nrare: gait disturbance \n\naThese adverse reactions were identified through post-marketing surveillance, however, the frequencies were estimated from \na statistical calculation based on the total number of patients exposed to atazanavir in randomised controlled and other \navailable clinical trials (n = 2321). \n\n\n\n25 \n\nbSee description of selected adverse reactions for more details. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) \nhave also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can \noccur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section \n4.4). \n \nRash and associated syndromes \nRashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 3 weeks \nof starting therapy with atazanavir. \n \nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme, toxic skin eruptions and drug rash with \neosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported with the use of \natazanavir (see section 4.4). \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \nThe most frequently reported laboratory abnormality in patients receiving regimens containing \natazanavir and one or more NRTIs was elevated total bilirubin reported predominantly as elevated \nindirect [unconjugated] bilirubin (87% Grade 1, 2, 3, or 4). Grade 3 or 4 elevation of total bilirubin \nwas noted in 37% (6% Grade 4). Among experienced patients treated with atazanavir 300 mg once \ndaily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily for a median duration of 95 weeks, 53% had Grade 3-4 total \nbilirubin elevations. Among naive patients treated with atazanavir 300 mg once daily with 100 mg \nritonavir once daily for a median duration of 96 weeks, 48% had Grade 3-4 total bilirubin elevations \n(see section 4.4). \n \nOther marked clinical laboratory abnormalities (Grade 3 or 4) reported in \u2265 2% of patients receiving \nregimens containing atazanavir and one or more NRTIs included: elevated creatine kinase (7%), \nelevated alanine aminotransferase/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (ALT/SGPT) (5%), low \nneutrophils (5%), elevated aspartate aminotransferase/serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase \n(AST/SGOT) (3%), and elevated lipase (3%). \n \nTwo percent of patients treated with atazanavir experienced concurrent Grade 3-4 ALT/AST and Grade \n3-4 total bilirubin elevations. \n \nPaediatric population \nIn a clinical study AI424-020, paediatric patients 3 months to less than 18 years of age who received \neither the oral powder or capsule formulation had a mean duration of treatment with atazanavir of \n115 weeks. The safety profile in this study was overall comparable to that seen in adults. Both \nasymptomatic first-degree (23%) and second-degree (1%) atrioventricular block were reported in \npaediatric patients. The most frequently reported laboratory abnormality in paediatric patients \nreceiving atazanavir was elevation of total bilirubin (\u2265 2.6 times ULN, Grade 3-4) which occurred in \n45% of patients. \n \nIn clinical studies AI424-397 and AI424-451, paediatric patients 3 months to less than 11 years of age \nhad a mean duration of treatment with atazanavir oral powder of 80 weeks. No deaths were reported. \nThe safety profile in these studies was overall comparable to that seen in previous paediatric and adult \nstudies. The most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities in paediatric patients receiving \n\n\n\n26 \n\natazanavir oral powder was elevation of total bilirubin (\u2265 2.6 times ULN, Grade 3-4; 16%) and \nincreased amylase (Grade 3-4; 33%), generally of non-pancreatic origin. Elevation in ALT levels were \nmore frequently reported in paediatric patients in these studies than in adults. \n \nOther special populations \nPatients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus \nAmong 1,151 patients receiving atazanavir 400 mg once daily, 177 patients were co-infected with \nchronic hepatitis B or C, and among 655 patients receiving atazanavir 300 mg once daily with \nritonavir 100 mg once daily, 97 patients were co-infected with chronic hepatitis B or C. Co-\ninfected patients were more likely to have baseline hepatic transaminase elevations than those \nwithout chronic viral hepatitis. No differences in frequency of bilirubin elevations were observed \nbetween these patients and those without viral hepatitis. The frequency of treatment emergent \nhepatitis or transaminase elevations in co-infected patients was comparable between atazanavir \nand comparator regimens (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nHuman experience of acute overdose with atazanavir is limited. Single doses up to 1,200 mg have \nbeen taken by healthy volunteers without symptomatic untoward effects. At high doses that lead to \nhigh drug exposures, jaundice due to indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinaemia (without associated \nliver function test changes) or PR interval prolongations may be observed (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nTreatment of overdose with Atazanavir Krka should consist of general supportive measures, including \nmonitoring of vital signs and electrocardiogram (ECG), and observations of the patient's clinical \nstatus. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed atazanavir should be achieved by emesis or gastric \nlavage. Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid removal of unabsorbed drug. \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with Atazanavir Krka. Since atazanavir is extensively \nmetabolised by the liver and is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant \nremoval of this medicinal product. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitors, ATC code: J05AE08. \n \nMechanism of action \nAtazanavir is an azapeptide HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI). The compound selectively inhibits the \nvirus-specific processing of viral Gag-Pol proteins in HIV-1 infected cells, thus preventing formation \nof mature virions and infection of other cells. \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro: atazanavir exhibits anti-HIV-1 (including all clades tested) and anti-HIV-2 \nactivity in cell culture. \n \nResistance \nAntiretroviral treatment naive adult patients \nIn clinical trials of antiretroviral treatment naive patients treated with unboosted atazanavir, the I50L \nsubstitution, sometimes in combination with an A71V change, is the signature resistance substitution \nfor atazanavir. Resistance levels to atazanavir ranged from 3.5- to 29-fold without evidence of \nphenotypic cross resistance to other PIs. In clinical trials of antiretroviral treatment naive patients \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATC_code_J05\n\n\n27 \n\ntreated with boosted atazanavir, the I50L substitution did not emerge in any patient without baseline \nPI substitutions. The N88S substitution has been rarely observed in patients with virologic failure on \natazanavir (with or without ritonavir). While it may contribute to decreased susceptibility to \natazanavir when it occurs with other protease substitutions, in clinical studies N88S by itself does \nnot always lead to phenotypic resistance to atazanavir or have a consistent impact on clinical \nefficacy. \n \nTable 3. De novo substitutions in treatment naive patients failing therapy with atazanavir + \nritonavir (Study 138, 96 weeks) \nFrequency de novo PI substitution (n=26)a \n>20% none \n10-20% none \na \nNumber of patients with paired genotypes classified as virological failures (HIV RNA \u2265 400 copies/ml). \n\n \nThe M184I/V substitution emerged in 5/26 atazanavir /ritonavir and 7/26 lopinavir/ritonavir virologic \nfailure patients, respectively. \n \nAntiretroviral treatment experienced adult patients \nIn antiretroviral treatment experienced patients from Studies 009, 043, and 045, 100 isolates from \npatients designated as virological failures on therapy that included either atazanavir, atazanavir + \nritonavir, or atazanavir + saquinavir were determined to have developed resistance to atazanavir. Of \nthe 60 isolates from patients treated with either atazanavir or atazanavir + ritonavir, 18 (30%) \ndisplayed the I50L phenotype previously described in naive patients. \n \nTable 4.

FC susceptibility in cell \nculture relative to the wild-type reference was assayed using PhenoSenseTM (Monogram Biosciences, South San Francisco, \nCalifornia, USA) \n \nNone of the de novo substitutions (see Table 4) are specific to atazanavir and may reflect re- \nemergence of archived resistance on atazanavir + ritonavir in Study 045 treatment-experienced \npopulation. \n \nThe resistance in antiretroviral treatment experienced patients mainly occurs by accumulation of the \nmajor and minor resistance substitutions described previously to be involved in protease inhibitor \nresistance. \n \nClinical results \nIn antiretroviral naive adult patients \nStudy 138 is an international randomised, open-label, multicenter, prospective trial of treatment na\u00efve \npatients comparing atazanavir /ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg once daily) to lopinavir/ritonavir (400 \nmg/100 mg twice daily), each in combination with fixed dose tenofovir disoproxil \nfumarate/emtricitabine (300 mg/200 mg tablets once daily).

For treatment-naive paediatric patients, the \nmean baseline CD4 cell count was 344 cells/mm3 (range: 2 to 800 cells/ mm3) and mean baseline \nplasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.67 log10 copies/ml (range: 3.70 to 5.00 log10 copies/ml). For treatment- \nexperienced paediatric patients, the mean baseline CD4 cell count was 522 cells/mm3 (range: 100 to \n1157 cells/ mm3) and mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.09 log10 copies/ml (range: 3.28 to 5.00 \nlog10 copies/ml). \n \nTable 7: Efficacy Outcomes (paediatric patients 6 years to less than 18 years of age) at \n\nWeek 48 (Study AI424-020) \nParameter Treatment-Naive atazanavir \n\nCapsules/ritonavir (300 mg/100 \nmg once daily) \n\nn=16 \n\nTreatment- Experienced \natazanavir \n\nCapsules/ritonavir (300 mg/100 \nmg once daily) \n\nn=25 \nHIV RNA <50 copies/ml, % a \nAll patients 81 (13/16) 24 (6/25) \nHIV RNA <400 copies/ml, % a \nAll patients 88 (14/16) 32 (8/25) \nCD4 Mean Change from Baseline, cells/mm3 \nAll patients 293 (n=14b) 229 (n=14b) \nHIV RNA <50 copies/ml by select baseline PI substitutions,c % (responder/evaluabled) \n0-2 NA 27 (4/15) \n3 NA - \n\u22654 NA 0 (0/3) \na Intent-to-treat analysis, with missing values considered as failures. \nb Number of patients evaluable. \nc PI major L24I, D30N, V32I, L33F, M46IL, I47AV, G48V, I50LV, F53LY, I54ALMSTV, L76V, V82AFLST, I84V, \nN88DS, L90M; PI minor: L10CFIRV, V11I, E35G, K43T, Q58E, A71ILTV, G73ACST, T74P, N83D, L89V. \nd Includes patients with baseline resistance data.  \nNA = not applicable. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of atazanavir were evaluated in healthy adult volunteers and in HIV-infected \npatients; significant differences were observed between the two groups. The pharmacokinetics of \natazanavir exhibit a non-linear disposition. \n \nAbsorption: in HIV-infected patients (n=33, combined studies), multiple dosing of atazanavir 300 mg \nonce daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food produced a geometric mean (CV%) for \natazanavir, cmax of 4466 (42%) ng/ml, with time to cmax of approximately 2.5 hours. The geometric \nmean (CV%) for atazanavir cmin and AUC was 654 (76%) ng/ml and 44185 (51%) ng\u2022h/ml, \nrespectively. \n \nIn HIV-infected patients (n=13), multiple dosing of atazanavir 400 mg (without ritonavir) once daily \nwith food produced a geometric mean (CV%) for atazanavir cmax of 2298 (71) ng/ml, with time to cmax \nof approximately 2.0 hours. The geometric mean (CV%) for atazanavir cmin and AUC were 120 (109) \nng/ml and 14874 (91) ng\u2022h/ml, respectively. \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \nFood effect: co-administration of atazanavir and ritonavir with food optimises the bioavailability of \natazanavir. Co-administration of a single 300 mg dose of atazanavir and 100 mg dose of ritonavir with \na light meal resulted in a 33% increase in the AUC and a 40% increase in both the cmax and the 24 hour \nconcentration of atazanavir relative to the fasting state. Co-administration with a high-fat meal did not \naffect the AUC of atazanavir relative to fasting conditions and the cmax was within 11% of fasting \nvalues. The 24 hour concentration following a high fat meal was increased by approximately 33% due \nto delayed absorption; the median Tmax increased from 2.0 to 5.0 hours. Administration of atazanavir \nwith ritonavir with either a light or a high-fat meal decreased the coefficient of variation of AUC and \ncmax by approximately 25% compared to the fasting state. To enhance bioavailability and minimise \nvariability, atazanavir is to be taken with food. \n \nDistribution: atazanavir was approximately 86% bound to human serum proteins over a concentration \nrange of 100 to 10,000 ng/ml. Atazanavir binds to both alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and albumin \nto a similar extent (89% and 86%, respectively, at 1,000 ng/ml). In a multiple-dose study in HIV- \ninfected patients dosed with 400 mg of atazanavir once daily with a light meal for 12 weeks, atazanavir \nwas detected in the cerebrospinal fluid and semen. \n \nMetabolism: studies in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes have demonstrated \nthat atazanavir is principally metabolised by CYP3A4 isozyme to oxygenated metabolites. Metabolites \nare then excreted in the bile as either free or glucuronidated metabolites. Additional minor metabolic \npathways consist of N-dealkylation and hydrolysis. Two minor metabolites of atazanavir in plasma \nhave been characterised. Neither metabolite demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity. \n \nElimination: following a single 400 mg dose of 14C-atazanavir, 79% and 13% of the total radioactivity \nwas recovered in the faeces and urine, respectively. Unchanged drug accounted for approximately 20% \nand 7% of the administered dose in the faeces and urine, respectively. Mean urinary excretion of \nunchanged drug was 7% following 2 weeks of dosing at 800 mg once daily. In HIV-infected adult \npatients (n=33, combined studies) the mean half-life within a dosing interval for atazanavir was 12 \nhours at steady state following a dose of 300 mg daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with a light \nmeal. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment: in healthy subjects, the renal elimination of unchanged atazanavir was approximately \n7% of the administered dose. There are no pharmacokinetic data available for atazanavir with ritonavir \nin patients with renal insufficiency. atazanavir (without ritonavir) has been studied in adult patients \nwith severe renal impairment (n=20), including those on haemodialysis, at multiple doses of 400 mg \nonce daily. Although this study presented some limitations (i.e., unbound drug concentrations not \nstudied), results suggested that the atazanavir pharmacokinetic parameters were decreased by 30% to \n50% in patients undergoing haemodialysis compared to patients with normal renal function. The \nmechanism of this decrease is unknown (see sections 4.2 and 4.4.). \n \nHepatic impairment: atazanavir is metabolised and eliminated primarily by the liver. Atazanavir \n(without ritonavir) has been studied in adult subjects with moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment (14 \nChild-Pugh Class B and 2 Child-Pugh Class C subjects) after a single 400 mg dose. The mean \nAUC(0-\u221e) was 42% greater in subjects with impaired hepatic function than in healthy subjects. The \nmean half-life of atazanavir in hepatically impaired subjects was 12.1 hours compared to 6.4 hours in \nhealthy subjects. The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir after a 300 \nmg dose with ritonavir have not been studied. Concentrations of atazanavir with or without ritonavir \nare expected to be increased in patients with moderately or severely impaired hepatic function (see \nsections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4). \n \nAge/Gender: a study of the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir was performed in 59 healthy male and \nfemale subjects (29 young, 30 elderly). There were no clinically important pharmacokinetic \ndifferences based on age or gender. \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nRace: a population pharmacokinetic analysis of samples from Phase II clinical trials indicated no \neffect of race on the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir. \n \nPregnancy: \nThe pharmacokinetic data from HIV-infected pregnant women receiving atazanavir capsules with \nritonavir are presented in Table 8. \n \nTable 8: Steady-State Pharmacokinetics of Atazanavir with ritonavir in HIV-Infected \nPregnant Women in the Fed State \n atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg \nPharmacokinetic Parameter 2nd Trimester \n\n(n=9) \n3rd Trimester \n\n(n=20) \npostpartuma \n\n(n=36) \nCmax ng/mL \n\nGeometric mean (CV%) \n3729.09 \n\n(39) \n3291.46 \n\n(48) \n5649.10 \n\n(31) \nAUC ng\u2022h/mL \n\nGeometric mean (CV%) \n34399.1 \n\n(37) \n34251.5 \n\n(43) \n60532.7 \n\n(33) \nCmin ng/mLb \n\nGeometric mean (CV%) \n663.78 \n\n(36) \n668.48 \n\n(50) \n1420.64 \n\n(47) \na Atazanavir peak concentrations and AUCs were found to be approximately 26-40% higher during the postpartum period (4-\n12 weeks) than those observed historically in HIV infected, non-pregnant patients. Atazanavir plasma trough concentrations \nwere approximately 2-fold higher during the postpartum period when compared to those observed historically in HIV infected \nnon-pregnant patients. \nb Cmin is concentration 24 hours post-dose \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is a trend toward a higher clearance in younger children when normalised for body weight. As a \nresult, greater peak to trough ratios are observed; however at recommended doses, geometric mean \natazanavir exposures (cmin, cmax and AUC) in paediatric patients are expected to be similar to those \nobserved in adults. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn repeat-dose toxicity studies, conducted in mice, rats, and dogs, atazanavir-related findings were \ngenerally confined to the liver and included generally minimal to mild increases in serum bilirubin and \nliver enzymes, hepatocellular vacuolation and hypertrophy, and, in female mice only, hepatic single- \ncell necrosis. Systemic exposures of atazanavir in mice (males), rats, and dogs at doses associated with \nhepatic changes were at least equal to that observed in humans given 400 mg once daily. In female \nmice, atazanavir exposure at a dose that produced single-cell necrosis was 12 times the exposure in \nhumans given 400 mg once daily. Serum cholesterol and glucose were minimally to mildly increased \nin rats but not in mice or dogs. \n \nDuring in vitro studies, cloned human cardiac potassium channel (hERG), was inhibited by 15% at a \nconcentration (30 \u03bcM) of atazanavir corresponding to 30 fold the free drug concentration at cmax in \nhumans. Similar concentrations of atazanavir increased by 13% the action potential duration (APD90) \nin rabbit Purkinje fibres study. Electrocardiographic changes (sinus bradycardia, prolongation of PR \ninterval, prolongation of QT interval, and prolongation of QRS complex) were observed only in an \ninitial 2 week oral toxicity study performed in dogs. Subsequent 9 month oral toxicity studies in dogs \nshowed no drug-related electrocardiographic changes. The clinical relevance of these non-clinical data \nis unknown. Potential cardiac effects of this product in humans cannot be ruled out (see sections 4.4 \nand 4.8). The potential for PR prolongation should be considered in cases of overdose (see section \n4.9). \n \nIn a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, atazanavir altered oestrus cycling with no \neffects on mating or fertility. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats or rabbits at maternally toxic \ndoses. In pregnant rabbits, gross lesions of the stomach and intestines were observed in dead or \nmoribund does at maternal doses 2 and 4 times the highest dose administered in the definitive embryo- \ndevelopment study. In the pre- and postnatal development assessment in rats, atazanavir produced a \ntransient reduction in body weight in the offspring at a maternally toxic dose. Systemic exposure to \n\n\n\n33 \n\natazanavir at doses that resulted in maternal toxicity was at least equal to or slightly greater than that \nobserved in humans given 400 mg once daily. \n \nAtazanavir was negative in an Ames reverse-mutation assay but did induce chromosomal aberrations \nin vitro in both the absence and presence of metabolic activation. In in vivo studies in rats, atazanavir \ndid not induce micronuclei in bone marrow, DNA damage in duodenum (comet assay), or unscheduled \nDNA repair in liver at plasma and tissue concentrations exceeding those that were clastogenic in vitro. \n \nIn long-term carcinogenicity studies of atazanavir in mice and rats, an increased incidence of benign \nhepatic adenomas was seen in female mice only. The increased incidence of benign hepatic adenomas \nin female mice was likely secondary to cytotoxic liver changes manifested by single-cell necrosis and \nis considered to have no relevance for humans at intended therapeutic exposures. There were no \ntumorigenic findings in male mice or in rats. \n \nAtazanavir increased opacity of bovine corneas in an in vitro ocular irritation study, indicating it may \nbe an ocular irritant upon direct contact with the eye. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Atazanavir Krka is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Atazanavir Krka \n3. How to take Atazanavir Krka \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Atazanavir Krka \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Atazanavir Krka is and what it is used for \n \nAtazanavir Krka is an antiviral (or antiretroviral) medicine. It is one of a group called protease \ninhibitors. These medicines control Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection by stopping a \nprotein that the HIV needs for its multiplication. They work by reducing the amount of HIV in your \nbody and this in turn, strengthens your immune system. In this way Atazanavir Krka reduces the risk \nof developing illnesses linked to HIV infection. \n \nAtazanavir Krka capsules may be used by adults and children 6 years of age and older. Your doctor \nhas prescribed Atazanavir Krka for you because you are infected by the HIV that causes Acquired \nImmunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). It is normally used in combination with other anti-HIV \nmedicines. Your doctor will discuss with you which combination of these medicines with Atazanavir \nKrka is best for you. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Atazanavir Krka \n \nDo not take Atazanavir Krka: \n- if you are allergic to atazanavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you have moderate to severe liver problems. Your doctor will evaluate how severe \n\nyourliver disease is before deciding whether you can take Atazanavir Krka \n- if you are taking any of these medicines: see also Other medicines and Atazanavir Krka \n\n- rifampicin (an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis) \n- astemizole or terfenadine (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms, these medicines \n\nmay be available without prescription); cisapride (used to treat gastric reflux, sometimes \ncalled heartburn); pimozide (used to treat schizophrenia); quinidine or bepridil (used to \ncorrect heart rhythm); ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine \n(used to treat headaches); and alfuzosin (used to treat enlarged prostatic gland) \n\n- quetiapine (used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder), \nlurasidone (used to treat schizophrenia) \n\n\n\n54 \n\n- medicines containing St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum, a herbal preparation) \n- triazolam and oral (taken by mouth) midazolam (used to help you sleep and/or to relieve \n\nanxiety) \n- simvastatin and lovastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol). \n- grazoprevir-containing products, including elbasvir/grazoprevir fixed dose combination \n\nand glecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed dose combination (used to treat chronic hepatitis C \ninfection) \n\n \nDo not take sildenafil with Atazanavir Krka when sildenafil is used for the treatment of pulmonary \narterial hypertension. Sildenafil is also used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Tell your doctor \nif you are using sildenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. \n \nTell your doctor at once if any of these apply to you. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nAtazanavir Krka is not a cure for HIV infection. You may continue to develop infections or other \nillnesses linked to HIV infection. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the \nrisk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to \navoid infecting other people. \n \nSome people will need special care before or while taking Atazanavir Krka. Talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking Atazanavir Krka and make sure your doctor knows: \n\n- if you have hepatitis B or C \n- if you develop signs or symptoms of gall stones (pain at the right side of your stomach) \n- if you have type A or B haemophilia \n- if you require haemodialysis \n\n \nAtazanavir Krka may affect how well your kidneys work. \n \nKidney stones have been reported in patients taking atazanavir. If you develop signs or symptoms of \nkidney stones (pain in your side, blood in your urine, pain when you urinate), please inform your \ndoctor immediately. \n \nIn some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs \nand symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is \nstarted. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body\u2019s immune response, \nenabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you \nnotice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately. In addition to the \nopportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system \nattacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your \nHIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you \nnotice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in \nhands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, \nplease inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n \nSome patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe \nimmunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for \ndeveloping this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the \nhip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor. \n \nHyperbilirubinaemia (an increase in the level of bilirubin in the blood) has occurred in patients \nreceiving atazanavir. The signs may be a mild yellowing of the skin or eyes. If you notice any of these \nsymptoms please inform your doctor. \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \nSerious skin rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, has been reported in patients taking \natazanavir. If you develop a rash inform your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you notice a change in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm changes), please inform your doctor. \nChildren receiving Atazanavir Krka may require their heart to be monitored. Your child's doctor will \ndecide this. \n \nChildren \nDo not give this medicine to children younger than 3 months of age and weighing less than 5 kg. The \nuse of Atazanavir Krka in children less than 3 months of age and weighing less than 5 kg has not been \nstudied due to the risk of serious complications. \n \nOther medicines and Atazanavir Krka \nYou must not take Atazanavir Krka with certain medicines. These are listed under Do not take \nAtazanavir Krka, at the start of Section 2. \n \nThere are other medicines that may not mix with Atazanavir Krka. Tell your doctor if you are taking, \nhave recently taken, or might take any other medicines. It is especially important to mention these: \n\n- other medicines to treat HIV infection (e.g. indinavir, nevirapine and efavirenz) \n- boceprevir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (used to treat hepatitis C) \n- sildenafil, vardenafil, or tadalafil (used by men to treat impotence (erectile dysfunction)) \n- if you are taking an oral contraceptive (\"the Pill\") with Atazanavir Krka to prevent pregnancy, \n\nbe sure to take it exactly as instructed by your doctor and not miss any doses \n- any medicines used to treat diseases related to the acid in the stomach (e.g. antacids to be \n\ntaken 1 hour before taking Atazanavir Krka or 2 hours after taking Atazanavir Krka, H2-\nblockers like famotidine and proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole) \n\n- medicines to lower blood pressure, to slow heart rate, or to correct heart rhythm (amiodarone, \ndiltiazem, systemic lidocaine, verapamil) \n\n- atorvastatin, pravastatin, and fluvastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol) \n- salmeterol (used to treat asthma) \n- cyclosporin, tacrolimus, and sirolimus (medicines to decrease the effects of body's immune \n\nsystem) \n- certain antibiotics (rifabutin, clarithromycin) \n- ketoconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole (antifungals) \n- warfarin (anticoagulant, used to reduce the blood clots) \n- carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, lamotrigine (antiepileptics) \n- irinotecan (used to treat cancer) \n- sedative agents (e.g. midazolam administered by injection) \n- buprenorphine (used to treat opioid addiction and pain). \n\n \nSome medicines may interact with ritonavir, a medicine that is taken with Atazanavir Krka. It is \nimportant to tell your doctor if you are taking fluticasone or budesonide (given by nose or inhaled to \ntreat allergic symptoms or asthma). \n \nAtazanavir Krka with food and drink \nIt is important that you take Atazanavir Krka with food (a meal or a substantial snack) as this helps the \nbody absorb the medicine. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Atazanavir, the active substance of \nAtazanavir Krka, is excreted in human milk. Patients should not breast-feed while taking Atazanavir \nKrka. It is recommended that women infected with HIV do not breast-feed because the virus might be \ntransmitted through the breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \n\n\n\n56 \n\nIf you feel dizzy or lightheaded, do not drive or use machines and contact your doctor immediately. \n \nAtazanavir Krka contains lactose monohydrate \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars (e.g. lactose), contact \nyour doctor before taking this medicinal product. \n \n \n3. How to take Atazanavir Krka \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. This way, you can be sure your medicine is fully effective and you reduce the risk of the virus \ndeveloping resistance to the treatment. \n \nThe recommended adult dose of Atazanavir Krka capsules is 300 mg once daily with 100 mg \nritonavir once daily and with food, in combination with other anti-HIV medicines. Your doctor may \nadjust the dose of Atazanavir Krka according to your anti-HIV therapy. \n \nFor children (6 to less than 18 years of age), your child's doctor will decide the right dose based \non your child's weight. The dose of Atazanavir Krka capsules for children is calculated by body \nweight and is taken once daily with food and 100 mg ritonavir as shown below: \n\nBody weight (kg) Atazanavir Krka Dose once daily \n(mg) \n\nRitonavir Dose* once daily (mg) \n\n15 to less than 35 200 100 \nAt least 35 300 100 \n\n*Ritonavir capsules, tablets or oral solution may be used. \n \nOther formulations of this medicine may be available for paediatric patients at least 3 months of age \nand weighing at least 5 kg (see relevant Summary of Product Characteristics for alternative forms).  \nSwitching to capsules from other formulations is encouraged as soon as patients are able to \nconsistently swallow capsules. \n \nTake Atazanavir Krka capsules with food (a meal or a substantial snack). Swallow the capsules \nwhole. \nDo not open the capsules. \n \nIf you take more Atazanavir Krka than you should \nYellowing of the skin and/or eyes (jaundice) and irregular heart beat (QTc prolongation) may occur if \nyou or your child take too much Atazanavir Krka. \nIf you accidentally take more Atazanavir Krka capsules than your doctor recommended, contact your \nHIV doctor at once or contact the nearest hospital for advice. \n \nIf you forget to take Atazanavir Krka \nIf you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as possible with food and then take your next \nscheduled dose at its regular time. If it is almost time for your next dose, do not take the missed dose. \nWait and take the next dose at its regular time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten \ndose. \n \nIf you stop taking Atazanavir Krka \nDo not stop taking Atazanavir Krka before talking to your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. When \ntreating HIV infection, it is not always easy to identify what side effects are caused by Atazanavir \n\n\n\n57 \n\nKrka, by the other medicines you are taking, or by the HIV infection itself. Tell your doctor if you \nnotice anything unusual about your health. \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you develop any of the following serious side effects: \n \n\n- Skin rash, itching that may occasionally be severe has been reported. The rash usually \ndisappears within 2 weeks without any change to your atazanavir treatment. Severe rash may \nbe developed in association with other symptoms which could be serious.

This side effect is usually not dangerous in adults \nand infants older than 3 months of age; but it might be a symptom of a serious problem. If \nyour skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow, talk to your doctor immediately. \n\n- Changes in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm change) may occasionally happen. Talk to \nyour doctor immediately if you get dizzy, lightheaded or if you suddenly faint. These could be \nsymptoms of a serious heart problem. \n\n- Liver problems may uncommonly happen. Your doctor should do blood tests prior you start \nAtazanavir Krka and during treatment. If you have liver problems, including hepatitis B or C \ninfection, you may experience a worsening of your liver problems. Talk to your doctor \nimmediately if you get dark (tea-colored) urine, itching, yellowing of your skin or the white \npart of your eyes, pain around the stomach, pale colored stools or nausea. \n\n- Gallbladder problems uncommonly happen in people taking atazanavir. Symptoms of \ngallbladder problems may include pain in the right or middle upper stomach area, nausea, \nvomiting, fever or yellowing your skin or the white part of your eyes. \n\n- Atazanavir Krka may affect how well your kidneys work. \n- Kidney stones uncommonly happen in people taking atazanavir.

hiv in your body and this in turn, strengthens your immune system. in this way atazanavir krka reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to hiv infection. atazanavir krka capsules may be used by adults and children 6 years of age and older. your doctor has prescribed atazanavir krka for you because you are infected by the hiv that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). it is

may have been present with no obvious symptoms. if you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately. in addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your hiv infection. autoimmune disorders may occur many
