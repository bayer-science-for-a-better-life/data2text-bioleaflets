NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nAZARGA 10 mg/ml + 5 mg/ml eye drops, suspension \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nOne ml of suspension contains 10 mg brinzolamide and 5 mg timolol (as timolol maleate). \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect: \n\n \n\nOne ml of suspension contains 0.10 mg benzalkonium chloride. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nEye drops, suspension (eye drops) \n\n \n\nWhite to off-white uniform suspension, pH 7.2 (approximately). \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nDecrease of intraocular pressure (IOP) in adult patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular \n\nhypertension for whom monotherapy provides insufficient IOP reduction (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nUse in adults, including the elderly \n\nThe dose is one drop of AZARGA in the conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s) twice daily. \n\n \n\nWhen using nasolacrimal occlusion or closing the eyelids, the systemic absorption is reduced. This \n\nmay result in a decrease in systemic side effects and an increase in local activity (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIf a dose is missed, treatment should be continued with the next dose as planned. The dose should not \n\nexceed one drop in the affected eye (s) twice daily. \n\n \n\nWhen substituting another ophthalmic antiglaucoma medicinal product with AZARGA, the other \n\nmedicinal product should be discontinued and AZARGA should be started the following day. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of AZARGA in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years have not yet been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nHepatic and renal impairment \n\nNo studies have been conducted with AZARGA or with timolol 5 mg/ml eye drops in patients with \n\nhepatic or renal impairment. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with hepatic impairment or \n\nin patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. \n\n\n\n3 \n\nAZARGA has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \n\nclearance <30 ml/min) or in patients with hyperchloraemic acidosis (see section 4.3). Since \n\nbrinzolamide and its main metabolite are excreted predominantly by the kidney, AZARGA is therefore \n\ncontraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nAZARGA should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor ocular use. \n\n \n\nPatients should be instructed to shake the bottle well before use. After cap is removed, if tamper \n\nevident snap collar is loose, remove before using product. \n\n \n\nTo prevent contamination of the dropper tip and the suspension, care must be taken not to touch the \n\neyelids, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper tip of the bottle. Instruct patients to keep \n\nthe bottle tightly closed when not in use. \n\n \n\nIf more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used, the medicinal products must be \n\nadministered at least 5 minutes apart. Eye ointments should be administered last. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n Hypersensitivity to other beta-blockers. \n\n Hypersensitivity to sulphonamides (see section 4.4). \n\n Reactive airway disease including bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, or severe \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease. \n\n Sinus bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, sino-atrial block, second or third degree \natrioventricular block not controlled with pace-maker. Overt cardiac failure, cardiogenic shock. \n\n Severe allergic rhinitis \n\n Hyperchloraemic acidosis (see section 4.2). \n\n Severe renal impairment. \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nSystemic effects \n\n \n\n Brinzolamide and timolol are absorbed systemically. Due to the beta-adrenergic blocking \ncomponent, timolol, the same types of cardiovascular, pulmonary and other adverse reactions \n\nseen with systemic beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur. The incidence of systemic \n\nadverse reactions after topical ophthalmic administration is lower than for systemic \n\nadministration. To reduce the systemic absorption, see section 4.2. \n\n Hypersensitivity reactions common to all sulphonamide derivates can occur in patients \nreceiving AZARGA as it is absorbed systemically. \n\n \n\nCardiac disorders \n\n \n\nIn patients with cardiovascular diseases (e.g. coronary heart disease, Prinzmetal's angina and cardiac \n\nfailure) and hypotension, therapy with beta-blockers should be critically assessed and the therapy with \n\nother active substances should be considered. Patients with cardiovascular diseases should be watched \n\nfor signs of deterioration of these diseases and of adverse reactions. \n\n \n\nDue to its negative effect on conduction time, beta-blockers should only be given with caution to \n\npatients with first degree heart block. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nVascular disorders \n\n \n\nPatients with severe peripheral circulatory disturbance/disorders (i.e. severe forms of Raynaud’s \n\ndisease or Raynaud’s syndrome) should be treated with caution. \n\n \n\nHyperthyroidism \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers may also mask the signs of hyperthyroidism. \n\n \n\nMuscle weakness \n\n \n\nBeta-adrenergic blocking medicinal products have been reported to potentiate muscle weakness \n\nconsistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g. diplopia, ptosis and generalised weakness). \n\n \n\nRespiratory disorders \n\n \n\nRespiratory reactions, including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma have been \n\nreported following administration of some ophthalmic beta-blockers. AZARGA should be used with \n\ncaution, in patients with mild/moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and only if the \n\npotential benefit outweighs the potential risk. \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia/diabetes \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycaemia \n\nor to patients with labile diabetes, as beta-blockers may mask the signs and symptoms of acute \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nAcid/base disturbances \n\n \n\nAZARGA contains brinzolamide, a sulphonamide. The same types of adverse reactions that are \n\nattributable to sulphonamides may occur with topical administration. Acid-base disturbances have \n\nbeen reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. This medicinal product should be used with \n\ncaution in patients with risk of renal impairment because of the possible risk of metabolic acidosis. If \n\nsigns of serious reactions or hypersensitivity occur, discontinue the use of this medicinal product. \n\n \n\nMental alertness \n\n \n\nOral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may impair the ability to perform tasks requiring mental alertness \n\nand/or physical coordination. AZARGA is absorbed systemically and therefore this may occur with \n\ntopical administration. \n\n \n\nAnaphylactic reactions \n\n \n\nWhile taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reaction \n\nto a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge with such allergens and \n\nunresponsive to the usual doses of adrenaline used to treat anaphylactic reactions. \n\n \n\nChoroidal detachment \n\n \n\nChoroidal detachment has been reported with administration of aqueous suppressant therapy (e.g. \n\ntimolol, acetazolamide) after filtration procedures. \n\n \n\nSurgical anaesthesia \n\n \n\nBeta-blocking ophthalmological preparations may block systemic beta-agonist effects e.g. of \n\nadrenaline. The anaesthesiologist should be informed when the patient is receiving timolol. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nConcomitant therapy \n\n \n\nThe effect on intra-ocular pressure or the known effects of systemic beta-blockade may be potentiated \n\nwhen timolol is given to the patients already receiving a systemic beta-blocking agent. The response of \n\nthese patients should be closely observed. The use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents or \n\ntwo local carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nThere is potential for an additive effect on the known systemic effects of carbonic anhydrase inhibition \n\nin patients receiving an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and AZARGA. The concomitant \n\nadministration of AZARGA and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors has not been studied and is not \n\nrecommended (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nOcular effects \n\n \n\nThere is limited experience with AZARGA in the treatment of patients with pseudoexfoliative \n\nglaucoma or pigmentary glaucoma. Caution should be utilised in treating these patients and close \n\nmonitoring of IOP is recommended. \n\n \n\nAZARGA has not been studied in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and its use is not \n\nrecommended in these patients. \n\n \n\nOphthalmic beta-blockers may induce dryness of eyes. Patients with corneal diseases should be treated \n\nwith caution. \n\n \n\nThe possible role of brinzolamide on corneal endothelial function has not been investigated in patients \n\nwith compromised corneas (particularly in patients with low endothelial cell count). Specifically, \n\npatients wearing contact lenses have not been studied and careful monitoring of these patients when \n\nusing brinzolamide is recommended, since carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may affect corneal hydration. \n\nThis may lead to a corneal decompensation and oedema and wearing contact lenses might increase the \n\nrisk for the cornea. Careful monitoring of patients with compromised corneas, such as patients with \n\ndiabetes mellitus or corneal dystrophies, is recommended. \n\n \n\nAZARGA may be used while wearing contact lenses with careful monitoring (see below under \n\n‘Benzalkonium chloride’). \n\n \n\nBenzalkonium chloride \n\n \n\nAZARGA contains benzalkonium chloride which may cause eye irritation and is known to discolour \n\nsoft contact lenses. Contact with soft contact lenses should be avoided. Patients must be instructed to \n\nremove contact lenses prior to the application of AZARGA and wait 15 minutes after instillation of the \n\ndose before reinsertion. \n\n \n\nBenzalkonium chloride has also been reported to cause punctate keratopathy and/or toxic ulcerative \n\nkeratopathy. Close monitoring is required with frequent or prolonged use. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nAZARGA should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo specific drug interaction studies have been performed with AZARGA. \n\n \n\nAZARGA contains brinzolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and, although administered topically, \n\nis absorbed systemically. Acid-base disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase \n\ninhibitors. The potential for interactions must be considered in patients receiving AZARGA. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nThere is a potential for an additive effect on the known systemic effects of carbonic anhydrase \n\ninhibition in patients receiving an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and brinzolamide eye drops. The \n\nconcomitant administration of eye drops containing brinzolamide and oral carbonic anhydrase \n\ninhibitors is not recommended. \n\n \n\nThe cytochrome P-450 isozymes responsible for metabolism of brinzolamide include CYP3A4 (main), \n\nCYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9. It is expected that inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as \n\nketoconazole, itraconazole, clotrimazole, ritonavir and troleandomycin will inhibit the metabolism of \n\nbrinzolamide by CYP3A4. Caution is advised if CYP3A4 inhibitors are given concomitantly. \n\nHowever, accumulation of brinzolamide is unlikely as renal elimination is the major route. \n\nBrinzolamide is not an inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 isozymes. \n\n \n\nThere is a potential for additive effects resulting in hypotension and/or marked bradycardia when an \n\nophthalmic beta-blocker solution is administered concomitantly with oral calcium channel blockers, \n\nbeta-adrenergic blocking agents, antiarrhythmics (including amiodarone), digitalis glycosides, \n\nparasympathomimetics, guanethidine. \n\nBeta blockers can decrease the response to adrenaline used to treat anaphylactic reactions. Special \n\ncaution should be exercised in patients with a history of atopy or anaphylaxis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe hypertensive reaction to sudden withdrawal of clonidine can be potentiated when taking beta-\n\nblockers. Caution is recommended in the concomitant use of this medicinal product with clonidine. \n\n \n\nPotentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g. decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during \n\ncombined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine) and timolol. \n\nCaution is recommended. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers may increase the hypoglycaemic effect of antidiabetic agents. Beta-blockers can mask \n\nthe signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMydriasis resulting from concomitant use of ophthalmic beta-blockers and adrenaline (epinephrine) \n\nhas been reported occasionally. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no adequate data regarding the use of ophthalmic brinzolamide and timolol in pregnant \n\nwomen. Studies in animals with brinzolamide have shown reproductive toxicity following systemic \n\nadministration, see section 5.3. AZARGA should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly \n\nnecessary. To reduce the systemic absorption, see section 4.2. \n\n \n\nEpidemiological studies have not revealed malformative effects but show a risk for intra uterine \n\ngrowth retardation when beta-blockers are administered by the oral route. In addition, signs and \n\nsymptoms of beta-blockade (e.g. bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory distress and hypoglycaemia) \n\nhave been observed in the neonate when beta-blockers have been administered until delivery. If \n\nAZARGA is administered until delivery, the neonate should be carefully monitored during the first \n\ndays of life. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether ophthalmic brinzolamide is excreted in human breast milk. Studies in animals \n\nhave shown that following oral administration brinzolamide is excreted in breast milk, see section 5.3. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers are excreted in breast milk. However, at therapeutic doses of timolol in eye drops it is \n\nnot likely that sufficient amounts would be present in breast milk to produce clinical symptoms of \n\nbeta-blockade in the infant. To reduce the systemic absorption, see section 4.2. \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nHowever, a risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to \n\ndiscontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from AZARGA therapy taking into account the \n\nbenefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nStudies have not been performed to evaluate the effect of topical ocular administration of Azarga on \n\nhuman fertility. \n\n \n\nNon clinical data do not show any effects of either brinzolamide or timolol on male or female fertility \n\nfollowing oral dosing. No effects on male or female fertility are anticipated from the use of AZARGA. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nAZARGA has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\nTemporary blurred vision or other visual disturbances may affect the ability to drive or use machines. \n\nIf blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient must wait until the vision clears before driving or \n\nusing machines. \n\n \n\nCarbonic anhydrase inhibitors may impair the ability to perform tasks requiring mental alertness \n\nand/or physical coordination (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were blurred vision, eye irritation and eye pain, \n\noccurring in approximately 2% to 7% of patients. \n\n \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported during clinical studies and post-marketing \n\nsurveillance with AZARGA and the individual components brinzolamide and timolol. They are \n\nclassified according to the following convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), \n\nuncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1000), very rare (<1/10,000), or not known \n\n(cannot be estimated from the available data).

monotherapy \n3 additional adverse reactions observed with brinzolamide monotherapy \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nDysgeusia (bitter or unusual taste in the mouth following instillation) was a frequently reported \n\nsystemic adverse reaction associated with the use of AZARGA during clinical trials. It is likely to be \n\ncaused by passage of the eye drops in the nasopharynx via the nasolacrimal canal and is attributable to \n\nbrinzolamide. Nasolacrimal occlusion or gently closing the eyelid after instillation may help reduce \n\nthe occurrence of this effect (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nAZARGA contains brinzolamide which is a sulphonamide inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase with \n\nsystemic absorption. Gastrointestinal, nervous system, haematological, renal and metabolic effects are \n\ngenerally associated with systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. The same type of adverse reactions \n\nattributable to oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may occur with topical administration. \n\n \n\nTimolol is absorbed into the systemic circulation. This may cause similar adverse reactions as seen \n\nwith systemic beta-blocking medicinal products. Listed adverse reactions include reactions seen within \n\nthe class of ophthalmic beta-blockers. Additional adverse reactions associated with the use of the \n\nindividual components that may potentially occur with AZARGA are included in the table above. The \n\nincidence of systemic adverse reactions after topical ophthalmic administration is lower than for \n\nsystemic administration. To reduce the systemic absorption, see section 4.2. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nAZARGA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years due to a lack of \n\ndata on safety and efficacy. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nIn case of accidental ingestion, symptoms of overdose from beta blockade may include bradycardia, \n\nhypotension, cardiac failure and bronchospasm. \n\n \n\nIf overdose with AZARGA eye drops occurs, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Due to \n\nbrinzolamide, electrolyte imbalance, development of an acidotic state, and possibly central nervous \n\nsystem effects may occur. Serum electrolyte levels (particularly potassium) and blood pH levels \n\nshould be monitored. Studies have shown that timolol does not dialyse readily. \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, Antiglaucoma preparation and miotics \n\nATC code: S01ED51 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nAZARGA contains two active substances: brinzolamide and timolol maleate. These two components \n\ndecrease elevated IOP primarily by reducing aqueous humour secretion, but do so by different \n\nmechanisms of action. The combined effect of these two active substances results in additional IOP \n\nreduction compared to either compound alone. \n\n \n\nBrinzolamide is a potent inhibitor of human carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II), the predominant iso-\n\nenzyme in the eye. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases \n\naqueous humour secretion, presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent \n\nreduction in sodium and fluid transport. \n\n \n\nTimolol is a non-selective adrenergic-blocking agent that has no intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct \n\nmyocardial depressant or membrane-stabilising activity. Tonography and fluorophotometry studies in \n\nman suggest that its predominant action is related to reduced aqueous humour formation and a slight \n\nincrease in outflow facility. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nClinical effects: \n\nIn a twelve-month, controlled clinical trial in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular \n\nhypertension who, in the investigator’s opinion could benefit from a combination therapy, and who \n\nhad baseline mean IOP of 25 to 27 mmHg, the mean IOP-lowering effect of AZARGA dosed twice \n\ndaily was 7 to 9 mmHg. The non-inferiority of AZARGA as compared to dorzolamide \n\n20 mg/ml + timolol 5 mg/ml in the mean IOP reduction was demonstrated across all time-points at all \n\nvisits. \n\n \n\nIn a six-month, controlled clinical study in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension \n\nand baseline mean IOP of 25 to 27 mmHg, the mean IOP-lowering effect of AZARGA dosed twice \n\ndaily was 7 to 9 mmHg, and was up to 3 mmHg greater than that of brinzolamide 10 mg/ml dosed \n\ntwice daily and up to 2 mmHg greater than that of timolol 5 mg/ml dosed twice daily. A statistically \n\nsuperior reduction in mean IOP was observed compared to both brinzolamide and timolol at all time-\n\npoints and visits throughout the study. \n\n \n\nIn three controlled clinical trials, the ocular discomfort upon instillation of AZARGA was significantly \n\nlower than that of dorzolamide 20 mg/ml + timolol 5 mg/ml. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n11 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nFollowing topical ocular administration, brinzolamide and timolol are absorbed through the cornea \n\nand into the systemic circulation. In a pharmacokinetic study, healthy subjects received oral \n\nbrinzolamide (1 mg) twice daily for 2 weeks to shorten the time to reach steady-state prior to starting \n\nAZARGA administration. Following twice daily dosing of AZARGA for 13 weeks, red blood cell \n\n(RBC) concentrations of brinzolamide averaged 18.8  3.29 µM, 18.1  2.68 µM and 18.4  3.01 µM \n\nat weeks 4, 10 and 15, respectively, indicating that steady-state RBC concentrations of brinzolamide \n\nwere maintained \n\n \n\nAt steady state, following administration of AZARGA, the mean plasma Cmax and AUC0-12h of timolol \n\nwere 27% and 28% lower (Cmax: 0.824 ± 0.453 ng/ml; AUC0-12h: 4.71 ± 4.29 ng·h/ml), respectively, in \n\ncomparison to the administration of timolol 5 mg/ml (Cmax: 1.13 ± 0.494 ng/ml; \n\nAUC0-12h: 6.58 ± 3.18 ng·h/ml). The lower systemic exposure to timolol following AZARGA \n\nadministration is not clinically relevant. Following administration of AZARGA, mean Cmax of timolol \n\nwas reached at 0.79 ± 0.45 hours. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nPlasma protein binding of brinzolamide is moderate (about 60%). Brinzolamide is sequestered in \n\nRBCs due to its high affinity binding to CA-II and to a lesser extent to CA-I. Its active N-desethyl \n\nmetabolite also accumulates in RBCs where it binds primarily to CA-I. The affinity of brinzolamide \n\nand metabolite to RBC and tissue CA results in low plasma concentrations. \n\n \n\nOcular tissue distribution data in rabbits showed that timolol can be measured in aqueous humour up \n\nto 48 hours after administration of AZARGA. At steady-state, timolol is detected in human plasma for \n\nup to 12 hours after administration of AZARGA. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nThe metabolic pathways for the metabolism of brinzolamide involve N-dealkylation, O-dealkylation \n\nand oxidation of its N-propyl side chain. N-desethyl brinzolamide is a major metabolite of \n\nbrinzolamide formed in humans, which also binds to CA-I in the presence of brinzolamide and \n\naccumulates in RBCs. In vitro studies show that the metabolism of brinzolamide mainly involves \n\nCYP3A4 as well as at least four other isozymes (CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9). \n\n \n\nTimolol is metabolised by two pathways. One route yields an ethanolamine side chain on the \n\nthiadiazole ring and the other giving an ethanolic side chain on the morpholine nitrogen and a second \n\nsimilar side chain with a carbonyl group adjacent to the nitrogen. Timolol metabolism is mediated \n\nprimarily by CYP2D6. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nBrinzolamide is eliminated primarily by renal excretion (approximately 60%). About 20% of the dose \n\nhas been accounted for in urine as metabolite. Brinzolamide and N-desethyl-brinzolamide are the \n\npredominant components found in the urine along with trace levels (<1%) of the N-desmethoxypropyl \n\nand O-desmethyl metabolites. \n\n \n\nTimolol and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys. Approximately 20% of a timolol \n\ndose is excreted in the urine unchanged and the remainder excreted in urine as metabolites. The \n\nplasma t1/2 of timolol is 4.8 hours after administration of AZARGA. \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nBrinzolamide \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans with brinzolamide based on conventional \n\nstudies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. \n\n \n\nDevelopmental toxicity studies in rabbits with oral doses of brinzolamide of up to 6 mg/kg/day \n\n(214 times the recommended daily clinical dose of 28 µg/kg/day) revealed no effect on foetal \n\ndevelopment despite significant maternal toxicity. Similar studies in rats resulted in slightly reduced \n\nossification of skull and sternebrae of foetuses of dams receiving brinzolamide at doses \n\nof 18 mg/kg/day (642 times the recommended daily clinical dose), but not 6 mg/kg/day. These \n\nfindings occurred at doses that caused metabolic acidosis with decreased body weight gain in dams \n\nand decreased foetal weights. Dose-related decreases in foetal weights were observed in pups of dams \n\nreceiving brinzolamide orally ranging from a slight decrease (about 5-6%) at 2 mg/kg/day to \n\nnearly 14% at 18 mg/kg/day. During lactation, the no adverse effect level in the offspring was \n\n5 mg/kg/day. \n\n \n\nTimolol \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans with timolol based on conventional studies of \n\nsafety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. Reproduction \n\ntoxicity studies with timolol showed delayed foetal ossification in rats with no adverse effects on \n\npostnatal development (at 50 mg/kg/day or 3,500 times the daily clinical dose of 14 g/kg/day) and \n\nincreased foetal resorptions in rabbits (at 90 mg/kg/day or 6,400 times the daily clinical dose). \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What AZARGA is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nAZARGA contains two active substances, brinzolamide and timolol, which work together to reduce \n\npressure within the eye. \n\n \n\nAZARGA is used to treat high pressure in the eyes, also called glaucoma or ocular hypertension, in \n\nadult patients that are more than 18 years of age and in whom high pressure in the eyes cannot be \n\ncontrolled effectively by one medicine alone. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use AZARGA \n\n \n\nDo not use AZARGA \n\n If you are allergic to brinzolamide, medicines called sulphonamides (examples include \nmedicines used to treat diabetes, infections and also diuretics (water tablets)), timolol, beta-\n\nblockers (medicines used to lower blood pressure or to treat heart disease) or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n If you have now or have had in the past respiratory problems such as asthma, severe long lasting \nobstructive bronchitis (severe lung condition which may cause wheezing, difficulty in breathing \n\nand/or long standing cough) or other types of breathing problems. \n\n If you have severe hay fever \n\n If you have a slow heart beat, heart failure or disorders of heart rhythm (irregular heartbeats). \n\n If you have too much acidity in your blood (a condition called hyperchloraemic acidosis). \n\n If you have severe kidney problems. \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n23 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nOnly use AZARGA for dropping in your eye(s). \n\n \n\nIf signs of serious reactions or hypersensitivity occur, discontinue the use of this product and talk to \n\nyour doctor. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using AZARGA if you have or have had in the past: \n\n coronary heart disease (symptoms can include chest pain or tightness, breathlessness or \nchoking), heart failure, low blood pressure \n\n disturbances of heart rate such as slow heart beat \n\n breathing problems, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \n\n poor blood circulation disease (such as Raynaud’s disease or Raynaud’s syndrome) \n\n diabetes as timolol may mask signs and symptoms of low blood sugar \n\n overactivity of the thyroid gland as timolol may mask signs and symptoms of thyroid disease \n\n muscular weakness (myasthenia gravis) \n\n tell your doctor before you have an operation that you are using AZARGA as timolol may \nchange effects of some medicines used during anaesthesia. \n\n if you have a history of atopy (a tendency to develop an allergic reaction) and severe allergic \nreactions you may be more sensitive to developing an allergic reaction whilst using AZARGA \n\nand adrenaline may not be as effective to treat an allergic reaction. When receiving any other \n\ntreatment please tell the doctor or nurse that you are taking AZARGA. \n\n if you have liver problems. \n\n if you have dry eyes or cornea problems. \n\n if you have problems with your kidneys. \n \n\nChildren and adolescents \nAZARGA is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and AZARGA \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n\n \n\nAZARGA can affect, or be affected by, other medicines you are taking, including other eye drops for \n\nthe treatment of glaucoma. Tell your doctor if you are taking or intent to take medicines to lower \n\nblood pressure like parasympathomimetics and guanetidine, or other heart medicines including \n\nquinidine (used to treat heart conditions and some types of malaria), amiodarone or other medicines to \n\ntreat heart rhythm disorders and glycosides to treat heart insufficiency. Also tell your doctor if you are \n\ntaking or intend to take medicines to treat diabetes, or to treat gastric ulcers, antifungal, antiviral or \n\nantibiotic medicines, or antidepressants such as fluoxetine and paroxetine. \n\n \n\nIf you are taking another carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazolamide or dorzolamide), talk to your \n\ndoctor. \n\nIncrease in pupil size when taking Azarga and adrenaline (epinephrine) together has been reported \n\noccasionally. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nYou should not use AZARGA if you are pregnant or might get pregnant, unless your doctor considers \n\nit necessary. Talk to your doctor before you use AZARGA. \n\n \n\nDo not use AZARGA if you are breast feeding, timolol may get into your milk. \n\nAsk your doctor for advice before taking any medicine during breastfeeding. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nDo not drive or use machines until your vision is clear. You may find that your vision is blurred for \n\nsome time just after using AZARGA. \n\n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nOne of the active ingredients may impair the ability to perform tasks requiring mental alertness and/or \n\nphysical coordination. If affected take care when driving or using machines. \n\n \n\nAZARGA contains benzalkonium chloride \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains 3.34 µg benzalkonium chloride per drop (= 1 dose) which is equivalent to \n\n0.01% or 0.1 mg/ml. \n\n \n\nAZARGA contains a preservative (benzalkonium chloride) which may be absorbed by soft contact \n\nlenses and may change the colour of the contact lenses. You should remove contact lenses before \n\nusing this medicine and put them back 15 minutes afterwards. Benzalkonium chloride may also cause \n\neye irritation, especially if you have dry eyes or disorders of the cornea (the clear layer at the front of \n\nthe eye). If you feel abnormal eye sensation, stinging or pain in the eye after using this medicine, talk \n\nto your doctor. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use AZARGA \n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\nIf you are changing from another eye drop medicine used to treat glaucoma to AZARGA, you should \n\nstop using the other medicine and start using AZARGA the following day. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure \n\n \n\nTo prevent contamination of the dropper tip and the suspension, care must be taken not to touch \n\nthe eyelids, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper tip. Keep the bottle tightly closed \n\nwhen not in use. \n\n \n\nThe following measure is useful to limit the amount of medicine that will come into the blood after \n\napplication of eye drops: \n\n- Keep the eyelid closed, while simultaneously applying gentle pressure to the corner of the eye \nnext to the nose with a finger for at least 2 minutes. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is \n\nOne drop in the affected eye or eyes, twice a day. \n\nOnly use AZARGA in both eyes if your doctor told you to. Take it for as long as your doctor told you \n\nto. \n\n \n\nHow to use \n\n    \n  1 2 3 \n\n \n\n Get the AZARGA bottle and a mirror. \n\n Wash your hands. \n\n Shake well before use. \n\n Twist off the bottle cap. After the cap is removed, if the tamper evident snap collar is loose, \nremove before using product. \n\n Hold the bottle, pointing down, between your thumb and fingers. \n\n Tilt your head back. Pull down your eyelid with a clean finger, until there is a ‘pocket’ between \nthe eyelid and your eye. The drop will go in here (picture 1). \n\n Bring the bottle tip close to the eye. Use the mirror if it helps. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n Do not touch your eye or eyelid, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper. It could \ninfect the drops. \n\n Gently press on the base of the bottle to release one drop of AZARGA at a time. \n\n Do not squeeze the bottle: it is designed so that a gentle press on the bottom is all that it needs \n(picture 2). \n\n After using AZARGA, press a finger into the corner of your eye, by the nose for 2 minutes \n(picture 3). This helps to stop AZARGA getting into the rest of the body. \n\n If you use drops in both eyes, repeat the steps for your other eye. \n\n Close the bottle cap firmly immediately after use. \n\n Use up one bottle before opening the next bottle. \n \n\nIf a drop misses your eye, try again. \n\n \n\nIf you are using other eye drop or eye ointment medicines leave at least 5 minutes between each \n\nmedicine. Eye ointments should be administered last. \n\n \n\nIf you use more AZARGA than you should, rinse your eye with warm water. Do not put in any \n\nmore drops until it is time for your next regular dose. \n\n \n\nYou may experience a decreased heart rate, decreased blood pressure, heart failure, difficulty \n\nbreathing and your nervous system may be affected \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use AZARGA, continue with the next dose as planned. Do not use a double dose to \n\nmake up for the forgotten dose. Do not use more than one drop in the affected eye(s) twice daily. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using AZARGA without speaking to your doctor, the pressure in your eye will not be \n\ncontrolled which could lead to loss of sight. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nStop using this medicine and contact your doctor immediately if you develop skin rash, severe skin \n\nreaction, or severe redness and itching of the eye. These could be the signs of an allergic reaction \n\n(frequency is not known). \n\n \n\nYou can usually carry on taking the drops, unless the effects are serious. If you are worried, talk to \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist. Do not stop using Azarga without speaking to your doctor first. \n\n \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Effects in the eye: eye surface inflammation, blurred vision, signs and symptoms of eye \nirritation (e.g. burning, stinging, itching, tearing, redness), eye pain. \n\n General side effects: heart rate decreased, taste disturbances. \n \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Effects in the eye:corneal erosion (damage to the front layer of the eyeball), Eye surface \ninflammation with surface damage, inflammation inside the eye, corneal staining, abnormal \n\nsensation in the eyes, eye discharge, dry eye, tired eyes, itchy eye, eye redness, eyelid redness. \n\n General side effects: decrease in white blood cell count, decreased blood pressure, cough, \nblood in urine, body weakness. \n\n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) \n\n Effects in the eye: corneal disorder, sensitivity to light, increased tear production, eyelid \ncrusting \n\n General side effects: difficulty sleeping (insomnia), throat pain, running nose \n\n \n\nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n Effects in the eye: eye allergy, disturbance of vision, damage to the optic nerve, increased \npressure in eye, deposits on the eye surface, decreased eye sensation, inflammation or infection \n\nof the conjunctiva (white of the eye), abnormal, double or reduced vision, increased \n\npigmentation of the eye, growth on surface of eye, eye swelling, sensitivity to light, decreased \n\ngrowth or number of eyelashes, drooping of the upper eyelids (making the eye stay half closed), \n\ninflammation of the eyelid and eye lid glands, inflammation in the cornea and detachment of the \n\nlayer below the retina that contains blood vessels following filtration surgery which may cause \n\nvisual disturbances, decreased corneal sensitivity. \n\n Heart and circulation: changes in rhythm or rate of the heartbeat, slow heart rate, palpitations, \na type of heart rhythm disorder, abnormal increase in heart rate, chest pain, reduced heart \n\nfunction, heart attack, increased blood pressure, reduced blood supply to the brain, stroke, \n\noedema (fluid build up), congestive heart failure (heart disease with shortness of breath and \n\nswelling of the feet and legs due to fluid build up), swelling of the extremities, low blood \n\npressure, discoloration of the fingers, toes, and occasionally other areas of the body (Raynaud’s \n\nphenomenon), cold hands and feet. \n\n Respiratory: Constriction of the airways in the lungs (predominantly in patients with pre-\nexisting disease) shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, cold symptoms, chest congestion, \n\nsinus infection, sneezing, stuffy nose, dry nose, nose bleeds, asthma, throat irritation. \n\n Nervous system and general disorders: hallucinations, depression, nightmares, memory loss, \nheadache, nervousness, irritability, tiredness, shaking, feeling abnormal, fainting, dizziness, \n\ndrowsiness, generalised or severe weakness, unusual sensations like pins and needles. \n\n Gastric: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, intestinal gas or abdominal discomfort, inflammation of \nthe throat, dry or abnormal sensation in mouth, indigestion, stomach ache. \n\n Blood: abnormal liver function values, increased blood chlorine levels, or decreased red blood \ncell count as seen in a blood test. \n\n Allergy: increased allergic symptoms, generalised allergic reactions including swelling beneath \nthe skin that can occur in areas such as the face and limbs and can obstruct the airway which \n\nmay cause difficulty swallowing or breathing, hives, localised and generalised rash, itchiness, \n\nsevere sudden life-threatening allergic reaction. \n\n Ear: ringing in the ears, sensation of spinning or dizziness. \n\n Skin: rash, skin redness or inflammation, abnormal or decreased skin sensation, hair loss, rash \nwith white silvery coloured appearance (psoriasiform rash) or worsening of psoriasis. \n\n Muscular: generalised back, joint, or muscle pain not caused by exercise, muscle spasms, pain \nin extremities, muscle weakness/tiredness, increases in the signs and symptoms of myasthenia \n\ngravis (muscle disorder). \n\n Kidney: kidney pain such as lower back pain, frequent urination. \n\n Reproduction: sexual dysfunction, decreased libido, male sexual difficulty. \n\n Metabolism: low blood sugar levels. \n \n\nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
