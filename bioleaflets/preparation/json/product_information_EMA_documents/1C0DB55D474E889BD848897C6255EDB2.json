CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRXULTI is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended starting dose for brexpiprazole is 1 mg once daily on days 1 to 4. \nThe recommended target dose range is 2 mg to 4 mg once daily. \nBased on the patient’s clinical response and tolerability the brexpiprazole dose can be titrated to 2 mg \nonce daily on day 5 through day 7 and then to 4 mg on day 8. \nThe maximum recommended daily dose is 4 mg. \n \nSwitching from other antipsychotics to brexpiprazole \nWhen switching from other antipsychotics to brexpiprazole gradual cross-titration should be \nconsidered, with gradual discontinuation of the previous treatment while brexpiprazole treatment is \ninitiated. \n \nSwitching to other antipsychotics from brexpiprazole \nWhen switching to other antipsychotics from brexpiprazole, no gradual cross-titration is needed, the \nnew antipsychotic should be initiated in its lowest dose while brexpiprazole is discontinued. It should \nbe considered that plasma concentration of brexpiprazole will decline gradually and will be \ncompletely washed out in 1 to 2 weeks. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThe safety and efficacy of brexpiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenia in patients aged 65 years \nand older have not been established (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). It is not possible to advise on a \nminimum effective/safe dose in this population. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nRenal impairment \nThe maximum recommended dose in patients with moderate to severe impaired renal function is \nreduced to 3 mg once daily (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe maximum recommended dose in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh score ≥ 7) is reduced to 3 mg once daily (see section 5.2). \n \nCYP2D6 poor metabolisers \nDosing modifications to half the recommended doses is required for patients with known CYP2D6 \npoor metaboliser status. Further dosing modifications to a quarter of the recommended dose is \nrequired for known CYP2D6 poor metabolisers while taking strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors \n(see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \nDose adjustments due to interactions \nDose adjustments should be made in patients taking concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers \nor strong CYP2D6 inhibitors. If the CYP3A4 inhibitor/inducers or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn, \nthe dose may need to be returned to the original dose (see section 4.5). In case of adverse reactions \ndespite dose adjustments of RXULTI, the necessity of concomitant use of RXULTI and CYP2D6 or \nCYP3A4 inhibitor should be reassessed. \n \nTable 1: Dose adjustments of RXULTI in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolisers and \n\nfor concomitant use with CYP inhibitors \n \nFactors Adjusted dose \nCYP2D6 poor metabolisers \nKnown CYP2D6 poor metabolisers Administer half of the recommended dose \nKnown CYP2D6 poor metabolisers taking \nstrong/moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nAdminister a quarter of the recommended dose \n\nPatients taking CYP2D6 inhibitors and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors \nStrong CYP2D6 inhibitors Administer half of the recommended dose \nStrong CYP3A4 inhibitors Administer half of the recommended dose \nStrong/moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors with \nstrong/moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nAdminister a quarter of the recommended dose \n\n \nPatients taking strong CYP3A4 inducers \nIf brexpiprazole is used concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin), in a patient \nstabilised on brexpiprazole it is necessary to titrate the daily dose of brexpiprazole stepwise up to \ndouble the recommended dose over the course of 1 to 2 weeks. Thereafter, if according to clinical \nresponse, further dose adjustments are required, the dose may be increased up to a maximum of three \ntimes the recommended daily dose. Daily dose must not exceed 12 mg when brexpiprazole is used \nconcomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inducers. Twice daily divided dosing of brexpiprazole is \npreferable as once daily dosing results in high peak to trough fluctuation (see section 4.5). \nCYP3A4 inducers exert their effect in a time-dependent manner, and may take at least 2 weeks to \nreach maximal effect after introduction. Conversely, on discontinuation, CYP3A4 induction may take \nat least 2 weeks to decline. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of brexpiprazole in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years have not \nbeen established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use \nThe film-coated tablets can be taken with or without food. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days \nto some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \n \nSuicidal ideation and behaviour \n \nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in \nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \ntreatment with brexpiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \n \nCardiovascular disorders \n \nBrexpiprazole has not been evaluated in patients with a history of myocardial infarction/ischaemic \nheart disease or clinically significant cardiovascular disease since such patients were excluded from \nclinical trials. \n \nBrexpiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension (including \naccelerated or malignant). \n \nQT prolongation \n \nQT prolongation can develop in patients treated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, only a few, non-\nserious, QT prolongations have been reported with brexpiprazole. Caution should be exercised when \nbrexpiprazole is prescribed in patients with known cardiovascular disease, family history of QT \nprolongation, electrolyte imbalance or in concomitant use with other medicinal products thought to \nprolong the QT interval (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nVenous thromboembolism \n \nCases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with antipsychotics. Since patients \ntreated with antipsychotics often present with acquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors \nfor VTE should be identified before and during treatment with brexpiprazole and preventive measures \nundertaken. \n \nOrthostatic hypotension and syncope \n \nAdverse reactions related to orthostatic hypotension can include dizziness, light-headedness and \ntachycardia. Generally, these risks are greatest at the beginning of treatment with antipsychotics and \nduring dose escalation. Patients at increased risk of these adverse reactions (e.g. elderly) or at \nincreased risk of developing complications from hypotension include those with dehydration, \nhypovolemia, treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products, history of cardiovascular disease \n(e.g., heart failure, myocardial infarction, ischemia, or conduction abnormalities), history of \ncerebrovascular disease, as well as patients who are antipsychotic-naive. In such patients, a lower \nstarting dose and slower titration should be considered, and orthostatic vital signs should be monitored \n(see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \n \nA potentially fatal symptom complex referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been \nreported in association with antipsychotic treatment, including brexpiprazole (see section 4.8). Clinical \nmanifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of \nautonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac \ndysrhythmia). Additional signs may include increased creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria \n(rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of \nNMS, or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS \nbrexpiprazole must be discontinued immediately. \n \nExtrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) \n \nExtrapyramidal symptoms (including acute dystonia) are known class effects for antipsychotics. \nBrexpiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a known history of EPS. \n \nTardive dyskinesia \n \nA syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients \ntreated with antipsychotics. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the \nelderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the \ninception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. If signs and \nsymptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on brexpiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation \nshould be considered. These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after \ndiscontinuation of treatment. \n \nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \n \nIn placebo-controlled trials with some antipsychotics in elderly patients with dementia, there was a \nhigher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (cerebrovascular accidents and transient \nischemic attacks), including fatalities, compared to placebo-treated subjects. \n \nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \n \nBrexpiprazole has not been studied in elderly patients with dementia and is not recommended to treat \nelderly patients with dementia due to increased risk of overall mortality. \n \nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \n \nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Risk factors that may \npredispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes. \nPatients treated with any antipsychotics, including brexpiprazole, should be observed for signs and \nsymptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness). Fasting plasma \nglucose should be assessed before or soon after the initiation of the antipsychotic treatment. During \nlong term treatment the plasma glucose levels should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose \ncontrol. \n \nWeight gain and dyslipidaemia \n \nAntipsychotics including brexpiprazole have been associated with metabolic changes, including \nweight gain and dyslipidaemia. An increased frequency of weight gain has been observed with \nincreased duration of brexpiprazole treatment (see section 4.8). At the beginning of treatment the lipid \nprofile should be assessed. Clinical monitoring of weight and lipid profile is recommended at baseline \nand during treatment. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nSeizures \n \nAs with other antipsychotics, brexpiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history \nof seizure disorder or other conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold. Seizures have been \nreported during use of brexpiprazole (see section 4.8). \n \nBody temperature regulation \n \nDisruption of the body’s ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotics. \nAppropriate care is advised when prescribing brexpiprazole for patients who will be experiencing \nconditions that may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, \nexposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medicinal products with anticholinergic activity, or \nbeing subject to dehydration. \n \nDysphagia \n \nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic use. Brexpiprazole \nshould be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \n \nImpulse-control disorders  \n \nImpulse-control disorders including gambling disorder have been reported in patients treated with \nbrexpiprazole. Patients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to \ncontrol these urges while taking brexpiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: compulsive sexual \nbehaviours, compulsive shopping, binge eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. \nPatients with a prior history of impulse-control disorders may be at increased risk and should be \nmonitored carefully. Because patients may not recognise these behaviours as abnormal, it is important \nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or \nincreased impulse-control disorders or other compulsive behaviours while being treated with \nbrexpiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be associated with the underlying \ndisorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or \nthe medication was discontinued. Compulsive behaviours may result in harm to the patient and others \nif not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges \nwhile taking brexpiprazole (see section 4.8). \n \nLeukopenia, neutropenia and agranulocytosis \n \nLeukopenia, neutropenia and agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) have been reported during \ntreatment with antipsychotics. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing \nlow white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with \na pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their \ncomplete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and \nbrexpiprazole should be discontinued at the first sign of decline in WBC, in the absence of other \ncausative factors. Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms \nor signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe \nneutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1,000/mm3) should discontinue brexpiprazole and have their \nWBC followed until recovery. \n \nProlactin \n \nBrexpiprazole can elevate prolactin levels. Elevations associated with brexpiprazole treatment are \ngenerally mild and may decline during administration, however, in some infrequent cases the effect \nmay persist during administration (see section 4.8). \n \nLactose \n \nRXULTI film-coated tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \n\n\n\n8 \n\nintolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal \nproduct. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nBrexpiprazole is predominantly metabolised by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. \n \nPotential for other medicinal products to affect brexpiprazole \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors \nCo-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily for 7 days), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, \nwith a 2 mg single oral dose of brexpiprazole increased the AUC of brexpiprazole by 97 % and no \nchange in Cmax. Based on results of interaction studies, dose adjustment of brexpiprazole to half the \ndose is recommended when administered concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (itraconazole, \nketoconazole, ritonavir, and clarithromycin). \n \nCYP3A4 inducers \nCo-administration of rifampicin (600 mg twice daily for 12 days), a potent CYP3A4 inducer, with a \nsingle 4 mg oral dose of brexpiprazole resulted in an approximate 31 % and 73 % decrease in \nbrexpiprazole Cmax and AUC, respectively. If brexpiprazole is used concomitantly with strong \nCYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin), the total daily dose requirement of brexpiprazole is increased by \napproximately a factor of three times the recommended daily dose (see section 4.2). Once daily dosing \nwhile CYP3A4 inducers are administered results in high peak to trough fluctuation, hence twice daily \ndivided dosing is preferable. \n \nCYP2D6 inhibitors \nCo-administration of a 2 mg single oral dose of brexpiprazole with quinidine (324 mg/day for 7 days), \na potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, increased the AUC of brexpiprazole by 94 % and no change in Cmax. \nBased on results of interaction studies, dose adjustment of brexpiprazole to half the dose is \nrecommended when administered concomitantly with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (quinidine, \nparoxetine, and fluoxetine). \n \nBased on estimations from the population pharmacokinetic analysis, CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers \nreceiving both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors or CYP2D6 poor metabolisers receiving strong \nCYP3A4 inhibitors are expected to have approximately 4-fold to 5-fold increase in brexpiprazole \nconcentrations and dose adjustment to a quarter of the dose is recommended for these subjects (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nPotential for brexpiprazole to affect other medicinal products \n \nBased on results of in vitro studies, brexpiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important \npharmacokinetic interactions with medicinal products metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. \nBrexpiprazole does not affect absorption of medicinal products that are substrates of Breast Cancer \nResistance Protein transporter (BCRP) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter. \n \nIf brexpiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \n \nIf brexpiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase creatine \nphosphokinase (CPK) the possible additive effect with CPK increase induced by brexpiprazole should \nbe considered. \n \nPharmacodynamic interactions \nNo information on pharmacodynamic interactions of brexpiprazole is available at present. Caution \nshould be exercised when prescribing with other medicinal products. Given the primary Central \nNervous System (CNS) effects of brexpiprazole, caution should be used when brexpiprazole is taken \n\n\n\n9 \n\nin combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse reactions such \nas sedation (see section 4.8). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of brexpiprazole in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Brexpiprazole is not recommended during \npregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n \nNeonates exposed to antipsychotics, including brexpiprazole, during the third trimester of pregnancy \nare at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that may vary in \nseverity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, \ntremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder. Consequently, new-borns should be \nmonitored carefully. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether brexpiprazole/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of brexpiprazole/ metabolites in \nmilk of rats (see section 5.3). A risk to the new-borns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be \nmade whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from brexpiprazole therapy \ntaking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThe effect of brexpiprazole on human fertility has not been evaluated. Studies in animals have shown \ndecreased female fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBrexpiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to \npotential nervous system effects, such as sedation and dizziness that are common adverse drug \nreactions (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were akathisia (5.6 %) and weight gain \n(3.9 %). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe incidences of the ADRs associated with brexpiprazole therapy are tabulated below. The table is \nbased on adverse reactions reported in short-term placebo-controlled phase 2 and 3 clinical trials with \nrelevant therapeutic doses (2 mg to 4 mg). \n \nAll ADRs are listed by system organ class (SOC) and frequency: very common (≥ 1/10), common \n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare \n(< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nSOC Very common Common Uncommon Not known \nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Rash Angioedema \nUrticaria \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nSOC Very common Common Uncommon Not known \nSwelling face \n \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\n Weight \nincrease \n\n  \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n \n\n  Suicide attempt \nSuicidal ideation \n\nGambling disorder \nImpulsive \nbehaviour \nBinge eating \nCompulsive \nshopping \nCompulsive sexual \nbehaviour \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n Akathisia \nDizziness \nTremor \nSedation \n\nParkinsonism Seizures \nNeuroleptic \nmalignant \nsyndrome (NMS) \n\nCardiac disorders    Electrocardiogram \nQT prolonged \n \n\nVascular disorders   Venous \nthromboembolism \n(including \npulmonary \nembolism and deep \nvein thrombosis) \nOrthostatic \nhypotension \n \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n  Cough  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Diarrhoea \nNausea \nAbdominal \npain upper \n \n\nDental caries \nFlatulence \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n Back pain \nPain in \nextremity \n\nMyalgia Rhabdomyolysis \n\nPregnancy, \npuerperium and \nperinatal conditions \n\n   Drug withdrawal \nsyndrome neonatal \n(see section 4.6) \n \n\nInvestigations \n \n\nBlood \nprolactin \nincreased1 \n\nBlood creatine \nphosphokinase \nincreased \n\nBlood pressure \nincreased \nBlood triglycerides \nincreased \nHepatic enzymes \nincreased \n\n \n\n1 The categorisation of blood prolactin increased is based on Potentially Clinically Relevant (PCR) criteria \nof > 1 × upper limit of normal (ULN). \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nExtrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS) \n\n\n\n11 \n\nAkathisia was the most frequently reported EPS related ADR in the brexpiprazole \n2 mg/day to 4 mg/day group (5.6 %) compared to 4.5 % in placebo, followed by tremor (2.7 %) \ncompared to 1.2 % in placebo. The incidences of other EPS-related ADRs reported in short-term, \ncontrolled trials are dyskinesia (0.4 %), extrapyramidal disorder (1.8 %) and Parkinsonism (0.4 %). \n \nAkathisia \nFrom fixed-dose trials there appears to be a dose-response relationship for akathisia in patients treated \nwith brexpiprazole, with an increasing frequency with higher doses. The incidence of akathisia in the \nbrexpiprazole 1 mg/day, 2 mg/day, and 4 mg/day groups was 3.0 %, 4.6 %, and 6.5 %, respectively, \ncompared with 5.2 % of subjects in the placebo group. \nThe incidence of akathisia in the short-term, controlled trials (5.4 %) was similar to the incidence in \nthe long-term, open-label trials (5.7 %). \n \nSuicidality \nIn short-term, controlled trials, Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) related to suicidality \nwere reported for 8 subjects (0.5 %, 2 serious events, 1 leading to discontinuation) in the all \nbrexpiprazole treatment group and 3 subjects (0.4 %, none serious) in the placebo group. In long-term, \nopen-label trials, TEAEs related to suicidality were reported for 23 subjects (1.6 %). Overall in the \nbrexpiprazole clinical development program for schizophrenia, one death due to suicide, considered \nnot drug related by the investigator, occurred. Spontaneous cases reporting completed suicide and \nsuicide attempt have been reported in the post-marketing setting. \n \nQT prolongation \nIn the short-term controlled trials with brexpiprazole, 3 TEAEs related to QT prolongation were \nreported in the 2 mg to 4 mg group (0.3 %), compared with 3 TEAEs (0.5 %) reported for subjects on \nplacebo. The incidence of TEAEs in long-term trials was similar to that of the short-term trials. \nThe effects of brexpiprazole at therapeutic (4 mg) and supra-therapeutic (12 mg) doses on QT interval \nwere evaluated in subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in a randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin), parallel-arm trial. Subgroup analyses \nfrom this trial suggested that the QTc prolongation was larger in female subjects than in males (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nWeight gain \nIn short-term, controlled trials, the percentage of subjects with clinically significant weight gain \n(increase of ≥ 7 % from baseline in body weight) was 9.1 % in the brexpiprazole \n2 mg/day to 4 mg/day group, compared with 3.8 % in the placebo group. \nIn the long-term, open-label trial, the percentage of subjects with clinically significant weight gain \n(increase of ≥ 7 % in body weight) at any visit was 20.7 % and 0.4 % of the subjects discontinued due \nto weight gain. In subjects who had a weight gain ≥ 7 % from baseline, weight increased over time, \nwith mean weight gain up to 10.2 kg at week 52. The mean change in body weight overall for the \nbrexpiprazole group in the long term, open label trial was 2.1 kg at week 52. \n \nProlactin \nThe incidence of blood prolactin increased was 0.9 % in 2 mg to 4 mg brexpiprazole group compared \nto that of 0.5 % in placebo in short-term, controlled trials. Higher frequencies of prolactin increased \n(1.5 % versus 0.60 %) were observed in females compared to males in short-term trials. In addition, \nthe frequencies of prolactin elevations > 1 × ULN in the 2 mg to 4 mg brexpiprazole group was \n13.7 % in females versus 6.4 % in placebo and 11.1 % in males versus 10.3 % in placebo group. \n \nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome \nA potentially fatal symptom complex referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been \nreported in association with brexpiprazole (see section 4.4). \n \nNausea \nFor nausea, the incidence in the 2 mg to 4 mg brexpiprazole group was 2.3 % overall in short-term \ncontrolled trials, compared to 2.0 % in placebo; for vomiting, these incidences were 1.0 % in the \nbrexpiprazole-treated group compared to 1.2 % in placebo group. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \nIn terms of gender differences, there were higher observed frequencies of nausea (4.8 % versus 2.8 %) \nand vomiting (4.6 % versus 1.4 %) in females compared to males among brexpiprazole-treated \nsubjects in short-term trials, in subjects receiving placebo: the frequency for nausea was 2.8 % for \nmales versus 3.2 % for females and for vomiting the frequency was 3.0 % for males versus 2.6 % for \nfemales (see section 5.2). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nGastric lavage and treatment with an emetic may be useful immediately after overdose. An \nelectrocardiogram should be obtained in case of overdose and if QT interval prolongation is present, \ncardiac monitoring should be instituted. \n \nOtherwise, management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an \nadequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. Close medical \nsupervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. \n \nOral activated charcoal and sorbitol (50 g/240 mL), administered one hour after ingesting 2 mg oral \ndose of brexpiprazole, decreased brexpiprazole Cmax and AUC by approximately 5 % to 23 % and \n31 % to 39 % respectively; however, there is insufficient information available on the therapeutic \npotential of activated charcoal in treating an overdose with brexpiprazole. \n \nAlthough there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with \nbrexpiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since brexpiprazole is \nhighly bound to plasma proteins. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, other antipsychotics, ATC code N05AX16 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nBrexpiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic agent. The pharmacology of brexpiprazole is believed to be \nmediated by a modulatory activity at the serotonin and dopamine systems that combines partial agonist \nactivity at serotonergic 5-HT1A and at dopaminergic D2 receptors with antagonist activity at \nserotonergic 5-HT2A receptors, with similar high affinities at all of these receptors \n(Ki: 0.1 nM to 0.5 nM). Brexpiprazole also shows antagonist activity at noradrenergic α1B/2C receptors \nwith affinity in the same sub-nanomolar Ki range (Ki: 0.2 nM to 0.6 nM). \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nInfluences of genetic variation on the pharmacodynamic responses to brexpiprazole have not been \ninvestigated. \n \nEffects on QT \nThe effects of brexpiprazole on the QT interval were evaluated in patients with schizophrenia or \nschizoaffective disorder. In the overall analysis brexpiprazole did not prolong the QTc interval to \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n13 \n\nclinically relevant extent following therapeutic and supra-therapeutic doses (4 mg/day; n = 62 or \n12 mg/day; n = 53) and no correlation has been observed between brexpiprazole concentrations and \nQTc prolongation. \n \nSubgroup analyses from the thorough QTc trial suggested that the QTc prolongation was larger in \nfemale subjects than in males. In the brexpiprazole 4 mg/day group, the maximum placebo-adjusted \nmean change from baseline in the QTcI interval was 5.2 ms (90 % CI: 1.5, 8.9) in males (n = 48) and \n15.0 ms (90 % CI: 7.7., 22.3) in females (n = 14) at 6 hours post-dosing. In the brexpiprazole \n12 mg/day group, the maximum placebo-adjusted mean change from baseline in the QTcI interval was \n2.9 ms (90 % CI: −1.2, 6.9) in males (n = 40) at 12 hours post-dosing and 10.4 ms (90 % CI: 2.7, 18.2) \nin females (n = 13) at 24 hours post-dosing. The smaller number of female than male subjects enrolled \nin the study does not allow to draw definitive conclusions. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of brexpiprazole in the treatment of adults with schizophrenia was studied in \ntwo multi-national and one regional (Japan), 6-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, \nfixed-dose clinical trials (trials 1 to 3), a multi-national, 6-week, randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled, active reference (quetiapine), flexible-dose clinical trial (trial 4), and, one \nmulti-national, placebo-controlled, 52-week maintenance trial (trial 5). The trials included \n2,690 patients with the age of 18 years to 65 years. \n \nIn trials 1, 2 and 3 brexpiprazole was titrated as described in section 4.2 with 1 mg for 4 days, \nfollowed by 2 mg on days 5 to 7. On day 8 the dose was increased to 4 mg for some of the treatment \narms. \n \nShort-term trials \nIn the three fixed-dose, short-term trials (trials 1, 2 and 3), subjects were randomised to brexpiprazole \n2 mg once daily, 4 mg once daily or placebo. \n \nTrial 4 assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of brexpiprazole in a flexible dose range of \n2 mg/day to 4 mg/day and 400 mg to 800 mg quetiapine extended release (XR) for assay sensitivity. In \nthe short-term trials, the primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the mean change from baseline to \nweek 6 in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores, a multi-item inventory \ncomposed of five factors to evaluate positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganised thoughts, \nuncontrolled hostility/excitement, and anxiety/depression. \n \nThe key secondary endpoint in trials 1, 2 and 4 was the Clinical Global Impression of Severity \n(CGI-S) of schizophrenia, a 7-point clinician’s assessment of the severity of disease. The CGI-S was \nalso assessed in trials 3 and 5 as secondary endpoint. \n \nThe effects of brexpiprazole were also evaluated across a number of pre-specified secondary \nendpoints; the specific aspects of symptoms of schizophrenia (PANSS Positive Subscale score, \nPANSS Negative Subscale score, PANSS Excited Component [PEC] score, PANSS Marder factors \npositive, negative, disorganised thoughts, uncontrolled hostility/excitement and anxiety/depression), \nand analyses of response (defined as 30 % improvement in PANSS total score compared to baseline or \na CGI-I score of 1 [very much improved] or 2 [much improved]). \n \nEfficacy was demonstrated in trial 1 for both brexpiprazole 2 mg/day and 4 mg/day and replicated in \ntrial 2 only for brexpiprazole 4 mg/day and in trial 3 only for brexpiprazole 2 mg/day. \n \nIn the flexible-dose trial 4, at week 6, subjects in the brexpiprazole treatment group had numerically \ngreater improvements on PANSS total score than the subjects in the placebo group, although, the \ndifference at week 6 did not reach statistical significance for the primary efficacy analysis (p = 0.0560; \nsee table 2). In the same trial the active reference, quetiapine XR added for assay sensitivity only, \nseparated from placebo. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nTable 2: Primary efficacy results for 6-week trials in schizophrenia \n \n\nTrial Treatment group n Primary efficacy measure: PANSS \n\n \nMean baseline \n\nscore (SD) \n \n\nLS mean change \nfrom baseline \n\n(SE) \n\nLS mean \ndifferencea, b \n(95 % CI) \n\np-value \n\n1 Brexpiprazole (2 mg/day)* 180 \n95.85 \n\n(13.75) \n−20.73 \n(1.55) \n\n−8.72 \n(−13.1, −4.37) < 0.0001 \n\n Brexpiprazole (4 mg/day)* 178 \n94.70 \n\n(12.06) \n−19.65 \n(1.54) \n\n−7.64 \n(−12.0, −3.30) 0.0006 \n\n Placebo 178 95.69 (11.46) \n−12.01 \n(1.60) -- -- \n\n2 Brexpiprazole (2 mg/day) 179 \n96.30 \n\n(12.91) \n−16.61 \n(1.49) \n\n−3.08 \n(−7.23, 1.07) 0.1448 \n\n Brexpiprazole (4 mg/day)* 181 \n94.99 \n\n(12.38) \n−20.00 \n(1.48) \n\n−6.47 \n(−10.6, −2.35) 0.0022 \n\n Placebo 180 94.63 (12.84) \n−13.53 \n(1.52) -- -- \n\n3 Brexpiprazole (2 mg/day)* 113 \n96.55 \n\n(19.20) \n−14.95 \n(2.00) \n\n−7.32 \n(−13.04, −1.59) 0.0124 \n\n Brexpiprazole (4 mg/day) 109 \n96.39 \n\n(15.73) \n−11.49 \n(2.10) \n\n−3.86 \n(−9.71, 2.00) 0.1959 \n\n Placebo 113 97.19 (19.27) \n−7.63 \n(2.11) -- -- \n\n4 \nBrexpiprazole \n\n(2 mg/day to 4 mg/day\n) \n\n150 \n97.82 \n\n(10.25) \n−19.99 \n(1.51) −4.1 (−8.2, 0.1) 0.0560 \n\n Placebo 159 98.38 (10.30) \n−15.93 \n(1.49) -- -- \n\nSD Standard deviation \nSE Standard error \nLS Mean Least-squares mean. \nCI Confidence interval \n* Treatment statistically significantly superior to placebo \na Difference (brexpiprazole minus placebo) in least-squares mean change from baseline, at week 6 \nb The LS Mean, 95 % CI, and p-values for individual trials were derived from an MMRM (Mixed \n\neffect Model Repeat Measurement) analysis as follows: fixed effects of site, treatment, visit, and \ntreatment-by-visit interaction, with baseline and baseline-by-visit interaction as covariates. \nUnstructured variance-covariance matrix structure was used. \n\n \nThe primary statistical analysis was performed using an MMRM model with MAR (Missing At \nRandom) imputation.

At week 52 brexpiprazole \n(13.5 %) reduced the risk of impending relapse by 71 % compared with placebo (38.5 %).

These \nimprovements were maintained during the 52-week double-blind maintenance phase in patients on \nbrexpiprazole whereas patients randomised to placebo showed deterioration in PANSS, CGI-S and \nCGI-I, and GAF scores [ANCOVA LOCF]). Brexpiprazole maintained symptom control and \nfunctioning compared to placebo. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of efficacy and \nsafety studies with brexpiprazole in the paediatric population from 13 years to less than 18 years of \nage (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nBrexpiprazole is absorbed after administration of the tablet, with peak plasma concentrations \noccurring within 4.0 hours after single dose administrations; the absolute oral bioavailability of the \ntablet formulation is 95.1 %. Brexpiprazole steady-state concentrations are attained within \n10 days to 12 days of dosing. Administration of a 4 mg brexpiprazole tablet with a standard high fat \nmeal did not significantly affect the Cmax or AUC of brexpiprazole. After single and multiple once \ndaily dose administration, brexpiprazole exposure (Cmax and AUC) increase in proportion to the dose \nadministered. Based on in vivo studies, brexpiprazole is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of efflux \ntransporters, such as Multi Drug Resistance (MDR) 1 (P-gp) and BCRP. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe volume of distribution of brexpiprazole following intravenous administration is high \n(1.56 L/kg ± 0.418 L/kg), indicating extravascular distribution. Brexpiprazole is highly protein bound \nin plasma (greater than 99 %) to serum albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein, and its protein binding is \nnot affected by renal or hepatic impairment. Based on results of in vitro studies brexpiprazole protein \nbinding is not affected by warfarin, diazepam, and digitoxin. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nBased on in vitro metabolism studies using recombinant human cytochrome P450, the metabolism of \nbrexpiprazole was shown to be mainly mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 leading to formation of \noxidative metabolites. Based on in vitro data brexpiprazole showed little to no inhibition of other \nCYP450 isozymes. In vivo, the metabolism of brexpiprazole is mainly mediated by CYP3A4 and \nCYP2D6 leading to formation of oxidative metabolites with only one metabolite, DM-3411, present in \nplasma with more than 10 % of plasma exposure. \n \nAt steady-state, DM-3411 represents 23.1 % to 47.7 % of brexpiprazole exposure (AUC) in plasma. It \nshould be noted that in vivo preclinical studies have shown that at clinically relevant plasma exposures \nof brexpiprazole, DM-3411 brain exposures were below the detection limit. Thus, DM-3411 is \nconsidered not to contribute to the therapeutic effects of brexpiprazole. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled brexpiprazole, approximately 24.6 % and 46 % of the \nadministered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and faeces, respectively. Less than 1 % of \nunchanged brexpiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 14 % of the oral dose was \nrecovered unchanged in the faeces. Apparent oral clearance of brexpiprazole tablet after once daily \nadministration is 19.8 (± 11.4) mL/h/kg. After multiple once daily administration of brexpiprazole, the \nterminal elimination half-life of brexpiprazole and its major metabolite, DM-3411, is 91.4 hours and \n85.7 hours, respectively. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nThe pharmacokinetic of brexpiprazole is dose proportional and time-invariant after single-dose \n(0.2 mg to 8 mg) and multiple-dose (0.5 mg to 4 mg) using once-daily administration. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nAge \nAfter single dose administration of brexpiprazole (2 mg), elderly subjects (older than 65 years) \nexhibited similar brexpiprazole systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) in comparison with the adult \nsubjects (18 years to 45 years old; see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nGender \nPopulation PK evaluation identified gender as statistically significant covariate. The exposure (AUC) \nof brexpiprazole in women was estimated to be 25 % higher than in men (see section 4.8). \n \nRace \nAlthough no specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted, population pharmacokinetic evaluation \nrevealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of \nbrexpiprazole. \n \nCYP2D6 genotype \nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation shows that CYP2D6 poor metabolisers have 47 % higher \nexposure to brexpiprazole compared to extensive metabolisers (see section 4.2). \n \nSmoking \nBased on studies utilising human liver enzymes in vitro, brexpiprazole is not a substrate for CYP1A2; \nsmoking should, therefore, not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of brexpiprazole. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn subjects (n = 10) with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min), AUC of oral brexpiprazole \n(3 mg single dose) compared to matched healthy subjects was increased by 68 % while its Cmax was \nnot changed. For patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \nCLcr < 60 mL/minute), the maximum recommended dose is reduced to 3 mg once daily (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn subjects (n = 22) with varying degrees of hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C), the \nAUC of oral brexpiprazole (2 mg single dose), compared to matched healthy subjects, increased 24 % \nin mild hepatic impairment, increased 60 % in moderate hepatic impairment, and did not change in \nsevere hepatic impairment. For patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nClasses B and C), the maximum recommended dose is reduced to 3 mg once daily (see section 4.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of brexpiprazole in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years have not \nbeen established (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nEffects observed in repeated-dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys were mainly related to the \nexaggerated pharmacological activity of brexpiprazole. No safety margins based on AUC0-24 h at the \nMaximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 4 mg/day could be derived in both female and \nmale rats and monkey. \n \nCardiovascular toxicity \n \nFollowing oral administration, brexpiprazole decreased blood pressure and prolonged QT interval in \nsafety pharmacology study in conscious male dog, in repeated-dose toxicity studies in male and \nfemale monkeys and in juvenile toxicity study in male and female dogs. The effect of brexpiprazole on \nblood pressure reduction is attributed to the expected blockade of α1-adrenoceptors in peripheral blood \nvessels. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nGenotoxicity, carcinogenicity \n \nBrexpiprazole did not show any genotoxic potential in both in vitro and in vivo studies using clinically \nrelevant exposures. Brexpiprazole administered orally did not increase in the incidence of tumours in \n2-year carcinogenicity study in both male and female rats and in male mice at exposures up to 4.4-fold \nand 3.1-fold the MRHD. In female mice, an increased incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinoma \nand adeno-squamous carcinoma, and pars distalis adenoma of the pituitary gland, was observed at \nsimilar or even lower clinically relevant exposures: these prolactin-mediated endocrine tumours were \nalso observed in rodents with other antipsychotics and their clinical relevance is unknown. \n \nReproductive toxicity \n \nFollowing oral administration, brexpiprazole did not affect male fertility in rats but prolonged diestrus \nand decreased fertility in female rats at similar or even lower exposure levels than those clinically \nachieved at MRHD. Significant increased pre-implantation losses were observed at 4.1-fold the \nclinical exposure at MRHD. In embryo-foetal developmental toxicity studies, brexpiprazole was not \nteratogen in orally treated rats up to exposure levels (based on data in non-pregnant rats) clinically \nachieved at MRHD. In rabbit, vertebral malformations were seen in 3 foetuses from 2 litters at \nmaternally toxic brexpiprazole oral doses corresponding to exposure approximately 16.5-fold the \nclinical exposure at MRHD. \n \nDelayed growth, physical development and impaired viability of the offspring were observed at \nmaternally toxic brexpiprazole doses in a pre-/post-natal developmental toxicity study in orally \nadministered rats. \n \nFollowing oral administration in pregnant rats, foetus and milk transfer of brexpiprazole was \ndemonstrated at concentrations that were generally comparable to levels seen in maternal blood. \n \nEnvironmental risk assessment (ERA) \n \nBrexpiprazole is very persistent and very bioaccumulative but not toxic, to the environment: possible \nenrichment of brexpiprazole in terrestrial food chains might pose a concern (see section 6.6). \n \n \n6.

What RXULTI is and what it is used for \n \nRXULTI contains the active substance brexpiprazole, which belongs to a group of medicines called \nantipsychotics. \n \nIt is used to treat schizophrenia in adult patients - a disease with symptoms such as hearing, seeing or \nsensing things - which are not there, suspiciousness, incoherent speech and behaviour and emotional \nflatness. People with this condition may also feel depressed, guilty, anxious or tense. \n \nRXULTI can help to keep the symptoms under control and to prevent relapse as you continue \ntreatment. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take RXULTI \n \nDo not take RXULTI \n• if you are allergic to brexpiprazole or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTell your doctor immediately if you \n• experience a combination of fever, sweating, faster breathing, muscle stiffness and drowsiness \n\nor sleepiness (may be signs of neuroleptic malignant syndrome). \n\n\n\n45 \n\n• are having any thoughts or feelings about hurting yourself or to commit suicide. Suicidal \nthoughts and behaviours are more likely at the beginning of the treatment. \n\n• or your family/carer notices that you are developing urges or cravings to behave in ways that are \nunusual for you and you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry out certain \nactivities that could harm yourself or others. These are called impulse-control disorders and can \ninclude behaviours such as addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally \nhigh sex drive or preoccupation with an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. Your doctor \nmay need to adjust or stop your dose. \n\n• have any difficulty in swallowing. \n• have or had a low number of white blood cells in your blood and get a fever or any other sign of \n\ninfection. This may for example be the case if other medicines lowered your white blood cells in \nthe past. Your doctor will regularly measure the white blood cells in your blood to minimise the \nrisk for diseases called leukopenia, neutropenia and agranulocytosis. It is important that you get \nyour blood checked regularly as this may be fatal. Your doctor will stop the treatment \nimmediately if the white blood cells in your blood are too low. \n\n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking RXULTI, or during treatment if you have \n• or had heart problems or a history of stroke, especially if you know that you have other risks \n\nfactors for stroke. \n• dementia (loss of memory and other mental abilities) especially if you are elderly. \n• irregular heart beat or if someone else in your family has a history of irregular heart beat \n\n(including so called QT prolongation seen with ECG monitoring). Please inform your doctor if \nyou take any other medicines that are known to prolong the QT interval. \n\n• an electrolyte imbalance (problems with the amount of salts in your blood). \n• or had low or high blood pressure. \n• a history of blood clots, or if someone else in your family has a history of blood clots, as \n\nmedicines for schizophrenia have been associated with formation of blood clots. \n• or had dizziness on standing up due to a drop in your blood pressure, which may cause fainting. \n• or had problems with your movements called extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in the past. \n\nThese may include jerky movements, spasms, restlessness or slow movements. \n• ever experienced or start to experience restlessness and inability to sit still. These symptoms \n\nmay occur early during treatment. Tell your doctor if this happens. \n• diabetes or risk factors for diabetes (e.g. obesity, or someone else in your family has diabetes). \n\nYour doctor will need to check your blood sugar regularly since it may be increased by this \nmedicine. Signs of high blood sugar level are excessive thirst, passing of large amounts of urine, \nincrease in appetite and feeling weak. \n\n• a history of seizures (fits) or epilepsy. \n• ever inhaled food, stomach acid, or saliva into your lungs causing a disease called aspiration \n\npneumonia. \n• increased levels of the hormone prolactin, or have a tumour in your pituitary gland. \n \nWeight gain \nThis medicine may cause significant weight gain which may affect your health. Your doctor will \ntherefore check your weight and your fats in the blood regularly. \n \nBody temperature \nWhile taking RXULTI you should avoid getting over-heated or dehydrated. Do not over-exercise and \ndrink plenty of water. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine must not be taken by children and adolescents under 18 years of age. The safety and \neffectiveness in these patients were not evaluated. \n \nOther medicines and RXULTI \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nRXULTI may increase the effect of medicines used to lower the blood pressure. Be sure to tell your \ndoctor if you take a medicine to keep your blood pressure under control. \n \nReceiving RXULTI with some medicines may mean the doctor will need to change your dose of \nRXULTI or the other medicines. It is especially important to mention the following medicines to your \ndoctor: \n• medicines to correct heart rhythm (such as quinidine), \n• antidepressants or herbal remedies used to treat depression and anxiety (such as fluoxetine, \n\nparoxetine, St. John's Wort), \n• antifungal medicines (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole), \n• certain medicines to treat HIV infection (such as efavirenz, nevirapine, and protease inhibitors \n\ne.g. indinavir, ritonavir), \n• anticonvulsants used to treat epilepsy, \n• antibiotics to treat bacterial infections (such as clarithromycin), \n• certain antibiotics used to treat tuberculosis (such as rifampicin), \n• medicines known to prolong your QT interval (an important measurement of your heart function \n\nin an electrocardiogram [ECG]), \n• medicines changing the salt concentrations in your body (causing a so-called electrolyte \n\nimbalance), \n• medicines increasing an enzyme called creatine phosphokinase (CPK), \n• medicines having an effect on the central nervous system. \n \nRXULTI with food and alcohol \nRXULTI can be taken with or without food.
