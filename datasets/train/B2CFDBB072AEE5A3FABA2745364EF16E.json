NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nPosaconazole SP 40 mg/ml oral suspension \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml of oral suspension contains 40 mg of posaconazole. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nOral suspension \nWhite suspension \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n \nPosaconazole SP is indicated for use in the treatment of the following fungal infections in adults (see \nsection 5.1): \n \n-  Invasive aspergillosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or \n\nitraconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products; \n-  Fusariosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or in patients who are \n\nintolerant of amphotericin B; \n-  Chromoblastomycosis and mycetoma in patients with disease that is refractory to itraconazole \n\nor in patients who are intolerant of itraconazole; \n-  Coccidioidomycosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B, itraconazole or \n\nfluconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products; \n- Oropharyngeal candidiasis: as first-line therapy in patients who have severe disease or are \n\nimmunocompromised, in whom response to topical therapy is expected to be poor. \n \nRefractoriness is defined as progression of infection or failure to improve after a minimum of 7 days \nof prior therapeutic doses of effective antifungal therapy. \n \nPosaconazole SP is also indicated for prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in the following \npatients: \n \n- Patients receiving remission-induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) \n\nor myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) expected to result in prolonged neutropenia and who are \nat high risk of developing invasive fungal infections;  \n\n- Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients who are undergoing high-dose \nimmunosuppressive therapy for graft versus host disease and who are at high risk of developing \ninvasive fungal infections. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of fungal infections or in \nthe supportive care in the high risk patients for which posaconazole is indicated as prophylaxis. \n \nRecommended dosage is shown in Table 1. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n a\n\nut\nho\n\nris\ned\n\n3 \n\nTable 1. Recommended dose according to indication \nIndication Dose and duration of therapy \n\nRefractory Invasive Fungal \nInfections (IFI)/Intolerant \npatients with IFI \n\n400 mg (10 ml) twice a day. In patients who cannot tolerate a \nmeal or a nutritional supplement, Posaconazole SP should be \nadministered at a dose of 200 mg (5 ml) four times a day. \nDuration of therapy should be based on the severity of the \nunderlying disease, recovery from immunosuppression, and \nclinical response. \n\nOropharyngeal Candidiasis Loading dose of 200 mg (5 ml) once a day on the first day, \nthen 100 mg (2.5 ml) once a day for 13 days. \nEach dose of Posaconazole SP should be administered with a \nmeal, or with a nutritional supplement in patients who cannot \ntolerate food to enhance the oral absorption and to ensure \nadequate exposure. \n\nProphylaxis of Invasive \nFungal Infections \n\n200 mg (5 ml) three times a day. Each dose of Posaconazole \nSP should be administered with a meal, or with a nutritional \nsupplement in patients who cannot tolerate food to enhance \nthe oral absorption and to ensure adequate exposure. The \nduration of therapy is based on recovery from neutropenia or \nimmunosuppression. For patients with acute myelogenous \nleukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes, prophylaxis with \nPosaconazole SP should start several days before the \nanticipated onset of neutropenia and continue for 7 days after \nthe neutrophil count rises above 500 cells per mm3. \n\n \nThere are limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe gastrointestinal dysfunction (such as \nsevere diarrhoea). Patients who have severe diarrhoea or vomiting should be monitored closely for \nbreakthrough fungal infections. \n \nThe oral suspension must be shaken well before use. \n \nUse in renal impairment: An effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole is \nnot expected and no dose adjustment is recommended (see section 5.2). \n \nUse in hepatic impairment: There are limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with hepatic \nimpairment; therefore, no recommendation for dose adjustment can be made. In the small number of \nsubjects studied who had hepatic impairment, there was an increase in exposure and half-life with a \ndecrease in hepatic function (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nUse in children: Safety and efficacy in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have not \nbeen established. Therefore posaconazole is not recommended for use in patients below 18 years of \nage (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \n \nCo-administration with ergot alkaloids (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration with the CYP3A4 substrates terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, \nhalofantrine or quinidine since this may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal \nproducts, leading to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see sections 4.4 \nand 4.5). \n \nCo-administration with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin \n(see section 4.5). \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n a\n\nut\nho\n\nris\ned\n\n4 \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity: There is no information regarding cross-sensitivity between posaconazole and other \nazole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing Posaconazole SP to patients with \nhypersensitivity to other azoles. \n \nHepatic toxicity: Hepatic reactions (e.g. mild to moderate elevations in ALT, AST, alkaline \nphosphatase, total bilirubin and/or clinical hepatitis) have been reported during treatment with \nposaconazole. Elevated liver function tests were generally reversible on discontinuation of therapy and \nin some instances these tests normalised without interruption of therapy. Rarely, more severe hepatic \nreactions with fatal outcomes have been reported.  \nPosaconazole should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment. In these \npatients, the prolonged elimination half-life may lead to increased exposure. \n \nMonitoring of hepatic function: Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during \nPosaconazole SP therapy must be routinely monitored for the development of more severe hepatic \ninjury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver \nfunction tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of Posaconazole SP should be considered if clinical signs \nand symptoms are consistent with development of liver disease. \n \nQTc prolongation: Some azoles have been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval. \nPosaconazole SP must not be administered with medicinal products that are substrates for CYP3A4 \nand are known to prolong the QTc interval (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). Posaconazole SP should be \nadministered with caution to patients with pro-arrhythmic conditions such as: \n\u2022 Congenital or acquired QTc prolongation \n\u2022 Cardiomyopathy, especially in the presence of cardiac failure \n\u2022 Sinus bradycardia \n\u2022 Existing symptomatic arrhythmias \n\u2022 Concomitant use with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval (other than those \n\nmentioned in section 4.3). \nElectrolyte disturbances, especially those involving potassium, magnesium or calcium levels, should \nbe monitored and corrected as necessary before and during posaconazole therapy. \n \nPosaconazole is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and should only be used under specific circumstances during \ntreatment with other medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A4 (see section 4.5). \n \nRifabutin: Concomitant use with posaconazole should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient \noutweighs the risk (see section 4.5). \n \nRifamycin antibacterials (rifampicin, rifabutin), certain anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nphenobarbital, primidone), efavirenz and cimetidine: Posaconazole concentrations may be \nsignificantly lowered in combination; therefore, concomitant use with posaconazole should be avoided \nunless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk (see section 4.5). \n \nThis medicinal product contains approximately 1.75 g of glucose per 5 ml of suspension. Patients with \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on posaconazole: \nPosaconazole is metabolised via UDP glucuronidation (phase 2 enzymes) and is a substrate for p-\nglycoprotein (P-gp) efflux in vitro. Therefore, inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, ciclosporin, quinidine, \nclarithromycin, erythromycin, etc.) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin, rifabutin, certain anticonvulsants, etc.) \nof these clearance pathways may increase or decrease posaconazole plasma concentrations, \nrespectively. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n a\n\nut\nho\n\nris\ned\n\n5 \n\n \nRifabutin (300 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax (maximum plasma concentration) and AUC (area \nunder the plasma concentration time curve) of posaconazole to 57 % and 51 %, respectively. \nConcomitant use of posaconazole and rifabutin and similar inducers (e.g. rifampicin) should be \navoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk. See also below regarding the effect of \nposaconazole on rifabutin plasma levels.  \n \nEfavirenz (400 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole by 45 % and 50 %, \nrespectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and efavirenz should be avoided unless the benefit to \nthe patient outweighs the risk.  \n \nPhenytoin (200 mg once a day) decreased the Cmax and AUC of posaconazole by 41 % and 50 %, \nrespectively. Concomitant use of posaconazole and phenytoin and similar inducers (e.g. \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone) should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient \noutweighs the risk. \n \nH2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors: Posaconazole plasma concentrations (Cmax and \nAUC) were reduced by 39 % when posaconazole was administered with cimetidine (400 mg twice a \nday) due to reduced absorption possibly secondary to a decrease in gastric acid production. \nConcomitant use of posaconazole and cimetidine should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient \noutweighs the risk. The effect of other H2 receptor antagonists (e.g. famotidine, ranitidine) and proton \npump inhibitors (e.g. omeprazole) that may suppress gastric acidity for several hours on plasma levels \nof posaconazole has not been studied but a reduction in bioavailability may occur so that co-\nadministration should be avoided if possible.  \n \nEffects of posaconazole on other medicinal products: \nPosaconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Co-administration of posaconazole with CYP3A4 \nsubstrates may result in large increases in exposure to CYP3A4 substrates as exemplified by the \neffects on tacrolimus, sirolimus, atazanavir and midazolam below. Caution is advised during co-\nadministration of posaconazole with CYP3A4 substrates administered intravenously and the dose of \nthe CYP3A4 substrate may need to be reduced. If posaconazole is used concomitantly with CYP3A4 \nsubstrates that are administered orally, and for which an increase in plasma concentrations may be \nassociated with unacceptable adverse events, plasma concentrations of the CYP3A4 substrate and/or \nadverse events should be closely monitored and the dose adjusted as needed. Several of the interaction \nstudies were conducted in healthy volunteers in whom a higher exposure to posaconazole occurs \ncompared to patients administered the same dose. The effect of posaconazole on CYP3A4 substrates \nin patients might be somewhat lower than that observed in healthy volunteers, and is expected to be \nvariable between patients due to the variable posaconazole exposure in patients. The effect of co-\nadministration with posaconazole on plasma levels of CYP3A4 substrates may also be variable within \na patient, unless posaconazole is administered in a strictly standardised way with food, given the large \nfood effect on posaconazole exposure (see section 5.2). \n \nTerfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine and quinidine (CYP3A4 substrates):  \nCo-administration of posaconazole and terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine or \nquinidine is contraindicated. Co-administration may result in increased plasma concentrations of these \nmedicinal products, leading to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nErgot alkaloids: Posaconazole may increase the plasma concentration of ergot alkaloids (ergotamine \nand dihydroergotamine), which may lead to ergotism. Co-administration of posaconazole and ergot \nalkaloids is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors metabolised through CYP3A4 (e.g. simvastatin, lovastatin, and \natorvastatin): Posaconazole may substantially increase plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase \ninhibitors that are metabolised by CYP3A4. Treatment with these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n a\n\nut\nho\n\nris\ned\n\n6 \n\nshould be discontinued during treatment with posaconazole as increased levels have been associated \nwith rhabdomyolysis (see section 4.3). \n \nVinca alkaloids: Posaconazole may increase the plasma concentration of vinca alkaloids (e.g. \nvincristine and vinblastine), which may lead to neurotoxicity. Therefore, concomitant use of \nposaconazole and vinca alkaloids should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the \nrisk. If co-administered, then it is recommended that dose adjustment of vinca alkaloids be considered. \n \nRifabutin: Posaconazole increased the Cmax and AUC of rifabutin by 31 % and 72 %, respectively. \nConcomitant use of posaconazole and rifabutin should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient \noutweighs the risk (see also above regarding the effect of rifabutin on plasma levels of posaconazole). \nIf these medicinal products are co-administered, careful monitoring of full blood counts and adverse \nevents related to increased rifabutin levels (e.g. uveitis) is recommended. \n \nCiclosporin: In heart transplant patients on stable doses of ciclosporin, posaconazole 200 mg once \ndaily increased ciclosporin concentrations requiring dose reductions. Cases of elevated ciclosporin \nlevels resulting in serious adverse events, including nephrotoxicity and one fatal case of \nleukoencephalopathy, were reported in clinical efficacy studies. When initiating treatment with \nposaconazole in patients already receiving ciclosporin, the dose of ciclosporin should be reduced (e.g. \nto about three quarters of the current dose). Thereafter blood levels of ciclosporin should be monitored \ncarefully during co-administration, and upon discontinuation of posaconazole treatment, and the dose \nof ciclosporin should be adjusted as necessary. \n \nTacrolimus: Posaconazole increased Cmax and AUC of tacrolimus (0.05 mg/kg body weight single \ndose) by 121 % and 358 %, respectively. Clinically significant interactions resulting in hospitalisation \nand/or posaconazole discontinuation were reported in clinical efficacy studies. When initiating \nposaconazole treatment in patients already receiving tacrolimus, the dose of tacrolimus should be \nreduced (e.g. to about one third of the current dose). Thereafter blood levels of tacrolimus should be \nmonitored carefully during co-administration, and upon discontinuation of posaconazole, and the dose \nof tacrolimus should be adjusted as necessary. \n \nSirolimus: Repeat dose administration of oral posaconazole (400 mg twice daily for 16 days) increased \nthe Cmax and AUC of sirolimus (2 mg single dose) an average of 6.7-fold and 8.9-fold (range 3.1 to \n17.5-fold), respectively, in healthy subjects. The effect of posaconazole on sirolimus in patients is \nunknown, but is expected to be variable due to the variable posaconazole exposure in patients. Co-\nadministration of posaconazole with sirolimus is not recommended and should be avoided whenever \npossible. If it is considered that co-administration is unavoidable, then it is recommended that the dose \nof sirolimus should be greatly reduced at the time of initiation of posaconazole therapy and that there \nshould be very frequent monitoring of trough concentrations of sirolimus in whole blood. Sirolimus \nconcentrations should be measured upon initiation, during co-administration, and at discontinuation of \nposaconazole treatment, with sirolimus doses adjusted accordingly. It should be noted that the \nrelationship between sirolimus trough concentration and AUC is changed during co-administration \nwith posaconazole. As a result, sirolimus trough concentrations that fall within the usual therapeutic \nrange may result in sub-therapeutic levels. Therefore trough concentrations that fall in the upper part \nof the usual therapeutic range should be targetted and careful attention should be paid to clinical signs \nand symptoms, laboratory parameters and tissue biopsies.  \n \nHIV Protease Inhibitors: As HIV protease inhibitors are CYP3A4 substrates, it is expected that \nposaconazole will increase plasma levels of these antiretroviral agents. Following co-administration of \noral posaconazole (400 mg twice daily) with atazanavir (300 mg once daily) for 7 days in healthy \nsubjects Cmax and AUC of atazanavir increased by an average of 2.6-fold and 3.7-fold (range 1.2 to 26-\nfold), respectively. Following co-administration of oral posaconazole (400 mg twice daily) with \natazanavir and ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects Cmax and AUC of \natazanavir increased by an average of 1.5-fold and 2.5-fold (range 0.9 to 4.1-fold), respectively. The \naddition of posaconazole to therapy with atazanavir or with atazanavir plus ritonavir was associated \nwith increases in plasma bilirubin levels. Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n a\n\nut\nho\n\nris\ned\n\n7 \n\nto antiretroviral agents that are substrates of CYP3A4 is recommended during co-administration with \nposaconazole.  \n \nMidazolam and other benzodiazepines metabolised by CYP3A4: In a study in healthy volunteers \nposaconazole (200 mg once daily for 10 days) increased the exposure (AUC) of IV midazolam \n(0.05 mg/kg) by 83 %. In another study in healthy volunteers, repeat dose administration of oral \nposaconazole (200 mg twice daily for 7 days) increased the Cmax and AUC of IV midazolam (0.4 mg \nsingle dose) by an average of 1.3- and 4.6-fold (range 1.7 to 6.4-fold), respectively; Posaconazole \n400 mg twice daily for 7 days increased the IV midazolam Cmax and AUC by 1.6 and 6.2-fold (range \n1.6 to 7.6-fold), respectively. Both doses of posaconazole increased Cmax and AUC of oral midazolam \n(2 mg single oral dose) by 2.2 and 4.5-fold, respectively. In addition, oral posaconazole (200 mg or \n400 mg) prolonged the mean terminal half-life of midazolam from approximately 3-4 hours to 8-\n10 hours during co-administration.  \nDue to the risk of prolonged sedation it is recommended that dose adjustments should be considered \nwhen posaconazole is administered concomitantly with any benzodiazepine that is metabolised by \nCYP3A4 (e.g. midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam). \n \nCalcium channel blockers metabolised through CYP3A4 (e.g. diltiazem, verapamil, nifedipine, \nnisoldipine): Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to calcium channel blockers \nis recommended during co-administration with posaconazole. Dose adjustment of calcium channel \nblockers may be required. \n \nDigoxin: Administration of other azoles has been associated with increases in digoxin levels. \nTherefore, posaconazole may increase plasma concentration of digoxin and digoxin levels need to be \nmonitored when initiating or discontinuing posaconazole treatment. \n \nSulfonylureas: Glucose concentrations decreased in some healthy volunteers when glipizide was co-\nadministered with posaconazole. Monitoring of glucose concentrations is recommended in diabetic \npatients. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nThere is insufficient information on the use of posaconazole in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Posaconazole \nmust not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk \nto the foetus. \n \nPosaconazole is excreted into the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). The excretion of \nposaconazole in human breast milk has not been investigated. Breast-feeding must be stopped on \ninitiation of treatment with posaconazole. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects of posaconazole on the ability to drive and use machines have been \nperformed. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe safety of posaconazole has been assessed in > 2,400 patients and healthy volunteers enrolled in \nclinical trials and from post-marketing experience. The most frequently reported serious related \nadverse events included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, pyrexia, and increased bilirubin.  \n\nTable 2.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycotics for systemic use-triazole derivatives,  \nATC code: J02A C04. \n \nMechanism of action \nPosaconazole inhibits the enzyme lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase (CYP51), which catalyses an essential \nstep in ergosterol biosynthesis.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n a\n\nut\nho\n\nris\ned\n\n10 \n\nMicrobiology \nPosaconazole has been shown in vitro to be active against the following microorganisms: Aspergillus \nspecies (Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. terreus, A. nidulans, A. niger, A. ustus), Candida species \n(Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. dubliniensis, C. famata, C. \ninconspicua, C. lipolytica, C. norvegensis, C. pseudotropicalis), Coccidioides immitis, Fonsecaea \npedrosoi, and species of Fusarium, Rhizomucor, Mucor, and Rhizopus. The microbiological data \nsuggest that posaconazole is active against Rhizomucor, Mucor, and Rhizopus, however the clinical \ndata are currently too limited to assess the efficacy of posaconazole against these causative agents. \n \nResistance \nClinical isolates with decreased susceptibility to posaconazole have been identified. The principle \nmechanism of resistance is the acquisition of substitutions in the target protein, CYP51.  \n \nCombination with other antifungal agents \nThe use of combination antifungal therapies should not decrease the efficacy of either posaconazole or \nthe other therapies; however, there is currently no clinical evidence that combination therapy will \nprovide an added benefit. \n \nPharmacokinetic / Pharmacodynamic relationships: \nA correlation between total medicinal product exposure divided by MIC (AUC/MIC) and clinical \noutcome was observed. The critical ratio for subjects with Aspergillus infections was ~200. It is \nparticularly important to try to ensure that maximal plasma levels are achieved in patients infected \nwith Aspergillus (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 on recommended dose regimens and the effects of food on \nabsorption). \n \nClinical experience \nInvasive aspergillosis \nOral posaconazole 800 mg/day in divided doses was evaluated for the treatment of invasive \naspergillosis in patients with disease refractory to amphotericin B (including liposomal formulations) \nor itraconazole or in patients who were intolerant of these medicinal products in a non-comparative \nsalvage therapy trial. Clinical outcomes were compared with those in an external control group \nderived from a retrospective review of medical records. The external control group included \n86 patients treated with available therapy (as above) mostly at the same time and at the same sites as \nthe patients treated with posaconazole. Most of the cases of aspergillosis were considered to be \nrefractory to prior therapy in both the posaconazole group (88 %) and in the external control group \n(79 %). \n \nAs shown in Table 3, a successful response (complete or partial resolution) at the end of treatment was \nseen in 42 % of posaconazole-treated patients compared to 26 % of the external group. However, this \nwas not a prospective, randomised controlled study and so all comparisons with the external control \ngroup should be viewed with caution.  \n \nTable 3.

Among \neighteen patients who were intolerant or had infections refractory to amphotericin B or itraconazole, \nseven patients were classed as responders.  \n \nChromoblastomycosis/Mycetoma: 9 of 11 patients were successfully treated with posaconazole \n800 mg/day in divided doses for a median of 268 days and up to 377 days. Five of these patients had \nchromoblastomycosis due to Fonsecaea pedrosoi and 4 had mycetoma, mostly due to Madurella \nspecies. \n \nCoccidioidomycosis: 11 of 16 patients were successfully treated (at the end of treatment complete or \npartial resolution of signs and symptoms present at baseline) with posaconazole 800 mg/day in divided \ndoses for a median of 296 days and up to 460 days. \n \nTreatment of azole-susceptible Oropharyngeal Candidiasis (OPC) \nA randomised, evaluator-blind, controlled study was completed in HIV-infected patients with azole-\nsusceptible oropharyngeal candidiasis (most patients studied had C. albicans isolated at baseline). The \nprimary efficacy variable was the clinical success rate (defined as cure or improvement) after 14 days \nof treatment. Patients were treated with posaconazole or fluconazole oral suspension (both \nposaconazole and fluconazole were given as follows: 100 mg twice a day for 1 day followed by \n100 mg once a day for 13 days). \n \nThe clinical response rates from the above study are shown in the Table 4 below. \nPosaconazole was shown to be non-inferior to fluconazole for clinical success rates at Day 14 as well \nas 4 weeks after the end of treatment. \n \nTable 4.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of \nproven/probable IFIs at 16 weeks post-randomization as determined by an independent, blinded \nexternal expert panel. A key secondary endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFIs during the \non-treatment period (first dose to last dose of study medicinal product + 7 days). The majority \n(377/600, [63 %]) of patients included had Acute Grade 2 or 3 or chronic extensive (195/600, \n[32.5 %]) GVHD at study start. The mean duration of therapy was 80 days for posaconazole and \n77 days for fluconazole. \n \nStudy 1899 was a randomised, evaluator-blinded study of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg three \ntimes a day) versus fluconazole suspension (400 mg once daily) or itraconazole oral solution (200 mg \ntwice a day)  in neutropenic patients who were receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy for acute \nmyelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. The primary efficacy endpoint was the \nincidence of proven/probable IFIs as determined by an independent, blinded external expert panel \nduring the on-treatment period. A key secondary endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFIs \nat 100 days post-randomization. New diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia was the most common \nunderlying condition (435/602, [72 %]). The mean duration of therapy was 29 days for posaconazole \nand 25 days for fluconazole/itraconazole. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n a\n\nut\nho\n\nris\ned\n\n12 \n\n \nIn both prophylaxis studies, aspergillosis was the most common breakthrough infection.

Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, the \nprobability of survival up to day 100 after randomization, was significantly higher for posaconazole \nrecipients; this survival benefit was demonstrated when the analysis considered all causes of death \n(P= 0.0354) as well as IFI-related deaths (P = 0.0209). \n \nIn Study 316, overall mortality was similar (POS, 25 %; FLU, 28 %); however, the proportion of IFI-\nrelated deaths was significantly lower in the POS group (4/301) compared with the FLU \ngroup (12/299; P= 0.0413). \n \nUse in paediatric patients \nSixteen patients 8-17 years of age were treated with 800 mg/day in a study for invasive fungal \ninfections. Based on the available data in 16 of these paediatric patients, the safety profile appears to \nbe similar to patients \u2265 18 years of age. \n \nAdditionally, twelve patients 13-17 years of age received 600 mg/day for prophylaxis of invasive \nfungal infections (Studies 316 and 1899). The safety profile in these patients < 18 years of age appears \nsimilar to the safety profile observed in adults. Based on pharmacokinetic data in 10 of these \npaediatric patients, the pharmacokinetic profile appears to be similar to patients \u2265 18 years of age. \n \nSafety and efficacy in paediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established.  \n \nElectrocardiogram evaluation \nMultiple, time-matched ECGs collected over a 12 hour period were obtained before and during \nadministration of posaconazole (400 mg twice daily with high fat meals) from 173 healthy male and \nfemale volunteers aged 18 to 85 years. No clinically relevant changes in the mean QTc (Fridericia) \ninterval from baseline were observed. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption  \nPosaconazole is absorbed with a median tmax of 3 hours (fed patients). The pharmacokinetics of \nposaconazole are linear following single and multiple dose administration of up to 800 mg when taken \nwith a high fat meal. No further increases in exposure were observed when doses above 800 mg daily \nwere administered to patients and healthy volunteers. In the fasting state, AUC increased less than in \nproportion to dose above 200 mg. In healthy volunteers under fasting conditions, dividing the total \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n a\n\nut\nho\n\nris\ned\n\n14 \n\ndaily dose (800 mg) into 200 mg four times daily compared to 400 mg twice daily, was shown to \nincrease posaconazole exposure by 58 % over 48 hours. \n \nEffect of food on oral absorption in healthy volunteers \nThe AUC of posaconazole is about 2.6 times greater when administered with a non-fat meal or \nnutritional supplement (14 grams fat) and 4 times greater when administered with a high-fat meal \n(~ 50 grams fat) relative to the fasted state. Posaconazole should be administered with food or a \nnutritional supplement (see section 4.2). \n \nDistribution \nPosaconazole is slowly absorbed and slowly eliminated with a large apparent volume of distribution \n(1,774 litres) and is highly protein bound (> 98 %), predominantly to serum albumin. \n \nMetabolism \nPosaconazole does not have any major circulating metabolites and its concentrations are unlikely to be \naltered by inhibitors of CYP450 enzymes. Of the circulating metabolites, the majority are glucuronide \nconjugates of posaconazole with only minor amounts of oxidative (CYP450 mediated) metabolites \nobserved. The excreted metabolites in urine and faeces account for approximately 17 % of the \nadministered radiolabelled dose. \n \nExcretion \nPosaconazole is slowly eliminated with a mean half-life (t\u00bd) of 35 hours (range 20 to 66 hours). After \nadministration of 14C-posaconazole, radioactivity was predominantly recovered in the faeces (77 % of \nthe radiolabelled dose) with the major component being parent compound (66 % of the radiolabelled \ndose). Renal clearance is a minor elimination pathway, with 14 % of the radiolabelled dose excreted in \nurine (< 0.2 % of the radiolabelled dose is parent compound). Steady-state is attained following 7 to \n10 days of multiple-dose administration. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \nChildren (< 18 years) \nFollowing administration of 800 mg per day of posaconazole as a divided dose for treatment of \ninvasive fungal infections, mean trough plasma concentrations from 12 patients 8 - 17 years of age \n(776 ng/ml) were similar to concentrations from 194 patients 18 - 64 years of age (817 ng/ml). No \npharmacokinetic data are available from paediatric patients less than 8 years of age. Similarly, in the \nprophylaxis studies, the mean steady-state posaconazole average concentration (Cav) was comparable \namong ten adolescents (13-17 years of age) to Cav achieved in adults (\u2265 18 years of age). \n \nGender \nThe pharmacokinetics of posaconazole are comparable in men and women. \n \nElderly (\u2265 65 years) \nAn increase in Cmax (26 %) and AUC (29 %) was observed in elderly subjects (24 subjects \u2265 65 years \nof age) relative to younger subjects (24 subjects 18 - 45 years of age). However, in clinical efficacy \ntrials, the safety profile of posaconazole between the young and elderly patients was similar. \n \nRace \nThere was a slight decrease (16 %) in the AUC and Cmax of posaconazole in Black subjects relative to \nCaucasian subjects. However, the safety profile of posaconazole between the Black and Caucasian \nsubjects was similar. \n \nRenal impairment \nFollowing single-dose administration, there was no effect of mild and moderate renal impairment \n(n=18, Cl cr \u2265 20 ml/min/1.73 m2) on posaconazole pharmacokinetics; therefore, no dose adjustment is \nrequired. In subjects with severe renal impairment (n=6, Cl cr < 20 ml/min/1.73 m2), the AUC of \nposaconazole was highly variable [> 96 % CV (coefficient of variance)] compared to other renal \ngroups [< 40 % CV]. However, as posaconazole is not significantly renally eliminated, an effect of \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n a\n\nut\nho\n\nris\ned\n\n15 \n\nsevere renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole is not expected and no dose \nadjustment is recommended. Posaconazole is not removed by haemodialysis. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn a study with small number of subjects (n=12) who had hepatic impairment, there was an increase in \nexposure associated with prolongation of half-life in hepatic impaired patients (26.6, 35.3, and \n46.1 hours for the mild, moderate and severe groups, respectively compared to 22.1 hours in subjects with \nnormal hepatic function). An approximately 2-fold increase in steady-state AUC is estimated in patients \nwith severe hepatic impairment. Due to the limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with hepatic \nimpairment, posaconazole should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment \nsince the prolonged half-life that may occur will lead to increased exposure. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAs observed with other azole antifungal agents, effects related to inhibition of steroid hormone \nsynthesis were seen in repeated-dose toxicity studies with posaconazole. Adrenal suppressive effects \nwere observed in toxicity studies in rats and dogs at exposures equal to or greater than those obtained \nat therapeutic doses in humans.  \n \nNeuronal phospholipidosis occurred in dogs dosed for \u2265 3 months at lower systemic exposures than \nthose obtained at therapeutic doses in humans. This finding was not seen in monkeys dosed for one \nyear. In twelve-month neurotoxicity studies in dogs and monkeys, no functional effects were observed \non the central or peripheral nervous systems at systemic exposures greater than those achieved \ntherapeutically. \n \nPulmonary phospholipidosis resulting in dilatation and obstruction of the alveoli was observed in the \n2-year study in rats. These findings are not necessarily indicative of a potential for functional changes \nin humans. \n \nNo effects on electrocardiograms, including QT and QTc intervals, were seen in a repeat dose safety \npharmacology study in monkeys at systemic exposures 4.6-fold greater than the exposures obtained at \ntherapeutic doses in humans. Echocardiography revealed no indication of cardiac decompensation in a \nrepeat dose safety pharmacology study in rats at a systemic exposure 1.4-fold greater than that \nachieved therapeutically. Increased systolic and arterial blood pressures (up to 29 mm-Hg) were seen \nin rats and monkeys at systemic exposures 1.4-fold and 4.6-fold greater, respectively, than those \nachieved with therapeutic doses. \n \nReproduction, peri- and postnatal development studies were conducted in rats. At exposures lower \nthan those obtained at therapeutic doses in humans, posaconazole caused skeletal variations and \nmalformations, dystocia, increased length of gestation, reduced mean litter size and postnatal viability. \nIn rabbits, posaconazole was embryotoxic at exposures greater than those obtained at therapeutic \ndoses. As observed with other azole antifungal agents, these effects on reproduction were considered \nto be due to a treatment-related effect on steroidogenesis. \n \nPosaconazole was not genotoxic in in vitro and in vivo studies. Carcinogenicity studies did not reveal \nspecial hazards for humans. \n \n \n6.

Posaconazole SP works by killing or \nstopping the growth of some types of fungi that can cause infections in humans. \n \nPosaconazole SP can be used to treat the following types of fungal infections in adults: \n- Infections caused by fungi of the Aspergillus family that have not improved during treatment \n\nwith the anti-fungal medicines amphotericin B or itraconazole or when these medicines have \nhad to be stopped; \n\n- Infections caused by fungi of the Fusarium family that have not improved during treatment with \namphotericin B or when amphotericin B has had to be stopped; \n\n- Infections caused by fungi that cause the conditions known as chromoblastomycosis and \nmycetoma that have not improved during treatment with itraconazole or when itraconazole has \nhad to be stopped; \n\n- Infections due to fungi called Coccidioides that have not improved during treatment with one or \nmore of amphotericin B, itraconazole or fluconazole or when these medicines have had to be \nstopped; \n\n- Infections in the mouth or throat area (known as \u201cthrush\u201d) caused by fungi called Candida, \nwhich are initial infections. \n\n \nPosaconazole SP can be used to prevent fungal infections in patients whose immune systems may be \nweakened due to other medicines or diseases. \n \n \n2.
