This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information.  Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.  \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nEpclusa 400 mg/100 mg film-coated tablets. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 400 mg sofosbuvir and 100 mg velpatasvir. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nPink, diamond-shaped, film-coated tablet of dimensions 20 mm x 10 mm, debossed on one side with \n“GSI” and “7916” on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEpclusa is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults (see \nsections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nEpclusa treatment should be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the management of \npatients with HCV infection. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of Epclusa is one tablet, taken orally, once daily with or without food (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nTable 1: Recommended treatment and duration for all HCV genotypes \nPatient populationa Treatment and duration \n\nPatients without cirrhosis and patients with \ncompensated cirrhosis \n\nEpclusa for 12 weeks \n \nAddition of ribavirin may be considered for genotype 3 infected \npatients with compensated cirrhosis (see section 5.1.) \n\nPatients with decompensated cirrhosis Epclusa + ribavirin for 12 weeks \na Includes patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and patients with recurrent HCV post-liver \n\ntransplant (see section 4.4.). \n \nWhen used in combination with ribavirin, refer also to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the \nmedicinal product containing ribavirin. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nThe following dosing is recommended where ribavirin is divided in two daily doses and given with \nfood: \n \nTable 2: Guidance for ribavirin dosing when administered with Epclusa to patients with \ndecompensated cirrhosis \nPatient Ribavirin Dose \nChild-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) Class B \ncirrhosis pre-transplant \n\n1,000 mg per day for patients < 75 kg and 1,200 mg for those \nweighing ≥ 75 kg \n\nCPT Class C cirrhosis pre-transplant \n \nCPT Class B or C post-transplant \n\nStarting dose of 600 mg, which can be titrated up to a maximum of \n1,000/1,200 mg (1,000 mg for patients weighing < 75 kg and \n1,200 mg for patients weighing ≥ 75 kg) if well tolerated.  If the \nstarting dose is not well tolerated, the dose should be reduced as \nclinically indicated based on haemoglobin levels \n\n \nIf ribavirin is used in genotype 3 infected patients with compensated cirrhosis (pre- or post-transplant) \nthe recommended dose of ribavirin is 1,000/1,200 mg (1,000 mg for patients weighing < 75 kg and \n1,200 mg for patients weighing ≥ 75 kg). \n \nFor ribavirin dose modifications, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal \nproduct containing ribavirin. \n \nPatients should be instructed that if vomiting occurs within 3 hours of dosing an additional tablet of \nEpclusa should be taken.  If vomiting occurs more than 3 hours after dosing, no further dose of \nEpclusa is needed (see section 5.1). \n \nIf a dose of Epclusa is missed and it is within 18 hours of the normal time, patients should be \ninstructed to take the tablet as soon as possible and then patients should take the next dose at the usual \ntime.  If it is after 18 hours then patients should be instructed to wait and take the next dose of Epclusa \nat the usual time.  Patients should be instructed not to take a double dose of Epclusa. \n \nPatients who have previously failed therapy with an NS5A-containing regimen \nEpclusa + ribavirin for 24 weeks may be considered (see section 4.4). \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is warranted for elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Epclusa is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.   \n \nSafety data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate \n[eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2)and end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis.  Epclusa \ncan be used in these patients with no dose adjustment when no other relevant treatment options are \navailable (see section 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Epclusa is required for patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic \nimpairment (CPT Class A, B, or C) (see section 5.2).  Safety and efficacy of Epclusa have been \nassessed in patients with CPT Class B cirrhosis, but not in patients with CPT Class C cirrhosis (see \nsections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Epclusa in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years have not yet \nbeen established.  No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nFor oral use. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPatients should be instructed to swallow the tablet whole with or without food (see section 5.2).  Due \nto the bitter taste, it is recommended that the film-coated tablet is not chewed or crushed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nUse with strong P-gp and strong CYP inducers \nMedicinal products that are strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and/or strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) \ninducers (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin and St. John’s wort).  \nCo-administration will significantly decrease sofosbuvir or velpatasvir plasma concentrations and \ncould result in loss of efficacy of Epclusa (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEpclusa should not be administered concurrently with other medicinal products containing sofosbuvir. \n \nSevere bradycardia and heart block \nLife-threatening cases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when sofosbuvir-\ncontaining regimens are used in combination with amiodarone. Bradycardia has generally occurred \nwithin hours to days, but cases with a longer time to onset have been observed mostly up to 2 weeks \nafter initiating HCV treatment. \n \nAmiodarone should only be used in patients on Epclusa when other alternative anti-arrhythmic \ntreatments are not tolerated or are contraindicated. \n \nShould concomitant use of amiodarone be considered necessary, it is recommended that patients \nundergo cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration, after \nwhich outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the \nfirst 2 weeks of treatment. \n \nDue to the long half-life of amiodarone, cardiac monitoring as outlined above should also be carried \nout for patients who have discontinued amiodarone within the past few months and are to be initiated \non Epclusa. \n \nAll patients with concurrent or recent use of amiodarone should be warned of the symptoms of \nbradycardia and heart block and should be advised to seek medical advice urgently should they \nexperience them. \n \nHCV/HBV (hepatitis B virus) co-infection \nCases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after \ntreatment with direct-acting antiviral agents.  HBV screening should be performed in all patients \nbefore initiation of treatment.  HBV/HCV co-infected patients are at risk of HBV reactivation, and \nshould therefore be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines. \n \nPatients who have previously failed therapy with an NS5A-containing regimen \nThere are no clinical data to support the efficacy of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for the treatment of patients \nwho have failed treatment with a regimen containing another NS5A inhibitor.  However, on the basis \nof NS5A resistance associated variants (RAVs) typically seen in patients who have failed therapy with \nother NS5A inhibitor containing regimens, the in vitro pharmacology of velpatasvir, and the outcomes \nof sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment in NS5A-naïve patients with baseline NS5A RAVs enrolled into \nthe ASTRAL-studies, treatment with Epclusa + RBV for 24 weeks can be considered for patients who \nhave failed therapy on an NS5A-containing regimen and who are deemed at high risk for clinical \ndisease progression and who do not have alternative treatment options. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nRenal impairment \nSafety data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and \nESRD requiring haemodialysis.  Epclusa can be used in these patients with no dose adjustment when \nno other relevant treatment options are available (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2).  When Epclusa is used \nin combination with ribavirin refer also to the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for \npatients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min (see section 5.2). \n \nUse with moderate P-gp inducers and/or moderate CYP inducers \nMedicinal products that are moderate P-gp and/or moderate CYP inducers (e.g. efavirenz, modafinil, \noxcarbazepine or rifapentine) may decrease sofosbuvir or velpatasvir plasma concentrations leading to \nreduced therapeutic effect of Epclusa.  Co-administration of such medicinal products with Epclusa is \nnot recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nUse with certain HIV antiretroviral regimens \nEpclusa has been shown to increase tenofovir exposure, especially when used together with an HIV \nregimen containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a pharmacokinetic enhancer (ritonavir or \ncobicistat).  The safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the setting of Epclusa and a \npharmacokinetic enhancer has not been established.  The potential risks and benefits associated with \nco-administration of Epclusa with the fixed-dose combination tablet containing \nelvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate \ngiven in conjunction with a boosted HIV protease inhibitor (e.g. atazanavir or darunavir) should be \nconsidered, particularly in patients at increased risk of renal dysfunction.  Patients receiving Epclusa \nconcomitantly with elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or with \ntenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a boosted HIV protease inhibitor should be monitored for \ntenofovir-associated adverse reactions.  Refer to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine/tenofovir \ndisoproxil fumarate, or elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate Summary of \nProduct Characteristics for recommendations on renal monitoring. \n \nUse in diabetic patients  \nDiabetics may experience improved glucose control, potentially resulting in symptomatic \nhypoglycaemia, after initiating HCV direct-acting antiviral treatment. Glucose levels of diabetic \npatients initiating direct-acting antiviral therapy should be closely monitored, particularly within the \nfirst 3 months, and their diabetic medication modified when necessary. The physician in charge of the \ndiabetic care of the patient should be informed when direct-acting antiviral therapy is initiated. \n \nCPT Class C cirrhosis \nSafety and efficacy of Epclusa has not been assessed in patients with CPT Class C cirrhosis (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nLiver transplant patients \nThe safety and efficacy of Epclusa in the treatment of HCV infection in patients who are post-liver \ntransplant have not been assessed.  Treatment with Epclusa in accordance with the recommended \nposology (see section 4.2) should be guided by an assessment of the potential benefits and risks for the \nindividual patient. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAs Epclusa contains sofosbuvir and velpatasvir, any interactions that have been identified with these \nactive substances individually may occur with Epclusa. \n \nPotential for Epclusa to affect other medicinal products \nVelpatasvir is an inhibitor of drug transporter P-gp, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic \nanion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and OATP1B3.  Co-administration of Epclusa with \nmedicinal products that are substrates of these transporters may increase the exposure of such \nmedicinal products.  See Table 3 for examples of interactions with sensitive substrates of P-gp \n(digoxin), BCRP (rosuvastatin), and OATP (pravastatin). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect Epclusa \nSofosbuvir and velpatasvir are substrates of drug transporters P-gp and BCRP.  Velpatasvir is also a \nsubstrate of drug transporter OATP1B.  In vitro, slow metabolic turnover of velpatasvir by CYP2B6, \nCYP2C8 and CYP3A4 was observed.  Medicinal products that are strong inducers of P-gp and/or \nstrong inducers of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, or CYP3A4 (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin, \nrifampicin, rifabutin and St. John’s wort) may decrease plasma concentrations of sofosbuvir or \nvelpatasvir leading to reduced therapeutic effect of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir.  The use of such medicinal \nproducts with Epclusa is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  Medicinal products that are moderate \nP-gp inducers and/or moderate CYP inducers (e.g. efavirenz, modafinil, oxcarbazepine or rifapentine) \nmay decrease sofosbuvir or velpatasvir plasma concentration leading to reduced therapeutic effect of \nEpclusa.  Co-administration with such medicinal products is not recommended with Epclusa (see \nsection 4.4).  Co-administration with medicinal products that inhibit P-gp or BCRP may increase \nsofosbuvir or velpatasvir plasma concentrations.  Medicinal products that inhibit OATP, CYP2B6, \nCYP2C8, or CYP3A4 may increase plasma concentration of velpatasvir.  Clinically significant \nmedicinal product interactions with Epclusa mediated by P-gp, BCRP, OATP, or CYP450 inhibitors \nare not expected; Epclusa may be co-administered with P-gp, BCRP, OATP and CYP inhibitors. \n \nPatients treated with vitamin K antagonists \nAs liver function may change during treatment with Epclusa, a close monitoring of International \nNormalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended. \n \nImpact of DAA therapy on drugs metabolized by the liver \nThe pharmacokinetics of drugs that are metabolized by the liver (e.g. immunosuppressive agents such \nas calcineurin inhibitors) may be impacted by changes in liver function during DAA therapy, related to \nclearance of HCV. \n \nInteractions between Epclusa and other medicinal products \nTable 3 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant medicinal product \ninteractions (where 90% confidence interval [CI] of the geometric least-squares mean [GLSM] ratio \nwere within “↔”, extended above “↑”, or extended below “↓” the predetermined interaction \nboundaries).

These and other adverse events were reported at a similar frequency in placebo treated \npatients compared with Epclusa treated patients in the Phase 3 pivotal clinical studies. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nAssessment of adverse reactions for Epclusa is based on safety data from clinical studies and \npostmarketing experience. All adverse reactions are presented in Table 4. The adverse reactions are \nlisted below by system organ class and frequency.  Frequencies are defined as follows: very common \n(≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1000) \nor very rare (< 1/10,000). \n \nTable 4: Adverse drug reactions identified with Epclusa \nFrequency Adverse drug reaction \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nCommon rasha \nUncommon angioedemaa \na. Adverse reaction identified through post-marketing surveillance for sofosbuvir/velpatasvir-containing products \n \nPatients with decompensated cirrhosis \nThe safety profile of Epclusa has been evaluated in one open-label study in which patients with CPT \nClass B cirrhosis received Epclusa for 12 weeks (n = 90), Epclusa + RBV for 12 weeks (n = 87) or \nEpclusa for 24 weeks (n = 90).  The adverse events observed were consistent with expected clinical \nsequelae of decompensated liver disease, or the known toxicity profile of ribavirin for patients \nreceiving Epclusa in combination with ribavirin. \n \nAmong the 87 patients who were treated with Epclusa + RBV for 12 weeks, decreases in haemoglobin \nto less than 10 g/dL and 8.5 g/dL during treatment were experienced by 23% and 7% patients, \nrespectively.  Ribavirin was discontinued in 15% of patients treated with Epclusa + RBV for 12 weeks \ndue to adverse events. \n \nPatients with renal impairment  \nThe safety of Epclusa has been evaluated in a 12-week non-controlled study including 59 subjects \nwith ESRD requiring dialysis (Study 4062). In this setting, exposure of sofosbuvir metabolite GS-\n331007 was 20-fold increased, exceeding levels where adverse reactions have been observed in \npreclinical trials. In this limited clinical safety data set, the rate of adverse events and deaths was not \nclearly elevated from what is expected in ESRD patients. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nCardiac arrhythmias \nCases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when sofosbuvir-containing regimens \nare used in combination with amiodarone and/or other medicinal products that lower heart rate (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nSkin disorders \nFrequency not known: Stevens-Johnson syndrome \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe highest documented doses of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir were a single dose of 1,200 mg and a \nsingle dose of 500 mg, respectively.  In these healthy volunteer studies, there were no untoward effects \nobserved at these dose levels, and adverse events were similar in frequency and severity to those \nreported in the placebo groups.  The effects of higher doses/exposures are not known. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n16 \n\nNo specific antidote is available for overdose with Epclusa.  If overdose occurs the patient must be \nmonitored for evidence of toxicity.  Treatment of overdose with Epclusa consists of general supportive \nmeasures including monitoring of vital signs, as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient.  \nHaemodialysis can efficiently remove the predominant circulating metabolite of sofosbuvir, \nGS-331007, with an extraction ratio of 53%.  Haemodialysis is unlikely to result in significant \nremoval of velpatasvir, since velpatasvir is highly bound to plasma protein. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Direct acting antiviral, ATC code: J05AP55 \n \nMechanism of action \nSofosbuvir is a pan-genotypic inhibitor of the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is \nessential for viral replication.  Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug that undergoes intracellular \nmetabolism to form the pharmacologically active uridine analogue triphosphate (GS-461203), which \ncan be incorporated into HCV RNA by the NS5B polymerase and acts as a chain terminator.  \nGS-461203 (the active metabolite of sofosbuvir) is neither an inhibitor of human DNA and \nRNA polymerases nor an inhibitor of mitochondrial RNA polymerase. \n \nVelpatasvir is a HCV inhibitor targeting the HCV NS5A protein, which is essential for both RNA \nreplication and the assembly of HCV virions.  In vitro resistance selection and cross-resistance studies \nindicate velpatasvir targets NS5A as its mode of action. \n \nAntiviral activity \nThe 50% effective concentration (EC50) values of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir against full-length or \nchimeric replicons encoding NS5B and NS5A sequences from the laboratory strains are presented in \nTable 5.  The EC50 values of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir against clinical isolates are presented in \nTable 6. \n \nTable 5: Activity of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir against full-length or chimeric laboratory \nreplicons \nReplicon \ngenotype \n\nSofosbuvir EC50, nMa Velpatasvir EC50, nMa \n\n1a 40 0.014 \n1b 110 0.016 \n2a 50 0.005-0.016c \n2b 15b 0.002-0.006c \n3a 50 0.004 \n4a 40 0.009 \n4d NA 0.004 \n5a 15b 0.021-0.054d \n6a 14b 0.006-0.009 \n6e NA 0.130d \nNA = Not available \na Mean value from multiple experiments of same laboratory replicon. \nb Stable chimeric 1b replicons carrying NS5B genes from genotype 2b, 5a or 6a were used for testing. \nc Data from various strains of full length NS5A replicons or chimeric NS5A replicons carrying full-length NS5A genes \n\nthat contain L31 or M31 polymorphisms. \nd Data from a chimeric NS5A replicon carrying NS5A amino acids 9-184. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nTable 6: Activity of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir against transient replicons containing NS5A or \nNS5B from clinical isolates \nReplicon \ngenotype \n\nReplicons containing NS5B from clinical \nisolates \n\nReplicons containing NS5A from clinical \nisolates \n\nNumber of clinical \nisolates \n\nMedian sofosbuvir \nEC50, nM (range) \n\nNumber of \nclinical isolates \n\nMedian velpatasvir \nEC50, nM (range) \n\n1a 67 62 (29-128) 23 0.019 (0.011-0.078) \n1b 29 102 (45-170) 34 0.012 (0.005-0.500) \n2a 15 29 (14-81) 8 0.011 (0.006-0.364) \n2b NA NA 16 0.002 (0.0003-0.007) \n3a 106 81 (24-181) 38 0.005 (0.002-1.871) \n4a NA NA 5 0.002 (0.001-0.004) \n4d NA NA 10 0.007 (0.004-0.011) \n4r NA NA 7 0.003 (0.002-0.006) \n5a NA NA 42 0.005 (0.001-0.019) \n6a NA NA 26 0.007 (0.0005-0.113) \n6e NA NA 15 0.024 (0.005-0.433)) \nNA = Not available \n \nThe presence of 40% human serum had no effect on the anti-HCV activity of sofosbuvir but reduced \nthe anti-HCV activity of velpatasvir by 13-fold against genotype 1a HCV replicons. \n \nEvaluation of sofosbuvir in combination with velpatasvir showed no antagonistic effect in reducing \nHCV RNA levels in replicon cells. \n \nResistance \nIn cell culture \nHCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir have been selected in cell culture for multiple \ngenotypes including 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 5a and 6a.  Reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir was associated \nwith the primary NS5B substitution S282T in all replicon genotypes examined.  Site-directed \nmutagenesis of the S282T substitution in replicons of genotype 1 to 6 conferred 2- to 18-fold reduced \nsusceptibility to sofosbuvir and reduced the replication viral capacity by 89% to 99% compared to the \ncorresponding wild-type.  In biochemical assays, the ability of the active triphosphate of sofosbuvir \n(GS-461203) to inhibit recombinant NS5B polymerase from genotypes 1b, 2a, 3a and 4a expressing \nthe S282T substitution was reduced compared to its ability to inhibit wild-type recombinant NS5B \npolymerase, as indicated by a 8.5- to 24-fold increase in the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50). \n \nIn vitro selection of HCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to velpatasvir was performed in cell \nculture for multiple genotypes including 1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a and 6a.  Variants were selected at NS5A \nresistance associated positions 24, 28, 30, 31, 32, 58, 92 and 93.  The resistance associated variants \n(RAVs) selected in 2 or more genotypes were F28S, L31I/V and Y93H.  Site-directed mutagenesis of \nknown NS5A RAVs showed that substitutions conferring a > 100-fold reduction in velpatasvir \nsusceptibility are M28G, A92K and Y93H/N/R/W in genotype 1a, A92K in genotype 1b, C92T and \nY93H/N in genotype 2b, Y93H in genotype 3, and L31V and P32A/L/Q/R in genotype 6.  No \nindividual substitutions tested in genotypes 2a, 4a, or 5a conferred a > 100-fold reduction in \nvelpatasvir susceptibility.  Combinations of these variants often showed greater reductions in \nsusceptibility to velpatasvir than single RAVs alone. \n \nIn clinical studies \nStudies in patients without cirrhosis and patients with compensated cirrhosis \nIn a pooled analysis of patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis who received Epclusa \nfor 12 weeks in three Phase 3 studies, 12 patients (2 with genotype 1 and 10 with genotype 3) qualified \nfor resistance analysis due to virologic failure.  One additional patient with genotype 3 HCV infection \nat baseline was reinfected with genotype 1a HCV at virologic failure and was excluded from the \nvirological analysis.  No patients with genotype 2, 4, 5, or 6 HCV infection experienced virologic \nfailure. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nOf the 2 genotype 1 virologic failure patients, one patient had virus with emergent NS5A RAV Y93N \nand the other patient had virus with emergent NS5A RAVs L31I/V and Y93H at virologic failure.  \nBoth patients had virus at baseline harboring NS5A RAVs.  No NS5B nucleoside inhibitor (NI) RAVs \nwere observed at failure in the 2 patients. \n \nOf the 10 genotype 3 virologic failure patients, Y93H was observed in all 10 patients at failure (6 had \nY93H emerge post-treatment and 4 patients had Y93H at baseline and post-treatment).  No \nNS5B NI RAVs were observed at failure in the 10 patients. \n \nStudies in patients with decompensated cirrhosis \nIn one Phase 3 study in patients with decompensated cirrhosis who received Epclusa + RBV for \n12 weeks, 3 patients (1 with genotype 1 and 2 with genotype 3) qualified for resistance analysis due to \nvirologic failure.  No patients with genotype 2 or 4 HCV infection in the Epclusa + RBV 12 weeks \ngroup experienced virologic failure. \n \nThe 1 virologic failure patient with genotype 1 HCV had no NS5A or NS5B RAVs at failure. \n \nOf the 2 genotype 3 virologic failure patients, one had NS5A RAV Y93H emerge at failure.  Another \npatient had virus with Y93H at baseline and virologic failure and also developed low levels (< 5%) of \nNS5B NI RAVs N142T and E237G at failure.  Pharmacokinetic data from this patient was consistent \nwith non-adherence to treatment. \n \nIn this study, 2 patients treated with Epclusa for 12 or 24 weeks without ribavirin had emergent NS5B \nS282T at low levels (< 5%) along with L159F. \n \nEffect of baseline HCV resistance-associated variants on treatment outcome \nStudies in patients without cirrhosis and patients with compensated cirrhosis \nAnalyses were conducted to explore the association between pre-existing baseline NS5A RAVs and \ntreatment outcome for patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis in three Phase 3 \nclinical studies (ASTRAL-1, ASTRAL-2 and ASTRAL-3).  Of the 1,035 patients treated with \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir in the three Phase 3 clinical studies, 1,023 patients were included in the analysis \nof NS5A RAVs; 7 patients were excluded as they neither achieved sustained virologic response \n(SVR12) nor had virologic failure and 5 additional patients were excluded as NS5A gene sequencing \nfailed.  In the pooled analysis of the Phase 3 studies, 380/1,023 (37%) patients’ virus had baseline \nNS5A RAVs.  Genotype 2, 4, and 6 HCV-infected patients had a higher prevalence of NS5A RAVs \n(70%, 63% and 52%, respectively) compared to genotype 1 (23%), genotype 3 (16%), and genotype 5 \n(18%) HCV-infected patients. \n \nBaseline RAVs had no relevant impact on SVR12 rates in patients infected with genotype 1, 2, 4, 5 \nand 6 HCV, as summarised in Table 7.  Genotype 3 infected patients with the NS5A RAV Y93H at \nbaseline had a lower SVR12 rate than patients without Y93H after treatment with Epclusa for \n12 weeks, as summarised in Table 8.  In the ASTRAL-3 study, the Y93H RAV was detected at \nbaseline in 9% of patients treated with Epclusa. \n \nTable 7: SVR12 in patients with or without baseline NS5A RAVs by HCV genotype (studies \nASTRAL-1, ASTRAL-2 and ASTRAL-3) \n Epclusa 12 weeks \n\nGenotype 1 Genotype 3 Genotypes 2, 4, 5 or 6 Total \nWith any baseline \nNS5A RAVs 97% (73/75) 88% (38/43) 100% (262/262) 98% (373/380) \n\nWithout baseline \nNS5A RAVs 100% (251/251) 97% (225/231) 100% (161/161) 99% (637/643) \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nTable 8: SVR12 in patients with and without baseline Y93H, 1% Cut-off (Resistance Analysis \nPopulation Set) ASTRAL 3 \n\n \n\nEpclusa 12 Weeks \n\nAll Subjects \n(n = 274) \n\nCirrhotic \n(n = 80) \n\nNon-Cirrhotic \n(n = 197) \n\nOverall 95.3% (263/274)  91.3% (73/80)  97.9% (190/194)  \n95% CI 92.9% to 98.0% 82.8% to 96.4% 92.8% to 98.6% \nSVR with Y93H 84.0% (21/25)  50.0% (2/4)  90.5% (19/21)  \n95% CI 63.9% to 95.5% 6.8% to 93.2% 69.6% to 98.8% \nSVR without Y93H 96.4% (242/249) 93.4% (71/76)  98.8% (171/173)  \n95% CI 94.3% to 98.9% 85.3% to 97.8% 95.9% to 99.9% \n \nThe NS5B NI RAV S282T was not detected in the baseline NS5B sequence of any patient in Phase 3 \nstudies.  SVR12 was achieved in all 77 patients who had baseline NS5B NI RAVs including N142T, \nL159F, E/N237G, C/M289L/I, L320F/I/V, V321A/I, and S282G+V321I. \n \nStudies in patients with decompensated cirrhosis (CPT Class B) \nAnalyses were conducted to explore the association between pre-existing baseline NS5A RAVs and \ntreatment outcome for patients with decompensated cirrhosis in one Phase 3 study (ASTRAL-4).  Of \nthe 87 patients treated with Epclusa + RBV, 85 patients were included in the analysis of NS5A RAVs; \n2 patients were excluded as they neither achieved SVR12 nor had virologic failure.  Among the \npatients who received treatment with Epclusa + RBV for 12 weeks, 29% (25/85) of patients had \nbaseline virus with NS5A RAVs: 29% (19/66), 75% (3/4), 15% (2/13), and 50% (1/2) for patients with \ngenotype 1, 2, 3 and 4 HCV, respectively. \n \nSVR12 in patients with or without baseline NS5A RAVs in the Epclusa + RBV 12 week group for this \nstudy is shown in Table 9. \n \nTable 9: SVR12 in patients with or without baseline NS5A RAVs by HCV genotype (study \nASTRAL-4) \n Epclusa + RBV 12 weeks \n\nGenotype 1 Genotype 3 Genotypes 2 or 4 Total \nWith any baseline \nNS5A RAVs 100% (19/19) 50% (1/2) 100% (4/4) 96% (24/25) \n\nWithout baseline \nNS5A RAVs 98% (46/47) 91% (10/11) 100% (2/2) 98% (58/60) \n\n \nThe single genotype 3 patient who had baseline NS5A RAVs and failed to achieve SVR12 had NS5A \nsubstitution Y93H at baseline; pharmacokinetic data from this patient was consistent with \nnon-adherence to treatment. \n \nThree patients in the Epclusa + RBV 12 week group had baseline NS5B NI RAVs (N142T and \nL159F) and all three patients achieved SVR12. \n \nCross-resistance \nIn vitro data suggests that the majority of NS5A RAVs that confer resistance to ledipasvir and \ndaclatasvir remained susceptible to velpatasvir.  Velpatasvir was fully active against the sofosbuvir \nresistance-associated substitution S282T in NS5B while all velpatasvir resistance-associated \nsubstitutions in NS5A were fully susceptible to sofosbuvir.  Both sofosbuvir and velpatasvir were fully \nactive against substitutions associated with resistance to other classes of direct-acting antivirals with \ndifferent mechanisms of actions, such as NS5B non-nucleoside inhibitors and NS3 protease inhibitors.  \nThe efficacy of Epclusa has not been assessed in patients who have previously failed treatment with \nother regimens that include an NS5A inhibitor. \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe efficacy of Epclusa was evaluated in three Phase 3 studies in patients with genotype 1 to 6 HCV \ninfection with or without compensated cirrhosis, one Phase 3 study in patients with genotype 1 to 6 \nHCV infection with decompensated cirrhosis, one Phase 3 study in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients \nwith genotype 1 to 6 HCV infection and one Phase 2 trial in patients with HCV infection and ESRD \nrequiring dialysis, as summarised in Table 10. \n \nTable 10: Studies conducted with Epclusa in patients with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 HCV \ninfection \nStudy Population Study arms \n\n(Number of patients treated) \n\nASTRAL-1 \nGenotype 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 \nTN and TE, without cirrhosis or with \ncompensated cirrhosis \n\nEpclusa 12 weeks (624) \nPlacebo 12 weeks (116) \n\nASTRAL-2 \nGenotype 2 \nTN and TE, without cirrhosis or with \ncompensated cirrhosis \n\nEpclusa 12 weeks (134) \nSOF+RBV 12 weeks (132) \n\nASTRAL-3 \nGenotype 3 \nTN and TE, without cirrhosis or with \ncompensated cirrhosis \n\nEpclusa 12 weeks (277) \nSOF+RBV 24 weeks (275) \n\nASTRAL-4 \nGenotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 \nTN and TE, with CPT Class B \ndecompensated cirrhosis  \n\nEpclusa 12 weeks (90) \nEpclusa + RBV 12 weeks (87) \nEpclusa 24 weeks (90) \n\nASTRAL-5 \n\nGenotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 \nTN and TE, without cirrhosis or with \ncompensated cirrhosis, with \nHCV/HIV-1 co-infection \n\nEpclusa 12 weeks (106) \n\nGS-US-342-4062 TN and TE with or without cirrhosis, with ESRD requiring dialysis \nEpclusa 12 weeks (59)  \n \n\nTN = treatment-naïve patients; TE = treatment-experienced patients (including those who have failed a peginterferon alfa + \nribavirin based regimen with or without an HCV protease inhibitor) \n \nThe ribavirin dose was weight-based (1,000 mg daily administered in two divided doses for patients \n< 75 kg and 1,200 mg for those ≥ 75 kg) and administered in two divided doses when used in \ncombination with sofosbuvir in the ASTRAL-2 and ASTRAL-3 studies or in combination with \nEpclusa in the ASTRAL-4 study.  Ribavirin dose adjustments were performed according to the \nribavirin prescribing information.  Serum HCV RNA values were measured during the clinical studies \nusing the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS Taqman HCV test (version 2.0) with a lower limit of \nquantification (LLOQ) of 15 IU/mL.  Sustained virologic response (SVR12), defined as HCV RNA \nless than LLOQ at 12 weeks after the cessation of treatment, was the primary endpoint to determine \nthe HCV cure rate. \n \nClinical studies in patients without cirrhosis and patients with compensated cirrhosis \nGenotype 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 HCV-infected adults – ASTRAL-1 (study 1138) \nASTRAL-1 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 12 weeks of \ntreatment with Epclusa compared with 12 weeks of placebo in patients with genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 \nHCV infection.  Patients with genotype 1, 2, 4 or 6 HCV infection were randomised in a 5:1 ratio to \ntreatment with Epclusa for 12 weeks or placebo for 12 weeks.  Patients with genotype 5 HCV \ninfection were enrolled to the Epclusa group.  Randomisation was stratified by HCV genotype (1, 2, 4, \n6, and indeterminate) and the presence or absence of cirrhosis. \n \nDemographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between the Epclusa and placebo group.  Of \nthe 740 treated patients, the median age was 56 years (range: 18 to 82); 60% of the patients were male; \n79% were White, 9% were Black; 21% had a baseline body mass index of at least 30 kg/m2; the \nproportions of patients with genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 HCV infection were 53%, 17%, 19%, 5% and \n7%, respectively; 69% had non-CC IL28B alleles (CT or TT); 74% had baseline HCV RNA levels of \nat least 800,000 IU/mL; 19% had compensated cirrhosis; and 32% were treatment-experienced. \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nTable 11 presents the SVR12 for the ASTRAL-1 study by HCV genotypes.

The proportions of patients with genotype 1, 2, \n3, 4, 6 or indeterminate HCV infection were 42%, 12%, 27%, 7% , 3%, and 9%, respectively.  At \nbaseline, 29% of patients had cirrhosis, 22% were treatment experienced, 32% had received a kidney \ntransplant, 92% were on haemodialysis, and 8% were on peritoneal dialysis; mean duration on dialysis \nwas 7.3 years (range: 0 to 40 years).  The overall SVR rate was 95% (56/59); of the three patients that \ndid not achieve SVR12, one had completed Epclusa treatment and relapsed and two did not meet \nvirologic failure criteria. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nEpclusa in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nElderly \nClinical studies of Epclusa included 156 patients aged 65 and over (12% of total number of patients in \nthe Phase 3 clinical studies).  The response rates observed for patients ≥ 65 years of age were similar \nto that of patients < 65 years of age, across treatment groups. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of sofosbuvir, GS-331007 and velpatasvir have been evaluated in \nhealthy adult subjects and in patients with chronic hepatitis C.  Following oral administration of \nEpclusa, sofosbuvir was absorbed quickly and the peak median plasma concentration was observed \n1 hour post-dose.  Median peak plasma concentration of GS-331007 was observed 3 hours post-dose.  \nVelpatasvir median peak concentrations were observed at 3 hours post-dose. \n \nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected patients, mean steady-state \nAUC0-24 for sofosbuvir (n = 982), GS-331007 (n = 1,428) and velpatasvir (n = 1,425) were 1,260, \n13,970 and 2,970 ng•h/mL, respectively.  Steady-state Cmax for sofosbuvir, GS-331007 and velpatasvir \nwere 566, 868 and 259 ng/mL, respectively.  Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUC0-24 and Cmax were \nsimilar in healthy adult subjects and patients with HCV infection.  Relative to healthy subjects \n(n = 331), velpatasvir AUC0-24 and Cmax were 37% lower and 41% lower, respectively in HCV-infected \npatients. \n \nEffects of food \nRelative to fasting conditions, the administration of a single dose of Epclusa with a moderate fat \n(~600 kcal, 30% fat) or high fat (~800 kcal, 50% fat) meal resulted in a 34% and 21% increase in \nvelpatasvir AUC0-inf, respectively, and a 31% and 5% increase in velpatasvir Cmax, respectively.  The \nmoderate or high fat meal increased sofosbuvir AUC0-inf by 60% and 78%, respectively, but did not \nsubstantially affect the sofosbuvir Cmax.  The moderate or high fat meal did not alter GS-331007 \nAUC0-inf, but resulted in a 25% and 37% decrease in its Cmax, respectively.  The response rates in \nPhase 3 studies were similar in HCV-infected patients who received Epclusa with food or without \nfood.  Epclusa can be administered without regard to food. \n \nDistribution \nSofosbuvir is approximately 61-65% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding is independent \nof drug concentration over the range of 1 µg/mL to 20 µg/mL.  Protein binding of GS-331007 was \nminimal in human plasma.  After a single 400 mg dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir in healthy subjects, the \nblood to plasma ratio of [14C]-radioactivity was approximately 0.7. \n \nVelpatasvir is > 99.5% bound to human plasma proteins and binding is independent of drug \nconcentration over the range of 0.09 µg/mL to 1.8 µg/mL.  After a single 100 mg dose of \n[14C]-velpatasvir in healthy subjects, the blood to plasma ratio of [14C]-radioactivity ranged between \n0.52 and 0.67. \n \nBiotransformation \nSofosbuvir is extensively metabolised in the liver to form the pharmacologically active nucleoside \nanalog triphosphate GS-461203.  The metabolic activation pathway involves sequential hydrolysis of \nthe carboxyl ester moiety catalysed by human cathepsin A (CatA) or carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) and \nphosphoramidate cleavage by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) followed by \nphosphorylation by the pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway.  Dephosphorylation results in the \nformation of nucleoside metabolite GS-331007 that cannot be efficiently rephosphorylated and lacks \nanti-HCV activity in vitro.  Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 are not substrates or inhibitors of UGT1A1 or \nCYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 enzymes.  After a single \n400 mg oral dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir, GS-331007 accounted for approximately > 90% of total \nsystemic exposure. \n \nVelpatasvir is a substrate of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4 with slow turnover.  Following a single \ndose of 100 mg [14C]-velpatasvir, the majority (> 98%) of radioactivity in plasma was parent drug.  \nThe monohydroxylated and desmethylated velpatasvir were the metabolites identified in human \nplasma.  Unchanged velpatasvir is the major species present in faeces. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nElimination \nFollowing a single 400 mg oral dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir, mean total recovery of the [14C]-radioactivity \nwas greater than 92%, consisting of approximately 80%, 14%, and 2.5% recovered in urine, faeces, \nand expired air, respectively.  The majority of the sofosbuvir dose recovered in urine was GS-331007 \n(78%) while 3.5% was recovered as sofosbuvir.  These data indicate that renal clearance is the major \nelimination pathway for GS-331007.  The median terminal half-lives of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 \nfollowing administration of Epclusa were 0.5 and 25 hours, respectively. \n \nFollowing a single 100 mg oral dose of [14C]-velpatasvir, mean total recovery of the \n[14C]-radioactivity was 95%, consisting of approximately 94% and 0.4% recovered from the faeces \nand urine, respectively.  Unchanged velpatasvir was the major species in faeces accounting for a mean \nof 77% of the administered dose, followed by monohydroxylated velpatasvir (5.9%) and \ndesmethylated velpatasvir (3.0%).  These data indicate that biliary excretion of parent drug was a \nmajor route of elimination for velpatasvir.  The median terminal half-life of velpatasvir following \nadministration of Epclusa was approximately 15 hours. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nVelpatasvir AUC increases in a nearly dose proportional manner over the dose range of 25 mg to \n150 mg.  Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUCs are near dose-proportional over the dose range of 200 mg \nto 1,200 mg. \n \nIn vitro potential for sofosbuvir/velpatasvir drug-drug interactions \nSofosbuvir and velpatasvir are substrates of drug transporters P-gp and BCRP while GS-331007 is not.  \nVelpatasvir is also a substrate of OATP1B.  In vitro, slow metabolic turnover of velpatasvir by \nCYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4 was observed. \n \nVelpatasvir is an inhibitor of drug transporter P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 and its \ninvolvement in drug interactions with these transporters is primarily limited to the process of \nabsorption.  At clinically relevant plasma concentration, velpatasvir is not an inhibitor of hepatic \ntransporters bile salt export pump (BSEP), sodium taurocholate cotransporter protein (NTCP), \nOATP2B1, OATP1A2 or organic cation transporter (OCT) 1, renal transporters OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, \nmultidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) or multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE) 1, \nor CYP or uridine glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 enzymes. \n \nSofosbuvir and GS-331007 are not inhibitors of drug transporters P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, BSEP, \nOATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OCT1.  GS-331007 is not an inhibitor of OAT1, OCT2, and MATE1. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \nRace and gender \nNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to race or gender have been identified for \nsofosbuvir, GS-331007 or velpatasvir. \n \nElderly \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected patients showed that within the age range (18 to \n82 years) analysed, age did not have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure to sofosbuvir, \nGS-331007, or velpatasvir. \n \nRenal impairment \nA summary of the effect of varying degrees of renal impairment (RI) on the exposures of the \ncomponents of Epclusa compared to subjects with normal renal function, as described in the text \nbelow, are provided in Table 19.  \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nTable 19: Effect of Varying Degrees of Renal Impairment on Exposures (AUC) of Sofosbuvir, \nGS-331007, and Velpatasvir Compared to Subjects with Normal Renal Function \n HCV-Negative Subjects HCV-Infected \n\nSubjects \nMild RI \n\n(eGFR ≥50 \nand <80 \n\nmL/min/1.7\n3m2) \n\nModerate RI \n(eGFR ≥30 \n\nand <50 \nmL/min/1.73\n\nm2) \n\nSevere RI \n(eGFR <30 \nmL/min/1.7\n\n3m2) \n\nESRD Requiring \nDialysis \n\nSevere RI \n(eGFR \n\n<30 \nmL/min/1.\n\n73m2) \n\nESRD \nRequiring \nDialysis Dosed 1 \n\nhr Before \nDialysis \n\nDosed 1 \nhr After \nDialysis \n\nSofosbuvir 1.6-fold↑ 2.1-fold↑ 2.7-fold↑ 1.3-fold↑ 1.6-fold↑ ~2-fold↑ 1.8-fold↑ \nGS-331007 1.6-fold↑ 1.9-fold↑ 5.5-fold↑ ≥10-fold↑ ≥20-fold↑ ~7-fold↑ 18-fold↑ \nVelpatasvir - - 1.5-fold↑ - - - 1.4-fold↑ \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir was studied in HCV negative patients with mild (eGFR ≥ 50 and \n< 80 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (eGFR ≥ 30 and < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2), severe renal impairment \n(eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and patients with ESRD requiring haemodialysis following a single \n400 mg dose of sofosbuvir, relative to patients with normal renal function \n(eGFR > 80 mL/min/1.73 m2).  GS-331007 is efficiently removed by haemodialysis with an extraction \ncoefficient of approximately 53%.  Following a single 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir, a 4 hour \nhaemodialysis removed 18% of administered dose. \n \nIn HCV-infected patients with severe renal impairment treated with sofosbuvir 200 mg with ribavirin \n(n=10) or sofosbuvir 400 mg with ribavirin (n=10) for 24 weeks or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 90/400 mg \n(n=18) for 12 weeks, the pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 were consistent with that \nobserved in HCV negative patients with severe renal impairment. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of velpatasvir was studied with a single dose of 100 mg velpatasvir in HCV \nnegative patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault).   \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir, GS-331007, and velpatasvir were studied in HCV-infected \npatients with ESRD requiring dialysis treated with Epclusa (n=59) for 12 weeks, and compared to \npatients without renal impairment in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir Phase 2/3 trials. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir was studied following 7-day dosing of 400 mg sofosbuvir in \nHCV-infected patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (CPT Class B and C).  Relative \nto patients with normal hepatic function, the sofosbuvir AUC0-24 was 126% and 143% higher in \nmoderate and severe hepatic impairment, while the GS-331007 AUC0-24 was 18% and 9% higher, \nrespectively.  Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected patients indicated that cirrhosis \n(including decompensated cirrhosis) had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure to sofosbuvir \nand GS-331007. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of velpatasvir was studied with a single dose of 100 mg velpatasvir in HCV \nnegative patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (CPT Class B and C).  Compared to \nsubjects with normal hepatic function velpatasvir total plasma exposure (AUCinf) was similar in \npatients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.  Population pharmacokinetics analysis in \nHCV-infected patients indicated that cirrhosis (including decompensated cirrhosis) had no clinically \nrelevant effect on the exposure to velpatasvir (see section 4.2).  \n \nBody weight \nBody weight did not have a clinically significant effect on sofosbuvir or velpatasvir exposure \naccording to a population pharmacokinetic analysis. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir, GS-331007 and velpatasvir in paediatric patients have not been \nestablished (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSofosbuvir \nExposure to sofosbuvir in rodent studies could not be detected likely due to high esterase activity and \nexposure to the major metabolite GS-331007 was instead used to estimate exposure margins. \n \nSofosbuvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial \nmutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo mouse \nmicronucleus assays.  No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat and rabbit developmental \ntoxicity studies with sofosbuvir.  Sofosbuvir had no adverse effects on behaviour, reproduction, or \ndevelopment of the offspring in the rat pre- and post-natal development study. \n \nSofosbuvir was not a carcinogen in the 2-year mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies at GS-331007 \nexposures up to 15 and 9 times, respectively, higher than human exposure. \n \nVelpatasvir \nVelpatasvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial \nmutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo rat \nmicronucleus assays. \n \nVelpatasvir was not carcinogenic in the 6-month rasH2 transgenic mouse and 2-year rat \ncarcinogenicity studies at exposures at least 50-times and 5-times higher than human exposure, \nrespectively. \n \nVelpatasvir had no adverse effects on mating and fertility.  No teratogenic effects were observed in the \nmouse and rat developmental toxicity studies with velpatasvir at AUC exposures approximately \n31- and 6-fold higher, respectively, than the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose.  \nHowever, a possible teratogenic effect was indicated in rabbits where an increase in total visceral \nmalformations was seen in exposed animals at AUC exposures up to 0.7 fold the human exposure at \nrecommended clinical dose.  The human relevance of this finding is not known.  Velpatasvir had no \nadverse effects on behaviour, reproduction, or development of the offspring in the rat pre- and \npost-natal development study at AUC exposures approximately 5-fold higher than the human exposure \nat the recommended clinical dose. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nEpclusa 400 mg/100 mg film-coated tablets \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring.  This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information.  You can help by reporting any side effects you may get.  See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet.  You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only.  Do not pass it on to others.  It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet.  See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Epclusa is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Epclusa \n3. How to take Epclusa \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Epclusa \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Epclusa is and what it is used for \n \nEpclusa is a medicine that contains the active substances sofosbuvir and velpatasvir in a single tablet.  \nIt is given to treat a chronic (long-term) viral infection of the liver called hepatitis C in adults of \n18 years and older. \n \nThe active substances in this medicine work together by blocking two different proteins that the virus \nneeds to grow and reproduce itself, allowing the infection to be permanently eliminated from the body. \n \nEpclusa is sometimes taken with another medicine, ribavirin. \n \nIt is very important that you also read the leaflets for the other medicines that you will be taking with \nEpclusa.  If you have any questions about your medicines, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Epclusa \n \nDo not take Epclusa \n• If you are allergic to sofosbuvir, velpatasvir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6 of this leaflet). \n \n If this applies to you, do not take Epclusa and tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \n• If you are currently taking any of the following medicines: \n\n• rifampicin and rifabutin (antibiotics used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); \n• St. John’s wort (herbal medicine used to treat depression); \n• carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (medicines used to treat epilepsy and \n\nprevent seizures). \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor if you: \n• have liver problems other than from hepatitis C, for instance \n\n• if you have a current or previous infection with the hepatitis B virus, since your doctor \nmay want to monitor you more closely; \n\n• if you have had a liver transplant \n• have kidney problems or if you are on kidney dialysis, since Epclusa has not been fully \n\ntested in patients with some severe kidney problems; \n• are taking treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, since your doctor \n\nmay want to monitor you more closely. \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Epclusa if: \n• you currently take, or have taken in the last few months, the medicine amiodarone to treat \n\nirregular heartbeats, as it may result in a life-threatening slowing of your heart beat. Your doctor \nmay consider alternative treatments if you have taken this medicine. If treatment with Epclusa is \nneeded, you may require additional heart monitoring. \n\n• you have diabetes. You may need closer monitoring of your blood glucose levels and/or \nadjustment of your diabetes medication after starting Epclusa. Some diabetic patients have \nexperienced low sugar levels in the blood (hypoglycaemia) after starting treatment with \nmedicines like Epclusa. \n\n \nTell your doctor immediately if you currently take, or have taken in the last months any medicines \nfor heart problems and during treatment you experience: \n• slow or irregular heartbeat, or heart rhythm problems; \n• shortness of breath or worsening of existing shortness of breath; \n• chest pain; \n• light-headedness; \n• palpitations; \n• near fainting or fainting. \n \nBlood tests \nYour doctor will test your blood before, during and after your treatment with Epclusa.  This is so that: \n• Your doctor can decide if you should take Epclusa and for how long; \n• Your doctor can confirm that your treatment has worked and you are free of the hepatitis C \n\nvirus. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age.  The use of Epclusa in \nchildren and adolescents has not yet been studied. \n \nOther medicines and Epclusa \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nWarfarin and other similar medicines called vitamin K antagonists used to thin the blood.  Your doctor \nmay need to increase the frequency of your blood tests to check how well your blood can clot. \n \nYour liver function may change with treatment of hepatitis C and therefore may affect other \nmedications (e.g. medicines used to suppress your immune system, etc.). Your doctor may need to \nclosely monitor these other medicines you are taking and make adjustments after starting Epclusa. \n \nIf you are not sure talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\nSome medicines should not be taken with Epclusa. \n \n• Do not take any other medicine that contains sofosbuvir, one of the active substances in \n\nEpclusa. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the medicines below: \n \n• amiodarone used to treat irregular heartbeats; \n• rifapentine (antibiotic used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); \n• oxcarbazepine (medicine used to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures); \n• tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or any medicine containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, used \n\nto treat HIV infection; \n• efavirenz used to treat HIV infection; \n• digoxin used to treat heart conditions; \n• dabigatran used to thin the blood; \n• modafinil used to treat sleep disorders; \n• rosuvastatin or other statins used to treat high cholesterol. \nTaking Epclusa with any of these may stop your medicines from working properly, or make any side \neffects worse.  Your doctor may need to give you a different medicine or adjust the dose of medicine \nyou are taking.  This change could be to Epclusa or another medicine you are taking. \n \n• Get advice from a doctor or pharmacist if you take medicines used to treat stomach ulcers, \n\nheartburn or acid reflux as they can decrease the amount of velpatasvir in your blood.  These \nmedicines include: \n• antacids (such as aluminium/magnesium hydroxide or calcium carbonate).  These should \n\nbe taken at least 4 hours before or 4 hours after Epclusa; \n• proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole and \n\nesomeprazole).  Epclusa should be taken with food 4 hours before using a proton pump \ninhibitor. \n\n• H2-receptor antagonists (such as famotidine, cimetidine, nizatidine or ranitidine).  If you \nneed high doses of these medicines your doctor may give you a different medicine instead \nor adjust the dose of the medicine you are taking. \n\nThese medicines can decrease the amount of velpatasvir in your blood.  If you are taking one of these \nmedicines your doctor will either give you a different medicine for stomach ulcers, heartburn or acid \nreflux, or recommend how and when you take that medicine. \n \nPregnancy and contraception \nThe effects of Epclusa during pregnancy are not known.  If you are pregnant, think you may be \npregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nEpclusa is sometimes used together with ribavirin.  Ribavirin can harm your unborn baby.  It is \ntherefore very important that you (or your partner) do not become pregnant during this treatment or for \na period of time after completing treatment.  You must read the “Pregnancy” section in the ribavirin \npackage leaflet very carefully.  Ask your doctor for effective contraception method suitable for you \nand your partner. \n \nBreast-feeding \nDo not breast-feed during treatment with Epclusa.  It is not known whether sofosbuvir or \nvelpatasvir, the two active substances of Epclusa, pass into human breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nEpclusa should not affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machinery. \n \n \n\n\n\n40 \n\n3. How to take Epclusa \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.  Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nRecommended dose \nThe recommended dose is one tablet once a day for 12 weeks. \n \nSwallow the tablet whole with or without food.  Do not chew, crush or split the tablet as it has a very \nbitter taste. \n \nIf you are taking an antacid, take it at least 4 hours before or at least 4 hours after Epclusa. \n \nIf you are taking a proton pump inhibitor, take Epclusa with food 4 hours before using a proton \npump inhibitor. \n \nIf you are sick (vomit) after taking Epclusa it may affect the amount of Epclusa in your blood.  This \nmay make Epclusa work less well. \n• If you are sick (vomit) less than 3 hours after taking Epclusa, take another tablet. \n• If you are sick (vomit) more than 3 hours after taking Epclusa, you do not need to take \n\nanother tablet until your next scheduled tablet. \n \nIf you take more Epclusa than you should \nIf you accidentally take more than the recommended dose you should contact your doctor or nearest \nemergency department immediately for advice.  Keep the tablet bottle with you so that you can easily \ndescribe what you have taken. \n \nIf you forget to take Epclusa \nIt is important not to miss a dose of this medicine. \n \nIf you do miss a dose, work out how long it is since you last took your Epclusa: \n• If you notice within 18 hours of the time you usually take Epclusa, you must take the tablet as \n\nsoon as possible.  Then take the next dose at your usual time. \n• If it’s 18 hours or more after the time you usually take Epclusa, wait and take the next dose at \n\nyour usual time.  Do not take a double dose (two doses close together). \n \nDo not stop taking Epclusa \nDo not stop taking this medicine unless your doctor tells you to.  It is very important that you complete \nthe full course of treatment to give the medicine the best chance to treat your hepatitis C virus \ninfection. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n\n\n\n41 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine may cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nCommon side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n• rash \n \nUncommon side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n• swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat (angioedema). \n \nOther effects that may be seen during treatment with sofosbuvir: \nThe frequency of the following side effects is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n• a wide spread severe rash with peeling skin which may be accompanied by fever, flu like \n\nsymptoms, blisters in the mouth, eyes, and/or genitals (Stevens Johnson syndrome). \n \n If you get any side effects tell your doctor. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet.  You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V.  By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Epclusa \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the bottle and carton after “EXP”.  \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nThis medicine does not require any special storage conditions. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.  Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use.  These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n \n6.

The review \nidentified 40 valid cases, of which 31 occurred after 5 March 2015, when warnings regarding \nbradyarrhythmia were implemented. Of these, 5 cases involved discontinuation of amiodarone prior to \ninitiation of the sofosbuvir-containing regimen. While this suggests that some physicians are aware of \nthe risk of bradyarrhythmia and discontinue amiodarone prior to initiation of the sofosbuvir-containing \nproducts, not all physicians appear to take into account the long half-life of amiodarone, despite the \nexisting labelling. \n\nOf note, two cases reported discontinuation of amiodarone on the day of starting the sofosbuvir-\ncontaining regimen, which would result in significant levels of amiodarone still being present in the \npatient’s plasma while on sofosbuvir. In the instances where amiodarone is coadministered, the \nreasons for coadministration were not reported in the majority of cases. However, when reported, \nprescribing error, patient error, medical need or the hepatologist not being aware of concomitant \namiodarone treatment were cited as reasons for the concomitant use. In this context, it was considered \nthat warnings regarding bradyarrhythmia and the recommendation of cardiac monitoring should be \nstrengthened. \n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\n \n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for sofosbuvir / velpatasvir the CHMP is of the opinion that \nthe benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing sofosbuvir / velpatasvir is unchanged \nsubject to the proposed changes to the product information \n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
