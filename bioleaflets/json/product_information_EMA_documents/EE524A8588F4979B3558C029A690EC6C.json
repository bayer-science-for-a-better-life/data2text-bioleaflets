NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nVentavis 10 microgram/ml nebuliser solution \nVentavis 20 microgram/ml nebuliser solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nVentavis 10 microgram/ml nebuliser solution \n1 ml solution contains 10 microgram iloprost (as iloprost trometamol).  \nEach ampoule with 1 ml solution contains 10 microgram iloprost. \nEach ampoule with 2 ml solution contains 20 microgram iloprost.  \n \nVentavis 20 microgram/ml nebuliser solution \n1 ml solution contains 20 microgram iloprost (as iloprost trometamol).  \nEach ampoule with 1 ml solution contains 20 microgram iloprost. \n \nExcipient with known effect \n• Ventavis 10 microgram/ml:  \n\nEach ml contains 0.81 mg ethanol 96% (equivalent to 0.75 mg ethanol) \n• Ventavis 20 microgram/ml:  \n\nEach ml contains 1.62 mg ethanol 96% (equivalent to 1.50 mg ethanol). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nNebuliser solution. \n \nVentavis 10 microgram/ml nebuliser solution \nClear, colourless solution. \n \nVentavis 20 microgram/ml nebuliser solution \nClear, colourless to slightly yellowish solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of adult patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, classified as NYHA functional \nclass III, to improve exercise capacity and symptoms.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nDrug product Suitable inhalation device (nebuliser) to be used \n\nVentavis 10 microgram/ml Breelib I-Neb AAD Venta-Neb  \n\nVentavis 20 microgram/ml Breelib I-Neb AAD  \n \nVentavis should only be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the treatment of \npulmonary hypertension. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPosology \n \nDose per inhalation session \nAt initiation of Ventavis treatment the first inhaled dose should be 2.5 microgram iloprost as \ndelivered at the mouthpiece of the nebuliser. If this dose is well tolerated, dosing should be increased \nto 5 microgram iloprost and maintained at that dose. In case of poor tolerability of the 5 microgram \ndose, the dose should be reduced to 2.5 microgram iloprost. \n \nDaily dose \nThe dose per inhalation session should be administered 6 to 9 times per day according to the \nindividual need and tolerability. \n \nDuration of treatment \nThe duration of treatment depends on clinical status and is left to the physician’s discretion. Should \npatients deteriorate on this treatment intravenous prostacyclin treatment should be considered. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nIloprost elimination is reduced in patients with hepatic dysfunction (see section 5.2). \n \nTo avoid undesired accumulation over the day, special caution has to be exercised with these patients \nduring initial dose titration. Initially, doses of 2.5 microgram iloprost should be administered using \nVentavis 10 microgram/ml with dosing intervals of 3-4 hours (corresponds to administration of max. \n6 times per day). Thereafter, dosing intervals may be shortened cautiously based on individual \ntolerability. If a dose up to 5 microgram iloprost is indicated, again dosing intervals of 3-4 hours \nshould be chosen initially and shortened according to individual tolerability. An accumulation of \niloprost following treatment over several days is not likely due to the overnight break in \nadministration of the medicinal product. \n \nRenal impairment \nThere is no need for dose adaptation in patients with a creatinine clearance >30 ml/min (as \ndetermined from serum creatinine using the Cockroft and Gault formula). Patients with a creatinine \nclearance of ≤30 ml/min were not investigated in the clinical trials. Data with intravenously \nadministered iloprost indicated that the elimination is reduced in patients with renal failure requiring \ndialysis. Therefore, the same dosing recommendations as in patients with hepatic impairment (see \nabove) are to be applied. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Ventavis in children aged up to 18 years have not been established. \nNo data from controlled clinical trials are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nVentavis is intended for inhalation use by nebulisation.  \n \nTo minimize accidental exposure it is recommended to keep the room well ventilated. \n \nThe ready-to-use Ventavis nebuliser solution is administered with a suitable inhalation device \n(nebuliser) (see below and section 6.6).  \nPatients stabilised on one nebuliser should not switch to another nebuliser without supervision by the \ntreating physician as different nebulisers have been shown to produce aerosols with slightly different \nphysical characteristics and delivery of the solution that may be faster (see section 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n• Breelib \n \nBreelib is a small handheld, battery-powered, breath activated, vibrating mesh technology system. \n \nVentavis 10 microgram/ml (1 ml ampoule) and Ventavis 20 microgram/ml nebuliser solution \n \nVentavis 10 microgram/ml nebuliser solution (1 ml ampoule) delivers 2.5 microgram and Ventavis 20 \nmicrogram/ml nebuliser solution delivers 5 microgram at the mouthpiece of the Breelib nebuliser. \n \nAt initiation of Ventavis treatment or if the patient is switched from an alternative device, the first \ninhalation should be made with 1 ml ampoule of Ventavis 10 microgram/ml (see section 4.4). If \ninhalation with Ventavis 10 microgram/ml is well tolerated, the dose should be increased by using \nVentavis 20 microgram/ml. This dose should be maintained. In case of poor tolerability of Ventavis \n20 microgram/ml, the dose should be reduced by using 1 ml ampoule of Ventavis 10 microgram/ml \n(see section 4.4). \n \nThe duration of an inhalation session with Breelib nebuliser is approximately 3 minutes, which \nreflects the higher delivery rate of the Breelib compared to other nebulisers. \n \nPatients initiating Ventavis treatment or switching from an alternative device to Breelib should be \nclosely supervised by the treating physician to ensure that dose and speed of inhalation are well \ntolerated. \n \nWhen using the Breelib nebuliser please follow the instructions for use provided with the device. \nFill the medication chamber with Ventavis immediately before use. \n \n• I-Neb AAD \n \nThe I-Neb AAD system is a portable, hand-held, vibrating mesh technology nebuliser system. This \nsystem generates droplets by ultrasound, which forces the solution through a mesh. The I-Neb AAD \nnebuliser has been shown to be suitable for the administration of Ventavis 10 microgram/ml (1 ml \nampoule) and 20 microgram/ml nebuliser solution. The Mass Median Aerodynamic Diameter \n(MMAD) of the aerosol measured using I-Neb nebulising systems equipped with power level 10 disc \nwas similar between Ventavis 20 microgram/ml (golden programme) and Ventavis 10 microgram/ml \n(purple programme) nebuliser solutions (i.e.: around 2 micrometres) but with faster delivery when \nusing Ventavis 20 microgram/ml.  \n \nThe dose delivered by the I-Neb AAD system is controlled by the medication chamber in combination \nwith a control disc. Each medication chamber is colour coded and has a corresponding colour coded \ncontrol disc. \n \nVentavis 10 microgram/ml nebuliser solution (1 ml ampoule) \n \nAt initiation of Ventavis treatment with I-Neb system the first inhaled dose should be 2.5 microgram \niloprost as delivered at the mouthpiece of the nebuliser using 1 ml ampoule of Ventavis \n10 microgram/ml. If this dose is well tolerated, dosing should be increased to 5 microgram iloprost \nusing 1 ml ampoule of Ventavis 10 microgram/ml and maintained at that dose. In case of poor \ntolerability of the 5 microgram dose, the dose should be reduced to 2.5 microgram iloprost. \n \nThis nebuliser monitors the breathing pattern to determine the aerosol pulse time required to deliver \nthe pre-set dose of 2.5 or 5 microgram iloprost.  \nFor the 2.5 microgram dose of Ventavis 10 microgram/ml the medication chamber with the red \ncoloured latch is used together with the red control disc.  \nFor the 5 microgram dose of Ventavis 10 microgram/ml the medication chamber with the purple \ncoloured latch is used together with the purple control disc. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nFor each inhalation session with the I-Neb AAD, the content of one 1 ml ampoule of Ventavis \n10 microgram/ml, with two coloured rings (white - yellow), is transferred into the medication \nchamber immediately before use. \n\n \n\nDrug \nproduct \n\nAmpoule  \ncoloured ring Dosage \n\nI-Neb AAD Estimated \ninhalation \ntime Medication \n\nchamber latch \nControl \ndisc \n\nVentavis \n10 mcg/ml \n\n1 ml ampoule \nwhite - yellow ring \n\n2.5 mcg red red 3.2 min \n\n5 mcg purple purple 6.5 min \n \nVentavis 20 microgram/ml nebuliser solution \n \nOnly patients who are maintained at the 5 microgram dose and who have repeatedly experienced \nextended inhalation times with Ventavis 10 microgram/ml, which could result in incomplete \ninhalation, may be considered suitable for switching to Ventavis 20 microgram/ml. \n \nClose supervision by the treating physician is necessary if switching from Ventavis 10 microgram/ml \nto Ventavis 20 microgram/ml to control the acute tolerance relating to faster delivery rate of iloprost \nwith the double concentration. \n \nThis nebuliser monitors the breathing pattern to determine the aerosol pulse time required to deliver \nthe pre-set dose of 5 microgram iloprost.  \nFor the 5 microgram dose of Ventavis 20 microgram/ml the medication chamber with the gold \ncoloured latch is used together with the gold control disc. \n \nFor each inhalation session with the I-Neb AAD, the content of one 1 ml ampoule of Ventavis \n20 microgram/ml with two coloured rings (yellow - red), is transferred into the medication chamber \nimmediately before use. \n \n\nDrug product Ampoule  coloured rings Dosage \nI-Neb AAD \n\nMedication \nchamber latch Control disc \n\nVentavis \n20 mcg/ml \n\n1 ml ampoule \nyellow - red ring 5 mcg golden  golden  \n\n \n• Venta-Neb \n \nVenta-Neb, a portable ultrasonic battery-powered nebuliser, has been shown to be suitable for the \nadministration of Ventavis 10 microgram/ml nebuliser solution (2 ml ampoule). The measured \nMMAD of the aerosol droplets was 2.6 micrometres.  \n \nAt initiation of Ventavis treatment with Venta-Neb the first inhaled dose should be 2.5 microgram \niloprost as delivered at the mouthpiece of the nebuliser using 2 ml ampoule of Ventavis \n10 microgram/ml. If this dose is well tolerated, dosing should be increased to 5 microgram iloprost \nusing 2 ml ampoule of Ventavis 10 microgram/ml and maintained at that dose. In case of poor \ntolerability of the 5 microgram dose, the dose should be reduced to 2.5 microgram iloprost. \n \nFor each inhalation session with the Venta-Neb, the content of one 2 ml ampoule of Ventavis \n10 microgram/ml with two coloured rings (white – pink) is transferred into the nebuliser medication \nchamber immediately before use.  \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nTwo programmes can be operated: \nP1 Programme 1: 5 microgram active substance on the mouth piece 25 inhalation cycles. \nP2 Programme 2: 2.5 microgram active substance on the mouth piece 10 inhalation cycles. \nThe selection of the pre-set programme is made by the physician. \n \nVenta-Neb prompts the patient to inhale by an optical and an acoustic signal. It stops after the pre-set \ndose has been administered. \nTo obtain the optimal droplet size for the administration of Ventavis 10 microgram/ml nebuliser \nsolution the green baffle plate should be used. For details refer to the instruction manual of the Venta-\nNeb nebuliser. \n \n\nDrug product \nAmpoule \n\ncoloured ring \nDose of iloprost at \nmouthpiece \n\nEstimated inhalation \ntime \n\nVentavis 10 mcg/ml 2 ml ampoule white - pink ring \n2.5 mcg \n5 mcg \n\n4 min \n8 min \n\n \nOther nebulising systems \n \nThe efficacy and tolerability of inhaled iloprost when administered with other nebulising systems, \nwhich provide different nebulisation characteristics of iloprost solution, have not been established. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n− Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n− Conditions where the effects of Ventavis on platelets might increase the risk of haemorrhage \n\n(e.g. active peptic ulcers, trauma, intracranial haemorrhage). \n− Severe coronary heart disease or unstable angina. \n− Myocardial infarction within the last six months.  \n− Decompensated cardiac failure if not under close medical supervision. \n− Severe arrhythmias. \n− Cerebrovascular events (e.g. transient ischaemic attack, stroke) within the last 3 months. \n− Pulmonary hypertension due to venous occlusive disease. \n− Congenital or acquired valvular defects with clinically relevant myocardial function disorders \n\nnot related to pulmonary hypertension. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe use of Ventavis is not recommended in patients with unstable pulmonary hypertension, with \nadvanced right heart failure. In case of deterioration or worsening of right heart failure transfer to \nother medicinal products should be considered. \n \nHypotension \n \nBlood pressure should be checked while initiating Ventavis. In patients with low systemic blood \npressure and in patients with postural hypotension or receiving medicinal products known to reduce \nblood pressure levels, care should be taken to avoid further hypotension. Ventavis should not be \ninitiated in patients with systolic blood pressure less than 85 mmHg.  \nPhysicians should be alerted to the presence of concomitant conditions or medicinal products that \nmight increase the risk of hypotension and syncope (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nSyncope \n \nThe pulmonary vasodilatory effect of inhaled iloprost is of short duration (one to two hours). \nSyncope is a common symptom of the disease itself and can also occur under therapy. Patients who \nexperience syncope in association with pulmonary hypertension should avoid any exceptional \nstraining, for example during physical exertion. Before physical exertion it might be useful to inhale. \nThe increased occurrence of syncope can reflect therapeutic gaps, insufficient effectiveness and/or \ndeterioration of the disease. The need to adapt and/or change the therapy should be considered (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nPatients with diseases of the respiratory tract \n \nVentavis inhalation might entail the risk of inducing bronchospasm, especially in patients with \nbronchial hyperactivity (see section 4.8). Moreover, the benefit of Ventavis has not been established \nin patients with concomitant Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and severe asthma. \nPatients with concomitant acute pulmonary infections, COPD and severe asthma should be carefully \nmonitored.  \n \nPulmonary veno-occlusive disease \n \nPulmonary vasodilators may significantly worsen the cardiovascular status of patients with pulmonary \nveno-occlusive disease. Should signs of pulmonary oedema occur, the possibility of associated \npulmonary veno-occlusive disease should be considered and treatment with Ventavis should be \ndiscontinued. \n \nInterruption of therapy \n \nIn case of interruption of Ventavis therapy, the risk of rebound effect is not formally excluded. \nCareful monitoring of the patient should be performed when inhaled iloprost therapy is stopped and \nan alternative treatment should be considered in critically ill patients. \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \n \nData with intravenously administered iloprost indicated that the elimination is reduced in patients \nwith hepatic dysfunction and in patients with renal failure requiring dialysis (see section 5.2). A \ncautious initial dose titration using dosing intervals of 3-4 hours is recommended (see section 4.2). \n \nSerum glucose levels \n \nProlonged oral treatment with iloprost clathrate in dogs up to one year was associated with slightly \nincreased fasted serum glucose levels. It cannot be excluded that this is also relevant to humans on \nprolonged Ventavis therapy.  \n \nUndesirable exposure to Ventavis \n \nTo minimise accidental exposure, it is recommended to use Ventavis with nebulisers with inhalation-\ntriggered systems (such as Breelib or I-Neb), and to keep the room well ventilated. \nNewborns, infants and pregnant women should not be subjected to Ventavis in the room air. \n \nSkin and eye contact, oral ingestion \n \nVentavis nebuliser solution should not come into contact with skin and eyes; oral ingestion of \nVentavis solution should be avoided. During nebulisation sessions a facial mask must be avoided and \nonly a mouthpiece should be used. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nVentavis contains ethanol \n \nThis medicinal product contains small amounts of ethanol (alcohol), less than 100 mg per dose. \n \nSwitching to the Breelib nebuliser \n \nLimited data are available on the use of the Breelib nebuliser. For patients being switched from an \nalternative device to the Breelib nebuliser the first inhalation should be made with Ventavis \n10 microgram/ml (1ml ampoule) delivering 2.5 microgram iloprost at the mouthpiece and under close \nmedical supervision to ensure that the faster inhalation provided by Breelib is well tolerated. First \ndosing with 2.5 microgram should be done even if patients had already been stable on 5 microgram \ninhaled with an alternative device (see section 4.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIloprost may increase the effects of vasodilatators and antihypertensive agents and then favour the risk \nof hypotension (see section 4.4). Caution is recommended in case of co-administration of Ventavis \nwith other antihypertensive or vasodilatating agents as dose adjustment might be required. \n \nSince iloprost inhibits platelet function its use with the following substances may enhance iloprost-\nmediated platelet inhibition, thereby increasing the risk of bleeding: \n• anticoagulants, such as \n\n- heparin, \n- oral anticoagulants (either coumarin-type or direct), \n\n• or other inhibitors of platelet aggregation, such as \n- acetylsalicylic acid, \n- non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products, \n- non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors like pentoxifylline, \n- selective phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitors like cilostazol or anagrelide, \n- ticlopidine, \n- clopidogrel, \n- glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists, like \n\no abciximab, \no eptifibatide, \no tirofiban, \n\n- defibrotide. \n \n\nA careful monitoring of the patients taking anticoagulants or other inhibitors of platelet aggregation \naccording to common medical practice is recommended.  \n\n \nIntravenous infusion of iloprost has no effect either on the pharmacokinetics of multiple oral doses of \ndigoxin or on the pharmacokinetics of co-administered tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) in patients. \nAlthough, clinical studies have not been conducted, in vitro studies investigating the inhibitory \npotential of iloprost on the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes revealed that no relevant inhibition \nof drug metabolism via these enzymes by iloprost is to be expected.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential  \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective contraceptive measures during treatment with \nVentavis. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nPregnancy \n \nWomen with pulmonary hypertension (PH) should avoid pregnancy as it may lead to life-threatening \nexacerbation of the disease. \nAnimal studies have shown reproductive effects (see section 5.3).  \nThere is a limited amount of data from the use of iloprost in pregnant women. If a pregnancy occurs, \ntaking into account the potential maternal benefit, the use of Ventavis during pregnancy may be \nconsidered, only following careful benefit-risk evaluation, in those women who choose to continue \ntheir pregnancy, despite the known risks of pulmonary hypertension during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether iloprost/metabolites are excreted in human breast milk. Very low levels of \niloprost into milk were observed in rats (see section 5.3). A potential risk to the breast-feeding child \ncannot be excluded and it is preferable to avoid breast-feeding during Ventavis therapy.  \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies have not shown harmful effect of iloprost on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nVentavis has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines for patients experiencing \nhypotensive symptoms such as dizziness. \nCare should be exercised during initiation of therapy until any effects on the individual have been \ndetermined.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn addition to local effects resulting from administration of iloprost by inhalation such as cough, \nadverse reactions with iloprost are related to the pharmacological properties of prostacyclins. \n \nThe most frequently observed adverse reactions (≥ 20 %) in clinical trials include vasodilatation \n(including hypotension), headache and cough. The most serious adverse reactions were hypotension, \nbleeding events, and bronchospasm. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions reported below are based on pooled clinical trial data from phase II and III \nclinical trials involving 131 patients taking the medicinal product and on data from post-marketing \nsurveillance. The frequencies of adverse reactions are defined as very common (≥1/10) and common \n(≥1/100 to <1/10). The adverse reactions identified only during post-marketing surveillance, and for \nwhich a frequency could not be estimated from clinical trial data, are listed under \"Frequency not \nknown\". \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nSystem organ class \n(MedDRA) \n \n\nVery common \n(≥1/10) \n\nCommon \n(≥1/100 to <1/10) \n\nNot known (cannot \nbe estimated from \nthe available data) \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nBleeding events*§  Thrombocytopenia \n\nImmune system disorders   Hypersensitivity \n\nNervous system disorders Headache Dizziness   \n\nCardiac disorders  Tachycardia \nPalpitations \n\n \n\nVascular disorders Vasodilatation \nFlushing \n\nSyncope§ (see \nsection 4.4)  \nHypotension* \n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nChest discomfort / \nchest pain \nCough  \n\nDyspnoea \nPharyngolaryngeal \npain  \nThroat irritation  \n\nBronchospasm* (see \nsection 4.4) / \nWheezing \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea Diarrhoea \nVomiting \nMouth and tongue \nirritation including \npain \n\nDysgeusia \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n Rash  \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n \n\nPain in jaw/trismus   \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site condition \n\nPeripheral oedema§   \n\n* Life-threatening and/or fatal cases have been reported. \n§ see section “Description of selected adverse reactions” \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nBleeding events (mostly epistaxis and haemoptysis) were very common as expected in this patient \npopulation with a high proportion of patients taking anticoagulant co-medication. The risk of bleeding \nmay be increased in patients when potential inhibitors of platelet aggregation or anticoagulants are \ngiven concomitantly (see section 4.5). Fatal cases included cerebral and intracranial haemorrhage. \n \nSyncope is a common symptom of the disease itself, but can also occur under therapy. The increased \noccurrence of syncope can be related to the deterioration of the disease or insufficient effectiveness of \nthe product (see section 4.4). \n \nIn clinical trials peripheral oedema was reported in 12.2% of patients on iloprost and 16.2% of \npatients on placebo. Peripheral oedema is a very common symptom of the disease itself, but can also \noccur under therapy. The occurrence of peripheral oedema can be related to the deterioration of the \ndisease or insufficient effectiveness of the product. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nCases of overdose were reported. Symptoms of overdoses are mainly related to the vasodilatory effect \nof iloprost. Frequently observed symptoms following overdose are dizziness, headache, flushing, \nnausea, jaw pain or back pain. Hypotension, an increase of blood pressure, bradycardia or \ntachycardia, vomiting, diarrhoea and limb pain might also be possible. \n \nManagement \n \nA specific antidote is not known. Interruption of the inhalation session, monitoring and symptomatic \nmeasures are recommended. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, platelet aggregation inhibitors excluding heparin, \nATC code: B01AC11 \n \nIloprost, the active substance of Ventavis, is a synthetic prostacyclin analogue. The following \npharmacological effects have been observed in vitro: \n• Inhibition of platelet aggregation, platelet adhesion and release reaction \n• Dilatation of arterioles and venules \n• Increase of capillary density and reduction of increased vascular permeability caused by \n\nmediators such as serotonin or histamine in the microcirculation  \n• Stimulation of endogenous fibrinolytic potential \n \nThe pharmacological effects after inhalation of Ventavis are: \n \nDirect vasodilatation of the pulmonary arterial bed occur with consecutive significant improvement of \npulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance and cardiac output as well as mixed venous \noxygen saturation.  \n \nIn a small, randomised, 12-week double-blinded, placebo-controlled study (the STEP trial), \n34 patients treated with bosentan 125 mg twice per day for at least 16 weeks who were in stable \nhaemodynamic conditions before enrolment, tolerated the addition of inhaled iloprost at the \nconcentration of 10 microgram/ml (up to 5 microgram 6 to 9 times per day during waking hours). The \nmean daily inhaled dose was 27 microgram and the mean number of inhalations per day was 5.6. The \nacute adverse effects in patients receiving concomitant bosentan and iloprost were consistent with \nthose observed in the larger experience of the phase 3 study in patients receiving only iloprost. No \nreliable conclusion could be drawn on efficacy of the association as the sample size was limited and \nthe study was of short duration. \n \nNo clinical trial data are available comparing directly in intra-patient observations the acute \nhaemodynamic response after intravenous to that after inhaled iloprost. The haemodynamics observed \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n12 \n\nsuggest an acute response with preferential effect of inhaled treatment on the pulmonary vessels. The \npulmonary vasodilatory effect of each single inhalation levels off within one to two hours. \n \nHowever, the predictive value of these acute haemodynamic data are considered to be of limited value \nas acute response does not in all cases correlate with long-term benefit of treatment with inhaled \niloprost. \n \nEfficacy in adult patients with pulmonary hypertension \n \nA randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, placebo-controlled phase III trial (study RRA02997) has \nbeen conducted in 203 adult patients (inhaled iloprost at the concentration of 10 microgram/ml: \nN=101; placebo n=102) with stable pulmonary hypertension. Inhaled iloprost (or placebo) was added \nto patients' current therapy, which could include a combination of anticoagulants, vasodilators (e.g. \ncalcium channel blockers), diuretics, oxygen, and digitalis, but not PGI2 (prostacyclin or its \nanalogues). 108 of the patients included were diagnosed with primary pulmonary hypertension, 95 \nwere diagnosed with secondary pulmonary hypertension of which 56 were associated with chronic \nthromboembolic disease, 34 with connective tissue disease (including CREST and scleroderma) and 4 \nwere considered appetite suppressant medicinal product related. The baseline 6-minute walk test \nvalues reflected a moderate exercise limitation: in the iloprost group the mean was 332 metres \n(median value: 340 metres) and in the placebo group the mean was 315 metres (median value: \n321 metres). In the iloprost group, the median daily inhaled dose was 30 microgram (range 12.5 to \n45 microgram/day). The primary efficacy endpoint defined for this study, was a combined response \ncriterion consisting of improvement in exercise capacity (6-minute walk test) at 12 weeks by at least \n10% versus baseline, and improvement by at least one NYHA class at 12 weeks versus baseline, and \nno deterioration of pulmonary hypertension or death at any time before 12 weeks. The rate of \nresponders to iloprost was 16.8% (17/101) and the rate of responders in the placebo group was 4.9% \n(5/102) (p=0.007).  \n \nIn the iloprost group, the mean change from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment in the 6-minute \nwalking distance was an increase of 22 metres (-3.3 metres in the placebo group, no data imputation \nfor death or missing values).  \n \nIn the iloprost group the NYHA class was improved in 26% of patients (placebo: 15%) (p = 0.032), \nunchanged in 67.7% of patients (placebo: 76%) and deteriorated in 6.3% of patients (placebo: 9%). \nInvasive haemodynamic parameters were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks treatment. \n \nA subgroup analysis showed that no treatment effect was observed as compared to placebo on the \n6-minute walk test in the subgroup of patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension.  \nA mean increase in the 6-minute walk test of 44.7 metres from a baseline mean value of 329 metres \nvs. a change of -7.4 metres from a baseline mean value of 324 metres in the placebo group (no data \nimputation for death or missing values) was observed in the subgroup of 49 patients with primary \npulmonary hypertension receiving treatment of inhaled iloprost for 12 weeks (46 patients in the \nplacebo group).  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo study has been performed with Ventavis in children with pulmonary hypertension. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nWhen iloprost at the concentration of 10 microgram/ml is administered via inhalation in patients with \npulmonary hypertension or healthy volunteers (iloprost dose at the mouthpiece: 5 microgram: \ninhalation time in between 4.6 – 10.6 min), mean peak serum concentrations of about 100 to \n200 picogram/ml were observed at the end of inhalation session. These concentrations decline with \n\n\n\n13 \n\nhalf-lives between approximately 5 and 25 minutes. Within 30 minutes to 2 hours after the end of \ninhalation, iloprost is not detectable in the central compartment (limit of quantification \n25 picogram/ml). \n \nDistribution  \n \nNo studies performed following inhalation. \n \nFollowing intravenous infusion, the apparent steady-state volume of distribution was 0.6 to 0.8 l/kg in \nhealthy subjects. Total plasma protein binding of iloprost is concentration-independent in the range of \n30 to 3,000 picogram/ml and amounts to approximately 60%, of which 75% is due to albumin \nbinding. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nNo studies to investigate the metabolism of iloprost were performed following inhalation of Ventavis. \n \nAfter intravenous administration, iloprost is extensively metabolised via ß-oxidation of the carboxyl \nside chain. No unchanged substance is eliminated. The main metabolite is tetranor-iloprost, which is \nfound in the urine in free and conjugated form. Tetranor-iloprost is pharmacologically inactive as \nshown in animal experiments. Results of in vitro studies reveal that CYP 450-dependent metabolism \nplays only a minor role in the biotransformation of iloprost. Further in vitro studies suggest that \nmetabolism of iloprost in the lungs is similar after intravenous administration or inhalation. \n \nElimination \n \nNo studies performed following inhalation. \n \nIn subjects with normal renal and hepatic function, the disposition of iloprost following intravenous \ninfusion is characterised in most cases by a two-phase profile with mean half-lives of 3 to 5 minutes \nand 15 to 30 minutes. The total clearance of iloprost is about 20 ml/kg/min, which indicates \nextrahepatic contribution to the metabolism of iloprost. \n \nA mass-balance study was done using 3H-iloprost in healthy subjects. Following intravenous infusion, \nthe recovery of total radioactivity is 81 %, and the respective recoveries in urine and faeces are 68% \nand 12%. The metabolites are eliminated from plasma and urine in 2 phases, for which half-lives of \nabout 2 and 5 hours (plasma) and 2 and 18 hours (urine) have been calculated. \n \nPharmacokinetics after use with different nebulisers \n \nBreelib nebuliser: \nPharmacokinetics of iloprost were investigated in a randomised, crossover study with 27 patients, \nstable on Ventavis 10 microgram/ml inhaled with I-Neb, following inhalation of single doses of 2.5 or \n5 microgram iloprost using the Breelib or the I-Neb AAD nebuliser. Following inhalation of these \ndoses with the Breelib the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and systemic exposures (AUC \n(0-tlast)) increased dose-proportionally. \nCmax and AUC (0–tlast) after inhalation of 5 microgram iloprost administered as Ventavis \n20 microgram/ml using the Breelib were 77% and 42%, respectively higher compared to inhalation of \nthe same dose using Ventavis 10 microgram/ml and the I-Neb AAD system. Cmax and AUC (0–tlast) of \niloprost after inhalation with Breelib were, however, still in the range of values observed with \nVentavis 10 microgram/ml using other inhalers across different studies. \n \nI-Neb AAD nebuliser: \nPharmacokinetics under the specific study conditions of extended inhalation time, were investigated \nin a randomised, crossover study with 19 healthy adult men following inhalation of single doses of \nVentavis 10 microgram/ml and Ventavis 20 microgram/ml (dose of 5 microgram iloprost at the \n\n\n\n14 \n\nmouthpiece) using the I-Neb. Comparable systemic exposures (AUC (0–tlast)) and approximately 30% \nhigher maximum serum concentrations (Cmax) were found following inhalation of Ventavis \n20 microgram/ml compared to Ventavis 10 microgram/ml which was in line with the observed shorter \ninhalation time using Ventavis 20 microgram/ml. \n \nOther special populations \n \nRenal impairment \nIn a study with intravenous infusion of iloprost, patients with end-stage renal failure undergoing \nintermittent dialysis treatment are shown to have a significantly lower clearance \n(mean CL = 5 ± 2 ml/minute/kg) than that observed in patients with renal failure not undergoing \nintermittent dialysis treatment (mean CL = 18 ± 2 ml/minute/kg). \n \nHepatic impairment \nBecause iloprost is extensively metabolised by the liver, the plasma levels of the active substance are \ninfluenced by changes in hepatic function. In an intravenous study, results were obtained involving \n8 patients suffering from liver cirrhosis. The mean clearance of iloprost is estimated to be \n10 ml/minute/kg. \n \nGender \nGender is not of clinical relevance to the pharmacokinetics of iloprost. \n \nElderly \nPharmacokinetics in elderly patients have not been investigated. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSystemic toxicity \n \nIn acute toxicity studies, single intravenous and oral doses of iloprost caused severe symptoms of \nintoxication or death (intravenous) at doses about two orders of magnitude above the intravenous \ntherapeutic dose. Considering the high pharmacological potency of iloprost and the absolute doses \nrequired for therapeutic purposes the results obtained in acute toxicity studies do not indicate a risk of \nacute adverse effects in humans. As expected for a prostacyclin, iloprost produced haemodynamic \neffects (vasodilatation, reddening of skin, hypotension, inhibition of platelet function, respiratory \ndistress) and general signs of intoxication such as apathy, gait disturbances, and postural changes. \n \nContinuous intravenous/subcutaneous infusion of iloprost up to 26 weeks in rodents and non-rodents \ndid not cause any organ toxicity at dose levels which exceeded the human therapeutic systemic \nexposure between 14 and 47 times (based on plasma levels). Only expected pharmacological effects \nlike hypotension, reddening of skin, dyspnoea, increased intestinal motility were observed. \n \nIn a chronic inhalation study in rats over 26 weeks, the highest achievable dose of \n48.7 microgram/kg/day was identified as ‘no observed adverse effect level’ (NOAEL). Systemic \nexposures exceeded human therapeutic exposures after inhalation by factors of more than 10 (Cmax, \ncumulative AUC). \n \nGenotoxic potential, tumourigenicity \n \nIn vitro (bacterial, mammalian cells, human lymphocytes) and in vivo studies (micronucleus test) for \ngenotoxic effects have not produced any evidence for a mutagenic potential. \nNo tumourigenic potential of iloprost was observed in tumourigenicity studies in rats and mice. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nReproductive toxicology \n \nIn embryo- and foetotoxicity studies in rats continuous intravenous administration of iloprost led to \nanomalies of single phalanges of the forepaws in a few foetuses/pups without dose dependence. \n \nThese alterations are not considered as teratogenic effects, but are most likely related to iloprost \ninduced growth retardation in late organogenesis due to haemodynamic alterations in the \nfoetoplacental unit. No disturbance of postnatal development and reproductive performance was seen \nin the offspring that were raised, indicating that the observed retardation in rats was compensated \nduring the postnatal development. In comparable embryotoxicity studies in rabbits and monkeys no \nsuch digit anomalies or other gross-structural anomalies were observed even after considerably higher \ndose levels which exceeded the human dose multiple times. \nIn rats, passage of low levels of iloprost and/or metabolites into the milk was observed (less than 1% \nof iloprost dose given intravenously). No disturbance of post-natal development and reproductive \nperformance was seen in animals exposed during lactation. \n \nLocal tolerance, contact sensitising and antigenicity potential \n \nIn inhalation studies in rats, the administration of an iloprost formulation with a concentration of \n20 microgram/ml up to 26 weeks did not cause any local irritation of the upper and lower respiratory \ntract. \n \nA dermal sensitisation (maximisation test) and an antigenicity study in guinea pigs showed no \nsensitising potential. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n43 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nVentavis 10 microgram/ml nebuliser solution \nIloprost \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n\n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Ventavis is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Ventavis \n3. How to use Ventavis \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Ventavis \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Ventavis is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Ventavis is \nThe active substance of Ventavis is iloprost. It imitates a natural substance in the body called \nprostacyclin. Ventavis inhibits unwanted blocking or narrowing of blood vessels and allows more \nblood to flow through the vessels.  \n \nWhat Ventavis is used for \nVentavis is used to treat moderate cases of primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) in adult patients. \nPPH is a category of pulmonary hypertension where the cause of the high blood pressure is not \nknown.  \nThis is a condition where blood pressure is too high in the blood vessels between the heart and the \nlungs.  \nVentavis is used to improve exercise capacity (the ability to carry out physical activity) and \nsymptoms. \n \nHow Ventavis works \nBreathing in the mist carries Ventavis to the lungs, where it can work most effectively in the artery \nbetween heart and lungs. Improved blood flow leads to a better supply of oxygen to the body and \nreduced strain on the heart. \n \n \n\n\n\n44 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Ventavis \n \nDo not use Ventavis  \n• if you are allergic to iloprost or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6), \n• if you are at risk of bleeding– for example, if you have an active ulcer of the stomach or of the \n\nfirst part of the small intestine (duodenal ulcers), if you have suffered a physical injury \n(trauma), if you are at risk of bleeding within the skull, \n\n• if you have a heart problem, such as \n- poor blood flow to the heart muscles (severe coronary heart disease or unstable angina). \n\nSymptoms can include chest pain, \n- a heart attack within the last six months, \n- a weak heart (decompensated cardiac failure) which is not under close medical \n\nobservation, \n- severe unstable heartbeat, \n- a defect of the heart valves (inborn or acquired) that causes the heart to work \n poorly (not related to pulmonary hypertension), \n\n• if you have had a stroke within the last 3 months, or any other occurrence that reduced the \nblood supply to the brain (e.g. transient ischaemic attack), \n\n• if your pulmonary hypertension is due to a blocked or narrowed vein (venous occlusive \ndisease). \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Ventavis:  \n• Inhaling Ventavis might trigger breathing difficulties (see section 4), especially in patients with \n\nbronchospasm (sudden constriction of the muscles in the walls of the small airways) and \nwheezing. Tell your doctor if you have a lung infection, severe asthma, or chronic lung \ndisease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Your doctor will monitor you closely. \n\n• Your blood pressure will be checked before treatment and if it is too low (less than \n85 mmHg for the upper value) then therapy with Ventavis should not be started. \n\n• In general, you will need to take special care to try and avoid effects of low blood pressure, \nsuch as fainting and dizziness:  \n- Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medication because the combined effect with \n\nVentavis may lower your blood pressure further (see below \"Other medicines and \nVentavis\"). \n\n- Stand up slowly when you get out of chairs or bed.  \n- If you tend to faint as soon as you get out of bed, it may be helpful to take your first dose \n\nof the day while you are still lying down. \n- If you tend to experience fainting episodes, avoid any exceptional straining, for example \n\nduring physical exertion; it might be useful to inhale Ventavis before.  \n• Fainting episodes may be due to the underlying disease. Tell your doctor if they get worse. \n\nHe/she may consider adjusting your dose or changing your treatment. \n• If you suffer from a weak heart condition such as right heart failure, and feel that your \n\ndisease is worsening, tell your doctor. Symptoms can include swelling of feet and ankles, \nshortness of breath, palpitations, urinating more frequently at night or oedema. Your doctor will \nconsider changing your treatment. \n\n• If you experience difficulty breathing, cough up blood, and/or sweat excessively these may \nbe signs that you have water in the lungs (lung oedema). Stop using Ventavis and tell your \ndoctor immediately. He/she will look for the cause and take appropriate measures. \n\n• If you have liver problems or very severe kidney problems, requiring dialysis, tell your \ndoctor. You may be gradually introduced to the prescribed dose or be prescribed a lower dose \nof Ventavis than for other patients (see section 3. \"How to use Ventavis\"). \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nContact of Ventavis with skin or swallowing Ventavis \n• Do NOT let Ventavis solution come into contact with your skin or eyes.  \n\nIf it does, rinse the skin or your eyes immediately with plenty of water.  \n• Do NOT drink or swallow Ventavis solution.  \n\nIf you swallow it accidentally, drink plenty of water and tell your doctor.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe safety and efficacy of Ventavis in children aged up to 18 years have not been established.  \n \nOther medicines and Ventavis \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other \nmedicines. Ventavis and certain other medicines may affect each other in the way they work in your \nbody. \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking: \n \n• Medicines used to treat high blood pressure or heart disease, such as  \n\n- beta blockers, \n- nitro-vasodilators, \n- ACE inhibitors. \nYour blood pressure may drop much further. \nYour doctor may change the dosage. \n \n\n• Medicines that thin the blood or inhibit blood clotting, this includes \n- acetylsalicylic acid (ASA - a compound found in many medicines that lower fever and \n\nrelieve pain), \n- heparin, \n- coumarin-type anticoagulants, such as warfarin or phenprocoumon, \n- non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, \n- non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as pentoxifylline, \n- selective phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE 3) inhibitors, such as cilostazol or anagrelide, \n- ticlopidine, \n- clopidogrel, \n- glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists, such as \n\no abciximab,  \no eptifibatide, \no tirofiban, \n\n- defibrotide. \nYour doctor will monitor you carefully. \n\n \nBefore taking any medicine ask your doctor or pharmacist, who has more information on medicines to \nbe careful with or avoid when using Ventavis. \n \nVentavis with food and drink \nFood or drink is not expected to affect Ventavis. However, you should avoid taking food or drink \nduring inhalation. \n \nPregnancy \n• If you suffer from pulmonary hypertension, avoid getting pregnant as pregnancy may lead to a \n\nworsening of your condition and may even endanger your life. \n• If you could get pregnant, use reliable contraception from the time you start treatment and during \n\ntreatment. \n• If you are pregnant, think you might be or are planning to have a baby, tell your doctor \n\nstraight away. Ventavis should only be used during pregnancy if your doctor decides that the \npotential benefit outweighs the potential risk to you and the foetus. \n\n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether Ventavis passes into human milk. A potential risk to the breast-feeding child \ncannot be excluded and it is preferable to avoid breast-feeding during Ventavis therapy. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nNewborns, infants and pregnant women should not be in the same room while you are inhaling \nVentavis. \n \nDriving and using machines \nVentavis lowers blood pressure and may cause dizziness or light-headedness in some people.  \nDo not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel these effects.  \n \nVentavis contains ethanol \nVentavis contains small amounts of ethanol (alcohol), less than 100 mg per dose. \n \n \n3. How to use Ventavis \n \nVentavis therapy should only be initiated by a physician experienced in treatment of pulmonary \nhypertension.  \n \nHow much to inhale and for how long \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \nThe dose of Ventavis and the duration of treatment that is right for you depend on your individual \ncondition. Your doctor will advise you. Do not change the recommended dose without consulting \nyour doctor first. \n \nDifferent nebuliser devices can be used to administer Ventavis. Depending on the type of device used \nand dose prescribed, 1 ml or 2 ml of Ventavis 10 microgram/ml are appropriate. \n \n• Breelib nebuliser \n \nIf you are starting Ventavis treatment or if you switch from an alternative device your first inhalation \nwill be with Ventavis 10 microgram/ml (1 ml ampoule with white and yellow rings). If you tolerate \nthis dose well, your next inhalation will be with Ventavis 20 microgram/ml (ampoule with yellow and \nred rings). You should continue on this dose. \n \nIf you cannot tolerate inhalation of Ventavis 20 microgram/ml talk to your doctor who may decide \nthat you should take Ventavis 10 microgram/ml (1 ml ampoule). \n \nMost people will have 6 to 9 inhalation sessions spread throughout the day. One inhalation session \nwith Breelib will usually last about 3 minutes. \n \nYour doctor will supervise your treatment when you start using the Breelib nebuliser to ensure that \nyou tolerate dose and speed of inhalation well. \n \n• I-Neb AAD nebuliser (1 ml ampoule with white and yellow rings) \n \nIn general, when starting Ventavis treatment the first inhaled dose should be 2.5 microgram iloprost as \ndelivered at the mouthpiece. If you tolerate this dose well, your dose should be increased to \n5 microgram iloprost and you should continue on this dose. If you are unable to tolerate the \n5 microgram dose, the dose should be reduced to 2.5 microgram. \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \nMost people will have 6 to 9 inhalation sessions spread throughout the day. One inhalation session \nwill usually last about 4 to 10 minutes with I-Neb AAD depending on the prescribed dose.  \n \n• Venta-Neb nebuliser (2 ml ampoule with white and pink rings) \n \nIn general, when starting Ventavis treatment the first inhaled dose should be 2.5 microgram iloprost as \ndelivered at the mouthpiece. If you tolerate this dose well, your dose should be increased to \n5 microgram and you should continue on this dose. If you are unable to tolerate the 5 microgram dose, \nthe dose should be reduced to 2.5 microgram. \n \nMost people will have 6 to 9 inhalation sessions spread throughout the day. One inhalation session \nwith Venta-Neb will usually last about 4 to 10 minutes depending on the prescribed dose.  \n \nDepending on your individual needs, Ventavis can be used for long term treatment. \n \nIf you have kidney or liver problems \n \nThere is no need to alter the dose in patients with mild or moderate kidney problems (patients with a \ncreatinine clearance > 30 ml/min).  \n \nIf you have very severe kidney problems and require dialysis or if you have liver problems, your \ndoctor will introduce you to Ventavis gradually and possibly prescribe fewer daily inhalations. Start \ntherapy by inhaling 2.5 microgram iloprost using 1 ml ampoule of Ventavis 10 microgram/ml (with \nwhite and yellow rings). Use dosing intervals of 3 – 4 hours (this corresponds to a maximum of \n6 administrations per day). Thereafter, your doctor may cautiously shorten the dosing intervals \ndepending on how you tolerate the treatment. If your doctor decides to further increase the dose up to \n5 microgram, again dosing intervals of 3 - 4 hours should be chosen initially and shortened depending \non how you tolerate the treatment. \n \nIf you feel that the effect of Ventavis is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \nAsk your doctor to have someone help you become thoroughly familiar with the use of the nebuliser. \nYou should not switch to another nebuliser without consulting the doctor who is treating you. \n \nHow to inhale \n \nFor each inhalation session you should use a new ampoule of Ventavis. Just before you start to \ninhale, break the glass ampoule and pour the solution into the medication chamber following \nthe instructions for use of the nebuliser. \n \nFollow carefully the instructions that come with the nebuliser especially the instructions on \nhygiene and cleaning of the nebuliser. \n \nAlways take Ventavis exactly as your doctor has told you.  \n• Ventavis 10 microgram/ml nebuliser solution is inhaled using the nebulisers your doctor \n\nprescribed (either the Breelib, the Venta-Neb or the I-Neb AAD system).  \n• The nebuliser turns Ventavis solution into a mist which you breathe in through your \n\nmouth.  \n• For the inhalation you should use a mouthpiece to prevent Ventavis coming into contact \n\nwith your skin. Do not use a facial mask. \n• Follow carefully any instructions that come with the nebuliser. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are unsure. \n• Any Ventavis solution remaining in the nebuliser after inhalation must be thrown away (see \n\nsection 5). \n \n\n\n\n48 \n\nRoom ventilation \nBe sure to ventilate or air the room in which you have taken your Ventavis treatment. Other people \nmight accidentally be exposed to Ventavis through the room air. In particular, newborns, infants and \npregnant women should not be in the same room while you are inhaling Ventavis. \n \n• Breelib \n \nFill the medication chamber with Ventavis immediately before use. For filling please follow the \ninstructions for use of the nebuliser. \n \n\nDevice Drug product \nDose of iloprost at \nmouthpiece \n\nEstimated \ninhalation time \n\nBreelib \nVentavis 10 mcg/ml (1 ml \nampoule with white and \nyellow rings) \n\n2.5 mcg 3 minutes \n\n \n• I-Neb AAD \n \n1. Just before you start to inhale, break the glass ampoule containing 1 ml solution, which has two \n\ncoloured rings (white - yellow), and pour the complete contents into the nebuliser medication \nchamber.  \n\n2. The pre-set dose provided by the I-Neb AAD system is controlled by the medication chamber in \ncombination with a control disc. There are two different colour coded medication chambers. \nFor each medication chamber there is a corresponding colour coded control disc: \n• For the 2.5 microgram dose the medication chamber with the red coloured latch is \n\nused together with the red control disc.  \n• For the 5 microgram dose the medication chamber with the purple coloured latch is \n\nused together with the purple control disc. \n3. In order to ensure that you receive the prescribed dose, check the colour of the medication \n\nchamber and the colour of the control disc. They should both have the same colour, either red \nfor the 2.5 microgram dose or purple for the 5 microgram dose. \n\n \n\nDevice Dose of iloprost at mouthpiece Estimated inhalation time \n\nI-Neb AAD 2.5 microgram 5 microgram \n3.2 min \n6.5 min \n\n \nThe table below provides a summary of the user instructions of the I-Neb: \n \n\nDrug product \nAmpoule  \ncoloured ring \n\nDosage \nI-Neb AAD \n\nMedication \nchamber latch \n\nControl disc \n\nVentavis 10 mcg/ml \n1 ml  ampoule \nwhite - yellow ring \n\n2.5 mcg red red \n\n5 mcg purple purple \n\n \n\n\n\n49 \n\n• Venta-Neb \n \n1.

This \nsystem generates droplets by ultrasound, which forces the solution through a mesh. The I-Neb AAD \nnebuliser has been shown to be suitable for the administration of Ventavis 10 microgram/ml (1 ml \nampoule with white and yellow rings).  \nThe measured MMAD of the aerosol droplets was 2.1 micrometres.  \nThis nebuliser monitors the breathing pattern to determine the aerosol pulse time required to deliver \nthe pre-set dose of 2.5 or 5 microgram iloprost.  \n \nThe dose delivered by the I-Neb AAD system is controlled by the medication chamber in combination \nwith a control disc. Each medication chamber is colour coded and has a corresponding colour coded \ncontrol disc. \n \n• For the 2.5 microgram dose the medication chamber with the red latch is used together with \n\nthe red control disc.  \n• For the 5 microgram dose the medication chamber with the purple coloured latch is used \n\ntogether with the purple control disc. \n \nFor each inhalation session with the I-Neb AAD, the content of one 1 ml ampoule of Ventavis, with \ntwo coloured rings (white - yellow) is transferred into the medication chamber immediately before \nuse.  \n \n\nDevice Dose of iloprost at mouthpiece Estimated inhalation time \n\nI-Neb AAD 2.5 microgram 5 microgram \n3.2 min \n6.5 min \n\n \n\n\n\n54 \n\nThe table below provides a summary of the user instructions of the I-Neb for Ventavis: \n \n\nDrug product Ampoule  coloured ring Dosage \nI-Neb AAD \n\nMedication \nchamber latch Control disc \n\nVentavis 10 mcg/ml 1 ml ampoule white - yellow ring \n2.5 mcg red red \n\n5 mcg purple purple \n \n• Venta-Neb \n \nVenta-Neb, a portable ultrasonic battery-powered nebuliser, has also been shown to be suitable for the \nadministration of Ventavis 10 microgram/ml.

What Ventavis is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Ventavis is \nThe active substance of Ventavis is iloprost. It imitates a natural substance in the body called \nprostacyclin. Ventavis inhibits unwanted blocking or narrowing of blood vessels and allows more \nblood to flow through the vessels.  \n \nWhat Ventavis is used for \nVentavis is used to treat moderate cases of primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) in adult patients. \nPPH is a category of pulmonary hypertension where the cause of the high blood pressure is not \nknown.  \nThis is a condition where blood pressure is too high in the blood vessels between the heart and the \nlungs.  \nVentavis is used to improve exercise capacity (the ability to carry out physical activity) and \nsymptoms. \n \nHow Ventavis works \nBreathing in the mist carries Ventavis to the lungs, where it can work most effectively in the artery \nbetween heart and lungs. Improved blood flow leads to a better supply of oxygen to the body and \nreduced strain on the heart. \n \n \n\n\n\n56 \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Ventavis \n \nDo not use Ventavis  \n• if you are allergic to iloprost or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6), \n• if you are at risk of bleeding– for example, if you have an active ulcer of the stomach or of the \n\nfirst part of the small intestine (duodenal ulcers), if you have suffered a physical injury \n(trauma), if you are at risk of bleeding within the skull, \n\n• if you have a heart problem, such as \n- poor blood flow to the heart muscles (severe coronary heart disease or unstable angina). \n\nSymptoms can include chest pain, \n- a heart attack within the last six months, \n- a weak heart (decompensated cardiac failure) which is not under close medical \n\nobservation, \n- severe unstable heartbeat, \n- a defect of the heart valves (inborn or acquired) that causes the heart to work \n\npoorly (not related to pulmonary hypertension), \n• if you have had a stroke within the last 3 months, or any other occurrence that reduced the \n\nblood supply to the brain (e.g. transient ischaemic attack), \n• if your pulmonary hypertension is due to a blocked or narrowed vein (venous occlusive \n\ndisease). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Ventavis: \n \n• Inhaling Ventavis might trigger breathing difficulties (see section 4), especially in patients with \n\nbronchospasm (sudden constriction of the muscles in the walls of the small airways) and \nwheezing. Tell your doctor if you have a lung infection, severe asthma, or chronic lung \ndisease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Your doctor will monitor you closely. \n\n• Your blood pressure will be checked before treatment and if it is too low (less than \n85 mmHg for the upper value) then therapy with Ventavis should not be started. \n\n• In general, you will need to take special care to try and avoid effects of low blood pressure, \nsuch as fainting and dizziness: \n- Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medication because the combined effect with \n\nVentavis may lower your blood pressure further (see below “Other medicines and \nVentavis”). \n\n- Stand up slowly when you get out of chairs or bed.  \n- If you tend to faint as soon as you get out of bed, it may be helpful to take your first dose \n\nof the day while you are still lying down. \n- If you tend to experience fainting episodes, avoid any exceptional straining, for example \n\nduring physical exertion; it might be useful to inhale Ventavis before. \n• Fainting episodes may be due to the underlying disease. Tell your doctor if they get worse. \n\nHe/she may consider adjusting your dose or changing your treatment. \n• If you suffer from a weak heart condition such as right heart failure, and feel that your \n\ndisease is worsening, tell your doctor. Symptoms can include swelling of feet and ankles, \nshortness of breath, palpitations, urinating more frequently at night or oedema. Your doctor will \nconsider changing your treatment. \n\n• If you experience difficulty breathing, cough up blood, and/or sweat excessively these may \nbe signs that you have water in the lungs (lung oedema). Stop using Ventavis and tell your \ndoctor immediately. He/she will look for the cause and take appropriate measures. \n\n• If you have liver problems or very severe kidney problems, requiring dialysis, tell your \ndoctor. You may be gradually introduced to the prescribed dose or be prescribed a lower dose \nof Ventavis than for other patients (see section 3. “How to use Ventavis”). \n\n \n\n\n\n57 \n\nContact of Ventavis with skin or swallowing Ventavis \n• Do NOT let Ventavis solution come into contact with your skin or eyes.  \n\nIf it does, rinse the skin or your eyes immediately with plenty of water.  \n• Do NOT drink or swallow Ventavis solution.  \n\nIf you swallow it accidentally, drink plenty of water and tell your doctor.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe safety and efficacy of Ventavis in children aged up to 18 years have not been established.  \n \nOther medicines and Ventavis \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other \nmedicines. Ventavis and certain other medicines may affect each other in the way they work in your \nbody. \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking: \n \n• Medicines used to treat high blood pressure or heart disease, such as \n\n- beta blockers, \n- nitro-vasodilators, \n- ACE inhibitors. \n\nYour blood pressure may drop much further. \nYour doctor may change the dosage. \n \n\n• Medicines that thin the blood or inhibit blood clotting, this includes \n- acetylsalicylic acid (ASA - a compound found in many medicines that lower fever and \n\nrelieve pain), \n- heparin, \n- coumarin-type anticoagulants, such as warfarin or phenprocoumon, \n- non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, \n- non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as pentoxifylline, \n- selective phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE 3) inhibitors, such as cilostazol or anagrelide, \n- ticlopidine, \n- clopidogrel, \n- glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists, such as \n\no abciximab,  \no eptifibatide,  \no tirofiban, \n\n- defibrotide. \nYour doctor will monitor you carefully. \n\n \nBefore taking any medicine ask your doctor or pharmacist, who has more information on medicines to \nbe careful with or avoid when using Ventavis. \n \nVentavis with food and drink \nFood or drink is not expected to affect Ventavis. However, you should avoid taking food or drink \nduring inhalation. \n \nPregnancy \n• If you suffer from pulmonary hypertension, avoid getting pregnant as pregnancy may lead to a \n\nworsening of your condition and may even endanger your life. \n•  If you could get pregnant, use reliable contraception from the time you start treatment and during \n\ntreatment. \n• If you are pregnant, think you might be or are planning to have a baby, tell your doctor \n\nstraight away. Ventavis should only be used during pregnancy if your doctor decides that the \npotential benefit outweighs the potential risk to you and the foetus. \n\n \n\n\n\n58 \n\nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether Ventavis passes into human milk. A potential risk to the breast-feeding child \ncannot be excluded and it is preferable to avoid breast-feeding during Ventavis therapy. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nNewborns, infants and pregnant women should not be in the same room while you are inhaling \nVentavis. \n \nDriving and using machines \nVentavis lowers blood pressure and may cause dizziness or light-headedness in some people.  \nDo not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel these effects.  \n \nVentavis contains ethanol \nVentavis contains small amounts of ethanol (alcohol), less than 100 mg per dose. \n \n \n3. How to use Ventavis  \n \nVentavis therapy should only be initiated by a physician experienced in treatment of pulmonary \nhypertension.  \n \nHow much to inhale and for how long \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \nThe dose of Ventavis and the duration of treatment that is right for you depend on your individual \ncondition. Your doctor will advise you. Do not change the recommended dose without consulting \nyour doctor first.  \n \nDifferent nebuliser devices can be used to administer Ventavis 20µg/ml. \n \n• Breelib nebuliser \n \nIf you are starting Ventavis treatment or if you switch from an alternative device your first inhalation \nwill be with Ventavis 10 microgram/ml (1 ml ampoule with white and yellow rings). If you tolerate \nthis dose well, your next inhalation will be with Ventavis 20 microgram/ml (ampoule with yellow and \nred rings). You should continue on this dose. \n \nIf you cannot tolerate inhalation of Ventavis 20 microgram/ml talk to your doctor who may decide \nthat you should take Ventavis 10 microgram/ml (1 ml ampoule). \n \nMost people will have 6 to 9 inhalation sessions spread throughout the day. One inhalation session \nwith Breelib will usually last about 3 minutes. \n \nYour doctor will supervise your treatment when you start using the Breelib nebuliser to ensure that \nyou tolerate dose and speed of inhalation well. \n \n• I-Neb nebuliser  \n \nAs you repeatedly experience extended inhalation treatment times with Ventavis 10 microgram/ml (1 \nml ampoule with white and yellow rings), your doctor decided to switch to \nVentavis 20 microgram/ml. \n \n\n\n\n59 \n\nVentavis 20 microgram/ml is double the concentration of Ventavis 10 microgram/ml. The active \nsubstance can be delivered more rapidly to your lungs. Your doctor will supervise your treatment if \nswitching from Ventavis 10 microgram /ml to Ventavis 20 microgram/ml to monitor how well you \ntolerate the higher concentration. \n \nYou should administer the dose 6 to 9 times per day according to individual needs and tolerability.  \n \nDepending on your individual needs, Ventavis can be used for long term treatment. \n \nIf you have kidney or liver problems \n \nThere is no need to alter the dose in patients with mild or moderate kidney problems (patients with a \ncreatinine clearance >30 ml/min).  \n \nIf you have very severe kidney problems and require dialysis or if you have liver problems, your \ndoctor will introduce you to Ventavis gradually and possibly prescribe fewer daily inhalations. Start \ntherapy by inhaling 2.5 microgram iloprost using Ventavis 10 micrograms/ml (1 ml ampoule with \nwhite and yellow rings). Use dosing intervals of 3 – 4 hours (this corresponds to a maximum of \n6 administrations per day). Thereafter, your doctor may cautiously shorten the dosing intervals \ndepending on how you tolerate the treatment. If your doctor decides to further increase the dose up to \n5 microgram, again dosing intervals of 3 - 4 hours should be chosen initially and shortened depending \non how you tolerate the treatment. \n \nIf you feel that the effect of Ventavis is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \nAsk your doctor to have someone help you become thoroughly familiar with the use of the nebuliser. \nYou should not switch to another nebuliser without consulting the doctor who is treating you. \n \nHow to inhale \n \nFor each inhalation session you should use a new ampoule of Ventavis. Just before you start to \ninhale, break the glass ampoule and pour the solution into the medication chamber following \nthe instructions for use of the nebuliser. \n \nFollow carefully the instructions that come with the nebuliser especially the instructions on \nhygiene and cleaning of the nebuliser. \n \nAlways take Ventavis exactly as your doctor has told you.  \n• Ventavis 20 microgram/ml nebuliser solution is inhaled using the nebulisers your doctor \n\nprescribed (either the Breelib or the I-Neb AAD nebuliser). \n• The nebuliser turns Ventavis solution into a mist which you breathe in through your \n\nmouth.  \n• For the inhalation you should use a mouthpiece to prevent Ventavis coming into contact \n\nwith your skin. Do not use a facial mask. \n• Follow carefully any instructions that come with the nebuliser. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are unsure. \n• Any Ventavis solution remaining in the nebuliser after inhalation must be thrown away (see \n\nsection 5). \n \nRoom ventilation \nBe sure to ventilate or air the room in which you have taken your Ventavis treatment. Other people \nmight accidentally be exposed to Ventavis through the room air. In particular, newborns, infants and \npregnant women should not be in the same room while you are inhaling Ventavis. \n \n\n\n\n60 \n\n• Breelib \n \nFill the medication chamber with Ventavis immediately before use. For filling please follow the \ninstructions for use of the nebuliser. \n \n\nDevice Drug product \nDose of iloprost at \nmouthpiece \n\nEstimated \ninhalation time \n\nBreelib \nVentavis 20 mcg/ml (1 ml \nampoule with yellow and \nred rings) \n\n5 mcg 3 minutes \n\n \n• I-Neb AAD \n\n \n1. Just before you start to inhale, take the yellow-red colour coded ampoule of \n\nVentavis 20 microgram/ml, break the glass ampoule and pour the complete contents of 1 ml into \nthe nebuliser medication golden chamber. \n\n2. The pre-set dose provided by the I-Neb AAD nebuliser is controlled by the medication chamber in \ncombination with a control disc. \n\n For Ventavis 20 microgram/ml (5 microgram dose), the medication chamber with the golden \ncoloured latch is used together with the golden control disc. \n\n3. To ensure that you receive the prescribed dose, check the colour of the medication chamber and \nthe colour of the control disc. They should both have the same colour. \n\n \nSince the I-Neb AAD nebuliser can be used for Ventavis 10 microgram/ml and Ventavis \n20 microgram/ ml, the table below provides a summary of the user instructions of the I-Neb for the 2 \nconcentrations of Ventavis: \n \n\nDrug product Ampoule  coloured rings Dosage \nI-Neb AAD \n\nMedication  \nchamber latch \n\nControl disc \n\nVentavis 10 mcg/ml 1 ml ampoule white-yellow ring \n\n2.5 mcg \n red red \n\n5 mcg \n purple purple \n\nVentavis 20 mcg/ml 1 ml ampoule \nyellow-red ring 5 mcg golden  golden  \n\n \nFor further details please refer to the instruction manual of the nebuliser device or ask your doctor. \n \nIf you use more Ventavis than you should \nUsing more Ventavis than you should may lead to dizziness, headache, flushing (reddening of the \nface), nausea (feeling sick), jaw pain or back pain. \nYou may also experience a decrease or an increase in blood pressure, bradycardia (reduced heart \nrate), tachycardia (increased heart rate), vomiting, diarrhoea or limb pain. If any of these happen when \nyou have used more Ventavis than you should: \n• stop the inhalation session  \n• talk to your doctor  \nYour doctor will monitor you and treat any resulting symptoms. A specific antidote is not known. \n \nIf you forget to use Ventavis \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please ask your doctor what you should \ndo. \n \n\n\n\n61 \n\nIf you stop taking Ventavis \nIf you stop or wish to stop treatment, discuss it with your doctor first. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nThe following serious side effects may occur. In this case talk to your doctor immediately. \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):  \n• Bleeding events (mostly nosebleed (epistaxis) and coughing up blood (haemoptysis)) may very \n\ncommonly occur, especially if you are also taking blood-thinning medicines (anticoagulants). \nThe risk of bleeding may be increased in patients when inhibitors of platelet aggregation or \nanticoagulants are given at the same time (see also section 2). Very rarely, fatal cases including \nbleeding in the brain (cerebral and intracranial haemorrhage) have been reported. \n\n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):  \n• Fainting (syncope) is a symptom of the illness itself but can also occur during treatment \n\nwith Ventavis (see also section 2 “Warnings and precautions”, for advice on what you \ncan do to avoid this). \n\n• Low blood pressure (hypotension) \n \nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data): \n• Bronchospasm (sudden constriction of the muscles in the walls of the small airways) and \n\nwheezing (see also section 2 “Warnings and precautions”) \n \nBelow we list other possible side effects by how likely they are: \n \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n• widening of the blood vessels (vasodilatation). Symptoms can be flushing or reddening \n\nof the face. \n• chest discomfort / chest pain \n• coughing  \n• headache \n• nausea \n• pain in jaw/spasm of the jaw muscles (trismus)  \n• swelling of the limbs (peripheral oedema) \n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n• breathing difficulties (dyspnoea) \n• dizziness  \n• vomiting \n• diarrhoea \n• pain when swallowing (pharyngolaryngeal irritation) \n• throat irritation \n• mouth and tongue irritation including pain \n• rash \n• fast heartbeat (tachycardia) \n• awareness of fast or hard heartbeat (palpitations) \n \n\n\n\n62 \n\nNot known: frequency cannot be estimated from the available data. \n• reduction in the number of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) \n• hypersensitivity (i.e. allergy) \n• disturbed sense of taste (dysgeusia)  \n \nOther possible effects \n• Swelling, mainly of the ankles and legs, due to fluid retention (peripheral oedema) is a \n\nvery common symptom of the illness itself but can also occur during treatment with \nVentavis. \n\n \nReporting of side effects  \nIf you get any side effects talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix \nV. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Ventavis \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and ampoule. \nThis medicine does not require any special storage conditions. \n \nAny Ventavis solution remaining in the nebuliser must be thrown away. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n \n6.

This \nsystem generates droplets by ultrasound, which is forcing the solution through a mesh. This nebuliser \nmonitors the breathing pattern to determine the aerosol pulse time required to deliver the pre-set dose \nof 5 micrograms iloprost of the Ventavis 20 microgram/ml nebuliser solution (1 ml ampoule with \nyellow and red rings).  \nThe nebulising device delivers 5 microgram iloprost at the mouthpiece. The Mass Median \nAerodynamic Diameter (MMAD) of the aerosol is between 1 and 5 micrometers. \n \nWhen using the I-Neb AAD system the following instructions need to be followed. \nThe dose delivered by the I-Neb AAD system is controlled by the medication chamber in combination \nwith a control disc. For each medication chamber there is a corresponding colour coded control disc. \n \nFor each inhalation session with the I-Neb AAD, the content of one 1-ml ampoule of Ventavis \n20 microgram/ml, showing two coloured rings (–yellow-red), will be transferred into the appropriate \nnebuliser medication chamber with golden coloured latch together with the golden colour disc \nimmediately before use.  \n \n\n\n\n66 \n\nSince the I-Neb AAD system can be used for Ventavis 10 microgram/ml and Ventavis 20 \nmicrogram/ml, the table below provides a summary of the user instructions of the I-Neb for the 2 \nconcentrations of Ventavis: \n \n\nDrug product Ampoule   coloured rings Dosage \nI-Neb AAD \n\nMedication  \nchamber latch \n\nControl disc \n\nVentavis 10 mcg/ml 1 ml ampoule white-yellow ring \n\n2.5 mcg \n red red \n\n5 mcg \n purple purple \n\nVentavis 20 mcg/ml 1 ml ampoule \nyellow-red ring 5 mcg golden  golden  \n\n \nThe efficacy and tolerability of inhaled iloprost when administered with other nebulising systems, \nwhich provide different nebulisation characteristics of iloprost solution, have not been established. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
