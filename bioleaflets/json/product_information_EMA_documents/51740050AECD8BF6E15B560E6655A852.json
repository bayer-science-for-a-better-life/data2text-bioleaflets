CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nMelanoma \n\n \n\nDabrafenib as monotherapy or in combination with trametinib is indicated for the treatment of adult \n\npatients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation (see sections 4.4 \n\nand 5.1). \n\n \n\nAdjuvant treatment of melanoma \n\n \n\nDabrafenib in combination with trametinib is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients \n\nwith Stage III melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation, following complete resection. \n\n \n\nNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) \n\n \n\nDabrafenib in combination with trametinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with \n\nadvanced non-small cell lung cancer with a BRAF V600 mutation. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTreatment with dabrafenib should be initiated and supervised by a qualified physician experienced in \n\nthe use of anticancer medicinal products. \n\n \n\nBefore taking dabrafenib, patients must have confirmation of tumour BRAF V600 mutation using a \n\nvalidated test. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of dabrafenib have not been established in patients with wild-type BRAF \n\nmelanoma or wild-type BRAF NSCLC. Dabrafenib should therefore not be used in patients with \n\nwild-type BRAF melanoma or wild-type BRAF NSCLC (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of dabrafenib, either used as monotherapy or in combination with trametinib, \n\nis 150 mg (two 75 mg capsules) twice daily (corresponding to a total daily dose of 300 mg). The \n\nrecommended dose of trametinib, when used in combination with dabrafenib, is 2 mg once daily. \n\n \n\nDuration of treatment \n\nTreatment should continue until the patient no longer derives benefit or the development of \n\nunacceptable toxicity (see Table 2). In the adjuvant melanoma setting, patients should be treated for a \n\nperiod of 12 months unless there is disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. \n\n \n\nMissed doses \n\nIf a dose of dabrafenib is missed, it should not be taken if it is less than 6 hours until the next \n\nscheduled dose. \n\n \n\nIf a dose of trametinib is missed, when dabrafenib is given in combination with trametinib, the dose of \n\ntrametinib should only be taken if it is more than 12 hours until the next scheduled dose. \n\n \n\nDose modification \n\nTwo dabrafenib capsule strengths, 50 mg and 75 mg, are available to effectively manage dose \n\nmodification requirements. \n\n \n\nThe management of adverse reactions may require treatment interruption, dose reduction, or treatment \n\ndiscontinuation (see Tables 1 and 2). \n\n \n\nDose modifications or interruptions are not recommended for adverse reactions of cutaneous \n\nsquamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) or new primary melanoma (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nTherapy should be interrupted if the patient’s temperature is ≥38.5ºC. Patients should be evaluated for \n\nsigns and symptoms of infection (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nNo dose modifications are required for uveitis as long as effective local therapies can control ocular \n\ninflammation. If uveitis does not respond to local ocular therapy, withhold dabrafenib until resolution \n\nof ocular inflammation and then restart dabrafenib reduced by one dose level (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRecommended dose level reductions and recommendations for dose modifications are provided in \n\nTables 1 and 2, respectively. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTable 1 Recommended dose level reductions \n\n \n\nDose level Dabrafenib dose \n\nUsed as monotherapy or in \n\ncombination with trametinib \n\nTrametinib dose* \n\nOnly when used in combination with \n\ndabrafenib \n\nStarting dose 150 mg twice daily 2 mg once daily \n\n1st dose reduction 100 mg twice daily 1.5 mg once daily \n\n2nd dose reduction 75 mg twice daily 1 mg once daily \n\n3rd dose reduction \n50 mg twice daily 1 mg once daily \n\nDose adjustment for dabrafenib below 50 mg twice daily is not recommended, whether used as \n\nmonotherapy or in combination with trametinib. Dose adjustment for trametinib below 1 mg once \n\ndaily is not recommended, when used in combination with dabrafenib. \n\n*For dosing instructions for treatment with trametinib monotherapy, see trametinib SmPC, Posology \n\nand Method of administration. \n\n \n\nTable 2 Dose modification schedule based on the grade of any adverse events (AE) \n\n \n\nGrade (CTC-AE)* Recommended dabrafenib dose modifications \n\nUsed as monotherapy or in combination with trametinib \n\nGrade 1 or Grade 2 \n\n(Tolerable) \n\nContinue treatment and monitor as clinically indicated. \n\nGrade 2 (Intolerable) or \n\nGrade 3 \n\nInterrupt therapy until toxicity is Grade 0 to 1 and reduce by one dose \n\nlevel when resuming therapy. \n\nGrade 4 Discontinue permanently, or interrupt therapy until Grade 0 to 1 and \n\nreduce by one dose level when resuming therapy. \n\n* The intensity of clinical adverse events graded by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse \n\nEvents (CTC-AE) v4.0 \n\n \n\nWhen an individual’s adverse reactions are under effective management, dose re-escalation following \n\nthe same dosing steps as de-escalation may be considered. The dabrafenib dose should not exceed \n\n150 mg twice daily. \n\n \n\nIf treatment-related toxicities occur when dabrafenib is used in combination with trametinib, then both \n\ntreatments should be simultaneously dose reduced, interrupted or discontinued. Exceptions where dose \n\nmodifications are necessary for only one of the two treatments are detailed below for pyrexia, uveitis, \n\nRAS mutation positive non-cutaneous malignancies (primarily related to dabrafenib), left ventricular \n\nejection fraction (LVEF) reduction, retinal vein occlusion (RVO), retinal pigment epithelial \n\ndetachment (RPED) and interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis (primarily related to trametinib). \n\n \n\nDose modification exceptions (where only one of the two therapies is dose reduced) for selected \n\nadverse reactions \n\nPyrexia \n\nWhen dabrafenib is used alone and in combination with trametinib, therapy with dabrafenib should be \n\ninterrupted if the patient’s temperature is ≥38.5oC (for dose modification guidance see Table 2). \n\nTrametinib should be continued at the same dose. Treatment with anti-pyretics such as ibuprofen or \n\nacetaminophen/paracetamol should be initiated. The use of oral corticosteroids should be considered \n\nin those instances in which anti-pyretics are insufficient. Patients should be evaluated for signs and \n\nsymptoms of infection and if necessary treated in line with local practice (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nUpon resolution of pyrexia dabrafenib should be restarted with appropriate anti-pyretic prophylaxis, \n\neither 1) at the same dose level, or 2) reduced by one dose level if the pyrexia is recurrent and/or was \n\naccompanied by other severe symptoms including dehydration, hypotension or renal failure. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nUveitis \n\nNo dose modifications are required for uveitis as long as effective local therapies can control ocular \n\ninflammation. If uveitis does not respond to local ocular therapy, dabrafenib should be withheld until \n\nresolution of ocular inflammation and then dabrafenib should be restarted reduced by one dose level. \n\nNo dose modification of trametinib is required when taken in combination with dabrafenib (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nRAS-mutation-positive non-cutaneous malignancies \n\nThe benefits and risks should be considered before continuing treatment with dabrafenib in patients \n\nwith a non-cutaneous malignancy that has a RAS mutation. No dose modification of trametinib is \n\nrequired when taken in combination with dabrafenib. \n\n \n\nLeft ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) reduction/Left ventricular dysfunction \n\nIf dabrafenib is being used in combination with trametinib and absolute decrease of >10% in LVEF \n\ncompared to baseline and the ejection fraction is below the institution’s lower limit of normal (LLN), \n\nplease refer to the trametinib SmPC (see section 4.2) for dose modification instructions for trametinib. \n\nNo dose modification of dabrafenib is required when taken in combination with trametinib. \n\n \n\nRetinal vein occlusion (RVO) and Retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED) \n\nIf patients report new visual disturbances such as diminished central vision, blurred vision, or loss of \n\nvision at any time while on combination therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib, please refer to the \n\ntrametinib SmPC (see section 4.2) for dose modification instructions for trametinib. No dose \n\nmodification of dabrafenib is required when taken in combination with trametinib for confirmed cases \n\nof RVO or RPED. \n\n \n\nInterstitial lung disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis \n\nIn patients treated with dabrafenib in combination with trametinib with suspected ILD or pneumonitis, \n\nincluding patients presenting with new or progressive pulmonary symptoms and findings including \n\ncough, dyspnoea, hypoxia, pleural effusion, or infiltrates, pending clinical investigations, please refer \n\nto the trametinib SmPC (see section 4.2) for dose modification instructions for trametinib. No dose \n\nmodification of dabrafenib is required when taken in combination with trametinib for cases of ILD or \n\npneumonitis. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. There are no \n\nclinical data in subjects with severe renal impairment and the potential need for dose adjustment \n\ncannot be determined (see section 5.2). Dabrafenib should be used with caution in patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment when administered as monotherapy or in combination with trametinib. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment. There are no clinical data in \n\nsubjects with moderate to severe hepatic impairment and the potential need for dose adjustment cannot \n\nbe determined (see section 5.2). Hepatic metabolism and biliary secretion are the primary routes of \n\nelimination of dabrafenib and its metabolites and patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment \n\nmay have increased exposure. Dabrafenib should be used with caution in patients with moderate or \n\nsevere hepatic impairment when administered as monotherapy or in combination with trametinib. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nNon-Caucasian patients \n\nLimited safety and efficacy data have been collected on dabrafenib in non-Caucasian patients. The \n\npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis showed no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of \n\ndabrafenib between Asian and Caucasian patients. No dabrafenib dose adjustment is needed in Asian \n\npatients. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required in patients >65 years of age. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of dabrafenib have not yet been established in children and adolescents \n\n(<18 years). No clinical data are available. Studies in juvenile animals have shown adverse effects of \n\ndabrafenib which had not been observed in adult animals (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nTafinlar is for oral use. The capsules are to be swallowed whole with water. They should not be \n\nchewed or opened and should not be mixed with food or liquids due to chemical instability of \n\ndabrafenib. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that the doses of dabrafenib be taken at similar times every day, leaving an interval \n\nof approximately 12 hours between doses. When dabrafenib and trametinib are taken in combination, \n\nthe once-daily dose of trametinib should be taken at the same time each day with either the morning \n\ndose or the evening dose of dabrafenib. \n\n \n\nDabrafenib should be taken at least one hour before, or at least 2 hours after a meal. \n\n \n\nIf a patient vomits after taking dabrafenib, the patient should not retake the dose and should take the \n\nnext scheduled dose. \n\n \n\nPlease refer to trametinib SmPC for information on method of administration when given in \n\ncombination with dabrafenib. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nWhen dabrafenib is given in combination with trametinib, the SmPC of trametinib must be consulted \n\nprior to intiation of combination treatment. For additional information on warnings and precautions \n\nassociated with trametinib treatment, please refer to the trametinib SmPC. \n\n \n\nBRAF V600 testing \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of dabrafenib have not been established in patients with wild-type BRAF \n\nmelanoma or wild-type BRAF NSCLC therefore dabrafenib should not be used in patients with \n\nwild-type BRAF melanoma or wild-type BRAF NSCLC (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nDabrafenib in combination with trametinib in patients with melanoma who have progressed on a \n\nBRAF inhibitor \n\n \n\nThere are limited data in patients taking the combination of dabrafenib with trametinib who have \n\nprogressed on a prior BRAF inhibitor. These data show that the efficacy of the combination will be \n\nlower in these patients (see section 5.1). Therefore, other treatment options should be considered \n\nbefore treatment with the combination in this prior BRAF inhibitor treated population. The sequencing \n\nof treatments following progression on a BRAF inhibitor therapy has not been established. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n7 \n\nNew malignancies \n\n \n\nNew malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, can occur when dabrafenib is used as monotherapy \n\nor in combination with trametinib. \n\n \n\nCutaneous malignancies \n\nCutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) \n\nCases of cuSCC (including keratoacanthoma) have been reported in patients treated with dabrafenib \n\nalone and in combination with trametinib (see section 4.8). In the Phase III clinical trials MEK115306 \n\nand MEK116513 in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, cuSCC occurred in 10% \n\n(22/211) of patients receiving dabrafenib as a monotherapy and in 18% (63/349) of patients receiving \n\nvemurafenib as a monotherapy, respectively. In the integrated safety population of patients with \n\nmelanoma and advanced NSCLC, cuSCC occurred in 2% (19/1076) of patients receiving dabrafenib in \n\ncombination with trametinib. The median time to diagnosis of the first occurrence of cuSCC in study \n\nMEK115306 was 223 days (range 56 to 510 days) in the combination therapy arm and 60 days (range \n\n9 to 653 days) in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm. In the Phase III study BRF115532 (COMBI-AD) \n\nin the adjuvant treatment of melanoma, 1% (6/435) of patients receiving dabrafenib in combination \n\nwith trametinib as compared to 1% (5/432) of patients receiving placebo developed cuSCC. The \nmedian time to onset of the first occurrence of cuSCC in the combination arm of the adjuvant \n\ntreatment study was approximately 18 weeks and was 33 weeks in the placebo arm. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that skin examination be performed prior to initiation of therapy with dabrafenib \n\nand monthly throughout treatment and for up to six months after treatment for cuSCC. Monitoring \n\nshould continue for 6 months following discontinuation of dabrafenib or until initiation of another \n\nanti-neoplastic therapy. \n\n \n\nCases of cuSCC should be managed by dermatological excision and dabrafenib treatment or, if taken \n\nin combination, dabrafenib and trametinib should be continued without any dose adjustment. Patients \n\nshould be instructed to immediately inform their physician if new lesions develop. \n\n \n\nNew primary melanoma \n\nNew primary melanomas have been reported in clinical trials in patients treated with dabrafenib. In \n\nclinical trials in unresectable or metastatic melanoma,these cases were identified within the first \n\n5 months of dabrafenib as monotherapy. Cases of new primary melanoma can be managed with \n\nexcision and do not require treatment modification. Monitoring for skin lesions should occur as \n\ndescribed for cuSCC. \n\n \n\nNon-cutaneous malignancies \n\nIn vitro experiments have demonstrated paradoxical activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase \n\n(MAP kinase) signalling in BRAF wild-type cells with RAS mutations when exposed to BRAF \n\ninhibitors. This may lead to increased risk of non-cutaneous malignancies with dabrafenib exposure \n\n(see section 4.8) when RAS mutations are present. RAS-associated malignancies have been reported \n\nin clinical trials, both with another BRAF inhibitor (chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia and \n\nnon-cutaneous SCC of the head and neck) as well as with dabrafenib monotherapy (pancreatic \n\nadenocarcinoma, bile duct adenocarcinoma) and with dabrafenib in combination with the MEK \n\ninhibitor, trametinib (colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer). \n\n \n\nPrior to initiation of treatment patients should undergo a head and neck examination with minimally \n\nvisual inspection of oral mucosa and lymph node palpation, as well as chest/abdomen computerised \n\ntomography (CT) scan. During treatment patients should be monitored as clinically appropriate which \n\nmay include a head and neck examination every 3 months and a chest/abdomen CT scan every \n\n6 months. Anal examinations and pelvic examinations are recommended before and at the end of \n\ntreatment or when considered clinically indicated. Complete blood cell counts and blood chemistry \n\nshould be performed as clinically indicated. \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nThe benefits and risks should be considered before administering dabrafenib in patients with a prior or \n\nconcurrent cancer associated with RAS mutations. No dose modification of trametinib is required \n\nwhen taken in combination with dabrafenib. \n\n \n\nFollowing discontinuation of dabrafenib, monitoring for non-cutaneous secondary/recurrent \n\nmalignancies should continue for up to 6 months or until initiation of another anti-neoplastic therapy. \n\nAbnormal findings should be managed according to clinical practices. \n\n \n\nHaemorrhage \n\n \n\nHaemorrhagic events, including major haemorrhagic and fatal haemorrhages, have occurred in \n\npatients taking the combination of dabrafenib with trametinib (see section 4.8). Please refer to the \n\ntrametinib SmPC (see section 4.4) for additional information. \n\n \n\nVisual impairment \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials ophthalmologic reactions, including uveitis, iridocyclitis and iritis, have been reported \n\nin patients treated with dabrafenib as monotherapy and in combination with trametinib. Patients should \n\nbe routinely monitored for visual signs and symptoms (such as change in vision, photophobia and eye \n\npain) while on therapy. \n\n \n\nNo dose modifications are required as long as effective local therapies can control ocular \n\ninflammation. If uveitis does not respond to local ocular therapy, withhold dabrafenib until resolution \n\nof ocular inflammation and then restart dabrafenib reduced by one dose level. No dose modification of \n\ntrametinib is required when taken in combination with dabrafenib following diagnosis of uveitis. \n\n \n\nRPED and RVO may occur with dabrafenib in combination with trametinib. Please refer to the \n\ntrametinib SmPC (see section 4.4). No dose modification of dabrafenib is required when taken in \n\ncombination with trametinib following diagnosis of RVO or RPED. \n\n \n\nPyrexia \n\n \n\nFever has been reported in clinical trials with dabrafenib as monotherapy and in combination with \n\ntrametinib (see section 4.8). In 1% of patients in clinical trials with dabrafenib monotherapy, serious \n\nnon-infectious febrile events were identified defined as fever accompanied by severe rigors, \n\ndehydration, hypotension and/or acute renal insufficiency of pre-renal origin in subjects with normal \n\nbaseline renal function (see section 4.8). The onset of these serious non-infectious febrile events was \n\ntypically within the first month of dabrafenib as monotherapy. Patients with serious non-infectious \n\nfebrile events responded well to dose interruption and/or dose reduction and supportive care. \n\n \n\nThe incidence and severity of pyrexia are increased with combination therapy. In the combination \n\ntherapy arm of study MEK115306 in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, pyrexia was \n\nreported in 57% (119/209) of patients with 7% Grade 3, as compared to the dabrafenib monotherapy \n\narm with 33% (69/211) of patients reporting pyrexia, 2% Grade 3. In the Phase II study BRF113928 in \n\npatients with advanced NSCLC the incidence and severity of pyrexia were increased slightly when \n\ndabrafenib was used in combination with trametinib (48%, 3% Grade 3) as compared to dabrafenib \n\nmonotherapy (39%, 2% Grade 3). In the Phase III study BRF115532 in the adjuvant treatment of \n\nmelanoma, the incidence and severity of pyrexia were higher in the dabrafenib in combination with \n\ntrametinib arm (67%; 6% Grade 3/4) as compared to the placebo arm (15%; <1% Grade 3). \n\n \n\nFor patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received dabrafenib in combination with \n\ntrametinib and developed pyrexia, approximately half of the first occurrences of pyrexia happened \n\nwithin the first month of therapy and approximately one-third of the patients had 3 or more events. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nTherapy with dabrafenib should be interrupted if the patient’s temperature is ≥38.5ºC (please refer to \n\nTable 2 for dose modification guidance). Patients should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of \n\ninfection. Dabrafenib can be restarted once the fever resolves with appropriate prophylaxis using \n\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products or paracetamol. The use of oral corticosteroids \n\nshould be considered in those instances in which anti-pyretics are insufficient. If fever is associated \n\nwith other severe signs or symptoms, dabrafenib should be restarted at a reduced dose once fever \n\nresolves and as clinically appropriate (see section 4.2). No dose modification of trametinib is required \n\nwhen taken in combination with dabrafenib. \n\n \n\nLVEF reduction/Left ventricular dysfunction \n\n \n\nDabrafenib in combination with trametinib has been reported to decrease LVEF (see section 4.8). \n\nPlease refer to the trametinib SmPC for additional information (see section 4.4). No dose modification \n\nof dabrafenib is required when taken in combination with trametinib. \n\n \n\nRenal failure \n\n \n\nRenal failure has been identified in <1% of patients treated with dabrafenib alone and in ≤1% of \n\npatients treated with dabrafenib in combination with trametinib. Observed cases were generally \n\nassociated with pyrexia and dehydration and responded well to dose interruption and general \n\nsupportive measures. Granulomatous nephritis has been reported (see section 4.8). Patients should be \n\nroutinely monitored for serum creatinine while on therapy. If creatinine increases, dabrafenib may \n\nneed to be interrupted as clinically appropriate. Dabrafenib has not been studied in patients with renal \n\ninsufficiency (defined as creatinine >1.5 x ULN) therefore caution should be used in this setting (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic events \n\n \n\nHepatic adverse events have been reported in clinical trials with dabrafenib in combination with \n\ntrametinib (see section 4.8). It is recommended that patients receiving treatment with dabrafenib in \n\ncombination with trametinib have liver function monitored every four weeks for 6 months after \n\ntreatment initiation with trametinib. Liver monitoring may be continued thereafter as clinically \n\nindicated. Please refer to the trametinib SmPC for additional information. \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\n \n\nElevations in blood pressure have been reported in association with dabrafenib in combination with \n\ntrametinib, in patients with or without pre-existing hypertension (see section 4.8). Please refer to the \n\ntrametinib SmPC for additional information. \n\n \n\nInterstitial lung disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis \n\n \n\nCases of pneumonitis or ILD have been reported in clinical trials with dabrafenib in combination with \n\ntrametinib. Please refer to the trametinib SmPC section 4.4 for additional information. If dabrafenib is \n\nbeing used in combination with trametinib then therapy with dabrafenib may be continued at the same \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nRash \n\n \n\nRash has been observed in about 24% of patients in clinical trials when dabrafenib is used in \n\ncombination with trametinib (see section 4.8). The majority of these cases were Grade 1 or 2 and did \n\nnot require any dose interruptions or dose reductions. Please refer to the trametinib SmPC section 4.4 \n\nfor additional information. \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nRhabdomyolysis \n\n \n\nRhabdomyolysis has been reported in patients taking dabrafenib in combination with trametinib (see \n\nsection 4.8). Please refer to the trametinib SmPC section 4.4 for additional information. \n\n \n\nPancreatitis \n\n \n\nPancreatitis has been reported in <1% of patients treated with dabrafenib as monotherapy and in \n\ncombination with trametinib in unresectable or metastatic melanoma clinical trials and about 4% of \n\npatients treated with dabrafenib in combination with trametinib in the NSCLC clinical trial. One of the \n\nevents occurred on the first day of dabrafenib dosing of a metastatic melanoma patient and recurred \n\nfollowing re-challenge at a reduced dose. In the adjuvant treatment of melanoma trial, pancreatitis was \n\nreported in <1% (1/435) of patients receiving dabrafenib in combination with trametinib, and no \n\npatients receiving placebo. Unexplained abdominal pain should be promptly investigated to include \n\nmeasurement of serum amylase and lipase. Patients should be closely monitored when re-starting \n\ndabrafenib after an episode of pancreatitis. \n\n \n\nDeep vein thrombosis/Pulmonary embolism \n\n \n\nPulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis can occur when dabrafenib is used in combination with \n\ntrametinib. If patients develop symptoms of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis such as \n\nshortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling, they should immediately seek medical care. \n\nPermanently discontinue trametinib and dabrafenib for life-threatening pulmonary embolism. \n\n \n\nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions \n\n \n\nCases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and drug \n\nreaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, \n\nhave been reported during treatment with dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy. Before initiating \n\ntreatment, patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for skin \n\nreactions. If signs and symptoms suggestive of SCARs appear, dabrafenib and trametinib should be \n\nwithdrawn. \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\n \n\nColitis and gastrointestinal perforation, including fatal outcome, have been reported in patients taking \n\ndabrafenib in combination with trametinib (see section 4.8). Please refer to the trametinib SmPC for \n\nadditional information (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nEffects of other medicinal products on dabrafenib \n\n \n\nDabrafenib is a substrate of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. Potent inducers of these enzymes should be \n\navoided when possible as these agents may decrease the efficacy of dabrafenib (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nEffects of dabrafenib on other medicinal products \n\n \n\nDabrafenib is an inducer of metabolising enzymes which may lead to loss of efficacy of many \n\ncommonly used medicinal products (see examples in section 4.5). A drug utilisation review (DUR) is \n\ntherefore essential when initiating dabrafenib treatment. Concomitant use of dabrafenib with medicinal \n\nproducts that are sensitive substrates of certain metabolising enzymes or transporters (see section 4.5) \n\nshould generally be avoided if monitoring for efficacy and dose adjustment is not possible. \n\n \n\nConcomitant administration of dabrafenib with warfarin results in decreased warfarin exposure. \n\nCaution should be exercised and additional International Normalised Ratio (INR) monitoring is \n\nrecommended when dabrafenib is used concomitantly with warfarin and at discontinuation of \n\ndabrafenib (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nConcomitant administration of dabrafenib with digoxin may result in decreased digoxin exposure. \n\nCaution should be exercised and additional monitoring of digoxin is recommended when digoxin (a \n\ntransporter substrate) is used concomitantly with dabrafenib and at discontinuation of dabrafenib (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nEffect of other medicinal products on dabrafenib \n\n \n\nDabrafenib is a substrate for the metabolising enzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, while the active \n\nmetabolites hydroxy-dabrafenib and desmethyl-dabrafenib are CYP3A4 substrates. Medicinal \n\nproducts that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 are therefore likely to increase \n\nor decrease, respectively, dabrafenib concentrations. Alternative agents should be considered during \n\nadministration with dabrafenib when possible. Use caution if strong inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, \n\ngemfibrozil, nefazodone, clarithromycin, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, itraconazole, \n\nvoriconazole, posaconazole, atazanavir) are co-administered with dabrafenib. Avoid co-administration \n\nof dabrafenib with potent inducers (e.g. rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or St \n\nJohn’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)) of CYP2C8 or CYP3A4. \n\n \n\nAdministration of ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor) 400 mg once daily, with dabrafenib 75 mg \n\ntwice daily, resulted in a 71% increase in dabrafenib AUC and a 33% increase in dabrafenib Cmax \n\nrelative to administration of dabrafenib 75 mg twice daily alone. Co-administration resulted in \n\nincreases in hydroxy- and desmethyl-dabrafenib AUC (increases of 82% and 68%, respectively). A \n\ndecrease of 16% in AUC was noted for carboxy-dabrafenib. \n\n \n\nAdministration of gemfibrozil (a CYP2C8 inhibitor) 600 mg twice daily, with dabrafenib 75 mg twice \n\ndaily, resulted in a 47% increase in dabrafenib AUC but did not alter dabrafenib Cmax relative to \n\nadministration of dabrafenib 75 mg twice daily alone. Gemfibrozil had no clinically relevant effect on \n\nthe systemic exposure to dabrafenib metabolites (≤13%). \n\n \n\nAdministration of rifampin (a CYP3A4/CYP2C8 inducer) 600 mg once daily with dabrafenib 150 mg \n\ntwice daily resulted in a decrease in repeat dose dabrafenib Cmax (27%) and AUC (34%). No relevant \n\nchange in AUC was noted for hydroxy-dabrafenib. There was an increase in AUC of 73% for \n\ncarboxy-dabrafenib and a decrease in AUC of 30% for desmethyl-dabrafenib. \n\n \n\nCo-administration of repeat doses of dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and the pH-elevating agent \n\nrabeprazole 40 mg once daily resulted in a 3% increase in AUC and a 12% decrease in dabrafenib \n\nCmax. These changes in dabrafenib AUC and Cmax are considered not clinically meaningful. Medicinal \n\nproducts that alter the pH of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, \n\nH2-receptor antagonists, antacids) are not expected to reduce the bioavailability of dabrafenib. \n\n \n\nEffect of dabrafenib on other medicinal products \n\n \n\nDabrafenib is an enzyme inducer and increases the synthesis of drug-metabolising enzymes including \n\nCYP3A4, CYP2Cs and CYP2B6 and may increase the synthesis of transporters. This results in \n\nreduced plasma levels of medicinal products metabolised by these enzymes, and may affect some \n\ntransported medicinal products. The reduction in plasma concentrations can lead to lost or reduced \n\nclinical effect of these medicinal products. There is also a risk of increased formation of active \n\nmetabolites of these medicinal products. Enzymes that may be induced include CYP3A in the liver \n\nand gut, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and UGTs (glucuronide conjugating enzymes). The \n\ntransport protein Pgp may also be induced as well as other transporters, e.g. MRP-2. Induction of \n\nOATP1B1/1B3 and BCRP is not likely based on the observations from a clinical study with \n\nrosuvastatin. \n\n \n\nIn vitro, dabrafenib produced dose-dependent increases in CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. In a clinical drug \n\ninteraction study, Cmax and AUC of oral midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate) decreased by 47% and 65%, \n\nrespectively with co-administration of repeat-dose dabrafenib. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nAdministration of dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and warfarin resulted in a decrease in AUC of S- and \n\nR- warfarin of 37% and 33%, respectively, compared to administration of warfarin alone. Cmax of \n\nS- and R-warfarin increased 18% and 19%. \n\n \n\nInteractions with many medicinal products eliminated through metabolism or active transport is \n\nexpected. If their therapeutic effect is of large importance to the patient, and dose adjustments are not \n\neasily performed based on monitoring of efficacy or plasma concentrations, these medicinal products \n\nare to be avoided or used with caution. The risk for liver injury after paracetamol administration is \n\nsuspected to be higher in patients concomitantly treated with enzyme inducers. \n\n \n\nThe number of affected medicinal products is expected to be large; although the magnitude of the \n\ninteraction will vary. Groups of medicinal products that can be affected include, but are not limited to: \n\n Analgesics (e.g. fentanyl, methadone) \n\n Antibiotics (e.g. clarithromycin, doxycycline) \n\n Anticancer agents (e.g. cabazitaxel) \n\n Anticoagulants (e.g. acenocoumarol, warfarin, see section 4.4) \n\n Antiepileptic (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, valproic acid) \n\n Antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol) \n\n Calcium channel blockers (e.g. diltiazem, felodipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, verapamil) \n\n Cardiac glycosides (e.g. digoxin, see section 4.4) \n\n Corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone, methylprednisolone) \n\n HIV antivirals (e.g. amprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, delavirdine, efavirenz, fosamprenavir, \nindinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, tipranavir) \n\n Hormonal contraceptives (see section 4.6) \n\n Hypnotics (e.g. diazepam, midazolam, zolpidem) \n\n Immunosuppressants (e.g. cyclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus) \n\n Statins metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. atorvastatin, simvastatin) \n \n\nOnset of induction is likely to occur after 3 days of repeat dosing with dabrafenib. Upon \n\ndiscontinuation of dabrafenib offset of induction is gradual, concentrations of sensitive CYP3A4, \n\nCYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, UDP glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) and transporter \n\nsubstrates (e.g. Pgp or MRP-2) may increase and patients should be monitored for toxicity and dose of \n\nthese agents may need to be adjusted. \n\n \n\nIn vitro, dabrafenib is a mechanism based inhibitor of CYP3A4. Therefore, transient inhibition of \n\nCYP3A4 may be observed during the first few days of treatment. \n\n \n\nEffects of dabrafenib on substance transport systems \n\n \n\nDabrafenib is an in vitro inhibitor of human organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 \n\n(OATP1B1), OATP1B3 and BCRP. Following co-administration of a single dose of rosuvastatin \n\n(OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and BCRP substrate) with repeat-dose dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily in \n\n16 patients, Cmax of rosuvastatin increased 2.6-fold whereas the AUC was only minimally changed \n\n(7% increase). The increased Cmax of rosuvastatin is unlikely to have clinical relevance. \n\n \n\nCombination with trametinib \n\n \n\nCo-administration of repeat dosing of trametinib 2 mg once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily \n\nresulted in no clinically meaningful changes in trametinib or dabrafenib Cmax and AUC with increases \n\nof 16 and 23%, respectively, in dabrafenib Cmax and AUC. A small decrease in trametinib \n\nbioavailability, corresponding to a decrease in AUC of 12%, was estimated when trametinib is \n\nadministered in combination with dabrafenib, a CYP3A4 inducer, using a population pharmacokinetic \n\nanalysis. \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nWhen dabrafenib is used in combination with trametinib refer to the guidance for medicinal product \n\ninteractions found in sections 4.4 and 4.5 of dabrafenib and trametinib SmPC. \n\n \n\nEffect of food on dabrafenib \n\n \n\nPatients should take dabrafenib as monotherapy or in combination with trametinib at least one hour \n\nprior to or two hours after a meal due to the effect of food on dabrafenib absorption (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in females \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective methods of contraception during therapy and for \n\n2 weeks following discontinuation of dabrafenib and 16 weeks following the last dose of trametinib \n\nwhen given in combination with dabrafenib. Dabrafenib may decrease the efficacy of oral or any \n\nsystemic hormonal contraceptives and an effective alternative method of contraception should be used \n\n(see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no data from the use of dabrafenib in pregnant women. Animal studies have shown \n\nreproductive toxicity and embryo-foetal developmental toxicities, including teratogenic effects (see \n\nsection 5.3). Dabrafenib should not be administered to pregnant women unless the potential benefit to \n\nthe mother outweighs the possible risk to the foetus. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking \n\ndabrafenib, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the foetus. Please see trametinib \n\nSmPC (see section 4.6) when used in combination with trametinib. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether dabrafenib is excreted in human milk. Because many medicinal products are \n\nexcreted in human milk, a risk to the breast-feeding child cannot be excluded. A decision should be \n\nmade whether to discontinue breast-feeding or discontinue dabrafenib, taking into account the benefit \n\nof breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no data in humans for dabrafenib as monotherapy or in combination with trametinib. \n\nDabrafenib may impair male and female fertility as adverse effects on male and female reproductive \n\norgans have been seen in animals (see section 5.3). Male patients taking dabrafenib as monotherapy or \n\nin combination with trametinib should be informed of the potential risk for impaired spermatogenesis, \n\nwhich may be irreversible. Please see trametinib SmPC (see section 4.6) when used in combination \n\nwith trametinib. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nDabrafenib has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. The clinical status of the \n\npatient and the adverse reaction profile of dabrafenib should be borne in mind when considering the \n\npatient's ability to perform tasks that require judgement, motor or cognitive skills.

The most common adverse reactions (incidence \n\n15%) reported with dabrafenib were hyperkeratosis, headache, pyrexia, arthralgia, fatigue, nausea, \n\npapilloma, alopecia, rash, and vomiting. \n\n \n\nThe safety of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib has been evaluated in the integrated safety \n\npopulation of 1076 patients with BRAF V600 mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma, Stage III \n\nBRAF V600 mutant melanoma following complete resection (adjuvant treatment) and advanced \n\nNSCLC treated with dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily. Of these patients, \n\n559 were treated with the combination for BRAF V600 mutant melanoma in two randomised Phase III \n\nclinical trials, MEK115306 (COMBI-d) and MEK116513 (COMBI-v), 435 were treated with the \n\ncombination in the adjuvant treatment of Stage III BRAF V600 mutant melanoma after complete \n\nresection in a randomised Phase III study BRF115532 (COMBI-AD) and 82 were treated with the \n\ncombination for BRAF V600 mutant NSCLC in a multi-cohort, non-randomised Phase II study \n\nBRF113928 (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nThe most common adverse reactions (incidence 20%) for dabrafenib in combination with trametinib \n\nwere: pyrexia, fatigue, nausea, chills, headache, diarrhoea, vomiting, arthralgia and rash. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse drug reactions are listed below by MedDRA system organ class ranked by frequency using \n\nthe following convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (1/1,000 to \n\n<1/100), rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from \n\nthe available data).

Erythema, generalised erythema \ni Muscle spasms, musculoskeletal stiffness \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nCutaneous squamous cell carcinoma \n\nFor dabrafenib monotherapy in study MEK115306, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (including \n\nthose classified as keratoacanthoma or mixed keratoacanthoma subtype) occurred in 10% of patients \n\nand approximately 70% of the events occurred within the first 12 weeks of treatment with a median \n\ntime to onset of 8 weeks. In the integrated safety population for dabrafenib in combination with \n\ntrametinib, 2% of patients developed cuSCC and the events occurred later than with dabrafenib \n\nmonotherapy with a median time to onset of 18-31 weeks. All patients receiving dabrafenib as \n\nmonotherapy or in combination with trametinib who developed cuSCC continued on treatment without \n\ndose modification. \n\n \n\nNew primary melanoma \n\nNew primary melanomas have been reported in clinical trials with dabrafenib as monotherapy and in \n\ncombination with trametinib in melanoma studies. Cases were managed with excision and did not \n\nrequire treatment modification (see section 4.4). No new primary melanoma was reported from the \n\nPhase II NSCLC study (BRF113928). \n\n \n\nNon-cutaneous malignancy \n\nActivation of MAP-kinase signalling in BRAF wild type cells which are exposed to BRAF inhibitors \n\nmay lead to increased risk of non-cutaneous malignancies, including those with RAS mutations (see \n\nsection 4.4). Non-cutaneous malignancies were reported in 1% (6/586) of patients in the integrated \n\nsafety population of dabrafenib monotherapy, and <1% (8/1076) of patients in the integrated safety \n\npopulation of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib. Cases of RAS-driven malignancies have \n\nbeen seen with dabrafenib as monotherapy and in combination with trametinib. Patients should be \n\nmonitored as clinically appropriate. \n\n \n\nHaemorrhage \n\nHaemorrhagic events, including major haemorrhagic events and fatal haemorrhages, have occurred in \n\npatients taking dabrafenib in combination with trametinib. Please refer to the trametinib SmPC. \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nLVEF reduction/Left ventricular dysfunction \n\nDecreased LVEF has been reported in 6% (65/1076) of patients in the integrated safety population of \n\ndabrafenib in combination with trametinib. Most cases were asymptomatic and reversible. Patients \n\nwith LVEF lower than the institutional lower limit of normal were not included in clinical trials with \n\ndabrafenib. Dabrafenib in combination with trametinib should be used with caution in patients with \n\nconditions that could impair left ventricular function. Please refer to the trametinib SmPC. \n\n \n\nPyrexia \n\nFever has been reported in clinical trials with dabrafenib as monotherapy and in combination with \n\ntrametinib; the incidence and severity of pyrexia are increased with the combination therapy (see \n\nsection 4.4). For patients who received dabrafenib in combination with trametinib and developed \n\npyrexia, approximately half of the first occurrences of pyrexia happened within the first month of \n\ntherapy and approximately one-third of the patients had 3 or more events. In 1% of patients receiving \n\ndabrafenib as monotherapy in the integrated safety population, serious non-infectious febrile events \n\nwere identified as fever accompanied by severe rigors, dehydration, hypotension and/or acute renal \n\ninsufficiency or pre-renal origin in subjects with normal baseline renal function. The onset of these \n\nserious non-infectious febrile events was typically within the first month of therapy. Patients with \n\nserious non-infectious febrile events responded well to dose interruption and/or dose reduction and \n\nsupportive care (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \n\nHepatic events \n\nHepatic adverse events have been reported in clinical trials with dabrafenib in combination with \n\ntrametinib. Please refer to the trametinib SmPC. \n\n \n\nHypertension \n\nElevations in blood pressure have been reported in association with dabrafenib in combination with \n\ntrametinib, in patients with or without pre-existing hypertension. Blood pressure should be measured \n\nat baseline and monitored during treatment, with control of hypertension by standard therapy as \n\nappropriate. \n\n \n\nArthralgia \n\nArthralgia was reported very commonly in the integrated safety population of dabrafenib monotherapy \n\n(25%) and dabrafenib in combination with trametinib (25%) although these were mainly Grade 1 and \n\n2 in severity with Grade 3 occurring uncommonly (<1%) and no Grade 4 occurrences being reported. \n\n \n\nHypophosphataemia \n\nHypophosphataemia has been reported commonly in the integrated safety population of dabrafenib \n\nmonotherapy (7%) and of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib (4%). It should be noted that \n\napproximately half of these occurrences with dabrafenib monotherapy (4%) and 1% with dabrafenib in \n\ncombination with trametinib were Grade 3 in severity.  \n\n \n\nPancreatitis \n\nPancreatitis has been reported in dabrafenib monotherapy and in combination with trametinib. \n\nUnexplained abdominal pain should be promptly investigated to include measurement of serum \n\namylase and lipase. Patients should be closely monitored when re-starting dabrafenib after an episode \n\nof pancreatitis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal failure \n\nRenal failure due to pyrexia-associated pre-renal azotaemia or granulomatous nephritis was \n\nuncommon; however dabrafenib has not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency (defined as \n\ncreatinine >1.5 x ULN). Caution should be used in this setting (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nOf the total number of patients in the integrated safety population of dabrafenib monotherapy (n=578), \n\n22% were 65 years of age and older, and 6% were 75 years of age and older. Compared with younger \n\nsubjects (<65), more subjects 65 years old had adverse reactions that led to study drug dose \n\nreductions (22% versus 12%) or interruptions (39% versus 27%). In addition, older patients \n\nexperienced more serious adverse reactions compared to younger patients (41% versus 22%). No \n\noverall differences in efficacy were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. \n\n \n\nIn the integrated safety population of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib (n=1076), \n\n265 patients (25%) were ≥65 years of age, 62 patients (6%) were ≥75 years of age. The proportion of \n\npatients experiencing AEs was similar in those aged <65 years and those aged ≥65 years in all clinical \n\ntrials. Patients ≥65 years were more likely to experience SAEs and AEs leading to permanent \n\ndiscontinuation of medicinal product, dose reduction and dose interruption than those <65 years. \n\n \n\nDabrafenib in combination with trametinib in patients with brain metastases \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib have been evaluated in a \n\nmulti-cohort, open-label, Phase II study in patients with BRAF V600 mutant melanoma with brain \n\nmetastases. The safety profile observed in these patients appears to be consistent with the integrated \n\nsafety profile of the combination. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nThere is no specific treatment for an overdose of dabrafenib. If overdose occurs, the patient should be \n\ntreated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE23 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nDabrafenib is an inhibitor of RAF kinases. Oncogenic mutations in BRAF lead to constitutive \n\nactivation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. BRAF mutations have been identified at a high \n\nfrequency in specific cancers, including approximately 50% of melanoma. The most commonly \n\nobserved BRAF mutation is V600E which accounts for approximately 90% of the BRAF mutations \n\nthat are seen in melanoma. \n \n\nPreclinical data generated in biochemical assays demonstrated that dabrafenib inhibits BRAF kinases \n\nwith activating codon 600 mutations (Table 5). \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n21 \n\nTable 5 Kinase inhibitory activity of dabrafenib against RAF kinases \n\n \n\nKinase Inhibitory concentration 50 (nM) \n\nBRAF V600E 0.65 \n\nBRAF V600K 0.50 \n\nBRAF V600D 1.8 \n\nBRAF WT 3.2 \n\nCRAF WT 5.0 \n\n \n\nDabrafenib demonstrated suppression of a downstream pharmacodynamic biomarker (phosphorylated \n\nERK) and inhibited cell growth of BRAF V600 mutant melanoma cell lines, in vitro and in animal \n\nmodels. \n\n \n\nIn subjects with BRAF V600 mutation positive melanoma, administration of dabrafenib resulted in \n\ninhibition of tumour phosphorylated ERK relative to baseline. \n\n \n\nCombination with trametinib \n\nTrametinib is a reversible, highly selective, allosteric inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular \n\nsignal regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 activation and kinase activity. MEK proteins are \n\ncomponents of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway. Thus, trametinib and dabrafenib \n\ninhibit two kinases in this pathway, MEK and RAF, and therefore the combination provides \n\nconcomitant inhibition of the pathway. The combination of dabrafenib with trametinib has shown \n\nanti-tumour activity in BRAF V600 mutation positive melanoma cell lines in vitro and delays the \n\nemergence of resistance in vivo in BRAF V600 mutation positive melanoma xenografts. \n\n \n\nDetermination of BRAF mutation status \n\nBefore taking dabrafenib or combination with trametinib, patients must have BRAF V600 \n\nmutation-positive tumour status confirmed by a validated test. In the Phase II and III clinical trials, \n\nscreening for eligibility required central testing for BRAF V600 mutation using a BRAF mutation \n\nassay conducted on the most recent tumour sample available. Primary tumour or tumour from a \n\nmetastatic site was tested with an investigational use only assay (IUO). The IUO is an allele-specific \n\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay performed on DNA extracted from formalin-fixed \n\nparaffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour tissue. The assay was specifically designed to differentiate between \n\nthe V600E and V600K mutations. Only subjects with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation positive \n\ntumours were eligible for study participation. \n\n \n\nSubsequently, all patient samples were re-tested using the bioMerieux (bMx) THxID BRAF validated \n\nassay, which has CE marking. The bMx THxID BRAF assay is an allele-specific PCR performed on \n\nDNA extracted from FFPE tumour tissue. The assay was designed to detect the BRAF V600E and \n\nV600K mutations with high sensitivity (down to 5% V600E and V600K sequence in a background of \n\nwild-type sequence using DNA extracted from FFPE tissue). Non-clinical and clinical trials with \n\nretrospective bi-directional Sanger sequencing analyses have shown that the test also detects the less \n\ncommon BRAF V600D mutation and V600E/K601E mutation with lower sensitivity. Of the \n\nspecimens from the non-clinical and clinical trials (n=876) that were mutation positive by the THxID \n\nBRAF assay and subsequently were sequenced using the reference method, the specificity of the assay \n\nwas 94%. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n22 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nUnresectable or metastatic melanoma \n\n Dabrafenib in combination with trametinib \nTreatment-naïve patients \n\nThe efficacy and safety of the recommended dose of trametinib (2 mg once daily) in combination with \n\ndabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic \n\nmelanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation was studied in two Phase III trials and one supportive \n\nPhase I/II study. \n\n \n\nMEK115306 (COMBI-d): \n\nMEK115306 was a Phase III, randomised, double-blinded study comparing the combination of \n\ndabrafenib and trametinib to dabrafenib and placebo in first-line therapy for subjects with unresectable \n\n(Stage IIIC) or metastatic (Stage IV) BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma. The \n\nprimary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival (PFS), with a key secondary endpoint of \n\noverall survival (OS). Subjects were stratified by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (> the upper limit \n\nof normal (ULN) versus ≤ULN) and BRAF mutation (V600E versus V600K). \n\n \n\nA total of 423 subjects were randomised 1:1 to either combination (N=211) or dabrafenib (N=212). \n\nMost subjects were Caucasian (>99%) and male (53%), with a median age of 56 years (28% were \n\n≥65 years). The majority of subjects had Stage IVM1c disease (67%). Most subjects had LDH ≤ULN \n\n(65%), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 (72%), and visceral \n\ndisease (73%) at baseline. The majority of subjects had a BRAF V600E mutation (85%). Subjects with \n\nbrain metastases were not included in the trial. \n\n \n\nMedian OS and estimated 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4 year and 5-year survival rates are presented in \n\nTable 6. From an OS analysis at 5 years, the median OS for the combination arm was approximately \n\n7 months longer than for dabrafenib monotherapy (25.8 months versus 18.7 months) with 5-year \n\nsurvival rates of 32% for the combination versus 27% for dabrafenib monotherapy (Table 6, Figure 1). \n\nThe Kaplan-Meier OS curve appears to stabilise from 3 to 5 years (see Figure 1).

The primary endpoint of the study was OS with a key secondary \n\nendpoint of PFS. Subjects were stratified by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (> the upper limit of \n\nnormal (ULN) versus ≤ULN) and BRAF mutation (V600E versus V600K). \n\n \n\nA total of 704 subjects were randomised 1:1 to either combination or vemurafenib. Most subjects were \n\nCaucasian (>96%) and male (55%), with a median age of 55 years (24% were ≥65 years). The \n\nmajority of subjects had Stage IV M1c disease (61% overall). Most subjects had LDH ≤ULN (67%), \n\nECOG performance status of 0 (70%), and visceral disease (78%) at Baseline. Overall, 54% of \n\nsubjects had <3 disease sites at baseline. The majority of subjects had BRAF V600E mutation-positive \n\nmelanoma (89%).

Intracranial response assessed by the \n\ninvestigator in Cohorts B, C and D were secondary endpoints of the study.

Patients with melanoma driven by BRAF mutations other than V600E were \n\nexcluded from the confirmatory trial and with respect to patients with the V600K mutation in single \n\narm clinical trials the activity appears lower than in V600E tumours. \n\n \n\nNo data is available in patients with melanoma harbouring BRAF V600 mutations others than V600E \n\nand V600K. Efficacy of dabrafenib in subjects previously treated with a protein kinase inhibitor has \n\nnot been investigated. \n\n \n\nPreviously untreated patients (results from the Phase III study [BREAK-3]) \n\nThe efficacy and safety of dabrafenib were evaluated in a Phase III randomised, open-label study \n\n[BREAK 3] comparing dabrafenib to dacarbazine (DTIC) in previously untreated patients with BRAF \n\nV600E mutation positive advanced (unresectable Stage III) or metastatic (Stage IV) melanoma. \n\nPatients with melanoma driven by BRAF mutations other than V600E were excluded. \n\n \n\nThe primary objective for this study was to evaluate the efficacy of dabrafenib compared to DTIC with \n\nrespect to PFS per investigator assessment. Patients on the DTIC arm were allowed to cross over to \n\ndabrafenib after independent radiographic confirmation of initial progression. Baseline characteristics \n\nwere balanced between treatment groups.

Enrollment required \n\ncomplete resection of melanoma with complete lymphadenectomy within 12 weeks prior to \n\nrandomisation. Any prior systemic anti-cancer treatment, including radiotherapy, was not allowed. \n\nPatients with a history of prior malignancy, if disease-free for at least 5 years, were eligible. Patients \n\npresenting with malignancies with confirmed activating RAS mutations were not eligible. Patients \n\nwere stratified by BRAF mutation status (V600E versus V600K) and stage of disease prior to surgery \n\nusing the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition Melanoma Staging System (by \nStage III sub-stage, indicating different levels of lymph node involvement and primary tumour size \n\n\n\n31 \n\nand ulceration). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed relapse-free survival (RFS), defined \n\nas the time from randomisation to disease recurrence or death from any cause. Radiological tumour \n\nassessment was conducted every 3 months for the first two years and every 6 months thereafter, until \n\nfirst relapse was observed. Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS; key secondary \n\nendpoint), freedom from relapse (FFR) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). \n\n \n\nA total of 870 patients were randomised to the combination therapy (n=438) and placebo (n=432) \n\narms. Most patients were Caucasian (99%) and male (55%), with a median age of 51 years (18% were \n\n≥65 years). The study included patients with all sub-stages of Stage III disease prior to resection; 18% \n\nof these patients had lymph node involvement only identifiable by microscope and no primary tumour \n\nulceration. The majority of patients had a BRAF V600E mutation (91%). The median duration of \n\nfollow-up (time from randomisation to last contact or death) was 2.83 years in the dabrafenib and \n\ntrametinib combination arm and 2.75 years in the placebo arm. \n\n \n\nResults for the primary analysis of RFS are presented in Table 14. The study showed a statistically \n\nsignificant difference for the primary outcome of RFS between treatment arms, with a median RFS of \n\n16.6 months for the placebo arm and not yet reached for the combination arm (HR: 0.47; 95% \n\nconfidence interval: (0.39, 0.58); p=1.53×10-14). The observed RFS benefit was consistently \n\ndemonstrated across subgroups of patients including age, sex and race.

The primary endpoint was ORR using the RECIST 1.1 assessed \n\nby the investigator. Secondary endpoints included DoR, PFS, OS, safety and population \n\npharmacokinetics. ORR, DoR and PFS were also assessed by an Independent Review Committee \n\n(IRC) as a sensitivity analysis. \n\n \n\nCohorts were enrolled sequentially: \n\n Cohort A: Monotherapy (dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily), 84 patients enrolled. 78 patients had \nprevious systemic treatment for their metastatic disease. \n\n Cohort B: Combination therapy (dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once \ndaily), 59 patients enrolled. 57 patients had 1-3 lines of previous systemic treatment for their \n\nmetastatic disease. 2 patients had no previous systemic treatment and were included in the \n\nanalysis for patients enrolled in Cohort C. \n\n Cohort C: Combination therapy (dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once \ndaily), 34 patients. All patients received study medicinal product as first-line treatment for \n\nmetastatic disease. \n\n \n\nAmong the total of 93 patients who were enrolled in the combination therapy cohorts B and C, most \n\npatients were Caucasian (>90%), and similar female versus male (54% versus 46%), with a median \n\nage of 64 years in second line or higher patients and 68 years in the first line patients. Most patients \n\n(94%) enrolled in the combination therapy treated cohorts had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. \n\n26 (28%) had never smoked. The majority of patients had a non-squamous histology. In the previously \n\ntreated population, 38 patients (67%) had one line of systemic anti-cancer therapy for metastatic \n\ndisease. \n\n \n\nFor the primary endpoint of investigator-assessed ORR, the ORR in the first line population was \n\n61.1% (95% CI, 43.5%, 76.9%) and in the previously treated population was 66.7% (95% CI, 52.9%, \n\n78.6%). These met the statistical significance to reject the null hypothesis that the ORR of dabrafenib \n\nin combination with trametinib for this NSCLC population was less than or equal to 30%. The ORR \n\nresults assessed by IRC were consistent with the investigator assessment. The response was durable \n\nwith median DoR in the previously treated population reaching 9.8 months (95% CI, 6.9, 16.0) by \n\ninvestigator assessment. In the first line population, 68% of patients had not progressed after 9 months. \n\nThe median DoR and PFS were not yet estimable (Table 15).

In the Phase III study MEK115306 no \n\npatients treated with trametinib in combination with dabrafenib had worst-case QTcB prolongation to \n\n>500 msec; QTcB was increased more than 60 msec from baseline in 1% (3/209) of patients. In the \n\nPhase III study MEK116513 four patients (1%) treated with trametinib in combination with dabrafenib \n\nhad a QTcB Grade 3 increase (>500 msec). Two of these patients had a QTcB Grade 3 increase \n\n(>500 msec) that was also an increase >60 msec from baseline. \n\n \n\nThe potential effect of dabrafenib on QT prolongation was assessed in a dedicated multiple dose QT \n\nstudy. A supratherapeutic dose of 300 mg dabrafenib twice daily was administered in 32 subjects with \n\nBRAF V600 mutation-positive tumours. No clinically relevant effect of dabrafenib or its metabolites \n\non the QTc interval was observed. \n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\ndabrafenib in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in melanoma and solid malignant \n\ntumours (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n35 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nDabrafenib is absorbed orally with median time to achieve peak plasma concentration of 2 hours \n\npost-dose. Mean absolute bioavailability of oral dabrafenib is 95% (90% CI: 81, 110%). Dabrafenib \n\nexposure (Cmax and AUC) increased in a dose proportional manner between 12 and 300 mg following \n\nsingle-dose administration, but the increase was less than dose-proportional after repeat twice daily \n\ndosing. A decrease in exposure was observed with repeat dosing, likely due to induction of its own \n\nmetabolism. Mean accumulation AUC Day 18/Day 1 ratios was 0.73. Following administration of \n\n150 mg twice daily, geometric mean Cmax, AUC(0-) and predose concentration (C) were 1478 ng/ml, \n\n4341 ng*hr/ml and 26 ng/ml, respectively. \n\n \n\nAdministration of dabrafenib with food reduced the bioavailability (Cmax and AUC decreased by 51% \n\nand 31% respectively) and delayed absorption of dabrafenib capsules when compared to the fasted \n\nstate. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nDabrafenib binds to human plasma protein and is 99.7% bound. The steady-state volume of \n\ndistribution following intravenous microdose administration is 46 L. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nThe metabolism of dabrafenib is primarily mediated by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 to form \n\nhydroxy-dabrafenib, which is further oxidised via CYP3A4 to form carboxy-dabrafenib. \n\nCarboxy-dabrafenib can be decarboxylated via a non-enzymatic process to form \n\ndesmethyl-dabrafenib. Carboxy-dabrafenib is excreted in bile and urine. Desmethyl-dabrafenib may \n\nalso be formed in the gut and reabsorbed. Desmethyl-dabrafenib is metabolised by CYP3A4 to \n\noxidative metabolites. Hydroxy-dabrafenib terminal half-life parallels that of parent with a half-life of \n\n10 hrs while the carboxy- and desmethyl-metabolites exhibited longer half-lives (21-22 hours). Mean \n\nmetabolite to parent AUC ratios following repeat-dose administration were 0.9, 11 and 0.7 for \n\nhydroxy-, carboxy-, and desmethyl-dabrafenib, respectively. Based on exposure, relative potency, and \n\npharmacokinetic properties, both hydroxy- and desmethyl-dabrafenib are likely to contribute to the \n\nclinical activity of dabrafenib while the activity of carboxy-dabrafenib is not likely to be significant. \n\n \n\nIn vitro evaluation of drug-drug interaction potential \n\n \n\nDabrafenib is a substrate of human P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and human BCRP in vitro. However, these \n\ntransporters have minimal impact on dabrafenib oral bioavailability and elimination and the risk for \n\nclinically relevant drug-drug interactions with inhibitors of Pgp or BCRP is low. Neither dabrafenib \n\nnor its 3 main metabolites were demonstrated to be inhibitors of Pgp in vitro. \n\n \n\nAlthough dabrafenib and its metabolites, hydroxy-dabrafenib, carboxy-dabrafenib and \n\ndesmethyl-dabrafenib, were inhibitors of human organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 and OAT3 \n\nin vitro, and dabrafenib and its desmethyl metabolite were found to be inhibitors of organic cation \n\ntransporter 2 (OCT2) in vitro, the risk of a drug-drug interaction at these transporters is minimal based \n\non clinical exposure of dabrafenib and its metabolites. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n36 \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nTerminal half-life of dabrafenib following an intravenous single microdose is 2.6 hours. Dabrafenib \n\nterminal half-life after a single oral dose is 8 hours due to absorption-limited elimination after oral \n\nadministration (flip-flop pharmacokinetics). IV plasma clearance is 12 l/hr. \n\n \n\nAfter an oral dose, the major route of elimination of dabrafenib is metabolism, mediated via CYP3A4 \n\nand CYP2C8. Dabrafenib related material is excreted primarily in faeces, with 71% of an oral dose \n\nrecovered in faeces; 23% of the dose was recovered in urine in the form of metabolites only. \n\n \n\nSpecial patient populations \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that mildly elevated bilirubin and/or AST levels \n\n(based on National Cancer Institute [NCI] classification) do not significantly affect dabrafenib oral \n\nclearance. In addition, mild hepatic impairment as defined by bilirubin and AST did not have a \n\nsignificant effect on dabrafenib metabolite plasma concentrations. No data are available in patients \n\nwith moderate to severe hepatic impairment. As hepatic metabolism and biliary secretion are the \n\nprimary routes of elimination of dabrafenib and its metabolites, administration of dabrafenib should be \n\nundertaken with caution in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that mild renal impairment does not affect oral \n\nclearance of dabrafenib. Although data in moderate renal impairment are limited these data may \n\nindicate no clinically relevant effect. No data are available in subjects with severe renal impairment \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, age had no significant effect on dabrafenib \n\npharmacokinetics. Age greater than 75 years was a significant predictor of carboxy- and \n\ndesmethyl-dabrafenib plasma concentrations with a 40% greater exposure in subjects ≥75 years of age, \n\nrelative to subjects <75 years old. \n\n \n\nBody weight and gender \n\nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, gender and weight were found to influence \n\ndabrafenib oral clearance; weight also impacted oral volume of distribution and distributional \n\nclearance. These pharmacokinetic differences were not considered clinically relevant. \n\n \n\nRace \n\nThe population pharmacokinetic analysis showed no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of \n\ndabrafenib between Asian and Caucasian patients. There are insufficient data to evaluate the potential \n\neffect of other races on dabrafenib pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nNo studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of dabrafenib in paediatric \n\npatients. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n37 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nCarcinogenicity studies with dabrafenib have not been conducted. Dabrafenib was not mutagenic or \n\nclastogenic using in vitro tests in bacteria and cultured mammalian cells, and an in vivo rodent \n\nmicronucleus assay. \n\n \n\nIn combined female fertility, early embryonic and embryo-foetal development studies in rats numbers \n\nof ovarian corpora lutea were reduced in pregnant females at 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times \n\nhuman clinical exposure based on AUC), but there were no effects on oestrous cycle, mating or \n\nfertility indices. Developmental toxicity including embryo-lethality and ventricular septal defects and \n\nvariation in thymic shape were seen at 300 mg/kg/day, and delayed skeletal development and reduced \n\nfoetal body weight at ≥20 mg/kg/day (≥0.5 times human clinical exposure based on AUC). \n\n \n\nMale fertility studies with dabrafenib have not been conducted. However, in repeat dose studies, \n\ntesticular degeneration/depletion was seen in rats and dogs (≥0.2 times the human clinical exposure \n\nbased on AUC). Testicular changes in rat and dog were still present following a 4-week recovery \n\nperiod (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\nCardiovascular effects, including coronary arterial degeneration/necrosis and/or haemorrhage, cardiac \n\natrioventricular valve hypertrophy/haemorrhage and atrial fibrovascular proliferation were seen in \n\ndogs (≥2 times clinical exposure based on AUC). Focal arterial/perivascular inflammation in various \n\ntissues was observed in mice and an increased incidence of hepatic arterial degeneration and \n\nspontaneous cardiomyocyte degeneration with inflammation (spontaneous cardiomyopathy) was \n\nobserved in rats (≥0.5 and 0.6 times clinical exposure for rats and mice respectively). Hepatic effects, \n\nincluding hepatocellular necrosis and inflammation, were observed in mice (≥0.6 times clinical \n\nexposure). Bronchoalveolar inflammation of the lungs was observed in several dogs at ≥20 mg/kg/day \n\n(≥9 times human clinical exposure based on AUC) and was associated with shallow and/or laboured \n\nbreathing. \n\n \n\nReversible haematological effects have been observed in dogs and rats given dabrafenib. In studies of \n\nup to 13 weeks, decreases in reticulocyte counts and/or red cell mass were observed in dogs and rats \n\n(≥10 and 1.4 times clinical exposure, respectively). \n\n \n\nIn juvenile toxicity studies in rats, effects on growth (shorter long bone length), renal toxicity (tubular \n\ndeposits, increased incidence of cortical cysts and tubular basophilia and reversible increases in urea \n\nand/or creatinine concentrations) and testicular toxicity (degeneration and tubular dilation) were \n\nobserved (≥0.2 times adult human clinical exposure based on AUC). \n\n \n\nDabrafenib was phototoxic in an in vitro mouse fibroblast 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) assay and \n\nin vivo at doses ≥100 mg/kg (>44 times clinical exposure based on Cmax) in an oral phototoxicity study \n\nin hairless mice. \n\n \n\nCombination with trametinib \n\n \n\nIn a study in dogs in which trametinib and dabrafenib were given in combination for 4 weeks, signs of \n\ngastrointestinal toxicity and decreased lymphoid cellularity of the thymus were observed at lower \n\nexposures than in dogs given trametinib alone. Otherwise, similar toxicities were observed as in \n\ncomparable monotherapy studies. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n38 \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n\n1. What Tafinlar is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Tafinlar \n\n3. How to take Tafinlar \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Tafinlar \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Tafinlar is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nTafinlar is a medicine that contains the active substance dabrafenib. It is used either on its own or in \n\ncombination with another medicine containing trametinib in adults to treat a type of skin cancer called \n\nmelanoma that has spread to other parts of the body, or cannot be removed by surgery. \n\n \n\nTafinlar in combination with trametinib is also used to prevent melanoma from coming back after it \n\nhas been removed by surgery. \n\n \n\nTafinlar in combination with trametinib is also used to treat a type of lung cancer called non-small cell \n\nlung cancer (NSCLC). \n\n \n\nBoth cancers have a particular change (mutation) in a gene called BRAF at the V600 position. This \n\nmutation in the gene may have caused the cancer to develop. Your medicine targets proteins made \n\nfrom this mutated gene and slows down or stops the development of your cancer. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Tafinlar \n\n \n\nTafinlar should only be used to treat melanomas and NSCLC with the BRAF mutation. Therefore \n\nbefore starting treatment your doctor will test for this mutation. \n\n \n\nIf your doctor decides that you will receive treatment with the combination of Tafinlar and trametinib, \n\nread the trametinib leaflet carefully as well as this leaflet. \n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nDo not take Tafinlar: \n\n if you are allergic to dabrafenib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n\nCheck with your doctor if you think this applies to you. \n\n \n\n\n\n54 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor, before taking Tafinlar. Your doctor needs to know if you: \n\n have any liver problems. \n\n have or have ever had any kidney problems. \nYour doctor may take blood samples to monitor your liver and kidney function while you are \n\ntaking Tafinlar. \n\n have had a different type of cancer other than melanoma or NSCLC, as you may be at \ngreater risk of developing other skin and non-skin cancers when taking Tafinlar. \n\n \n\nBefore you take Tafinlar in combination with trametinib your doctor also needs to know if you: \n\n have heart problems such as heart failure or problems with the way your heart beats. \n\n have eye problems including blockage of the vein draining the eye (retinal vein occlusion) or \nswelling in the eye which may be caused by fluid leakage (chorioretinopathy). \n\n have any lung or breathing problems, including difficulty in breathing often accompanied by a \ndry cough, shortness of breath and fatigue. \n\n have or have had any gastrointestinal problems such as diverticulitis (inflamed pouches in the \ncolon) or metastases to the gastrointestinal tract. \n\n \n\nCheck with your doctor if you think any of these may apply to you. \n\n \n\nConditions you may need to look out for \n\nSome people taking Tafinlar develop other conditions, which can be serious. You need to know about \n\nimportant signs and symptoms to look out for while you’re taking this medicine. Some of these \n\nsymptoms (bleeding, fever, changes to your skin and eye problems) are briefly mentioned in this \n\nsection, but more detailed information is found in section 4, “Possible side effects”. \n\n \n\nBleeding \n\nTaking Tafinlar in combination with trametinib can cause serious bleeding including in your brain, the \n\ndigestive system (such as stomach, rectum or intestine), lungs, and other organs, and can lead to death. \n\nSymptoms may include: \n\n headaches, dizziness, or feeling weak \n\n passing blood in the stools or passing black stools \n\n passing blood in the urine \n\n stomach pain \n\n coughing / vomiting up blood \n \n\nTell your doctor as soon as possible if you get any of these symptoms. \n\n \n\nFever \n\nTaking Tafinlar or the combination of Tafinlar and trametinib may cause fever, although it is more \n\nlikely if you are taking the combination treatment (see also section 4). In some cases, people with \n\nfever may develop low blood pressure, dizziness or other symptoms. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor immediately if you get a temperature above 38.5ºC while you are taking this \n\nmedicine. \n\n \n\nHeart disorder \n\nTafinlar can cause heart problems, or make existing heart problems worse (see also “Heart conditions” \n\nin section 4), in people taking Tafinlar in combination with trametinib. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you have a heart disorder. Your doctor will run tests to check that your heart is \n\nworking properly before and during your treatment with Tafinlar in combination with trametinib. Tell \n\nyour doctor immediately if it feels like your heart is pounding, racing, or beating irregularly, or if you \n\nexperience dizziness, tiredness, light-headedness, shortness of breath or swelling in the legs. If \n\nnecessary, your doctor may decide to interrupt your treatment or to stop it altogether. \n\n \n\n\n\n55 \n\nChanges in your skin which may indicate new skin cancer \nYour doctor will check your skin before you start taking this medicine and regularly while you are \n\ntaking it.
