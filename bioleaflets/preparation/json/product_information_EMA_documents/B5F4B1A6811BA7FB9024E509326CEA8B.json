This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nIntrarosa 6.5 mg pessary. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pessary contains 6.5 mg of prasterone. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPessary. \n \nWhite to off-white, bullet-shaped pessary approximately 28 mm long and 9 mm in diameter at its \nwidest end. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nIntrarosa is indicated for the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women \nhaving moderate to severe symptoms.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose is 6.5 mg prasterone (one pessary) administered once daily, at bedtime. \n \nFor the treatment of postmenopausal symptoms, Intrarosa should only be initiated for symptoms that \nadversely affect quality of life. In all cases, a careful appraisal of the risks and benefits should be \nreassessed at least every 6 months and Intrarosa should only be continued as long as the benefit \noutweighs the risk. \n \nIf a dose is forgotten, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers. However, if the next dose is \ndue in less than 8 hours, the patient should skip the missed pessary. Two pessaries should not be used \nto make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is considered necessary in elderly women. \n \nPatients with renal and/or hepatic impairment \nSince Intrarosa acts locally in the vagina, no dosage adjustment is needed for postmenopausal women \nhaving renal or hepatic impairment or any other systemic anomaly or disease. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Intrarosa in female children of any age group for the indication of vulvar \nand vaginal atrophy due to menopause. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nVaginal use. \n \nIntrarosa can be inserted in the vagina with the finger or with an applicator provided within the \nidentified pack. \n \nThe pessary should be inserted in the vagina as far as it can comfortably go without force. \n \nIf inserted with an applicator, the following steps should be followed: \n \n1. The applicator should be activated (by pulling back the plunger) before use. \n2. The flat end of the pessary should be placed into the open end of the activated applicator. \n3. The applicator should be inserted into the vagina as far as it can comfortably go without force. \n4. The plunger of the applicator should be pressed to release the pessary. \n5. The applicator should then be withdrawn and disassembled, and the two pieces of the applicator \n\nshould be rinsed for 30 seconds under running water before wiping with paper towel and \nreassembled. The applicator should be kept in a clean place until next use. \n\n6. Each applicator should be discarded after one week of usage (two extra applicators are \nprovided). \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to the excipient listed in section 6.1; \n• Undiagnosed genital bleeding; \n• Known, past or suspected breast cancer; \n• Known or suspected oestrogen-dependent malignant tumours (e.g endometrial cancer); \n• Untreated endometrial hyperplasia; \n• Acute liver disease, or a history of liver disease as long as liver function tests have failed to \n\nreturn to normal \n• Previous or current venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism); \n• Known thrombophilic disorders (e.g. protein C, protein S, or antithrombin deficiency, see \n\nsection 4.4); \n• Active or recent arterial thromboembolic disease (e.g. angina, myocardial infarction); \n• Porphyria. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFor the treatment of postmenopausal symptoms, Intrarosa should only be initiated for symptoms that \nadversely affect quality of life. In all cases, a careful appraisal of the risks and benefits should be \nreassessed at least every 6 months and Intrarosa should only be continued as long as the benefit \noutweighs the risk following discussions with their doctor. \n \nBefore initiating Intrarosa, a complete personal and family medical history should be taken. Physical \n(including pelvic and breast) examination should be guided by this and by the contraindications and \nspecial warnings and precautions for use according to the decision of their doctor. During treatment, \nperiodic check-ups are recommended of a frequency and nature adapted to the individual woman. \nWomen should be advised what changes in their breasts should be reported to their doctor or nurse \n(see ‘Breast cancer’ below). Investigations, including Pap smears and blood pressure measurements \nshould be carried out in accordance with currently accepted screening practices, modified to the \nclinical needs of the individual.  \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nConditions which need supervision \n• If any of the following conditions are present, have occurred previously, and/or have been \n\naggravated during pregnancy or previous hormone treatment, the patient should be closely \nsupervised.  It should be taken into account that these conditions may recur or be aggravated \nduring treatment with Intrarosa, in particular: \n– Leiomyoma (uterine fibroids) or endometriosis \n– Risk factors for thromboembolic disorders (see below) \n– Risk factors for oestrogen dependent tumours, e.g. 1st degree heredity for breast cancer \n– Hypertension \n– Liver disorders (e.g. liver adenoma) \n– Diabetes mellitus with or without vascular involvement \n– Cholelithiasis \n– Migraine or (severe) headache \n– Systemic lupus erythematosus. \n– A history of endometrial hyperplasia (see below) \n– Epilepsy \n– Asthma \n– Otosclerosis \n\n \nReasons for immediate withdrawal of therapy \nTherapy should be discontinued in case a contraindication is discovered and in the following situation: \n– Jaundice or deterioration in liver function \n– Significant increase in blood pressure  \n– New onset of migraine-type headache \n– Pregnancy. \n \nEndometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma \n• Estrogen is a metabolite of prasterone. In women with an intact uterus, the risk of endometrial \n\nhyperplasia and carcinoma is increased when exogenous oestrogens are administered for \nprolonged periods. No cases of endometrial hyperplasia have been reported in women treated \nfor 52 weeks during the clinical studies. Intrarosa has not been studied in women with \nendometrial hyperplasia.  \n\n• For oestrogen products for vaginal application of which the systemic exposure to oestrogen \nremains within the normal postmenopausal range, it is not recommended to add a progestagen. \n\n• Endometrial safety of long-term of local vaginally administered prasterone has not been studied \nfor more than one year. Therefore, if repeated, treatment should be reviewed at least annually.  \n\n• If bleeding or spotting appears at any time on therapy, the reason should be investigated, which \nmay include endometrial biopsy to exclude endometrial malignancy. \n\n• Unopposed oestrogen stimulation may lead to premalignant or malignant transformation in the \nresidual foci of endometriosis. Therefore caution is advised when using this product in women \nwho have undergone hysterectomy because of endometriosis, especially if they are known to \nhave residual endometriosis since intravaginal prasterone has not been studied in women with \nendometriosis.  \n\n \nPrasterone is metabolised into estrogenic compounds. The following risks have been associated with \nsystemic HRT and apply to a lesser extent for oestrogen products for vaginal application of which the \nsystemic exposure to the oestrogen remains within the normal postmenopausal range. However, they \nshould be considered in case of long term or repeated use of this product. \n \nBreast cancer \nThe overall evidence suggests an increased risk of breast cancer in women taking combined oestrogen-\nprogestagen and possibly also oestrogen-only systemic HRT, that is dependent on the duration of \ntaking HRT. The excess risk becomes apparent within a few years of use but returns to baseline within \na few (at most five) years after stopping treatment. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nIntrarosa has not been studied in women with active or past breast cancer. One case of breast cancer at \nweek 52 has been reported on 1196 women who have been exposed with the 6.5 mg dose which is \nbelow the incidence rate observed in the normal population of the same age.  \n \nOvarian cancer \nOvarian cancer is much rarer than breast cancer. \nEpidemiological evidence from a large meta-analysis suggests a slightly increased risk in women \ntaking oestrogen-only systemic HRT, which becomes apparent within 5 years of use and diminishes \nover time after stopping. \n \nIntrarosa has not been studied in women with active or past ovarian cancer. One Case of ovarian \ncancer has been reported on 1196 women who have been exposed with the 6.5 mg dose which is \nabove the incidence rate observed in the normal population of the same age. Of note, this case was \npresent before start of treatment and was bearing a BRCA1 mutation.  \n \nAbnormal Pap smear \nIntrarosa has not been studied in women with abnormal Pap smears (Atypical Squamous Cells of \nUndetermined Significance (ASCUS)) or worse. Cases of abnormal Pap smears corresponding to \nASCUS or Low Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL) have been reported in women treated \nwith the 6.5 mg dose (common frequency).  \n \nVenous thromboembolism \nIntrarosa has not been studied in women with current or previous venous thromboembolic disease.  \n• Systemic HRT is associated with a 1.3-3 fold risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE), \n\ni.e. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. The occurrence of such an event is more likely \nin the first year of HRT than later (see section 4.8). \n\n• Patients with known thrombophilic states have an increased risk of VTE and HRT may add to this \nrisk. HRT is therefore contraindicated in these patients (see section 4.3). \n\n• Generally recognised risk factors for VTE include, use of oestrogens, older age, major surgery, \nprolonged immobilisation, obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2), pregnancy/postpartum period, systemic \nlupus erythematosus (SLE), and cancer. There is no consensus about the possible role of varicose \nveins in VTE. \nAs in all postoperative patients, prophylactic measures need be considered to prevent VTE \nfollowing surgery. If prolonged immobilisation is to follow elective surgery temporarily stopping \nHRT 4 to 6 weeks earlier is recommended. Treatment should not be restarted until the woman is \ncompletely mobilised. \n\n• In women with no personal history of VTE but with a first degree relative with a history of \nthrombosis at young age, screening may be offered after careful counselling regarding its \nlimitations (only a proportion of thrombophilic defects are identified by screening). \nIf a thrombophilic defect is identified which segregates with thrombosis in family members or if \nthe defect is ‘severe’ (e.g, antithrombin, protein S, or protein C deficiencies or a combination of \ndefects) HRT is contraindicated. \n\n• Women already on chronic anticoagulant treatment require careful consideration of the benefit-\nrisk of use of HRT. \n\n• If VTE develops after initiating therapy, the drug should be discontinued. Patients should be told \nto contact their doctors immediately when they are aware of a potential thromboembolic symptom \n(e.g. painful swelling of a leg, sudden pain in the chest, dyspnoea). \n \n\nOne case of pulmonary embolism has been reported in the 6.5 mg group and one in the placebo group \nduring clinical trials.  \n \nCoronary artery disease (CAD)/ Hypertension  \nIntrarosa has not been studied in women with uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure above \n140/90 mmHg) and cardiovascular disease. Cases of hypertension have been reported in clinical trials \nwith an uncommon frequency and similar incidence rates were observed in both groups (6.5 mg \nprasterone and placebo). No case of coronary artery disease has been reported during clinical trials.  \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nIschaemic stroke \nSystemic oestrogen-only therapy is associated with an up to 1.5-fold increase in risk of ischaemic \nstroke. The relative risk does not change with age or time since menopause. However, as the baseline \nrisk of stroke is strongly age-dependent, the overall risk of stroke in women who use HRT will \nincrease with age (see section 4.8). \nIntrarosa has not been studied in women with current or previous arterial thromboembolic disease. \nNo cases of arterial thromboembolic disease have been reported during clinical trials. \n \nOther conditions observed with HRT \n• Oestrogens may cause fluid retention, and therefore patients with cardiac or renal dysfunction \n\nshould be carefully observed. \n• Women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridaemia should be followed closely during oestrogen \n\nreplacement or hormone replacement therapy, since rare cases of large increases of plasma \ntriglycerides leading to pancreatitis have been reported with oestrogen therapy in this condition. \n\n• Oestrogens increase thyroid binding globulin (TBG), leading to increased circulating total \nthyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radio-\nimmunoassay) or T3 levels (by radio-immunoassay). T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the \nelevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Other binding proteins may be \nelevated in serum, i.e. corticoid binding globulin (CBG), sex-hormone-binding globulin \n(SHBG) leading to increased circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. Free or \nbiological active hormone concentrations are unchanged. Other plasma proteins may be \nincreased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-I-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). \n\n• HRT use does not improve cognitive function.  There is some evidence of increased risk of \nprobable dementia in women who start using continuous combined or oestrogen-only HRT after \nthe age of 65. \n\n \nNone of these conditions has been observed with Intrarosa during the clinical trials. \nWomen with vaginal infection should be treated with appropriate antimicrobial therapy before starting \nIntrarosa. \n \nDue to melting of the hard fat base added to an expected increase in vaginal secretions due to \ntreatment, vaginal discharge can occur although it does not require to stop the medication (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nUse of Intrarosa with condoms, diaphragms or cervical caps made of latex must be avoided since the \nrubber may be damaged by the preparation. \n \nIntrarosa has not been studied in women with a current hormonal treatment: hormone replacement \ntherapy (oestrogens alone or combined with progestogens) or androgens treatment.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nConcomitant use with systemic hormone replacement therapy (oestrogen-only or oestrogen-\nprogestagen combination or androgen treatment) or vaginal oestrogens has not been investigated and \nis therefore not recommended. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nIntrarosa is not indicated in pre-menopausal women of child-bearing age, including pregnancy.  \n \nIf pregnancy occurs during treatment with Intrarosa, the treatment should be withdrawn immediately. \nThere are no data on the use of Intrarosa in pregnant women. \n \nNo studies in animals were performed with regard to the reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The \npotential risk in humans is unknown. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nBreast-feeding \nIntrarosa is not indicated during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \nIntrarosa is not indicated in fertile women. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nIntrarosa has no influence in the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of safety profile \nThe most frequently observed adverse reaction was vaginal discharge. This is due to melting of the hard \nfat used as vehicle, added to the expected increase in vaginal secretions due to treatment. It is not \nrequired to stop Intrarosa if vaginal discharge occurs (see section 4.4).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe adverse reaction observed with prasterone 6.5 mg pessaries obtained from clinical studies is \ntabulated below. \n\nMedDRA System Organ Class Common \n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nApplication site discharge  \n\nReproductive system and \nbreast disorders  \n\nAbnormal Pap smear (mostly \nASCUS or LGSIL) \n \n\nCervical/ uterine polyps \n \nBreast mass (benign)  \n\nInvestigations  Weight fluctuation  \n \nBreast cancer risk \n• An up to 2-fold increased risk of having breast cancer diagnosed is reported in women taking \n\ncombined oestrogen-progestagen therapy for more than 5 years.  \n• Any increased risk in users of oestrogen-only therapy is substantially lower than that seen in \n\nusers of oestrogen-progestagen combinations.  \n• The level of risk is dependent on the duration of use (see section 4.4).  \n• Results of the largest randomised placebo-controlled trial (WHI-study) and largest \n\nepidemiological study (MWS) are presented. \n \nMillion Women study– Estimated additional risk of breast cancer after 5 years’ use  \n\nAge \nrange \n\n(years) \n\nAdditional \ncases per 1000 \nnever-users of \nHRT over a 5 \nyear period*1 \n\nRisk ratio & \n95%CI#  \n\nAdditional cases per 1000 HRT users over 5 years \n(95%CI)  \n\n Oestrogen only HRT \n\n50-65 9-12 1.2 1-2 (0-3) \n\n#Overall risk ratio.

For women aged 50 to 54 years taking 5 years of HRT, this results in about 1 extra case per \n2000 users. In women aged 50 to 54 who are not taking HRT, about 2 women in 2000 will be \ndiagnosed with ovarian cancer over a 5-year period. \n \nRisk of venous thromboembolism \nHRT is associated with a 1.3-3-fold increased relative risk of developing venous thromboembolism \n(VTE), i.e. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.  The occurrence of such an event is more \nlikely in the first year of using HT (see section 4.4).  Results of the WHI studies are presented: \n \nWHI Studies - Additional risk of VTE over 5 years’ use \n\n \nRisk of coronary artery disease \n \n• The risk of coronary artery disease is slightly increased in users of combined oestrogen-progestagen \n\nHRT over the age of 60 (see section 4.4). \n \nRisk of ischaemic stroke \n \n• The use of oestrogen-only and oestrogen + progestagen therapy is associated with an up to 1.5 \n\nfold increased relative risk of ischaemic stroke. The risk of haemorrhagic stroke is not increased \nduring use of HRT. \n\n• This relative risk is not dependent on age or on duration of use, but as the baseline risk is \nstrongly age-dependent, the overall risk of stroke in women who use HRT will increase with \nage, see section 4.4. \n \n\nWHI studies combined - Additional risk of ischaemic stroke*4 over 5 years’ use \n\nAge range (years) \nIncidence \nper 1000 women in \nplacebo arm over 5 years \n\nRisk ratio and \n95%CI \n\nAdditional cases per 1000 \nHRT users over 5 years \n\n50-59 8 1.3 (1.1-1.6) 3 (1-5) \n \n\nOther adverse reactions have been reported in association with oestrogen/progestagen treatment:  \n \n– Gall bladder disease. \n\n                                                      \n2 *WHI study in women with no uterus, which did not show an increase in risk of breast cancer \n3 *Study in women with no uterus \n4 *no differentiation was made between ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke. \n\nAge range (years) Incidence \nper 1000 women in \nplacebo arm over 5 years \n\nRisk ratio and \n95%CI \n\nAdditional cases per 1000 \nHRT users \n\nOral oestrogen-only*3 \n50-59 7 1.2 (0.6 - 2.4) 1 (-3 – 10) \n\n\n\n9 \n\n– Skin and subcutaneous disorders: chloasma, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, vascular \npurpura. \n\n– Probable dementia over the age of 65 (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn the event of overdose, vaginal douching is recommended.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, \nATC code: G03XX01. \n \nMechanism of action \nIntrarosa contains the active ingredient prasterone, i.e. dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), which is \nbiochemically and biologically identical to the endogenous human DHEA, a precursor steroid which is \ninactive by itself and it is converted into oestrogens and androgens. Intrarosa is thus different from the \noestrogens preparations since it delivers also androgen metabolites.  \n \nAn oestrogen-mediated increase in the number of superficial and intermediate cells and decrease in the \nnumber of parabasal cells in the vaginal mucosa is noted. In addition, the vaginal pH decreased \ntowards the normal range, thus facilitating the growth of the normal bacterial flora. \n \nClinical efficacy \nPhysiological responses (objective measures) \nEfficacy data were obtained from two US and Canadian randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, \nmulticentre, pivotal phase III trials (ERC-231/Trial 1 and ERC-238/Trial 2) performed in \npostmenopausal women aged 40 to 80 years (mean age = 58.6 years in Trial 1 and 59.5 years in \nTrial 2) with vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA ). At baseline, women had ≤ 5.0% superficial cells in \nthe vaginal smear, a vaginal pH ˃ 5.0 and they had identified dyspareunia (moderate to severe) as their \nmost bothersome symptom (MBS) of VVA. After 12 weeks of daily treatment with a prasterone \n6.5 mg pessary (n=81 in Trial 1 and n=325 in Trial 2), the change from baseline, in comparison with \nplacebo treatment (n=77 in Trial 1 and n=157 in Trial 2), demonstrated significant improvements of \nthe 3 co-primary endpoints compared to placebo in both studies, namely increase of the percentage of \nsuperficial cells (p<0.0001), decrease of the percentage of parabasal cells (p<0.0001), and decrease in \nthe vaginal pH (p<0.0001).  \n \nSymptoms (subjective measures) \nThe most bothersome symptom (MBS) dyspareunia (co-primary endpoint) was assessed at baseline \nand 12 weeks with the severity scored as follows: None=0, Mild=1, Moderate=2, Severe=3. \nTable 1 shows the mean change in severity score in MBS dyspareunia after 12 weeks with associated \nstatistical testing for the difference vs. placebo for Trial 1 (ERC-231) and Trial 2 (ERC-238). \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\nTable 1: Primary Efficacy Analysis – Change from Baseline to Week 12 in the Most \nBothersome Symptom Dyspareunia (ITT Population; LOCF) \n\n \nStudy Dyspareunia \n\nIntrarosa 6.5 mg  Placebo p-value \n\nTrial 1  -1.27 -0.87 0.0132 \n\nTrial 2  -1.42 -1.06 0.0002 \n \nTable 2 shows the percentage of subjects who reported a change from baseline in their MBS \ndyspareunia at week 12. “Improvement” was defined as a reduction in the severity score of 1 or more. \n“Relief” was defined as no or only mild symptoms at week 12. “Substantial improvement” was \nrestricted to patients who had moderate or severe MBS at baseline and changed from severe to mild or \nsevere or moderate to none. \n \nTable 2:  Percentage of Patients with Improvement, Relief or Substantial Improvement of \n\nMBS Dyspareunia after 12 Weeks on Intrarosa vs. Placebo (ITT, LOCF) \n \n\n \nImprovement Relief Substantial  improvement \n\n Intrarosa Placebo Intrarosa Placebo Intrarosa Placebo \n\nTrial 1 \n(Intrarosa: n= 81) \n(Placebo: n= 77) \n\n72.8% \n(p=0.0565) \n\n58.4% 58.0% \n(p=0.0813) \n\n44.2% 43.2% \n(p=0.0821) \n\n29.9% \n\nTrial 2 \n(Intrarosa: n= 325) \n(Placebo: n= 157) \n\n80.3% \n(p=0.0003) \n\n65.0% 68.6% \n(p=0.0003) \n\n51.6% 47.1% \n(p=0.0179) \n\n35.7% \n\n \nClinical safety \nApart from the main two 12-week phase III clinical studies, the safety data of Intrarosa has also been \nobtained from one non comparative open-label safety study of one year.  \n \nCases of breast and ovarian cancer have been reported in women treated with 6.5 mg of prasterone for \n52 weeks (see section 4.4). \n \nCases of abnormal Pap smears either Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance \n(ASCUS) or Low Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL) have been reported with a common \nfrequency in women treated with Intrarosa for 52 weeks (see section 4.4). \n \nEndometrial safety \nOn the 389 evaluable end-of-study endometrial biopsies performed after 52 weeks of treatment with \nIntrarosa, no histological abnormalities were reported on the biopsies.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nIntrarosa in all subsets of the paediatric population.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nPrasterone administered in the vagina is an inactive precursor that enters the vaginal cells and is \nconverted intracellularly into cell-specific small amounts of both oestrogens and androgens depending \nupon the level of enzymes expressed in each cell type. The beneficial effects on the symptoms and \n\n\n\n11 \n\nsigns of vulvar and vaginal atrophy are exerted through activation of the vaginal oestrogen and \nandrogen receptors. \nIn a study conducted in postmenopausal women, administration of the Intrarosa pessary once daily for \n7 days resulted in a mean prasterone Cmax and area under the curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24) at \nday 7 of 4.4 ng/mL and 56.2 ng h/mL, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in the \ngroup treated with placebo (Table 3; Figure 1). The Cmax and AUC0-24 of the metabolites testosterone \nand estradiol were also slightly higher in women treated with the Intrarosa pessary compared to those \nreceiving placebo but all remained within normal values of postmenopausal women \n(< 10 pg estradiol/mL; < 0.26 ng testosterone/mL) as measured by validated mass spectrometry-based \nassays for both the study samples and reference values.  \n \n\nTable 3: Cmax and AUC0-24 of Prasterone, Testosterone, and Estradiol on Day 7 Following Daily \nAdministration of Placebo or Intrarosa (mean ± S.D.) \n\n  Placebo (N=9) INTRAROSA (N=10) \n\nPrasterone \nCmax (ng/mL) 1.60 (±0.95) 4.42 (±1.49) \n\nAUC0-24 (ng⋅h/mL) 24.82 (±14.31) 56.17 (±28.27) \n\nTestosterone \nCmax (ng/mL) 0.12 (±0.04)1 0.15 (±0.05) \n\nAUC0-24 (ng⋅h/mL) 2.58 (±0.94)1 2.79 (±0.94) \n\nEstradiol \nCmax (pg/mL) 3.33 (±1.31) 5.04 (±2.68) \n\nAUC0-24 (pg⋅h/mL) 66.49 (±20.70) 96.93 (±52.06) \n1 : N=8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1: Serum Concentrations of Prasterone (A), Testosterone (B), and Estradiol (C) Measured \nOver a 24h Period on Day 7 Following Daily Administration of Placebo or Intrarosa (mean ± S.D.) \n\n \n\nDistribution \nThe distribution of intravaginal (exogenous) prasterone is mainly local but some increase in systemic \nexposure is observed especially for the metabolites but within normal values.  \n \nBiotransformation \nExogenous prasterone is metabolized in the same manner as endogenous prasterone. Systemic \nmetabolism has not been studied in this application. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nElimination \nSystemic elimination has not been studied specifically for this application. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPrasterone was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo studies. \n \nCarcinogenic and reproductive and development toxicity studies were not performed. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Intrarosa is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use Intrarosa \n3. How to use Intrarosa  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Intrarosa \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Intrarosa is and what it is used for \n \nIntrarosa contains the active substance prasterone.  \n \nWhat Intrarosa is used for \nIntrarosa is used to treat postmenopausal women having moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and \nvaginal atrophy. It is used to relieve menopausal symptoms in the vagina such as dryness or irritation. \nIt is caused by a drop in the levels of oestrogen in your body. This happens naturally after the \nmenopause. \n \nHow Intrarosa works \nPrasterone corrects the symptoms and signs of vulvar and vaginal atrophy by replacing the oestrogens \nwhich are normally produced before menopause by the ovaries of women. It is inserted into your vagina, \nso the hormone is released where it is needed. This may relieve discomfort in the vagina. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Intrarosa  \n \nThe use of HRT carries risks which need to be considered when deciding whether to start taking it, or \nwhether to carry on taking it.  \n \nThe experience in treating women with a premature menopause (due to ovarian failure or surgery) is \nlimited. If you have a premature menopause the risks of using HRT may be different. Please talk to \nyour doctor.  \n \nBefore you start (or restart) HRT, your doctor will ask about your own and your family’s medical \nhistory. Your doctor may decide to perform a physical examination. This may include an examination \nof your breasts and/or an internal examination, if necessary.  \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \nOnce you have started on Intrarosa you should see your doctor for regular check-ups (at least every \n6 months). At these check-ups, discuss with your doctor the benefits and risks of continuing with \nIntrarosa. \n \nGo for regular breast screening, as recommended by your doctor. \n \nDo not take Intrarosa \nif any of the following applies to you. If you are not sure about any of the points below, talk to your \ndoctor before taking Intrarosa, \n• If you have or have ever had breast cancer, or if you are suspected of having it; \n• If you have cancer which is sensitive to oestrogens, such as cancer of the womb lining \n\n(endometrium), or if you are suspected of having it; \n• If you have any unexplained vaginal bleeding; \n• If you have excessive thickening of the womb lining (endometrial hyperplasia ) that is not \n\nbeing treated; \n• If you have or have ever had a blood clot in a vein (thrombosis), such as in the legs (deep \n\nvenous thrombosis) or the lungs (pulmonary embolism); \n• If you have a blood clotting disorder (such as protein C, protein S, or antithrombin deficiency); \n• If you have or recently have had a disease caused by blood clots in the arteries, such as a heart \n\nattack, stroke or angina; \n• If you have or have ever had a liver disease and your liver function tests have not returned to \n\nnormal; \n• If you have a rare blood problem called “porphyria” which is passed down in families \n\n(inherited); \n• If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to prasterone or any of the other ingredients of Intrarosa \n\n(listed in section 6 Further information). \n \nIf any of the above conditions appears for the first time while taking Intrarosa, stop taking it at once \nand consult your doctor immediately. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nWhen to take special care with Intrarosa \nTell your doctor if you have ever had any of the following problems, before you start the treatment, as \nthese may return or become worse during treatment with Intrarosa. If so, you should see your doctor \nmore often for check-ups: \n \n\n• fibroids inside your womb;  \n• growth of womb lining outside your womb (endometriosis) or a history of excessive growth of \n\nthe womb lining (endometrial hyperplasia); \n• increased risk of developing blood clots (see “Blood clots in a vein (thrombosis)”);  \n• increased risk of getting a oestrogen-sensitive cancer (such as having a mother, sister or \n\ngrandmother who has had breast cancer); \n• high blood pressure; \n• a liver disorder, such as a benign liver tumour; \n• diabetes; \n• gallstones;  \n• migraine or severe headaches; \n• a disease of the immune system that affects many organs of the body (systemic lupus \n\nerythematosus, SLE); \n• epilepsy; \n• asthma; \n• a disease affecting the eardrum and hearing (otosclerosis); \n• a very high level of fat in your blood (triglycerides); \n• fluid retention due to cardiac or kidney problems. \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \nStop taking Intrarosa and see a doctor immediately  \nIf you notice any of the following when taking HRT: \n\n• any of the conditions mentioned in the ‘DO NOT take Intrarosa’ section; \n• yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes (jaundice). These may be signs of a liver \n\ndisease; \n• if you become pregnant; \n• a large rise in your blood pressure (symptoms may be headache, tiredness, dizziness); \n• migraine-like headaches which happen for the first time; \n• if you notice signs of a blood clot, such as: \n\n- painful swelling and redness of the legs; \n- sudden chest pain; \n- difficulty in breathing. \n\nFor more information, see ‘Blood clots in a vein (thrombosis)’ \n \nNote: Intrarosa is not a contraceptive. If it is less than 12 months since your last menstrual period or \nyou are under 50 years old, you may still need to use additional contraception to prevent pregnancy. \nSpeak to your doctor for advice. \n \nHRT and cancer \nIntrarosa has not been studied in women with current or history of cancers.  \n\nExcessive thickening of the lining of the womb (endometrial hyperplasia) and cancer of the lining \nof the womb (endometrial cancer) \nTaking oestrogen-only HRT tablets for a long time can increase the risk of developing cancer of the \nwomb lining (the endometrium). Intrarosa does not stimulate the endometrium as shown by atrophy of \nthe lining of the womb in all women treated with Intrarosa for one year during the clinical trials. \n \nIt is uncertain whether a  risk exists with Intrarosa used for long term (more than one year) treatments.  \nHowever, Intrarosa has been shown to have very low absorption into the blood, therefore the addition \nof a progestagen is not necessary. \n \nIf you get bleeding or spotting, it’s usually nothing to worry about, but you should make an \nappointment to see your doctor. It could be a sign that your endometrium has become thicker. \n \nThe following risks apply to HRT medicines which circulate in the blood. However Intrarosa is for \nlocal treatment in the vagina and the absorption into the blood is very low. It is less likely that the \nconditions mentioned below will get worse or come back during treatment with Intrarosa, but you \nshould see your doctor if you are concerned. \n \nBreast cancer \nEvidence suggests that taking combined oestrogen-progestogen and possibly also oestrogen-only HRT \nincreases the risk of breast cancer. The extra risk depends on how long you take HRT. The additional \nrisk becomes clear within a few years. However, it returns to normal within a few years (at most 5) \nafter stopping treatment.  \n \n• Regularly check your breasts. See your doctor if you notice any changes such as: \n\n • dimpling of the skin; \n • changes in the nipple; \n • any lumps you can see or feel. \n \n\nAdditionally, you are advised to join mammography screening programs when offered to you. \n \nOvarian cancer \nOvarian cancer is rare - much rarer than breast cancer. The use of oestrogen-only HRT has been \nassociated with a slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer.  \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nThe risk of ovarian cancer varies with age. For example, in women aged 50 to 54 who are not taking \nHRT, about 2 women in 2000 will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer over a 5-year period. For women \nwho have been taking HRT for 5 years, there will be about 3 cases per 2000 users (i.e. about 1 extra \ncase). \nCases of ovarian and breast cancer have rarely been reported in women treated with 6.5 mg of \nprasterone for 52 weeks. \n \nEffect of HRT on heart and circulation \nIntrarosa has not been studied in women with history of thromboembolic diseases, uncontrolled \nhypertension or heart disease.  \n \nBlood clots in a vein (thrombosis) \nThe risk of blood clots in the veins is about 1.3 to 3-times higher in HRT users than in non-users, \nespecially during the first year of taking it.  \n \nBlood clots can be serious, and if one travels to the lungs, it can cause chest pain, breathlessness, \nfainting or even death.  \n \nYou are more likely to get a blood clot in your veins as you get older and if any of the following \napplies to you. Inform your doctor if any of these situations applies to you: \n\n• you are unable to walk for a long time because of major surgery, injury or illness (see also \nsection 3, If you need to have surgery); \n\n• you are seriously overweight (BMI >30 kg/m2); \n• you have any blood clotting problem that needs long-term treatment with a medicine used to \n\nprevent blood clots; \n• if any of your close relatives has ever had a blood clot in the leg, lung or another organ; \n• you have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); \n• you have cancer. \n\n \nFor signs of a blood clot, see “Stop taking Intrarosa and see a doctor immediately”. \nIn clinical trials, no deep vein thrombosis has been observed with intravaginal prasterone while one \ncase of pulmonary embolism which corresponds to an incidence lower with Intrarosa than in the \nplacebo group. \n \nCompare \nLooking at women in their 50s who are not taking HRT, on average, over a 5-year period, 4 to 7 in 1000 \nwould be expected to get a blood clot in a vein.  \n \nHeart disease (heart attack) / Hypertension \nFor women taking oestrogen-only therapy there is no increased risk of developing a heart disease. \n \nStroke \nThe risk of getting stroke is about 1.5 times higher in HRT users than in non-users. The number of \nextra cases of stroke due to use of HRT will increase with age.  \nNo case of stroke has been observed with Intrarosa during clinical trials. \n \nCompare \nLooking at women in their 50s who are not taking HRT, on average, 8 in 1000 would be expected to \nhave a stroke over a 5-year period. For women in their 50s who are taking HRT, there will be 11 cases \nin 1000 users, over 5 years (i.e. an extra 3 cases). \n \nOther conditions \n• HRT will not prevent memory loss. There is some evidence of a higher risk of memory loss in \n\nwomen who start using HRT after the age of 65. Speak to your doctor for advice; \n• You may have vaginal discharge due to melting of the ‘hard fat base’ which adds to increased \n\nvaginal secretions due to treatment. If vaginal discharge occurs, it is not required to stop \nIntrarosa.  \n\n\n\n28 \n\n• Intrarosa may weaken condoms, diaphragms and cervical caps made of latex. \n• If you have a vaginal infection you will need a course of antibiotics before taking Intrarosa. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nIntrarosa is only used in adult women.  \n \nOther medicines and Intrarosa  \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nNo data on efficacy and safety are available in women currently treated with hormonal therapy such \nas: androgens, hormone replacement therapy (oestrogen alone or combined with progestogens).  \n \nThe use of Intraorsa in combination with hormone replacement therapy (oestrogen-only or oestrogen-\nprogestagen combination or androgen treatment) or vaginal oestrogens is not recommended. \n \nPregnancy, breast feeding and fertility \n \nPregnancy and breast feeding  \nIntrarosa is for use in postmenopausal women only. If you become pregnant, stop taking Intrarosa and \ncontact your doctor. \n \nFertility \nIntrarosa is not meant for women with child-bearing potential. It is not known if this medicine affects \nfertility. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nIntrarosa does not affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \n \n3. How to use Intrarosa \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \nYour doctor will aim to prescribe the lowest dose to treat your symptom for as short as necessary. \nSpeak to your doctor if you think this dose is too strong or not strong enough. \n \nHow much to use \nUse one pessary once a day, at bedtime. \n \nHow to use \nInsert the pessary into the vagina with your finger or with an applicator provided in the pack. \n \nRead the instructions on how to use Intrarosa at the end of the leaflet carefully before using this \nmedicine. \n \nHow long to use \nAfter initial use, see your doctor at least every 6 months to check if you need to keep using Intrarosa. \n \nIf you use more Intrarosa than you should \n \nVaginal douching is recommended. \n \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nIf you forget to use Intrarosa \n \nIf you forget to use a pessary, insert one as soon as you remember. However, if the next dose is due in \nless than 8 hours, skip the missed pessary. \n \nDo not use two pessaries to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you need to have surgery  \n \nIf you are going to have surgery, tell the surgeon that you are taking Intrarosa. You may need to stop \ntaking Intrarosa about 4 to 6 weeks before the operation to reduce the risk of a blood clot (see \nsection 2, Blood clots in a vein). Ask your doctor when you can start taking Intrarosa again. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe following diseases are reported more often in women using HRT medicines which circulate in the \nblood compared to women not using HRT. These risks apply less to vaginally administered oestrogen \ntreatments: \n\n• breast cancer; \n• ovarian cancer; \n• blood clots in the veins of the legs or lungs (venous thromboembolism);  \n• stroke; \n• probable memory loss if HRT is started over the age of 65. \n\nFor more information about these side effects, see section 2. \n \nThe side effect the most frequently reported in the clinical studies was vaginal discharge. This is likely \ndue to melting of the hard fat added to an expected increase in vaginal secretions due to treatment. \nVaginal discharge does not require to stop Intrarosa. \n \nThe following adverse effects were also reported: \n− with a common frequency (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): abnormal Pap smear (mostly \n\nASCUS or LGSIL), weight fluctuations (either increase or decrease); \n− with a uncommon frequency (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): benign cervical or uterine \n\npolyps, benign breast mass.  \n \nThe following side effects have been reported with HRT containing estrogens but not with Intrarosa \nduring clinical trials: \n• gall bladder disease \n• various skin disorders: \n\n- discoloration of the skin especially of the face or neck known as “pregnancy patches” \n(chloasma); \n\n- painful reddish skin nodules (erythema nodosum); \n- rash with target-shaped reddening or sores (erythema multiforme). \n\n \nReporting of side effects \n \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n30 \n\n5.
