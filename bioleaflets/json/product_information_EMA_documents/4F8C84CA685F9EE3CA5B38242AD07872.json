NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nPrialt 25 micrograms/ml solution for infusion \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nOne ml solution contains 25 μg ziconotide (as acetate). \n\nEach 20 ml vial contains 500 μg ziconotide (as acetate). \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for infusion (infusion).   \n\nClear, colourless solution. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nZiconotide is indicated for the treatment of severe, chronic pain in adults who require intrathecal (IT) \nanalgesia. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nTreatment with ziconotide should only be undertaken by physicians experienced in intrathecal (IT) \nadministration of medicinal products.   \n\nPosology \n\nAdults (including the elderly ≥ 65 years of age) \n\nDosing of ziconotide should be initiated at 2.4 μg/day and titrated on an individual patient basis \naccording to the patient’s analgesic response and adverse reactions.  Patients should be titrated in dose \nincrements of ≤ 2.4 μg/day, up to a maximum dose of 21.6 μg/day.  The minimal interval between \ndose increases is 24 hours; the recommended interval, for safety reasons, is 48 hours or more.  If \nnecessary the dose can be decreased by any amount (including stopping the infusion) for the \nmanagement of adverse reactions.  Approximately 75% of patients who respond satisfactorily to \ntreatment require a dose of ≤ 9.6 μg/day. \n\nRenal impairment\n\nStudies have not been conducted in patients with impaired renal function.  Caution should be exercised \nwhen ziconotide is administered to patients with impaired renal function. \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nStudies have not been conducted in patients with impaired hepatic function.  Caution should be \nexercised when ziconotide is administered to patients with impaired hepatic function. \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of ziconotide in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. \n\nNo data are available. \n\nMethod of administration  \n\nIntrathecal use. \n\nZiconotide must be administered as a continuous infusion via an intrathecal catheter, using an external \nor internally implanted mechanical infusion pump capable of delivering an accurate infusion volume.  \nAs the risk of meningitis secondary to prolonged catheterisation of the intrathecal space is greater with \nan external catheter infusion system, internal systems are recommended to administer ziconotide for \nprolonged periods (see section 4.4).  An external catheter system should only be used when an internal \nsystem cannot be implanted. \n\nWhen low doses of ziconotide are required, for example when initiating titration, ziconotide must be \ndiluted before use with preservative-free sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. \n\nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nCombination with IT chemotherapy (see section 4.5). \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nLong-term use \nAlthough ziconotide has been studied in long-term, open label efficacy and safety clinical trials, \ncontrolled studies of longer than 3 weeks duration have not been conducted (see section 5.1).  Possible \nlong-term local toxic effects on the spinal cord have not been excluded and preclinical data in this \nrespect are limited (see section 5.3).  Therefore, caution is needed during long-term treatment. \n\nRisk of infection \nThe administration of medicinal products by the intrathecal (IT) route carries the risk of potentially \nserious infections, such as meningitis, which may be life threatening.  Meningitis due to the entrance \nof organisms along the catheter track or inadvertent contamination of the infusion system is a known \ncomplication of intrathecal medicinal product administration, especially with external systems. \n\nPatients and physicians must be vigilant for typical symptoms and signs of meningitis. \n\nThe optimal intrathecal placement of the catheter tip has not been established.  Lower catheter tip \nplacement, e.g. at the lumbar level, may reduce the incidence of ziconotide-related neurological \nadverse reactions.  Therefore, catheter tip placement should be carefully considered to allow adequate \naccess to spinal nociceptive segments whilst minimising medicinal product concentrations at cerebral \nlevels. \n\nOnly a small number of patients have received systemic chemotherapy and IT ziconotide.  Caution \nshould be exercised when ziconotide is administered to patients who are receiving systemic \nchemotherapy (see section 4.5). \n\n\n\n4 \n\nElevations in creatine kinase \nElevations in creatine kinase, which are usually asymptomatic, are common amongst patients on \nintrathecal ziconotide.  Progressive elevation of the creatine kinase is uncommon.  However, \nmonitoring of creatine kinase is recommended.  In the event of progressive elevation, or clinically \nsignificant elevation in association with clinical features of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, \ndiscontinuation of ziconotide should be considered. \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \nHypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have not been observed during clinical trials and the \nimmunogenicity of ziconotide administered by the IT route appears to be low.  However, the potential \nfor severe allergic reactions cannot be excluded and spontaneous reports of anaphylactic reactions \nhave been received. \n\nCognitive and neuropsychiatric adverse reactions \nCognitive and neuropsychiatric adverse reactions, particularly confusion, are common in patients \ntreated with ziconotide.  Cognitive impairment typically appears after several weeks of treatment.  \nEpisodes of acute psychiatric disturbances, such as hallucinations, paranoid reactions, hostility, \naggressiveness, delirium, psychosis and manic reactions have been reported in patients treated with \nziconotide.  The ziconotide dose should be reduced or discontinued if signs or symptoms of cognitive \nimpairment or neuropsychiatric adverse reactions develop, but other contributing causes should also be \nconsidered.  The cognitive effects of ziconotide are typically reversible within 1 - 4 weeks after \ndiscontinuation of the medicinal product, but may persist in some cases.  It is recommended that \npatients undergo a neuropsychiatric evaluation before and after starting intrathecal ziconotide.\n\nIn patients with severe chronic pain there is a higher incidence of suicide and suicide attempts than in \nthe general population.  Ziconotide may cause or worsen depression with the risk of suicide in \nsusceptible patients. \n\nDepression of Central Nervous System (CNS) \nPatients have experienced depressed levels of consciousness while receiving ziconotide.  The patient \nusually remains conscious and breathing is not depressed.  The event may be self-limited, but \nziconotide should be discontinued until the event resolves.  The re-introduction of ziconotide is not \nrecommended in these patients.  Withdrawal of concomitant CNS depressant medicinal products \nshould also be considered as they may contribute to the reduced level of arousal. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nSpecific clinical medicinal product interaction studies have not been conducted with ziconotide.  \nHowever, low plasma ziconotide concentrations, metabolism by ubiquitous peptidases and relatively \nlow plasma protein binding (see section 5.2) make metabolic-based interactions or plasma protein \ndisplacement type interactions between ziconotide and other medicinal products unlikely. \n\nNo clinical data are available on the interaction between IT chemotherapy and IT ziconotide.  \nZiconotide is contraindicated in combination with IT chemotherapy (see section 4.3). \n\nOnly a small number of patients have received systemic chemotherapy and IT ziconotide.  Caution \nshould be exercised when ziconotide is administered to patients who are receiving systemic \nchemotherapy (see section 4.4). \n\nMedicinal products that affect specific peptidases/proteases would not be expected to impact upon \nziconotide plasma exposure.  Based on very limited clinical investigations, both angiotensin \nconverting enzyme inhibitors (e.g., benazepril, lisinopril and moexipril) and HIV protease inhibitors \n(e.g., ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir), have no readily apparent effect on plasma ziconotide exposure. \n\nZiconotide does not interact with opiate receptors. If discontinuing opiates when initiating ziconotide \ntherapy, opiate withdrawal should be gradual. For patients being withdrawn from IT opiates, the IT \n\n\n\n5 \n\nopiate infusion dose should be gradually tapered over a few weeks and replaced with a \npharmacologically equivalent dose of oral opiates.  Adding IT ziconotide to stable doses of IT \nmorphine (see section 5.1), is possible but requires special attention, as a high rate of neuropsychiatric \nadverse reactions (confusion/thinking abnormal, paranoid reactions and hallucinations, and abnormal \ngait), some of them serious, was observed in Study 202 despite a low dose of ziconotide. Vomiting and \nanorexia, and peripheral oedema were also observed when IT ziconotide was added to IT morphine.  \nThe addition of IT morphine to stable doses of IT ziconotide is better tolerated (pruritis has been \nreported) (see section 5.1). \n\nAn increased incidence of somnolence has been observed when ziconotide is administered \nconcomitantly with systemic baclofen, clonidine, bupivacaine or propofol thus for the time being their \nsimultaneous use is discouraged. \n\nNo data are available regarding the concomitant use of partial opioid agonists (e.g. buprenorphine) \nwith ziconotide. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of ziconotide in pregnant women.   \n\nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).   \n\nZiconotide is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception.  \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether ziconotide/metabolites are excreted in human milk. \n\nA risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  \n\nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \nziconotide therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n\nFertility \n\nNo specific studies with ziconotide in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In a \nstudy on male and female fertility in rats no effects in males while reductions in corpora lutea; \nimplantation sites and number of live embryos were observed in females (see section 5.3). \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nZiconotide has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\nZiconotide may cause confusion, somnolence and other neurological adverse reactions, therefore \npatients must be advised not to drive or operate machines if affected. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of ziconotide administered as a continuous intrathecal infusion has been evaluated in more \nthan 1,400 patients participating in acute and chronic pain clinical trials.  The duration of treatment has \nranged from one-hour bolus infusion to continuous use for more than 6 years.  The median exposure \n\n\n\n6 \n\ntime was 43 days.  The infusion dose rate ranged from 0.03 - 912 μg/day, with a median final dose rate \nof 7.2 μg/day. \n\nIn clinical trials, 88% of patients experienced adverse reactions.  The most common adverse reactions  \nreported in long-term clinical trials were dizziness (42%), nausea (30%), nystagmus (23%), \nconfusional state (25%), gait abnormal (16%), memory impairment (13%), vision blurred (14%), \nheadache (12%), asthenia (13%), vomiting (11%), and somnolence (10%).  Most adverse reactions \nwere mild to moderate in severity and resolved over time. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nUnless otherwise noted the table shows the incidence rates of adverse reactions  reported in the \nintrathecal clinical trials with ziconotide (short- and long-term exposure).

Discontinuation of ziconotide should be considered in the event of \nprogressive or significant elevation of creatine phosphokinase in association with clinical features of \nmyopathy or rhabdomyolysis (see section 4.4). \n\nCNS adverse reactions \n\nCognitive and neuropsychiatric adverse reactions are common in patients treated with ziconotide. \nCognitive impairment typically appears after several weeks of treatment. Episodes of acute psychiatric \ndisturbances, such as hallucinations, paranoid reactions, hostility, aggressiveness, delirium, psychosis \nand manic reactions have been reported in patients treated with ziconotide. The ziconotide dose should \nbe reduced or discontinued if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment or neuropsychiatric adverse \nreactions develop, but other contributing causes should also be considered. The cognitive effects of \nziconotide are typically reversible within 1 - 4 weeks after discontinuation of the medicinal product, \nbut may persist in some cases.  It is recommended that patients undergo a neuropsychiatric evaluation \nbefore and after starting intrathecal ziconotide (see section 4.4).\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n9 \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\nIn intravenous infusion studies, healthy male volunteers received ziconotide at doses of up \nto70,000 μg/day or 3,200 times the maximum recommended daily intrathecal infusion dose.  Postural \nhypotension was observed in almost all subjects who received high intravenous doses of ziconotide. \n\nThe maximum recommended intrathecal dose is 21.6 μg/day.  The maximum intended intrathecal dose \nof ziconotide in clinical trials was 912 μg/day following upward titration over 7 days. \n\nSymptoms \nIn one clinical study a male cancer patient received an accidental IT ziconotide overdose of 744 μg \nover a 24-hour period (31 μg/hour) and resumed treatment at the intended dose after experiencing a \nreduction in Visual Analog Scale of Pain Intensity (VASPI) from 82 to 2.5 mm.  In some patients who \nreceived intrathecal doses greater than the maximum recommended dose, exaggerated \npharmacological effects, e.g., ataxia, nystagmus, dizziness, stupor, depressed level of consciousness, \nmuscle spasms, confusional state, sedation, hypotension, aphasia, speech disorder, nausea and \nvomiting were observed.  There was no indication of respiratory depression.  Most patients under \nobservation recovered within 24 hours of withdrawal of the medicinal product. \n\nManagement \nGeneral medical supportive measures should be administered to patients who receive an overdose until \nthe exaggerated pharmacological effects of the medicinal product have resolved. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group:  Analgesics, other analgesics and antipyretics,   ATC code:  N02BG08 \n\nMechanism of action \nZiconotide is a synthetic analogue of a ω-conopeptide, MVIIA, found in the venom of the Conus \nmagus marine snail.  It is an N-type calcium channel blocker (NCCB).  NCCs regulate \nneurotransmitter release in specific neuronal populations responsible for the spinal processing of pain.  \nIn binding to these neuronal NCCs ziconotide inhibits the voltage sensitive calcium current into \nprimary nociceptive afferents terminating in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.  \nIn turn, this inhibits their release of neurotransmitters (including Substance P) and therefore, the spinal \nsignalling of pain. \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \nThough statistically significant relationships and reasonable correlation between cerebrospinal fluid \n(CSF) exposure (AUC, Cmax) and clinical response measures have been observed following 1 hour IT \nadministration, no well-defined dose-concentration-response relationships have yet been identified.  \nMany responsive patients obtain near-maximal analgesia within a few hours of delivery of an \nappropriate dose.  However, maximal effects may be delayed for approximately 24 hours in some \npatients.  Given the occurrence of analgesia and adverse reactions at similar doses, the recommended \ninterval between dose increases is 48 hours or more.  If necessary the dose can be decreased by any \namount (including stopping the infusion) for the management of adverse reactions. \n\nNervous system adverse reactions, particularly dizziness, nausea and abnormal gait appear to be \ncorrelated with CSF exposure, though a definitive relationship has not been established. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\nLow plasma exposure occurs during IT infusion due to the low recommended IT infusion rates and \nrelatively rapid plasma clearance (see section 5.2).  Therefore, pharmacological effects related to \nsystemic exposure should be minimal. \n\nThe median dose at response is approximately 6.0 μg/day and approximately 75% of responsive \npatients require ≤ 9.6 μg/day.  To limit the occurrence of serious adverse reactions, a maximum dose \nof 21.6 μg/day is recommended.  However, in clinical trials it has been observed that patients who \ntolerate doses of 21.6 μg/day following slow titration over a 3 to 4-week period, generally tolerate \nhigher doses up to 48.0 μg/day. \n\nThere is no evidence of the development of pharmacological tolerance to ziconotide in patients.  \nHowever, in view of limited data, the development of tolerance cannot be excluded.  Examination of \nthe patency of the intrathecal catheter should be considered if the required ziconotide dose continually \nincreases and there is no benefit or increase in adverse reactions. \n\nAlternative dosing regimens including initiation of dosing with lower doses of ziconotide and bolus \nadministration have been explored in a limited number of studies available in the literature. \n\nThe use of lower doses through continuous administration was demonstrated to achieve efficacy with \nfewer adverse reactions. \n\nBolus administration studies suggest that bolus dosing may be useful in identifying patients who may \nbenefit from long term use of ziconotide, however, may result in more adverse reactions than \nadministration by continuous infusion. \n\nThese studies suggest that these alternative methods of administration of ziconotide may be possible \nhowever, due to the limited numbers of patients, these results are inconclusive and there is currently \ninsufficient evidence available to make definitive recommendations for such alternative dosing \nregimens. \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \nThere were three placebo-controlled clinical trials of IT ziconotide. \n\nTwo short-term studies, 95-001 (malignant pain) and 96-002 (non malignant pain), involving \n366 patients, demonstrated the efficacy of IT ziconotide in severe chronic pain using the percent \nchange in Visual Analog Scale of Pain Intensity (VASPI) as the primary efficacy measure.  These \nstudies were of short duration, 5 and 6 days respectively, and used a more rapid dose escalation and \nhigher doses than recommended in Section 4.2. \n\n\n\n11 \n\nEfficacy results from study 95-001 \n\nInitial treatment assignment \nParameter Ziconotide (n = 71) Placebo (n = 40) p-value \n\nMean VASPI score at \nbaseline in mm (SD) \n\n74.1 (± 13.82) 77.9 (± 13.60) _ \n\nMean VASPI score at end of \ninitial titration in mm (SD) \n\n35.7 (± 33.27) 61.0 (± 22.91) _ \n\n% improvement in VASPI \nscore at end of initial titration\n(SD) \n\n51.4 (± 43.63) 18.1 (± 28.28) < 0.001 \n\nRespondera n (%) 34 (47.9%) 7 (17.5%) 0.001 \nDose at end of titration \n(μg/hr) \n\nMean \nMedian \n\nRange\n\n0.91 \n0.60 \n\n0.074 - 9.36 \naResponders were defined as those patients who 1) experienced a ≥ 30% drop in VASPI score \ncompared to baseline; 2) had stable or decreased concomitant opioid analgesics; and 3) had opiate type \nunchanged from preinfusion if receiving opiates. \nSD – Standard Deviation. \n\nEfficacy results from study 96-002 \n\nInitial treatment assignment \nParameter Ziconotide (n = 169)b Placebo (n = 86) p-value \n\nMean VASPI score at \nbaseline in mm (SD) \n\n80.1 (± 15.10) 76.9 (± 14.58) _ \n\nMean VASPI score at end of \ninitial titration in mm (SD) \n\n54.4 (± 29.30) 71.9 (± 30.93) _ \n\n% improvement in VASPI \nscore at end of initial titration\n(SD) \n\n31.2 (± 38.69) 6.0 (± 42.84) < 0.001 \n\nRespondera n (%) 57 (33.7%) 11 (12.8%) < 0.001 \nDose at end of titration \n(μg/hr) \n\nMean \nMedian \n\nRange\n\n1.02 \n0.50 \n\n0.019 - 9.60 \naResponders were defined as those patients who 1) experienced a ≥ 30% drop in VASPI score \ncompared to baseline; 2) had stable or decreased concomitant opioid analgesics; and 3) had opiate type \nunchanged from preinfusion if receiving opiates. \nb164 patients provided VASPI scores for ziconotide at the end of titration. \nSD – Standard Deviation. \n\nThe aetiologies of pain in studies 95-001 (malignant pain) and 96-002 (non-malignant pain) were \nvaried and included bone pain (n = 38) mostly due to bone metastases (n = 34), myelopathy (n = 38), \nhalf of whom had spinal cord injury with paralysis (n = 19), neuropathy (n = 79), radiculopathy \n(n = 24), spinal pain (n = 91) mostly due to failed back surgery (n = 82), and other aetiologies (n = 82).  \nSome patients had more than one cause of pain.  The efficacy of IT ziconotide was apparent in all \ngroups. \n\nStudy 301 (n = 220) was of longer duration (21 days), involved more cautious up-titration and lower \ndoses of IT ziconotide, and enrolled the most refractory population of patients studied in the three \nstudies.  All patients in the 301 study had failed IT therapy with combinations of analgesics and their \nphysicians considered that 97% of the patients were refractory to currently available treatments.  The \nmajority had spinal pain (n = 134), especially failed back surgery (n = 110); a lower proportion had \n\n\n\n12 \n\nneuropathy (n = 36).  Only five had malignant pain.  The primary endpoint was the percent change in \nVASPI score.  The efficacy of IT ziconotide in study 301 was lower than in the previous two, \nshort-term studies.  The frequency and severity of adverse reactions were also lower. \n\nEfficacy results from study 301\n\nInitial treatment assignment \nParameter Ziconotide (n = 112) Placebo (n = 108) p-value \n\nMean VASPI score at baseline \nin mm (SD) \n\n80.7 (± 14.98) 80.7 (± 14.91) - \n\nMean VASPI score at end of \ninitial titration in mm (SD) \n\n67.9 (± 22.89) 74.1 (± 21.28) _ \n\n% improvement in VASPI score \nat end of initial titration (SD) \n\n14.7 (± 27.71) 7.2 (± 24.98) 0.0360 \n\nRespondera n (%) 18 (16.1%) 13 (12.0%) 0.390 \nDose at end of titration (μg/hr) \n\nMean \nMedian \n\nRange\n\n0.29 \n0.25 \n\n0.0 - 0.80 \naResponders were defined as those who experienced a ≥ 30% drop in VASPI score compared to \nbaseline. \nSD – Standard Deviation. \n\nCombination studies with IT Morphine \nClinical studies 201 and 202 indicate that the combination of IT ziconotide and IT morphine may \neffectively reduce pain and decrease systemic opioid use over a sustained period of time for patients \nwhose pain was inadequately controlled with their maximum tolerated dose of IT ziconotide (median \n8.7 μg/day, mean 25.7 μg/day – study 201) or with IT morphine (study 202) alone.  When adding IT \nziconotide to stable doses of IT morphine, as with the initiation of IT ziconotide monotherapy, the \nappearance of psychotic adverse reactions. (e.g., hallucinations, paranoid reactions) or discontinuation \ndue to increased adverse reactions may occur. (see section 4.5). \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe CSF pharmacokinetics of ziconotide have been studied following one-hour IT infusions of \n1 - 10 μg of ziconotide in patients with chronic pain.  The plasma pharmacokinetics following \nintravenous doses (0.3 – 10 μg/kg/24 hr) were also studied.  IT and intravenous pharmacokinetics data \nare summarised below. \n\nCSF and Plasma Pharmacokinetics of Ziconotide [mean ± SD (median)] \n\nRoute of \nadministration \n\nFluid \nmatrix \n\nNumber \nof \n\npatients  \n\nCL (ml/min) Vd (ml) t½ (hr) \n\nIntrathecal CSF 23 0.38 ± 0.56 \n(0.26) \n\n155 ± 263 \n(99) \n\n4.6 ± 0.9 \n(4.5) \n\nIntravenous Plasma 21 270 ± 44 \n(260) \n\n30,460 ± 6,366 \n(29,320) \n\n1.3 ± 0.3 \n(1.3) \n\nCL = clearance; Vd = distribution volume; t½ = half life \n\nAbsorption \nFollowing one-hour IT administration (1 – 10 μg), both cumulative exposure (AUC; range:  83.6 –\n608 ng/h/ml) and peak exposure (Cmax; range:  16.4 – 132 ng/ml) values were variable and \ndose-dependent, but appeared only approximately dose-proportional.  Plasma concentrations following \ncontinuous (≥ 48 h) IT infusion (≤ 21.6 μg/day) appear to be relatively low and typically undetectable \n(i.e., about 80% of plasma samples collected from pain patients contain no quantifiable medicinal \n\n\n\n13 \n\nproduct; < 0.04 ng/ml).  No accumulation of ziconotide in plasma following long-term IT \nadministration (up to 9 months) has been observed. \n\nDistribution\nMedian ziconotide CSF volume of distribution (Vd:  99 ml) is between the spinal cord CSF volume \n(approximately 75 ml) and total CSF volume (approximately 130 ml).  Ziconotide appears to distribute \nmainly within the CSF until transferred to the systemic circulation.  Upon reaching the systemic \ncirculation, ziconotide appears to be more extensively distributed, based on a plasma distribution \nvolume of approximately 30 l and is only about 53% bound (non-specifically) to human plasma \nproteins. \n\nBiotransformation \nZiconotide is a peptide consisting of 25 naturally-occurring amino acids of the L-configuration, and \ndoes not appear to be appreciably metabolised in the CSF.  Following passage into the systemic \ncirculation, ziconotide is expected to be primarily susceptible to proteolytic cleavage by various \nubiquitous peptidases/proteases present in most organs (e.g., kidney, liver, lung, muscle, etc.), and thus \ndegraded to peptide fragments and its individual constituent free amino acids.  The generated free \namino acids are expected to be taken up by cellular carrier systems and either subjected to normal \nintermediary metabolism or used as substrates for constitutive biosynthetic processes.  Due to the wide \ndistribution of these peptidases it is not expected that hepatic or renal impairment would affect the \nsystemic clearance of ziconotide.  The biological activity of the various expected proteolytic \ndegradation products has not been assessed.  It is unlikely that the degradation products of ziconotide \nwill have significant biological activity, as peptides consisting of the individual peptide loop structures \nhave been found to have binding affinities for N-type voltage sensitive calcium channels that are \nseveral orders of magnitude lower than that of the parent (ziconotide) compound. \n\nElimination \nMean ziconotide CL (0.38 ml/min) approximates adult human CSF turnover rate (0.3 - 0.4 ml/min).  \nHence, ziconotide appears to be mainly eliminated from the CSF (mean t½ = 4.6 hr) by bulk flow of \nCSF out of the CNS through the arachnoid villi with subsequent transfer into the systemic circulation.  \nVery low circulating plasma concentrations of ziconotide may be observed following IT \nadministration due to both the low IT infusion rate and relatively rapid plasma clearance.  The mean \nplasma elimination half-life (t½) is 1.3 hr.  Ziconotide is a relatively small molecular weight peptide \n(MW = 2,639) and is filtered by the kidney glomerulus, but only minimal amounts of ziconotide \n(< 1%) are recovered in human urine following intravenous infusion.  This is because almost all of the \nfiltered active substance is rapidly endocytosed and ultimately transported back to the systemic \ncirculation. \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \nNo formal studies assessing the impact of renal or hepatic dysfunction have been conducted; however, \ngiven that peptidases are present in various body organs, it is not anticipated that renal or hepatic \ndysfunction will significantly impact systemic exposure of ziconotide. \n\nOther special populations\nAlthough only limited data are available, there is no obvious effect of race, height, weight, gender or \nage on CSF ziconotide exposure after IT administration.   \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nEffects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the \nmaximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. \n\nIn subchronic continuous intrathecal infusion studies in rats and dogs, behavioural effects were seen at \ndoses ≥ 8-fold the maximum recommended clinical intrathecal infusion dose of 21.6 μg/day (on a \nmg/kg basis).  These effects were defined by exaggerated pharmacological actions of ziconotide and \nnot by neurotoxic lesions or target organ toxicity.  Observations included transient and reversible \nneurological effects consisting of tremors, uncoordinated movements and hyper- and hypoactivity. \n\n\n\n14 \n\nThe long-term consequences to neuronal function of continuous N-type calcium-channel block have \nnot been demonstrated in experimental animals.  Changes in neurological signalling have not been \nstudied in experimental animals.  Ziconotide did not induce bacterial gene mutation and was not \ngenotoxic.  Chronic animal studies have not been performed to assess the carcinogenic potential of \nziconotide.  However, ziconotide did not induce cell transformation in the in vitro Syrian hamster \nembryo (SHE) assay and did not increase cell proliferation (pre-neoplastic lesion formation) or \napoptosis after subchronic intrathecal exposure in dogs. \n\nIn rat fertility studies, there were no effects in males while reductions in corpora lutea; implantation \nsites and number of live embryos were observed in females.  No adverse effects on female \nreproduction and post-natal development in rats were seen at systemic exposures up to 2,300 times \nhuman exposures at the maximum recommended intrathecal dose. \n\nZiconotide was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits at exposures < 100 times human plasma levels. \n\nThese results do not indicate a significant risk to humans due to the relatively high systemic exposures \nneeded to elicit these effects in rats and rabbits. \n\n6.

If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the \nresponsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C – 8°C, unless dilution \nhas taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage\n\nStore in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C).  Do not freeze.  Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect \nfrom light. \n\nFor storage conditions after dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n\n\n\n15 \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n\nType I glass vials with butyl rubber stoppers coated with fluorinated polymer. \n\nEach vial contains 20 ml solution for infusion. \n\nOne vial per carton. \n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling\n\nIf dilution is required, Prialt must be diluted aseptically with preservative-free sodium chloride \n9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection before use.  The concentration of the solution used in the \ninfusion pump must be no lower than 5 μg/ml ziconotide in an external pump and 25 μg/ml in an \ninternal pump. \n\nStrict aseptic procedures must be used during the preparation and handling of the solution for infusion \nand refilling of the pump.  The patient and health-care providers must be familiar with the handling of \nthe external or internal infusion system and be aware of the need to guard against infection. \n\nSpecific instructions for using the pumps must be obtained from the manufacturer.   \n\nPrialt has been shown to be chemically and physically compatible with the implantable Synchromed \npump and the external CADD-Micro pump at the concentration levels indicated above.  Chemical and \nphysical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 14 days at 37ºC in the Synchromed pump when the \npump has not previously been exposed to the medicinal product.  The initial fill must therefore be \nreplaced after 14 days. \n\nPrialt was stable for 60 days at 37°C in the Synchromed pump previously exposed to the medicinal \nproduct.  Stability has been demonstrated for 21 days at room temperature in the CADD-Micro pump. \n\nThe technical data are given only for information and should not limit health-care providers’ choice.\nCE marked pumps equivalent to the Synchromed and CADD-Micro pump should be used to deliver \nPrialt.   \n\nPumps previously used to deliver other medicinal products must be washed out three times with \nsodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection (preservative-free) before being filled with \nPrialt.  The introduction of air into the pump reservoir or cartridge should be minimized, as oxygen can \ndegrade ziconotide. \n\nPrior to initiation of therapy, an internal pump must be rinsed three times with 2 ml of Prialt at \n25 μg/ml.  The concentration of Prialt in a naïve pump may be reduced due to adsorption onto the \nsurfaces of the device, and/or dilution by the residual space of the device.  Because of this, after the \nfirst use of Prialt, the reservoir should be emptied and refilled after 14 days.  Subsequently the pump \nshould be emptied and refilled every 60 days. \n\nPrialt should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration.  \nThe solution should not be used if discoloured or cloudy or if particulate matter is observed. \n\nFor single use only.  Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in \naccordance with local requirements.  \n\n\n\n16 \n\n7.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for infusion (infusion). \n\nClear, colourless solution. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nZiconotide is indicated for the treatment of severe, chronic pain in adults who require intrathecal (IT) \nanalgesia. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\nTreatment with ziconotide should only be undertaken by physicians experienced in intrathecal (IT) \nadministration of medicinal products.   \n\nPosology \n\nAdults (including the elderly ≥ 65 years of age) \n\nDosing of ziconotide should be initiated at 2.4 μg/day and titrated on an individual patient basis \naccording to the patient’s analgesic response and adverse reactions.  Patients should be titrated in dose \nincrements of ≤ 2.4 μg/day, up to a maximum dose of 21.6 μg/day.  The minimal interval between \ndose increases is 24 hours; the recommended interval, for safety reasons, is 48 hours or more.  If \nnecessary the dose can be decreased by any amount (including stopping the infusion) for the \nmanagement of adverse reactions.  Approximately 75% of patients who respond satisfactorily to \ntreatment require a dose of ≤ 9.6 μg/day. \n\nRenal impairment \n\nStudies have not been conducted in patients with impaired renal function.  Caution should be exercised \nwhen ziconotide is administered to patients with impaired renal function. \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n\n\n18 \n\nStudies have not been conducted in patients with impaired hepatic function.  Caution should be \nexercised when ziconotide is administered to patients with impaired hepatic function. \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of ziconotide in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. \n\nNo data are available. \n\nMethod of administration \n\nIntrathecal use. \n\nZiconotide must be administered as a continuous infusion via an intrathecal catheter, using an external \nor internally implanted mechanical infusion pump capable of delivering an accurate infusion volume.  \nAs the risk of meningitis secondary to prolonged catheterisation of the intrathecal space is greater with \nan external catheter infusion system, internal systems are recommended to administer ziconotide for \nprolonged periods (see section 4.4).  An external catheter system should only be used when an internal \nsystem cannot be implanted. \n\nWhen low doses of ziconotide are required, for example when initiating titration, ziconotide must be \ndiluted before use with preservative-free sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. \n\nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nCombination with IT chemotherapy (see section 4.5). \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nLong-term use \nAlthough ziconotide has been studied in long-term, open label efficacy and safety clinical trials, \ncontrolled studies of longer than 3 weeks duration have not been conducted (see section 5.1).  Possible \nlong-term local toxic effects on the spinal cord have not been excluded and preclinical data in this \nrespect are limited (see section 5.3).  Therefore, caution is needed during long-term treatment. \n\nRisk of infection \nThe administration of medicinal products by the intrathecal (IT) route carries the risk of potentially \nserious infections, such as meningitis, which may be life threatening.  Meningitis due to the entrance \nof organisms along the catheter track or inadvertent contamination of the infusion system is a known \ncomplication of intrathecal medicinal product administration, especially with external systems. \n\nPatients and physicians must be vigilant for typical symptoms and signs of meningitis. \n\nThe optimal intrathecal placement of the catheter tip has not been established.  Lower catheter tip \nplacement, e.g. at the lumbar level, may reduce the incidence of ziconotide-related neurological \nadverse reactions.  Therefore, catheter tip placement should be carefully considered to allow adequate \naccess to spinal nociceptive segments whilst minimising medicinal product concentrations at cerebral \nlevels. \n\nOnly a small number of patients have received systemic chemotherapy and IT ziconotide.  Caution \nshould be exercised when ziconotide is administered to patients who are receiving systemic \nchemotherapy (see section 4.5). \n\n\n\n19 \n\nElevations in creatine kinase \nElevations in creatine kinase, which are usually asymptomatic, are common amongst patients on \nintrathecal ziconotide.  Progressive elevation of the creatine kinase is uncommon.  However \nmonitoring of creatine kinase is recommended.  In the event of progressive elevation, or clinically \nsignificant elevation in association with clinical features of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, \ndiscontinuation of ziconotide should be considered. \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \nHypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have not been observed during clinical trials and the \nimmunogenicity of ziconotide administered by the IT route appears to be low.  However, the potential \nfor severe allergic reactions cannot be excluded and spontaneous reports of anaphylactic reactions \nhave been received. \n\nCognitive and neuropsychiatric adverse reactions \nCognitive and neuropsychiatric adverse reactions, particularly confusion, are common in patients \ntreated with ziconotide.  Cognitive impairment typically appears after several weeks of treatment.  \nEpisodes of acute psychiatric disturbances, such as hallucinations, paranoid reactions, hostility, \naggressiveness, delirium, psychosis and manic reactions have been reported in patients treated with \nziconotide.  The ziconotide dose should be reduced or discontinued if signs or symptoms of cognitive \nimpairment or neuropsychiatric adverse reactions develop, but other contributing causes should also be \nconsidered.  The cognitive effects of ziconotide are typically reversible within 1 - 4 weeks after \ndiscontinuation of the medicinal product, but may persist in some cases.  It is recommended that patients \nundergo a neuropsychiatric evaluation before and after starting intrathecal ziconotide. \n\nIn patients with severe chronic pain there is a higher incidence of suicide and suicide attempts than in \nthe general population.  Ziconotide may cause or worsen depression with the risk of suicide in \nsusceptible patients. \n\nDepression of Central Nervous System (CNS) \nPatients have experienced depressed levels of consciousness while receiving ziconotide.  The patient \nusually remains conscious and breathing is not depressed.  The event may be self limited, but \nziconotide should be discontinued until the event resolves.  The re-introduction of ziconotide is not \nrecommended in these patients.  Withdrawal of concomitant CNS depressant medicinal products \nshould also be considered as they may contribute to the reduced level of arousal. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nSpecific clinical medicinal product interaction studies have not been conducted with ziconotide.  \nHowever, low plasma ziconotide concentrations, metabolism by ubiquitous peptidases and relatively \nlow plasma protein binding (see section 5.2) make metabolic-based interactions or plasma protein \ndisplacement type interactions between ziconotide and other medicinal products unlikely. \n\nNo clinical data are available on the interaction between IT chemotherapy and IT ziconotide.  \nZiconotide is contraindicated in combination with IT chemotherapy (see section 4.3). \n\nOnly a small number of patients have received systemic chemotherapy and IT ziconotide.  Caution \nshould be exercised when ziconotide is administered to patients who are receiving systemic \nchemotherapy (see section 4.4). \n\nMedicinal products that affect specific peptidases/proteases would not be expected to impact upon \nziconotide plasma exposure.  Based on very limited clinical investigations, both angiotensin \nconverting enzyme inhibitors (e.g., benazepril, lisinopril and moexipril) and HIV protease inhibitors \n(e.g., ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir), have no readily apparent effect on plasma ziconotide exposure. \n\nZiconotide does not interact with opiate receptors. If discontinuing opiates when initiating ziconotide \ntherapy, opiate withdrawal should be gradual. For patients being withdrawn from IT opiates, the IT \n\n\n\n20 \n\nopiate infusion dose should be gradually tapered over a few weeks and replaced with a \npharmacologically equivalent dose of oral opiates.  Adding IT ziconotide to stable doses of IT \nmorphine (see section 5.1), is possible but requires special attention, as a high rate of neuropsychiatric \nadverse reactions (confusion/thinking abnormal, paranoid reactions and hallucinations, and abnormal \ngait), some of them serious, was observed in Study 202 despite a low dose of ziconotide. Vomiting and \nanorexia, and peripheral oedema were also observed when IT ziconotide was added to IT morphine.  \nThe addition of IT morphine to stable doses of IT ziconotide is better tolerated (pruritis has been \nreported) (see section 5.1). \n\nAn increased incidence of somnolence has been observed when ziconotide is administered \nconcomitantly with systemic baclofen, clonidine, bupivacaine or propofol thus for the time being their \nsimultaneous use is discouraged. \n\nNo data are available regarding the concomitant use of partial opioid agonists (e.g. buprenorphine) \nwith ziconotide. \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\nPregnancy  \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of ziconotide in pregnant women.   \n\nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3 \n\nZiconotide is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception.  \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether ziconotide/metabolites are excreted in human milk. \n\nA risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  \n\nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \nziconotide therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n\nFertility \n\nNo specific studies with ziconotide in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In a \nstudy on male and female fertility in rats no effects in males while reductions in corpora lutea; \nimplantation sites and number of live embryos were observed in females (see section 5.3). \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nZiconotide has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\nZiconotide may cause confusion, somnolence and other neurological adverse reactions, therefore \npatients must be advised not to drive or operate machines if affected. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile \nThe safety of ziconotide administered as a continuous intrathecal infusion has been evaluated in more \nthan 1,400 patients participating in acute and chronic pain clinical trials.  The duration of treatment has \nranged from one-hour bolus infusion to continuous use for more than 6 years.  The median exposure \n\n\n\n21 \n\ntime was 43 days.  The infusion dose rate ranged from 0.03 - 912 μg/day, with a median final dose rate \nof 7.2 μg/day. \n\nIn clinical trials, 88% of patients experienced adverse reactions.  The most common adverse reactions \nreported in long-term clinical trials were dizziness (42%), nausea (30%), nystagmus (23%), \nconfusional state (25%), gait abnormal (16%), memory impairment (13%), vision blurred (14%), \nheadache (12%), asthenia (13%), vomiting (11%), and somnolence (10%).  Most adverse reactions \nwere mild to moderate in severity and resolved over time. \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nUnless otherwise noted shows the incidence rates of adverse reactions reported in the intrathecal \nclinical trials with ziconotide (short- and long-term exposure).

Patients and physicians must be vigilant \nfor typical symptoms and signs of meningitis (see section 4.4). \n\nElevations of creatine phosphokinase \n\nElevations in creatine phosphokinase were usually asymptomatic. Monitoring of creatine \nphosphokinase is recommended.  Discontinuation of ziconotide should be considered in the event of \nprogressive or significant elevation of creatine phosphokinase in association with clinical features of \nmyopathy or rhabdomyolysis (see section 4.4). \n\nCNS adverse reactions \n\n\n\n24 \n\nCognitive and neuropsychiatric adverse reactions are common in patients treated with ziconotide. \nCognitive impairment typically appears after several weeks of treatment. Episodes of acute psychiatric \ndisturbances, such as hallucinations, paranoid reactions, hostility, aggressiveness, delirium, psychosis \nand manic reactions have been reported in patients treated with ziconotide. The ziconotide dose should \nbe reduced or discontinued if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment or neuropsychiatric adverse \nreactions develop, but other contributing causes should also be considered. The cognitive effects of \nziconotide are typically reversible within 1 - 4 weeks after discontinuation of the medicinal product, \nbut may persist in some cases.  It is recommended that patients undergo a neuropsychiatric evaluation \nbefore and after starting intrathecal ziconotide (see section 4.4). \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\nIn intravenous infusion studies, healthy male volunteers received ziconotide at doses of up to \n70,000 μg/day or 3,200 times the maximum recommended daily intrathecal infusion dose.  Postural \nhypotension was observed in almost all subjects who received high intravenous doses of ziconotide. \n\nThe maximum recommended intrathecal dose is 21.6 μg/day.  The maximum intended intrathecal dose \nof ziconotide in clinical trials was 912 μg/day following upward titration over 7 days. \n\nSymptoms \nIn one clinical study a male cancer patient received an accidental IT ziconotide overdose of 744 μg \nover a 24-hour period (31 μg/hour) and resumed treatment at the intended dose after experiencing a \nreduction in Visual Analog Scale of Pain Intensity (VASPI) from 82 to 2.5 mm.  In some patients who \nreceived intrathecal doses greater than the maximum recommended dose, exaggerated \npharmacological effects, e.g., ataxia, nystagmus, dizziness, stupor, depressed level of consciousness, \nmuscle spasms, confusional state, sedation, hypotension, aphasia, speech disorder, nausea and \nvomiting were observed.  There was no indication of respiratory depression.  Most patients under \nobservation recovered within 24 hours of withdrawal of the medicinal product. \n\nManagement \nGeneral medical supportive measures should be administered to patients who receive an overdose until \nthe exaggerated pharmacological effects of the medicinal product have resolved. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group:  Analgesics, other analgesics and antipyretics, ATC code:  N02BG08 \n\nMechanism of action \nZiconotide is a synthetic analogue of a ω-conopeptide, MVIIA, found in the venom of the Conus \nmagus marine snail.  It is an N-type calcium channel blocker (NCCB).  NCCs regulate \nneurotransmitter release in specific neuronal populations responsible for the spinal processing of pain.  \nIn binding to these neuronal NCCs ziconotide inhibits the voltage sensitive calcium current into \nprimary nociceptive afferents terminating in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.  \nIn turn, this inhibits their release of neurotransmitters (including Substance P) and therefore, the spinal \nsignalling of pain. \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n25 \n\nThough statistically significant relationships and reasonable correlation between cerebrospinal fluid \n(CSF) exposure (AUC, Cmax) and clinical response measures have been observed following 1 hour IT \nadministration, no well-defined dose-concentration-response relationships have yet been identified.  \nMany responsive patients obtain near-maximal analgesia within a few hours of delivery of an \nappropriate dose.  However, maximal effects may be delayed for approximately 24 hours in some \npatients.  Given the occurrence of analgesia and adverse reactions at similar doses, the recommended \ninterval between dose increases is 48 hours or more.  If necessary the dose can be decreased by any \namount (including stopping the infusion) for the management of adverse reactions. \n\nNervous system adverse reactions, particularly dizziness, nausea and abnormal gait appear to be \ncorrelated with CSF exposure, though a definitive relationship has not been established. \n\nLow plasma exposure occurs during IT infusion due to the low recommended IT infusion rates and \nrelatively rapid plasma clearance (see section 5.2).  Therefore, pharmacological effects related to \nsystemic exposure should be minimal. \n\nThe median dose at response is approximately 6.0 μg/day and approximately 75% of responsive \npatients require ≤ 9.6 μg/day.  To limit the occurrence of serious adverse reactions, a maximum dose \nof 21.6 μg/day is recommended.  However, in clinical trials it has been observed that patients who \ntolerate doses of 21.6 μg/day following slow titration over a 3 to 4-week period, generally tolerate \nhigher doses up to 48.0 μg/day. \n\nThere is no evidence of the development of pharmacological tolerance to ziconotide in patients.  \nHowever, in view of limited data, the development of tolerance cannot be excluded.  Examination of \nthe patency of the intrathecal catheter should be considered if the required ziconotide dose continually \nincreases and there is no benefit or increase in adverse reactions. \n\nAlternative dosing regimens including initiation of dosing with lower doses of ziconotide and bolus \nadministration have been explored in a limited number of studies available in the literature. \n\nThe use of lower doses through continuous administration was demonstrated to achieve efficacy with \nfewer adverse reactions. \n\nBolus administration studies suggest that bolus dosing may be useful in identifying patients who may \nbenefit from long term use of ziconotide, however, may result in more adverse reactions than \nadministration by continuous infusion. \n\nThese studies suggest that these alternative methods of administration of ziconotide may be possible \nhowever, due to the limited numbers of patients, these results are inconclusive and there is currently \ninsufficient evidence available to make definitive recommendations for such alternative dosing \nregimens. \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nThere were three placebo-controlled clinical trials of IT ziconotide. \n\nTwo short-term studies, 95-001 (malignant pain) and 96-002 (non malignant pain), involving \n366 patients, demonstrated the efficacy of IT ziconotide in severe chronic pain using the percent \nchange in Visual Analog Scale of Pain Intensity (VASPI) as the primary efficacy measure.  These \nstudies were of short duration, 5 and 6 days respectively, and used a more rapid dose escalation and \nhigher doses than recommended in Section 4.2. \n\nEfficacy results from study 95-001 \n\nInitial treatment assignment \nParameter Ziconotide (n = 71) Placebo (n = 40) p-value \n\nMean VASPI score at 74.1 (± 13.82) 77.9 (± 13.60) _ \n\n\n\n26 \n\nbaseline in mm (SD) \nMean VASPI score at end of \ninitial titration in mm (SD) \n\n35.7 (± 33.27) 61.0 (± 22.91) _ \n\n% improvement in VASPI \nscore at end of initial titration\n(SD) \n\n51.4 (± 43.63) 18.1 (± 28.28) < 0.001 \n\nRespondera n (%) 34 (47.9%) 7 (17.5%) 0.001 \nDose at end of titration \n(μg/hr) \n\nMean \nMedian \n\nRange\n\n0.91 \n0.60 \n\n0.074 - 9.36 \naResponders were defined as those patients who 1) experienced a ≥ 30% drop in VASPI score \ncompared to baseline; 2) had stable or decreased concomitant opioid analgesics; and 3) had opiate type \nunchanged from preinfusion if receiving opiates. \nSD – Standard Deviation. \n\nEfficacy results from study 96-002 \n\nInitial treatment assignment \nParameter Ziconotide (n = 169)b Placebo (n = 86) p-value \n\nMean VASPI score at \nbaseline in mm (SD) \n\n80.1 (± 15.10) 76.9 (± 14.58) _ \n\nMean VASPI score at end of \ninitial titration in mm (SD) \n\n54.4 (± 29.30) 71.9 (± 30.93) _ \n\n% improvement in VASPI \nscore at end of initial titration\n(SD) \n\n31.2 (± 38.69) 6.0 (± 42.84) < 0.001 \n\nRespondera n (%) 57 (33.7%) 11 (12.8%) < 0.001 \nDose at end of titration \n(μg/hr) \n\nMean \nMedian \n\nRange\n\n1.02 \n0.50 \n\n0.019 - 9.60 \naResponders were defined as those patients who 1) experienced a ≥ 30% drop in VASPI score \ncompared to baseline; 2) had stable or decreased concomitant opioid analgesics; and 3) had opiate type \nunchanged from preinfusion if receiving opiates. \nb164 patients provided VASPI scores for ziconotide at the end of titration. \nSD – Standard Deviation. \n\nThe aetiologies of pain in studies 95-001 (malignant pain) and 96-002 (non-malignant pain) were \nvaried and included bone pain (n = 38) mostly due to bone metastases (n = 34), myelopathy (n = 38), \nhalf of whom had spinal cord injury with paralysis (n = 19), neuropathy (n = 79), radiculopathy \n(n = 24), spinal pain (n = 91) mostly due to failed back surgery (n = 82), and other aetiologies (n = 82).  \nSome patients had more than one cause of pain.  The efficacy of IT ziconotide was apparent in all \ngroups. \n\nStudy 301 (n = 220) was of longer duration (21 days), involved more cautious up-titration and lower \ndoses of IT ziconotide, and enrolled the most refractory population of patients studied in the three \nstudies.  All patients in the 301 study had failed IT therapy with combinations of analgesics and their \nphysicians considered that 97% of the patients were refractory to currently available treatments.  The \nmajority had spinal pain (n = 134), especially failed back surgery (n = 110); a lower proportion had \nneuropathy (n = 36).  Only five had malignant pain.  The primary endpoint was the percent change in \nVASPI score.  The efficacy of IT ziconotide in study 301 was lower than in the previous two, \nshort-term studies.  The frequency and severity of adverse reactions were also lower. \n\n\n\n27 \n\nEfficacy results from study 301\n\nInitial treatment assignment \nParameter Ziconotide (n = 112) Placebo (n = 108) p-value \n\nMean VASPI score at baseline \nin mm (SD) \n\n80.7 (± 14.98) 80.7 (± 14.91) - \n\nMean VASPI score at end of \ninitial titration in mm (SD) \n\n67.9 (± 22.89) 74.1 (± 21.28) _ \n\n% improvement in VASPI score \nat end of initial titration (SD) \n\n14.7 (± 27.71) 7.2 (± 24.98) 0.0360 \n\nRespondera n (%) 18 (16.1%) 13 (12.0%) 0.390 \nDose at end of titration (μg/hr) \n\nMean \nMedian \n\nRange\n\n0.29 \n0.25 \n\n0.0 - 0.80 \naResponders were defined as those who experienced a ≥ 30% drop in VASPI score compared to \nbaseline. \nSD – Standard Deviation. \n\nCombination studies with IT Morphine \nClinical studies 201 and 202 indicate that the combination of IT ziconotide and IT morphine may \neffectively reduce pain and decrease systemic opioid use over a sustained period of time for patients \nwhose pain was inadequately controlled with their maximum tolerated dose of IT ziconotide (median \n8.7 μg/day, mean 25.7 μg/day – study 201) or with IT morphine (study 202) alone.  When adding IT \nziconotide to stable doses of IT morphine, as with the initiation of IT ziconotide monotherapy, the \nappearance of psychotic adverse reactions (e.g., hallucinations, paranoid reactions) or discontinuation \ndue to increased adverse reactions may occur. (see section 4.5). \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe CSF pharmacokinetics of ziconotide have been studied following one-hour IT infusions of \n1 - 10 μg of ziconotide in patients with chronic pain.  The plasma pharmacokinetics following \nintravenous doses (0.3 – 10 μg/kg/24 hr) were also studied.  IT and intravenous pharmacokinetics data \nare summarised below. \n\nCSF and Plasma Pharmacokinetics of Ziconotide [mean ± SD (median)] \n\nRoute of \nadministration \n\nFluid \nmatrix \n\nNumber \nof \n\npatients  \n\nCL (ml/min) Vd (ml) t½ (hr) \n\nIntrathecal CSF 23 0.38 ± 0.56 \n(0.26) \n\n155 ± 263 \n(99) \n\n4.6 ± 0.9 \n(4.5) \n\nIntravenous Plasma 21 270 ± 44 \n(260) \n\n30,460 ± 6,366 \n(29,320) \n\n1.3 ± 0.3 \n(1.3) \n\nCL = clearance; Vd = distribution volume; t½ = half life \n\nAbsorption   \nFollowing one-hour IT administration (1 – 10 μg), both cumulative exposure (AUC; range:  83.6 –\n608 ng/h/ml) and peak exposure (Cmax; range:  16.4 – 132 ng/ml) values were variable and \ndose-dependent, but appeared only approximately dose-proportional.  Plasma concentrations following \ncontinuous (≥ 48 h) IT infusion (≤ 21.6 μg/day) appear to be relatively low and typically undetectable \n(i.e., about 80% of plasma samples collected from pain patients contain no quantifiable medicinal \nproduct; < 0.04 ng/ml).  No accumulation of ziconotide in plasma following long-term IT \nadministration (up to 9 months) has been observed. \n\n\n\n28 \n\nDistribution   \nMedian ziconotide CSF volume of distribution (Vd:  99 ml) is between the spinal cord CSF volume \n(approximately 75 ml) and total CSF volume (approximately 130 ml).  Ziconotide appears to distribute \nmainly within the CSF until transferred to the systemic circulation.  Upon reaching the systemic \ncirculation, ziconotide appears to be more extensively distributed, based on a plasma distribution \nvolume of approximately 30 l and is only about 53% bound (non-specifically) to human plasma \nproteins. \n\nBiotransformation   \nZiconotide is a peptide consisting of 25 naturally-occurring amino acids of the L-configuration, and \ndoes not appear to be appreciably metabolised in the CSF.  Following passage into the systemic \ncirculation, ziconotide is expected to be primarily susceptible to proteolytic cleavage by various \nubiquitous peptidases/proteases present in most organs (e.g., kidney, liver, lung, muscle, etc.), and thus \ndegraded to peptide fragments and its individual constituent free amino acids.  The generated free \namino acids are expected to be taken up by cellular carrier systems and either subjected to normal \nintermediary metabolism or used as substrates for constitutive biosynthetic processes.  Due to the wide \ndistribution of these peptidases it is not expected that hepatic or renal impairment would affect the \nsystemic clearance of ziconotide.  The biological activity of the various expected proteolytic \ndegradation products has not been assessed.  It is unlikely that the degradation products of ziconotide \nwill have significant biological activity, as peptides consisting of the individual peptide loop structures \nhave been found to have binding affinities for N-type voltage sensitive calcium channels that are \nseveral orders of magnitude lower than that of the parent (ziconotide) compound. \n\nElimination   \nMean ziconotide CL (0.38 ml/min) approximates adult human CSF turnover rate (0.3 - 0.4 ml/min).  \nHence, ziconotide appears to be mainly eliminated from the CSF (mean t½ = 4.6 hr) by bulk flow of \nCSF out of the CNS through the arachnoid villi with subsequent transfer into the systemic circulation.  \nVery low circulating plasma concentrations of ziconotide may be observed following IT \nadministration due to both the low IT infusion rate and relatively rapid plasma clearance.  The mean \nplasma elimination half-life (t½) is 1.3 hr.  Ziconotide is a relatively small molecular weight peptide \n(MW = 2,639) and is filtered by the kidney glomerulus, but only minimal amounts of ziconotide \n(< 1%) are recovered in human urine following intravenous infusion.  This is because almost all of the \nfiltered active substance is rapidly endocytosed and ultimately transported back to the systemic \ncirculation. \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \nNo formal studies assessing the impact of renal or hepatic dysfunction have been conducted; however, \ngiven that peptidases are present in various body organs, it is not anticipated that renal or hepatic \ndysfunction will significantly impact systemic exposure of ziconotide. \n\nOther special populations   \nAlthough only limited data are available, there is no obvious effect of race, height, weight, gender or \nage on CSF ziconotide exposure after IT administration.   \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nEffects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the \nmaximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. \n\nIn subchronic continuous intrathecal infusion studies in rats and dogs, behavioural effects were seen at \ndoses ≥ 8-fold the maximum recommended clinical intrathecal infusion dose of 21.6 μg/day (on a \nmg/kg basis).  These effects were defined by exaggerated pharmacological actions of ziconotide and \nnot by neurotoxic lesions or target organ toxicity.  Observations included transient and reversible \nneurological effects consisting of tremors, uncoordinated movements and hyper- and hypoactivity. \n\nThe long-term consequences to neuronal function of continuous N-type calcium-channel block have \nnot been demonstrated in experimental animals.  Changes in neurological signalling have not been \n\n\n\n29 \n\nstudied in experimental animals.  Ziconotide did not induce bacterial gene mutation and was not \ngenotoxic.  Chronic animal studies have not been performed to assess the carcinogenic potential of \nziconotide.  However, ziconotide did not induce cell transformation in the in vitro Syrian hamster \nembryo (SHE) assay and did not increase cell proliferation (pre-neoplastic lesion formation) or \napoptosis after subchronic intrathecal exposure in dogs. \n\nIn rat fertility studies, there were no effects in males while reductions in corpora lutea; implantation \nsites and number of live embryos were observed in females.  No adverse effects on female \nreproduction and post-natal development in rats were seen at systemic exposures up to 2,300 times \nhuman exposures at the maximum recommended intrathecal dose. \n\nZiconotide was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits at exposures < 100 times human plasma levels. \n\nThese results do not indicate a significant risk to humans due to the relatively high systemic exposures \nneeded to elicit these effects in rats and rabbits. \n\n6.

If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the \nresponsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C – 8°C, unless dilution \nhas taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage\n\nStore in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C).  Do not freeze.  Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect \nfrom light. \n\nFor storage conditions after dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n\n\n\n30 \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n\nType I glass vials with butyl rubber stoppers coated with fluorinated polymer. \n\nEach vial contains 1, 2 or 5 ml solution for infusion. \n\nOne vial per carton. \n\nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling\n\nIf dilution is required, Prialt must be diluted aseptically with preservative-free sodium chloride \n9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection before use.  The concentration of the solution used in the \ninfusion pump must be no lower than 5 μg/ml ziconotide in an external pump and 25 μg/ml in an \ninternal pump. \n\nStrict aseptic procedures must be used during the preparation and handling of the solution for infusion \nand refilling of the pump.  The patient and health-care providers must be familiar with the handling of \nthe external or internal infusion system and be aware of the need to guard against infection. \n\nSpecific instructions for using the pumps must be obtained from the manufacturer.   \n\nPrialt has been shown to be chemically and physically compatible with the implantable Synchromed \npump and the external CADD-Micro pump at the concentration levels indicated above.  Chemical and \nphysical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 14 days at 37ºC in the Synchromed pump when the \npump has not previously been exposed to the medicinal product.  The initial fill must therefore be \nreplaced after 14 days. \n\nPrialt was stable for 60 days at 37°C in the Synchromed pump previously exposed to the medicinal \nproduct.  Stability has been demonstrated for 21 days at room temperature in the CADD-Micro pump. \n\nThe technical data are given only for information and should not limit health-care providers’ choice.\nCE marked pumps equivalent to the Synchromed and CADD-Micro pump should be used to deliver \nPrialt.   \n\nPumps previously used to deliver other medicinal products must be washed out three times with \nsodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection (preservative-free) before being filled with \nPrialt.  The introduction of air into the pump reservoir or cartridge should be minimized, as oxygen can \ndegrade ziconotide. \n\nPrior to initiation of therapy, an internal pump must be rinsed three times with 2 ml of Prialt at \n25 μg/ml.  The concentration of Prialt in a naïve pump may be reduced due to adsorption onto the \nsurfaces of the device, and/or dilution by the residual space of the device.  Because of this, after the \nfirst use of Prialt, the reservoir should be emptied and refilled after 14 days.  Subsequently the pump \nshould be emptied and refilled every 60 days. \n\nPrialt should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration.  \nThe solution should not be used if discoloured or cloudy or if particulate matter is observed. \n\nFor single use only.  Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in \naccordance with local requirements.  \n\n\n\n31 \n\n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n45 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient\n\nPrialt 25 micrograms/ml solution for infusion \nZiconotide \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you.\n- Keep this leaflet.  You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor.  This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet.  See section 4. \n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Prialt is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Prialt \n3. How to use Prialt \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Prialt \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n1. What Prialt is and what it is used for\n\nPrialt contains the active substance ziconotide which belongs to a group of medicines, called \nanalgesics or ‘painkillers’.  Prialt is used for the treatment of severe, long-term pain in adults who need \na painkiller by intrathecal injection (injection into the space that surrounds the spinal cord and the \nbrain). \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Prialt\n\nYou should not be given Prialt \n- If you are allergic to ziconotide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). \n- If you are receiving an anticancer medicine into the space around your spinal cord. \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before you are given Prialt \n- The effects of long-term treatment of Prialt are uncertain at this time and the possibility of toxic \n\neffects on the spinal cord have not yet been ruled out.  In case of a need for long term treatment, \nmonitoring may be necessary (as decided by your doctor). \n\n- If you are receiving Prialt via a pump worn outside your body, it is important you check once \ndaily for any signs of infection at the point where the tube enters your body. \n\n- If you observe any signs of infection around the tube, such as skin redness, swelling, pain or \ndischarge, you must tell your doctor immediately and seek treatment for the infection. \n\n- If you develop any tenderness in the area around the tube without signs of infection, you should \nseek advice from your doctor as soon as possible as tenderness may be an early sign of \ninfection. \n\n- If you are receiving Prialt via a pump worn outside your body and any part of the infusion \ntubing becomes disconnected, you must contact your doctor or nurse immediately. \n\n- If you have any of the following symptoms:  high temperature, headache, stiff neck, tiredness, \nconfusion, feeling sick, vomiting or occasional fits, these may be signs of meningitis.  You must \ntell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the above symptoms. \n\n- If you notice any adverse change in your thinking, mood or memory, please tell your doctor. \n- If you are receiving chemotherapy please tell your doctor. \n\n\n\n46 \n\n- You may have an increased level of an enzyme called creatine kinase in your blood and \nalthough this does not usually cause any symptoms or problems, your doctor is likely to monitor \nits level.  In addition, you may also occasionally experience muscular problems. If such is the \ncase, you should immediately notify your doctor, as he/she may decide to halt your Prialt \ntreatment. \n\n- You should tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms after \nreceiving your treatment; sudden wheeziness, difficulty in breathing, pain in the chest, swelling \nof eyelids, face or lips, rash or itching (especially affecting the whole body). These may be signs \nof a severe allergic reaction. \n\n- In patients that suffer from severe long term pain, there is a higher likelihood of suicide and \nattempted suicide than in the general population. Prialt may also cause or worsen depression in \npeople that are already susceptible. If you are experiencing depression or have a history of \ndepression please inform your healthcare professional before you are commenced on Prialt. If \nafter starting Prialt you experience a worsening of your depression or have any other symptoms \naffecting your mood, please inform your healthcare professional.\n\n- You may experience drowsiness or may not be fully aware of your surroundings whilst \nreceiving treatment.  If this happens, you should immediately notify your doctor, as he/she may \ndecide to halt your Prialt treatment. \n\nChildren and adolescents \nPrialt is not recommended for use in children and adolescents. \n\nOther medicines and Prialt \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines (for example, \nbaclofen used to treat muscle spasticity, clonidine used to treat high blood pressure, bupivacaine used \nfor local anaesthesia, morphine used for pain, propofol used for general anaesthesia, or any medicine \nwhich is  administered by intrathecal injection (injection into the space that surrounds the spinal cord \nand the brain)).  You may feel drowsy if you are given Prialt with certain other medicines used to treat \npain. \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n\nPrialt is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception.  \n\nDriving and using machines \nThe use of Prialt has been reported to cause confusion and drowsiness.  Ask your doctor for advice \nbefore you drive or operate machinery. \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per maximum recommended \nintrathecal dose (21.6 μg/day), i.e. essentially ‘sodium- free’.\n\n3. How to use Prialt\n\nYour treatment with Prialt will be managed by a doctor who has experience of giving medicines into \nthe space around the spinal cord, and in the use of internal and external infusion pumps. \n\nThe recommended starting dose is no more than 2.4 micrograms per day.  Your doctor will adjust the \ndose of Prialt according to the severity of your pain by adding no more than 2.4 micrograms/day.  The \nmaximum dose is 21.6 micrograms/day.  At the start of your treatment your doctor may increase your \ndose every 1 to 2 days or more.  If needed, the dose may be decreased or injection stopped if the side \neffects are too great. \n\n\n\n47 \n\nPrialt is given as a very slow continuous injection into the space surrounding the spinal cord \n(intrathecal use).  The medicine will be administered continuously from a pump either implanted into \nyour abdominal wall or placed externally in a belt pouch.  Your doctor will discuss with you the kind \nof pump that will be most suitable for you and when you need to have your pump refilled. \n\nIf you feel that you are still in too much pain while receiving Prialt, or that the side effects are too \ngreat, talk to your doctor. \n\nBefore giving you Prialt, your doctor might decide to slowly stop giving you opiates (other types of \nmedicinal product which are used to treat pain) into your spinal cord and instead replace with \nalternative pain medicinal products. \n\nIf you receive more Prialt than you should \nIf you receive more Prialt than your doctor intended, you may feel unwell with signs such as \nconfusion, problems with speech, word finding difficulties, excessive shaking, light-headedness, \nexcessive sleepiness, feeling or being sick.  If this happens, consult your doctor or hospital \nimmediately. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n\n4.

There are also links to other websites about rare diseases and treatments. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: \n\nInstructions for use and handling \n\nPrialt is supplied as a clear, colourless solution in single use vials.  It should be inspected visually for \nparticulate matter and discolouration prior to administration.  The solution should not be used if \ndiscoloured or cloudy or if particulate matter is observed. \n\nFor single use only.  Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in \naccordance with local requirements.  \n\nIf dilution is required, Prialt must be diluted aseptically with preservative-free sodium chloride \n9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection before use.  The concentration of the solution used in the \ninfusion pump must be no lower than 5 μg/ml ziconotide in an external pump and 25 μg/ml in an \ninternal pump. \n\nStrict aseptic procedures must be used during the preparation and handling of the solution for infusion \nand refilling of the pump.  The patient and health-care providers must be familiar with the handling of \nthe external or internal infusion system and be aware of the need to guard against infection. \n\nSpecific instructions for using the pumps must be obtained from the manufacturer.   \n\nPrialt has been shown to be chemically and physically compatible with the implantable Synchromed \npump and the external CADD-Micro pump at the concentration levels indicated above.  Chemical and \nphysical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 14 days at 37ºC in the Synchromed pump when the \npump has not previously been exposed to the medicinal product.  The initial fill must therefore be \nreplaced after 14 days. \n\nPrialt was stable for 60 days at 37°C in the Synchromed pump previously exposed to the medicinal \nproduct.  Stability has been demonstrated for 21 days at room temperature in the CADD-Micro pump. \n\nThe technical data are given only for information and should not limit health-care providers’ choice. \nCE marked pumps equivalent to the Synchromed and CADD-Micro pump should be used to deliver \nziconotide.   \n\n\n\n52 \n\nPumps previously used to deliver other medicinal products must be washed out three times with \nsodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection (preservative-free) before being filled with \nziconotide.  The introduction of air into the pump reservoir or cartridge should be minimized, as \noxygen can degrade ziconotide. \n\nPrior to initiation of therapy, an internal pump must be rinsed three times with 2 ml of the solution at \n25 μg/ml.  The concentration of Prialt in a naïve pump may be reduced due to adsorption onto the \nsurfaces of the device, and/or dilution by the residual space of the device.  Because of this, after the \nfirst use of Prialt, the reservoir should be emptied and refilled after 14 days.  Subsequently the pump \nshould be emptied and refilled every 60 days. \n\n\n\n53 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient\n\nPrialt 100 micrograms/ml solution for infusion \nZiconotide \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you.\n- Keep this leaflet.  You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor.  This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet.  See section 4. \n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What Prialt is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Prialt \n3. How to use Prialt \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Prialt \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n1. What Prialt is and what it is used for\n\nPrialt contains the active substance ziconotide which belongs to a group of medicines, called \nanalgesics or ‘painkillers’.  Prialt is used for the treatment of severe, long-term pain in adults who need \na painkiller by intrathecal injection (injection into the space that surrounds the spinal cord and the \nbrain). \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Prialt\n\nYou should not be given Prialt \n- If you are allergic to ziconotide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). \n- If you are receiving an anticancer medicine into the space around your spinal cord. \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before you are given Prialt \n- The effects of long-term treatment of Prialt are uncertain at this time and the possibility of toxic \n\neffects on the spinal cord have not yet been ruled out.  In case of a need for long term treatment, \nmonitoring may be necessary (as decided by your doctor). \n\n- If you are receiving Prialt via a pump worn outside your body, it is important you check once \ndaily for any signs of infection at the point where the tube enters your body. \n\n- If you observe any signs of infection around the tube, such as skin redness, swelling, pain or \ndischarge, you must tell your doctor immediately and seek treatment for the infection. \n\n- If you develop any tenderness in the area around the tube without signs of infection, you should \nseek advice from your doctor as soon as possible as tenderness may be an early sign of \ninfection. \n\n- If you are receiving Prialt via a pump worn outside your body and any part of the infusion \ntubing becomes disconnected, you must contact your doctor or nurse immediately. \n\n- If you have any of the following symptoms:  high temperature, headache, stiff neck, tiredness, \nconfusion, feeling sick, vomiting or occasional fits, these may be signs of meningitis.  You must \ntell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the above symptoms. \n\n- If you notice any adverse change in your thinking, mood or memory, please tell your doctor. \n- If you are receiving chemotherapy please tell your doctor. \n\n\n\n54 \n\n- You may have an increased level of an enzyme called creatine kinase in your blood and \nalthough this does not usually cause any symptoms or problems, your doctor is likely to monitor \nits level. In addition, you may also occasionally experience muscular problems. If such is the \ncase, you should immediately notify your doctor, as he/she may decide to halt your Prialt \ntreatment. \n\n- You should tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms after \nreceiving your treatment; sudden wheeziness, difficulty in breathing, pain in the chest, swelling \nof eyelids, face or lips, rash or itching (especially affecting the whole body). These may be signs \nof a severe allergic reaction. \n\n- In patients that suffer from severe long term pain, there is a higher likelihood of suicide and \nattempted suicide than in the general population. Prialt may also cause or worsen depression in \npeople that are already susceptible. If you are experiencing depression or have a history of \ndepression please inform your healthcare professional before you are commenced on Prialt. If \nafter starting Prialt you experience a worsening of your depression or have any other symptoms \naffecting your mood, please inform your healthcare professional. \n\n- You may experience drowsiness or may not be fully aware of your surroundings whilst \nreceiving treatment.  If this happens, you should immediately notify your doctor, as he/she may \ndecide to halt your Prialt treatment. \n\nChildren and adolescents \nPrialt is not recommended for use in children and adolescents. \n\nOther medicines and Prialt \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines (for example, \nbaclofen used to treat muscle spasticity, clonidine used to treat high blood pressure, bupivacaine used \nfor local anaesthesia, morphine used for pain, propofol used for general anaesthesia or any medicine \nwhich is administered by intrathecal injection (injection into the space that surrounds the spinal cord \nand the brain)).  You may feel drowsy if you are given Prialt with certain other medicines used to treat \npain. \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n\nPrialt is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception.  \n\nDriving and using machines \nThe use of Prialt has been reported to cause confusion and drowsiness.  Ask your doctor for advice \nbefore you drive or operate machinery. \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per maximum recommended \nintrathecal dose (21.6 μg/day), i.e. essentially ‘sodium- free’.\n\n3. How to use Prialt\n\nYour treatment with Prialt will be managed by a doctor who has experience of giving medicines into \nthe space around the spinal cord, and in the use of internal and external infusion pumps. \n\nThe recommended starting dose is no more than 2.4 micrograms per day.  Your doctor will adjust the \ndose of Prialt according to the severity of your pain by adding no more than 2.4 micrograms/day.  The \nmaximum dose is 21.6 micrograms/day.  At the start of your treatment your doctor may increase your \ndose every 1 to 2 days or more.  If needed, the dose may be decreased or injection stopped if the side \neffects are too great. \n\n\n\n55 \n\nPrialt is given as a very slow continuous injection into the space surrounding the spinal cord \n(intrathecal use).  The medicine will be administered continuously from a pump either implanted into \nyour abdominal wall or placed externally in a belt pouch.  Your doctor will discuss with you the kind \nof pump that will be most suitable for you and when you need to have your pump refilled. \n\nIf you feel that you are still in too much pain while receiving Prialt, or that the side effects are too \ngreat, talk to your doctor. \n\nBefore giving you Prialt, your doctor might decide to slowly stop giving you opiates (other types of \nmedicinal product which are used to treat pain) into your spinal cord and instead replace with \nalternative pain medicinal products. \n\nIf you receive more Prialt than you should \nIf you receive more Prialt than your doctor intended, you may feel unwell with signs such as \nconfusion, problems with speech, word finding difficulties, excessive shaking, light-headedness, \nexcessive sleepiness, feeling or being sick.  If this happens, consult your doctor or hospital \nimmediately. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n\n4.

Stability has been demonstrated for 21 days at room temperature in the CADD-Micro pump. \n\nThe technical data are given only for information and should not limit health-care providers’ choice. \nCE marked pumps equivalent to the Synchromed and CADD-Micro pump should be used to deliver \nziconotide.   \n\n\n\n60 \n\nPumps previously used to deliver other medicinal products must be washed out three times with \nsodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection (preservative-free) before being filled with \nziconotide.  The introduction of air into the pump reservoir or cartridge should be minimized, as \noxygen can degrade ziconotide. \n\nPrior to initiation of therapy, an internal pump must be rinsed three times with 2 ml of the solution at \n25 μg/ml.  The concentration of Prialt in a naïve pump may be reduced due to adsorption onto the \nsurfaces of the device, and/or dilution by the residual space of the device.  Because of this, after the \nfirst use of Prialt, the reservoir should be emptied and refilled after 14 days.  Subsequently the pump \nshould be emptied and refilled every 60 days. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.\tMANUFACTURER(S) RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tB.\tCONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS REGARDING SUPPLY AND USE\n\tC.\tOTHER CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION\n\tD. \tCONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\tA.\tLABELLING\n\tB.\tPACKAGE LEAFLET","content_length":124852,"file_size":427917}],"conditional_approval":false,"exceptional_circumstances":false,"indication":"<div> \n <div class=\"ecl-field__body\"> \n  <div class=\"ecl-editor first last\">\n   <p>Ziconotide is indicated for the treatment of severe, chronic pain in patients who require intrathecal (IT) analgesia.</p>\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div>","therapeutic_area":["Injections, Spinal","Pain"],"contact_address":"An derWiek 7\n17493 Greifswald-Insel Riems\nGermany","biosimilar":false}
