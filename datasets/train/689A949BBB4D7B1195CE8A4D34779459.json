NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nOrbactiv 400 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains oritavancin diphosphate equivalent to 400 mg oritavancin. \n \nAfter reconstitution, 1 ml of the solution contains 10 mg oritavancin. \n \nAfter dilution, 1 ml of the solution for infusion contains 1.2 mg oritavancin. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion (powder for concentrate). \n \nWhite to off-white powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nOrbactiv is indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in \nadults (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \n1,200 mg administered as a single dose by intravenous infusion over 3 hours. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (\u2265 65 years) \nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients \u2265 65 years of age (see section 5.2).  \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). \nThe pharmacokinetics of oritavancin in patients with severe renal impairment has not been evaluated.  \nOritavancin is not removed from blood by haemodialysis procedures. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nClass B) (see section 5.2). The pharmacokinetics of oritavancin in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh Class C) has not been evaluated, however based on pharmacokinetic \nparameters, severe hepatic impairment is not expected to have an impact on oritavancin exposure. \nTherefore no dose adjustment is required, even if caution should be exercised when prescribing \noritavancin to patients with severe hepatic impariment (Child-Pugh Class C). \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of oritavancin in children and adolescents (<18 years) have not yet been \nestablished.  No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nIntravenous use. \nIntravenous infusion over 3 hours (see section 6.6).  \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nUse of intravenous unfractionated heparin sodium is contraindicated for 120 hours (5 days) after \noritavancin administration because the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) test results may \nremain falsely elevated for up to 120 hours after oritavancin administration (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nSerious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions and anaphylactic shock have been \nreported with the use of oritavancin. If an acute hypersensitivity reaction occurs during oritavancin \ninfusion, oritavancin should be discontinued immediately and appropriate supportive care should be \ninstituted.  \n \nNo data are available on cross-reactivity between oritavancin and other glycopeptides, including \nvancomycin. Before using oritavancin it is important to inquire carefully about previous \nhypersensitivity reactions to glycopeptides (e.g. vancomycin, telavancin). Due to the possibility of \ncross-hypersensitivity, there should be careful monitoring of patients with any history of glycopeptide \nhypersensitivity during and after the infusion. \n \nInfusion related reactions \n \nOritavancin is given via intravenous infusion over 3 hours to minimise the risk of infusion related \nreactions. Intravenous infusions of oritavancin can cause reactions that resemble \u201cred man syndrome\u201d, \nincluding flushing of the upper body, urticaria, pruritis and/or rash. Infusion-associated reactions \ncharacterized by chest pain, chest discomfort, chills, tremor, back pain, neck pain, dyspnoea, hypoxia, \nabdominal pain and fever have been observed with the use of oritavancin, including after the \nadministration of more than one dose of oritavancin (1200mg) during a single course of therapy. If \nreactions do occur, stopping or slowing the infusion may result in cessation of these symptoms (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nNeed for additional antibacterial agents \n \nOritavancin is active against Gram positive bacteria only (see section 5.1). In mixed infections where \nGram negative and/or certain types of anaerobic bacteria are suspected, oritavancin should be co-\nadministered with appropriate antibacterial agent(s). \n \nConcomitant use of warfarin \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\n     \nOritavancin has been shown to artificially prolong prothrombin time (PT) and international normalised \nratio (INR) for up to 12 hours, making the monitoring of the anticoagulation effect of warfarin \nunreliable up to 12 hours after an oritavancin dose.  \n \nInterference with assay for coagulation tests  \n \nOritavancin has been shown to interfere with certain laboratory coagulation tests (see sections 4.3 and \n4.5).  Oritavancin concentrations that are found in the blood of patients following administration of a \nsingle dose have been shown to artificially prolong: \n\n\u2022 aPTT for up to 120 hours,  \n\u2022 PT and INR for up to 12 hours,  \n\u2022 Activated Clotting Time (ACT) for up to 24 hours, \n\u2022 Silica Clot Time (SCT) for up to 18 hours, and \n\u2022 Dilute Russell\u2019s Viper Venom Test (DRVVT) for up to 72 hours. \n\n \nThese effects result from oritavancin binding to and preventing the action of the phospholipid reagents \nwhich activate coagulation in commonly used laboratory coagulation tests. For patients who require \naPTT monitoring within 120 hours of oritavancin dosing, a non-phospholipid dependent coagulation \ntest such as a Factor Xa (chromogenic) assay or an alternative anticoagulant not requiring aPTT \nmonitoring may be considered.  \n \nThe Chromogenic Factor Xa Assay, the Thrombin Time (TT) assay and the assays used for the \ndiagnosis of Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) are not affected by oritavancin. In vitro, \noritavancin 46.6 \u03bcg/mL did not affect an assay for activated protein C resistance (APCR), suggesting \nthat there is a low likelihood that oritavancin will interfere with this test. However, APCR is a \nphospholipid-based test and it cannot be ruled out that higher concentrations of oritavancin that may \noccur during clinical use could interfere with this test. \n \nNo effect of oritavancin on the in vivo coagulation system was observed in nonclinical and clinical \nstudies. \n \nClostridioides difficile-associated diarrhoea \n \nAntibacterial-associated colitis and pseudomembranous colitis have been reported for oritavancin \nand may range in severity from mild to life threatening diarrhoea. Therefore, it is important to \nconsider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhoea subsequent to the administration of \noritavancin (see section 4.8). In such a circumstance, the use of supportive measures together with the \nadministration of specific treatment for Clostridioides difficile should be considered. \n \nSuperinfection  \n \nThe use of antibacterial medicinal products may increase the risk of overgrowth of non-susceptible \nmicro-organisms. If superinfection occurs, appropriate measures should be taken. \n \nOsteomyelitis \n \nIn Phase 3 ABSSSI clinical trials, more cases of osteomyelitis were reported in the oritavancin-treated \narm than in the vancomycin-treated arm (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of osteomyelitis after administration of oritavancin. If osteomyelitis is suspected or \ndiagnosed, appropriate alternative antibacterial therapy should be instituted.  \n \nAbscess \n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nIn the Phase 3 clinical trials, slightly more cases of newly emergent abscesses were reported in the \noritavancin-treated arm than in the vancomycin-treated arm (4.6% vs 3.4%, respectively) (see section \n4.8). If newly emergent abscesses occur, appropriate measures should be taken.  \n \nLimitations of the clinical data \nIn the two major trials in ABSSSI the types of infections treated were confined to cellulitis, abscesses \nand wound infections only. Other types of infections have not been studied. There is limited \nexperience in clinical studies in patients with bacteraemia, peripheral vascular disease or neutropenia, \nin immunocompromised patients, in patients aged > 65 years and in infections due to S. pyogenes.   \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nSubstances metabolised by cytochrome P450  \n \nA screening drug-drug interaction study was conducted in healthy volunteers (n=16) evaluating the \nconcomitant administration of a single 1,200 mg dose of oritavancin with probe substrates for several \nCYP450 enzymes. Oritavancin was found to be a nonspecific, weak inhibitor (CYP2C9 and \nCYP2C19) or a weak inducer (CYP3A4 and CYP2D6) of several CYP isoforms. \n \nCaution should be used when administering oritavancin concomitantly with medicinal products with a \nnarrow therapeutic window that are predominantly metabolised by one of the affected CYP450 \nenzymes(e.g., warfarin), as co-administration may increase (e.g., for CYP2C9 substrates) or decrease \n(e.g., for CYP2D6 substrates) concentrations of the narrow therapeutic range medicinal product. \nPatients should be closely monitored for signs of toxicity or lack of efficacy if they have been given \noritavancin while on a potentially affected compound (e.g. patients should be monitored for bleeding, \nif concomitantly receiving oritavancin and warfarin) (see section 4.4). A study to assess the drug-drug \ninteraction effect of a single 1,200mg dose of oritavancin on the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin \nfollowing a single dose was conducted in 36 healthy subjects. S-warfarin pharmacokinetics were \nevaluated following a single dose of warfarin 25 mg given alone, or administered at the start, 24, or 72 \nhours after a single 1,200mg dose of oritavancin. The results showed no effect of oritavancin on S-\nwarfarin AUC and Cmax. \n \nDrug-laboratory test interactions (see sections 4.3 and 4.4) \n \nOritavancin binds to and prevents the action of the phospholipid reagents which activate coagulation in \ncommonly used laboratory coagulation tests. Oritavancin concentrations achieved in the blood after \n1,200 mg doses may produce falsely elevated results from certain laboratory tests (see Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Coagulation tests affected by oritavancin \n\nAssay Duration of interference \n\nProthrombin time (PT) Up to 12 hours \nInternational normalized ratio (INR) Up to 12 hours \n\nActivated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) Up to 120 hours \n\nActivated clotting time (ACT) Up to 24 hours \n\nSilica clot time (SCT)   Up to 18 hours \n\nDilute Russell\u2019s viper venom time (DRVVT) Up to 72 hours \n \n \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of oritavancin in pregnant women. Animal studies \ndo not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of oritavancin during pregnancy unless the \npotential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of oritavancin in milk \n(see section 5.3). It is unknown whether oritavancin/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to \nthe newborns/infants cannot be excluded. \n \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \noritavancin therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility due to oritavancin at the highest \nconcentrations administered, however, there is no data on the effects of oritavancin on human fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nOritavancin has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness may occur and \nthis may have an effect on driving and use of machines (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u22655%) were: nausea, hypersensitivity reactions, \ninfusion site reactions, and headache. The most commonly reported serious adverse reaction was \ncellulitis (1.1%).  The most common reported reasons for discontinuation were cellulitis (0.4%) and \nosteomyelitis (0.3%). Female patients had a higher reporting rate for adverse reactions than male \npatients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions for oritavancin from the pooled Phase 3 ABSSSI clinical trials with single dose \noritavancin are listed by system organ class in the following table.   \n \nFrequencies are defined as: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 \nto <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from \nthe available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 2: Frequency of adverse reactions by system organ class \nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse Reactions \nInfections and infestations \n Common Cellulitis, abscess (limb and subcutaneous) \n Uncommon Osteomyelitis \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n Common Anaemia  \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\n Uncommon Eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia \nImmune system disorders \n Uncommon Hypersensitivity (see sections 4.3 and 4.4) , \n\nanaphylactic reaction \n Unknown Anaphylactic shock \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n Uncommon Hypoglycaemia, hyperuricaemia \nNervous system disorders \n Common Headache, dizziness \n Rare Tremor* \nCardiac disorders \n Common Tachycardia \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n Uncommon Bronchospasm, wheezing, dyspnoea* \n Rare Hypoxia* \nGastrointestinal disorders \n Common Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation \n Uncommon Abdominal pain* \nHepatobiliary disorders \n Common Liver function test abnormal (Alanine \n\naminotransferase increased, Aspartate \naminotransferase increased) \n\n Uncommon Blood bilirubin increased \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n Common Urticaria, rash, pruritis \n Uncommon Leucocytoclastic vasculitis, angioedema, \n\nerythema multiforme, flushing \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n Common Myalgia \n Uncommon Tenosynovitis \n Rare Back pain*, neck pain* \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n Common Infusion site reactions, including the following \n\nsymptoms infusion site phlebitis, infusion site \nerythema, extravasation, induration, pruritis, \nrash, oedema peripheral \n\n Uncommon Chest pain*, pyrexia* \n Rare Red man syndrome, chest discomfort*, chills* \n\n*These reactions may be infusion-related (see section 4.4) \n \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn the clinical programme of 3,017 oritavancin-treated subjects; there was no incidence of accidental \noverdose of oritavancin.  \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n \n\nOritavancin is not removed from blood by haemodialysis procedures. In the event of overdose, \nsupportive measures should be taken. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, glycopeptide antibacterials, \nATC code: J01XA05 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nOritavancin has three mechanisms of action: (i) inhibition of the transglycosylation (polymerization) \nstep of cell wall biosynthesis by binding to the stem peptide of peptidoglycan precursors; (ii) inhibition \nof the transpeptidation (crosslinking) step of cell wall biosynthesis by binding to the peptide bridging \nsegments of the cell wall; and (iii) disruption of bacterial membrane integrity, leading to \ndepolarization, permeabilization, and rapid cell death.   \n \nResistance \n \nGram-negative organisms are intrinsically resistant to all glycopeptides, including oritavancin. \n \nResistance to oritavancin was observed in vitro in vancomycin-resistant isolates of Staphylococcus \naureus. There is no known cross-resistance between oritavancin and non-glycopeptide classes of \nantibiotics. \n \nOritavancin exhibits reduced in vitro activity against certain Gram-positive organisms of the genera \nLactobacillus, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus that are intrinsically resistant to glycopeptides.  \n \nSusceptibility testing break points \n \nMinimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints established by the European Committee on \nAntimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) are as follows:  \n \nTable 3:  Susceptibility Interpretive Criteria for Oritavancin \n\nOrganism group \nMIC breakpoints \n\n(mg/L) \nS \u2264 R > \n\nStaphylococcus aureus  0.125 0.125 \nBeta-haemolytic streptococci Groups A, B, C, G 0.25 0.25 \nViridans group streptococci (S. anginosus group \nonly) 0.25 0.25 \n\nS=Susceptible, R=Resistant \n \nPharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship \n \nThe area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio \nof oritavancin for the infecting organism has been shown to be the parameter that best correlates with \nefficacy. \n \nClinical efficacy against specific pathogens \n \nEfficacy has been demonstrated in clinical studies against the following pathogens that were \nsusceptible to oritavancin in vitro. \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n \nGram-positive microorganisms: \n\u2022 Staphylococcus aureus  \n\u2022 Streptococcus pyogenes \n\u2022 Streptococcus agalactiae \n\u2022 Streptococcus dysgalactiae \n\u2022 Streptococcus anginosus group (includes S. anginosus, S. intermedius, and S. constellatus) \n \n \nAntibacterial activity against other relevant pathogens \n \nClinical efficacy has not been established against the following pathogens although in vitro studies \nsuggest that they would be susceptible to oritavancin in the absence of acquired mechanisms of \nresistance: \n\u2022  Beta-haemolytic streptococci of Group G \n\u2022  Clostridium perfringens \n\u2022  Peptostreptococcus spp. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \noritavancin in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of acute bacterial skin \nand skin structure infections (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nOritavancin exhibits linear pharmacokinetics at a dose up to 1,200 mg. The mean (CV%) maximum \noritavancin concentration (Cmax) and AUC0-\u221e in patients receiving a single 1,200 mg dose in ABSSSI \npatients is 138 (23) \u03bcg/ml and 2,800 (28.6) \u03bcg\u2022h/mL respectively.   \n \nDistribution \n \nOritavancin is approximately 85% bound to human plasma proteins. Based on population PK analysis, \nthe population mean total volume of distribution is estimated to be approximately 87.6 L, indicating \noritavancin is extensively distributed into the tissues.   \n \nExposures (AUC0-24) of oritavancin in skin blister fluid were 20% of those in plasma after a single \n800 mg dose in healthy subjects. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nNo metabolites were observed in plasma or bile from oritavancin treated dogs and rats, respectively. \nAdditionally, in vitro human liver microsome studies indicated that oritavancin is not metabolized.  \n \nElimination \n \nNo mass balance study has been conducted in humans. In humans, less than 1% to 5% of the dose was \nrecovered as parent drug in faeces and urine respectively after 2 weeks of collection indicating that \noritavancin is slowly excreted unchanged.  \n \nThe mean terminal elimination plasma half-life of oritavancin is 245 hours (14.9% CV) based on \npopulation PK analysis of ABSSSI patients receiving a single 1,200 mg dose. The population mean \ntotal clearance is estimated at 0.445 L/h (27.2 % CV). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nIn a population PK analysis, a relationship between height and clearance was identified, where \nclearance increased with increasing height. Dose modification based on height is not necessary. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of oritavancin was examined in the single dose Phase 3 ABSSSI studies in \npatients with normal renal function, CrCL \u226590 mL/min (n=213), mild renal impairment, \nCrCL 60-89 mL/min (n=59), moderate renal impairment, CrCL 30-59 mL/min (n=22), and severe \nrenal impairment CrCL <30 mL/min (n=3). Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that renal \nimpairment had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of oritavancin. No dedicated studies in \ndialysis patients have been conducted. \nDosage adjustment of oritavancin is not needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. \nThe pharmacokinetics of oritavancin in patients with severe renal impairment has not been evaluated.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of oritavancin were evaluated in a study of subjects with moderate hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh Class B, n=20) and compared with healthy subjects (n=20) matched for \ngender, age and weight. There were no relevant changes in pharmacokinetics of oritavancin in subjects \nwith moderate hepatic impairment. \n \nDosage adjustment of oritavancin is not needed in patients with mild and moderate hepatic \nimpairment. The pharmacokinetics of oritavancin in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not \nbeen studied. \n \nEffects of age, weight, gender and race   \nPopulation PK analysis from the single dose Phase 3 ABSSSI studies in patients indicated that gender, \nage, weight, or race had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of oritavancin. No dosage \nadjustment is warranted in these subpopulations. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe primary adverse effect of oritavancin administration to rats and dogs was a dose related \naccumulation of eosinophilic granules in tissue macrophages including hepatocytes, renal cortical \nepithelial cells, adrenal cells and macrophages of the reticulo endothelial system. The appearance of \nthe eosinophilic granules did not occur following single dose administration and did not significantly \naffect innate macrophage function in vitro at intracellular levels anticipated from a single 1,200 mg \ndose. \n \nModerate, dose-related increases in liver enzymes (alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase) \nwere observed in rats and dogs and were shown to be reversible upon cessation of treatment. \nBiochemistry changes associated with kidney function including decreases in urine-specific gravity \nand pH and slight increases in blood urea nitrogen and sporadic increases in creatinine were present in \nboth rat and dog after treatment of two weeks. Extramedullary haematopoiesis in the spleen was \nobserved in rats. This histopathological finding correlated with an enlargement and an increase in the \nweight of the spleen. The exposure in rats at the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was less to \nonly slightly higher than the human exposure based on the AUC. \n \nHistamine-like infusion reactions following immediately or shortly after dosing with oritavancin \noccurred in both rats and dogs. These reactions were associated with mortality at lower dosages in \nmale than in female rats in single dose studies; however, the same gender-related differences were not \nobserved in other species. Studies in neonatal rats and dogs for 30 days showed the same tissue effects \nas those seen in adult animals including sensitivity to the oritavancin-mediated histamine-like infusion \nreactions. Mortality was observed in neonatal rats at slightly lower dosage levels than in adults. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nA standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests on the genotoxic potential did not reveal any clinically \nrelevant findings. Lifetime studies in animals have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic \npotential of oritavancin.  \n \nWhen administered intravenously at doses up to 30 mg/kg, oritavancin did not affect the fertility or \nreproductive performance of male and female rats. Studies in pregnant rats and rabbits do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition \nor postnatal development. There was no evidence of transplacental transfer of oritavancin in pregnant \nrats. The exposure in rats at the NOAEL was less to only slightly higher than the human exposure \nbased on the AUC. \n \nFollowing a single intravenous infusion in lactating rats, radio-labelled [14C]oritavancin was excreted in \nmilk and absorbed by nursing pups. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nMannitol \nPhosphoric acid (for pH-adjustment) \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nSodium chloride solution should not be used for dilution as it is incompatible with oritavancin and \nmay cause precipitation of the medicinal product. Therefore, other substances, additives or other \nmedicinal products mixed in sodium chloride solution for intravenous use should not be added to \noritavancin single-use vials or infused simultaneously through the same intravenous line or through a \ncommon intravenous port. In addition, medicinal products formulated at a basic or neutral pH may be \nincompatible with oritavancin (see section 6.6). \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \n4 years \n \nAfter reconstitution \n \nThe reconstituted solution should be further diluted in glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) intravenous infusion \nbag immediately. \n \nAfter dilution \n \nThe diluted solution should be used immediately.  \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would \nnormally not be longer than 12 hours at 25\u00b0C and 24 hours at 2-8\u00b0C following dilution in a glucose 5% \nintravenous infusion bag, unless reconstitution and dilution has taken place in controlled and validated \naseptic conditions. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nDo not store above 25\u00b0C.  \n \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container  \n \nSingle-use 50 ml Type 1 glass vials with rubber stoppers and aluminium flip off cap. \n \n3 individual vials are packaged in a carton. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling  \n \nFor single use only. Orbactiv should be prepared under aseptic techniques in a pharmacy. \n \nThe powder must be reconstituted with water for injections and the resulting concentrate must be \ndiluted in a glucose 5% intravenous infusion bag prior to use. Both the reconstituted solution and the \ndiluted solution for infusion should be clear, colourless to pale yellow solution. Parenteral medicinal \nproducts should be inspected visually for particulate matter after reconstitution.  \nReconstitution:.   \n\u2022 40 mL of water for injections (WFI) should be added using a sterile syringe to reconstitute each \n\nvial to provide a 10 mg/mL solution per vial.  \n\u2022 To avoid excessive foaming, it is recommended that WFI should be added carefully, along the \n\nwalls of the vials. \n\u2022 Each vial should be swirled gently to avoid foaming and ensure that all of the powder is \n\ncompletely reconstituted in solution.  \n \n\nDilution: Three reconstituted vials are needed for dilution for administration of a single 1,200 mg \nintravenous infusion. Only glucose 5% intravenous bag (D5W) should be used for dilution. Sodium \nchloride solution should not be used for dilution (see section 6.2). \n \nDilution: \n\u2022 Withdraw and discard 120 mL from a 1,000 mL D5W intravenous bag. \n\u2022 Withdraw 40 mL from each of the three reconstituted vials and add to D5W intravenous bag to \n\nbring the bag volume to 1,000 mL. This yields a concentration of 1.2 mg/mL of oritavancin. PP \n(Polypropylene) or PVC (Polyvinyl chloride) bags should be used for administration \npreparation.  \n\n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nOrbactiv 400 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion  \noritavancin \n\n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Orbactiv is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you are given Orbactiv \n3. How you will be given Orbactiv  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Orbactiv  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Orbactiv is and what it is used for \n \nOrbactiv is an antibiotic that contains the active substance oritavancin. Oritavancin is a type of \nantibiotic (a lipoglycopeptide antibiotic) that can kill or stop the growth of certain bacteria. \nOrbactiv is used to treat infections of the skin and underlying tissues.  \nIt is for use in adults only. \n \nOrbactiv can only be used to treat infections caused by bacteria known as Gram positive bacteria. In \nmixed infections where other types of bacteria are suspected, your doctor will give you other \nappropriate antibiotics together with Orbactiv.    \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Orbactiv  \n \nYou must not be given Orbactiv  \n- if you are allergic to oritavancin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if it is expected that you may need to be given a blood thinning medicine (unfractionated \n\nheparin sodium)  within 5 days (120 hours) of the dose of Orbactiv. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before receiving Orbactiv if you: \n\u2022 have ever had an allergic reaction to another glycopeptide antibiotic (such as vancomycin and \n\ntelavancin)  \n\u2022 have developed severe diarrhoea during or following antibiotic treatment in the past.  \n\u2022 have or are suspected to have a bone infection caused by bacteria (osteomyelitis). Your doctor \n\nwill treat you as necessary \n\u2022 have or are suspected to have a painful collection of pus on your skin (abscess). Your doctor \n\nwill treat you as necessary. \n \nIntravenous infusions of Orbactiv can cause flushing of the upper body, hives, itching and/or rashes. \nInfusion-associated reactions characterized by chest pain, chest discomfort, chills, tremor, back pain, \nneck pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, fever and headache, fatigue, somnolence that might be \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\nsymptoms of hypoxia, have also been observed. If you experience these types of reactions, your doctor \nmay decide to stop or slow the infusion. \n \nOrbactiv may interfere with laboratory tests that measure how well your blood is clotting and may \ncause a false reading.  \n \nWhile antibiotics, including Orbactiv, fight certain bacteria, they may not be active against other \nbacteria or fungi, which may, therefore, continue to grow. This is called overgrowth. Your doctor will \nmonitor you in case this happens and treat you if necessary. \n \nAfter being given Orbactiv, you may get a new infection at another site on your skin. Your doctor \nshould monitor you in case this happens and treat you as necessary. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nOrbactiv should not to be used in children or adolescents below the age of 18. \n \nOther medicines and Orbactiv \nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.  \n \nIf you are going to be given a blood thinner called unfractionated heparin, then tell your doctor if you \nhave received Orbactiv within the last 5 days (120 hours).  \n \nIt is particularly important to tell your doctor if you are using medicines that prevent blood from \nclotting (oral anticoagulants, e.g.coumarin anticoagulants ). Orbactiv may interfere with laboratory \ntests or self-test that measure how well your blood is clotting (INR) and may cause a false reading up \nto 12 hours after the infusion. \n \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. \n \nYou should not be given this medicine during pregancy unless the benefit is considered to be greater \nthan the risk to the baby. \n \nDriving and using machines \nOrbactiv may cause dizziness, which can influence your ability to drive or operate machines. \n \n \n3. How you will be given Orbactiv \n \nOrbactiv will be given to you by your doctor or nurse, by infusion (drip) into a vein. \n \nThe recommended dose for Orbactiv is one single infusion of 1,200 mg administered into a vein over \n3 hours. \n \nIf you are given more Orbactiv than you should \nYour doctor will decide how to treat you, including stopping the treatment and monitoring for signs of \nill effects.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\nTell your doctor or nurse immediately if you experience a reaction to the infusion including any \nof the following symptoms: \n\u2022 Flushing of the face and upper body, hives, itching and/or rashes (red man syndrome)   \n\u2022 Wheezing;  \n\u2022 Shortness of breath;  \n\u2022 Swelling around throat or under the skin that develops over a short period of time;  \n\u2022 Shivering or trembling;  \n\u2022 Rapid or weak pulse;  \n\u2022 Chest pain or tightness;  \n\u2022 Decrease in blood pressure (which could make you feel faint or dizzy).  \n \nSuch reactions may be life-threatening.  \n \nOther side effects occur with the following frequencies: \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 patients): \n\u2022 Fewer red blood cells or less haemoglobin than normal; \n\u2022 Feeling dizzy; \n\u2022 Headache; \n\u2022 Feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting); \n\u2022 Diarrhoea; \n\u2022 Constipation; \n\u2022 Pain or irritation where the injection was given;  \n\u2022 Itching, skin rash; \n\u2022 Muscle pain; \n\u2022 More enzymes produced by your liver (as shown in blood tests); \n\u2022 Heart racing or beating fast; \n\u2022 Infection getting worse or new infection at another site on your skin; \n\u2022 Swollen, red area of skin or underneath skin that feels hot and tender;  \n\u2022 Accumulation of pus underneath the skin. \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 patients): \n\u2022 Higher than normal levels of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell (eosinophilia); \n\u2022 Low blood sugar; \n\u2022 High uric acid levels in the blood; \n\u2022 Increased blood bilirubin levels ; \n\u2022 Severe rash; \n\u2022 Flushing; \n\u2022 Inflammation surrounding a tendon (known as tenosynovitis); \n\u2022 Bone infection caused by bacteria (known as osteomyelitis); \n\u2022 Reduced blood platelet count below the normal lower limit (known as thrombocytopenia); \n\u2022 Abdominal pain \n\u2022 Chest pain \n\u2022 Fever \n\u2022 Shortness of breath \n \nRare side effects(may affect up to 1 in 1000 patients): \n\u2022 Headache, fatigue, somnolence that might be symptoms of hypoxia; \n\u2022 Back pain \n\u2022 Neck pain \n\u2022 Chills \n\u2022 Tremor. \n \n \nReporting of side effects \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse.

Both the reconstituted solution and the \ndiluted solution for infusion should be clear, colourless to pale yellow solution. Parenteral medicinal \nproducts should be inspected visually for particulate matter after reconstitution. Aseptic procedures \nshould be used for the preparation of Orbactiv.  \n \nReconstitution: Aseptic technique should be used to reconstitute three Orbactiv 400 mg vials. \n\u2022 40 mL of water for injections (WFI) should be added using a sterile syringe to reconstitute each \n\nvial to provide a 10 mg/mL solution per vial.  \n\u2022 To avoid excessive foaming, it is recommended that WFI should be added carefully, along the \n\nwalls of the vials. \n\u2022 Each vial should be swirled gently to avoid foaming and ensure that all Orbactiv powder is \n\ncompletely reconstituted in solution.  \n \n\nThe reconstituted solution should be further diluted in glucose 5% intravenous infusion bag \nimmediately. \n \nDilution: Three reconstituted vials are needed for dilution for administration of a single 1,200 mg IV \ninfusion. Only glucose 5% intravenous bag (D5W) should be used for dilution.  \n  \nTo dilute: \n\u2022 Withdraw and discard 120 mL from a 1,000 mL D5W intravenous bag.   \n\u2022 Withdraw 40 mL from each of the three reconstituted vials and add to D5W intravenous bag to \n\nbring the bag volume to 1,000 mL. This yields a concentration of 1.2 mg/mL of oritavancin. PP \n(Polypropylene) or PVC (Polyvinyl chloride) bags should be used for administration \npreparation. \n \n\nThe diluted solution should be used immediately.  \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would \nnormally not be longer than 12 hours at 25\u00b0C and 24 hours at 2-8\u00b0C for Orbactiv diluted in glucose 5% \nintravenous infusion bag, unless reconstitution and dilution has taken place in controlled and validated \naseptic conditions.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAnnex IV \n\nScientific conclusions and grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing \nauthorisation(s) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\nScientific conclusions \n\nTaking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for oritavancin, the scientific \nconclusions of CHMP are as follows:  \n\nIn view of available data on infusion related reactions from clinical trial(s), and spontaneous reports \nand considering that reported cases have a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and in \nsome cases positive re-challenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC \nconsiders a causal relationship between oritavancin and chest pain/discomfort, chills, back pain, \ndyspnoea, fever, tremor, hypoxia, neck pain and abdominal pain are at least a reasonable possibility. \nThe PRAC concluded that the product information of product containing oritavancin should be \namended accordingly. \n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\n \n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for oritavancin the CHMP is of the opinion that the \nbenefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing oritavancin is unchanged subject to the \nproposed changes to the product information \n\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
