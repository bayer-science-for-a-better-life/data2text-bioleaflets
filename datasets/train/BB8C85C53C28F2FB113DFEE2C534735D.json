PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \n \nClear, colourless, aqueous solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTRISENOX is indicated for induction of remission, and consolidation in adult patients with: \n\uf0b7 Newly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (white blood \n\ncell count, \u2264 10 x 103/\u00b5l) in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) \n\uf0b7 Relapsed/refractory acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (previous treatment should have \n\nincluded a retinoid and chemotherapy) \ncharacterised by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation and/or the presence of the promyelocytic \nleukaemia/retinoic-acid-receptor-alpha (PML/RAR-alpha) gene. \n \nThe response rate of other acute myelogenous leukaemia subtypes to arsenic trioxide has not been \nexamined. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTRISENOX must be administered under the supervision of a physician who is experienced in the \nmanagement of acute leukaemias, and the special monitoring procedures described in section 4.4 must \nbe followed. \n \nPosology \n \nThe same dose is recommended for adults and elderly. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nNewly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) \n \nInduction treatment schedule \nTRISENOX must be administered intravenously at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day, given daily until \ncomplete remission is achieved. If complete remission has not occurred by day 60, dosing must be \ndiscontinued. \n \nConsolidation schedule \nTRISENOX must be administered intravenously at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day, 5 days per week. \nTreatment should be continued for 4 weeks on and 4 weeks off, for a total of 4 cycles. \n \nRelapsed/refractory acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) \n \nInduction treatment schedule \nTRISENOX must be administered intravenously at a fixed dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day given daily until \ncomplete remission is achieved (less than 5 % blasts present in cellular bone marrow with no evidence \nof leukaemic cells). If complete remission has not occurred by day 50, dosing must be discontinued. \n \nConsolidation schedule \nConsolidation treatment must begin 3 to 4 weeks after completion of induction therapy. TRISENOX is \nto be administered intravenously at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day for 25 doses given 5 days per week, \nfollowed by 2 days interruption, repeated for 5 weeks. \n \nDose delay, modification and reinitiation \n \nTreatment with TRISENOX must be temporarily interrupted before the scheduled end of therapy at \nany time that a toxicity grade 3 or greater on the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria \nis observed and judged to be possibly related to TRISENOX treatment. Patients who experience such \nreactions that are considered TRISENOX related must resume treatment only after resolution of the \ntoxic event or after recovery to baseline status of the abnormality that prompted the interruption. In \nsuch cases, treatment must resume at 50 % of the preceding daily dose. If the toxic event does not \nrecur within 7 days of restarting treatment at the reduced dose, the daily dose can be escalated back to \n100 % of the original dose. Patients who experience a recurrence of toxicity must be removed from \ntreatment. \nFor ECG, electrolytes abnormalities and hepatotoxicity see section 4.4. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nSince no data are available across all hepatic impairment groups and hepatotoxic effects may occur \nduring the treatment with TRISENOX, caution is advised in the use of TRISENOX in patients with \nhepatic impairment (see section 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nRenal impairment \nSince no data are available across all renal impairment groups, caution is advised in the use of \nTRISENOX in patients with renal impairment. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of TRISENOX in children aged up to 17 years has not been established. \nCurrently available data for children aged 5 to 16 years are described in section 5.1 but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made. No data are available for children under 5 years.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTRISENOX must be administered intravenously over 1-2 hours. The infusion duration may be \nextended up to 4 hours if vasomotor reactions are observed. A central venous catheter is not required. \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPatients must be hospitalised at the beginning of treatment due to symptoms of disease and to ensure \nadequate monitoring. \n \nFor instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nClinically unstable APL patients are especially at risk and will require more frequent monitoring of \nelectrolyte and glycaemia levels as well as more frequent haematologic, hepatic, renal and coagulation \nparameter tests. \n \nLeukocyte activation syndrome (APL differentiation syndrome) \n27 % of patients with APL, in the relapsed/refractory setting, treated with arsenic trioxide have \nexperienced symptoms similar to a syndrome called the retinoic-acid-acute promyelocytic leukaemia \n(RA-APL) or APL differentiation syndrome, characterised by fever, dyspnoea, weight gain, \npulmonary infiltrates and pleural or pericardial effusions, with or without leucocytosis. This syndrome \ncan be fatal. In newly diagnosed APL patients treated with arsenic trioxide and all-trans-retinoic acid \n(ATRA), APL differentiation syndrome was observed in 19 % including 5 severe cases. At the first \nsigns that could suggest the syndrome (unexplained fever, dyspnoea and/or weight gain, abnormal \nchest auscultatory findings or radiographic abnormalities), treatment with TRISENOX must be \ntemporarily discontinued and high-dose steroids (dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously twice a day) \nmust be immediately initiated, irrespective of the leukocyte count and continued for at least 3 days or \nlonger until signs and symptoms have abated. If clinically justified/required, concomitant diuretic \ntherapy is also recommended. The majority of patients do not require permanent termination of \nTRISENOX therapy during treatment of the APL differentiation syndrome. As soon as signs and \nsymptoms have subsided, treatment with TRISENOX can be resumed at 50 % of the previous dose \nduring the first 7 days. Thereafter, in the absence of worsening of the previous toxicity, TRISENOX \nmight be resumed at full dosage. In the case of the reappearance of symptoms TRISENOX should be \nreduced to the previous dosage. In order to prevent the development of the APL differentiation \nsyndrome during induction treatment, prednisone (0.5 mg/kg body weight per day throughout \ninduction treatment) may be administered from day 1 of TRISENOX application to the end of \ninduction therapy in APL patients. It is recommended that chemotherapy not be added to treatment \nwith steroids since there is no experience with administration of both steroids and chemotherapy \nduring treatment of the leukocyte activation syndrome due to TRISENOX. Post-marketing experience \nsuggests that a similar syndrome may occur in patients with other types of malignancy. Monitoring \nand management for these patients should be as described above. \n \nElectrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities \nArsenic trioxide can cause QT interval prolongation and complete atrioventricular block. QT \nprolongation can lead to a torsade de pointes-type ventricular arrhythmia, which can be fatal. Previous \ntreatment with anthracyclines may increase the risk of QT prolongation. The risk of torsade de pointes \nis related to the extent of QT prolongation, concomitant administration of QT prolonging medicinal \nproducts (such as class Ia and III antiarrythmics (e.g. quinidine, amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide), \nantipsychotics (e.g. thioridazine), antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline), some macrolides (e.g. \nerythromycin), some antihistamines (e.g. terfenadine and astemizole), some quinolone antibiotics (e.g. \nsparfloxacin), and other individual medicinal products known to increase QT interval (e.g. cisapride)), \na history of torsade de pointes, pre-existing QT interval prolongation, congestive heart failure, \nadministration of potassium-wasting diuretics, amphotericin B or other conditions that result in \nhypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia. In clinical trials, in the relapsed/refractory setting, 40 % of \npatients treated with TRISENOX experienced at least one QT corrected (QTc) interval prolongation \ngreater than 500 msec. Prolongation of the QTc was observed between 1 and 5 weeks after \nTRISENOX infusion, and then returned to baseline by the end of 8 weeks after TRISENOX infusion. \nOne patient (receiving multiple, concomitant medicinal products, including amphotericin B) had \n\n\n\n5 \n\nasymptomatic torsade de pointes during induction therapy for relapsed APL with arsenic trioxide. In \nnewly diagnosed APL patients 15.6 % showed QTc prolongation with arsenic trioxide in combination \nwith ATRA (see section 4.8). In one newly diagnosed patient induction treatment was terminated \nbecause of severe prolongation of the QTc interval and electrolyte abnormalities on day 3 of induction \ntreatment. \n \nECG and electrolyte monitoring recommendations \nPrior to initiating therapy with TRISENOX, a 12-lead ECG must be performed and serum electrolytes \n(potassium, calcium, and magnesium) and creatinine must be assessed; pre-existing electrolyte \nabnormalities must be corrected and, if possible, medicinal products that are known to prolong the QT \ninterval must be discontinued. Patients with risk factors of QTc prolongation or risk factors of torsade \nde pointes should be monitored with continuous cardiac monitoring (ECG). For QTc greater than \n500 msec, corrective measures must be completed and the QTc reassessed with serial ECGs and, if \navailable, a specialist advice could be sought prior to considering using TRISENOX. During therapy \nwith TRISENOX, potassium concentrations must be kept above 4 mEq/l and magnesium \nconcentrations must be kept above 1.8 mg/dl. Patients who reach an absolute QT interval value \n> 500 msec must be reassessed and immediate action must be taken to correct concomitant risk \nfactors, if any, while the risk/benefit of continuing versus suspending TRISENOX therapy must be \nconsidered. If syncope, rapid or irregular heartbeat develops, the patient must be hospitalised and \nmonitored continuously, serum electrolytes must be assessed, TRISENOX therapy must be \ntemporarily discontinued until the QTc interval regresses to below 460 msec, electrolyte abnormalities \nare corrected, and the syncope and irregular heartbeat cease. After recovery, treatment should be \nresumed at 50 % of the preceding daily dose. If QTc prolongation does not recur within 7 days of \nrestarting treatment at the reduced dose, treatment with TRISENOX can be resumed at 0.11 mg/kg \nbody weight per day for a second week. The daily dose can be escalated back to 100 % of the original \ndose if no prolongation occurs. There are no data on the effect of arsenic trioxide on the QTc interval \nduring the infusion. Electrocardiograms must be obtained twice weekly, and more frequently for \nclinically unstable patients, during induction and consolidation. \n \nHepatotoxicity (grade 3 or greater) \nIn newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate risk APL 63.2 % developed grade 3 or 4 hepatic \ntoxic effects during induction or consolidation treatment with arsenic trioxide in combination with \nATRA (see section 4.8). However, toxic effects resolved with temporary discontinuation of either \narsenic trioxide, ATRA or both. Treatment with TRISENOX must be discontinued before the \nscheduled end of therapy at any time that a hepatotoxicity grade 3 or greater on the National Cancer \nInstitute Common Toxicity Criteria is observed. As soon as bilirubin and/or SGOT and/or alkaline \nphosphatase are decreased to below 4 times the normal upper level, treatment with TRISENOX should \nbe resumed at 50 % of the previous dose during the first 7 days. Thereafter, in absence of worsening of \nthe previous toxicity, TRISENOX should be resumed at full dosage. In case of reappearance of \nhepatotoxicity, TRISENOX must be permanently discontinued. \n \nDose delay and modification \nTreatment with TRISENOX must be temporarily interrupted before the scheduled end of therapy at \nany time that a toxicity grade 3 or greater on the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria \nis observed and judged to be possibly related to TRISENOX treatment. (see section 4.2) \n \nLaboratory tests \nThe patient\u2019s electrolyte and glycaemia levels, as well as haematologic, hepatic, renal and coagulation \nparameter tests must be monitored at least twice weekly, and more frequently for clinically unstable \npatients during the induction phase and at least weekly during the consolidation phase.  \n \nRenal impairment \nSince no data are available across all renal impairment groups, caution is advised in the use of \nTRISENOX in patients with renal impairment. The experience in patients with severe renal \nimpairment is insufficient to determine if dose adjustment is required. \nThe use of TRISENOX in patients on dialysis has not been studied.  \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nHepatic impairment \nSince no data are available across all hepatic impairment groups and hepatotoxic effects may occur \nduring the treatment with arsenic trioxide caution is advised in the use of TRISENOX in patients with \nhepatic impairment (see section 4.4 on hepatotoxicity and section 4.8). The experience in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment is insufficient to determine if dose adjustment is required. \n \nElderly \nThere is limited clinical data on the use of TRISENOX in the elderly population. Caution is needed in \nthese patients. \n \nHyperleucocytosis \nTreatment with arsenic trioxide has been associated with the development of hyperleucocytosis \n(\u2265 10 x 103/\u03bcl) in some relapsed/refractory APL patients. There did not appear to be a relationship \nbetween baseline white blood cell (WBC) counts and development of hyperleucocytosis nor did there \nappear to be a correlation between baseline WBC count and peak WBC counts. Hyperleucocytosis \nwas never treated with additional chemotherapy and resolved on continuation of TRISENOX. WBC \ncounts during consolidation were not as high as during induction treatment and were < 10 x 103/\u03bcl, \nexcept in one patient who had a WBC count of 22 x 103/\u03bcl during consolidation. Twenty \nrelapsed/refractory APL patients (50 %) experienced leucocytosis; however, in all these patients, the \nWBC count was declining or had normalized by the time of bone marrow remission and cytotoxic \nchemotherapy or leucopheresis was not required. In newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate \nrisk APL leucocytosis developed during induction therapy in 35 of 74 (47 %) patients (see \nsection 4.8). However all cases were successfully managed with hydroxyurea therapy.  \n \nIn newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory APL patients who develop sustained leucocytosis after \ninitiation of therapy, hydroxyurea should be administered. Hydroxyurea should be continued at a \ngiven dose to keep the white blood cell count \u2264 10 x 103/\u03bcl and subsequently tapered. \n \nTable 1 Recommendation for initiation of hydroxyurea \nWBC Hydroxyurea \n10\u201350 x 103/\u00b5l 500 mg four times a day \n> 50 x 103/\u00b5l 1000 mg four times a day \n\n \nDevelopment of second primary malignancies  \nThe active ingredient of TRISENOX, arsenic trioxide, is a human carcinogen. Monitor patients for the \ndevelopment of second primary malignancies. \n \nEncephalopathy \nCases of encephalopathy were reported with treatment with arsenic trioxide. Wernicke encephalopathy \nafter arsenic trioxide treatment was reported in patients with vitamin B1 deficiency. Patients at risk of \nB1 deficiency should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of encephalopathy after arsenic \ntrioxide initiation. Some cases recovered with vitamin B1 supplementation. \n \nExcipient with known effect \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal assessments of pharmacokinetic interactions between TRISENOX and other therapeutic \nmedicinal products have been conducted.  \n \nMedicinal products known to cause QT/QTc interval prolongation, hypokalaemia or \nhypomagnesaemia \nQT/QTc prolongation is expected during treatment with arsenic trioxide, and torsade de pointes and \ncomplete heart block have been reported. Patients who are receiving, or who have received, medicinal \nproducts known to cause hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia, such as diuretics or amphotericin B, \n\n\n\n7 \n\nmay be at higher risk for torsade de pointes. Caution is advised when TRISENOX is co-administered \nwith other medicinal products known to cause QT/QTc interval prolongation such as macrolide \nantibiotics, the antipsychotic thioridazine, or medicinal products known to cause hypokalaemia or \nhypomagnesaemia. Additional information about QT prolonging medicinal agents, is provided in \nsection 4.4. \n \nMedicinal products known to cause hepatotoxic effects \nHepatotoxic effects may occur during the treatment with arsenic trioxide, caution is advised when \nTRISENOX is co-administered with other medicinal products known to cause hepatotoxic effects (see \nsection 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nOther antileukaemic medicinal products \nThe influence of TRISENOX on the efficacy of other antileukaemic medicinal products is unknown. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nContraception in males and females \nWomen of childbearing potential and men must use effective contraception during treatment with \nTRISENOX. \n \nPregnancy \nArsenic trioxide has been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic in animal studies (see section 5.3). \nThere are no studies in pregnant women using TRISENOX. If this medicinal product is used during \npregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this product, the patient must be informed \nof the potential harm to the foetus.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nArsenic is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in \nbreast-feeding infants and children from TRISENOX, breast-feeding must be discontinued prior to and \nthroughout administration.  \n \nFertility \nNo clinical or non-clinical fertility studies have been conducted with TRISENOX. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTRISENOX has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nRelated adverse reactions of CTC grade 3 and 4 occurred in 37 % of relapsed/refractory APL patients \nin clinical trials. The most commonly reported reactions were hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia, \nneutropenia, and increased alanine amino transferase (ALT). Leucocytosis occurred in 50 % of \npatients with relapsed/refractory APL, as determined by haematology assessments. \n \nSerious adverse reactions were common (1-10 %) and not unexpected in the relapsed/refractory \npopulation. Those serious adverse reactions attributed to arsenic trioxide included APL differentiation \nsyndrome (3), leucocytosis (3), prolonged QT interval (4, 1 with torsade de pointes), atrial \nfibrillation/atrial flutter (1), hyperglycaemia (2) and a variety of serious adverse reactions related to \nhaemorrhage, infections, pain, diarrhoea, nausea.  \n \nIn general, treatment-emergent adverse events tended to decrease over time, in relapsed/refractory \nAPL patients perhaps accounted for by amelioration of the underlying disease process. Patients tended \nto tolerate consolidation and maintenance treatment with less toxicity than in induction. This is \nprobably due to the confounding of adverse events by the uncontrolled disease process early on in the \n\n\n\n8 \n\ntreatment course and the myriad concomitant medicinal products required to control symptoms and \nmorbidity.  \n \nIn a phase 3, multicentre, non-inferiority trial comparing all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) plus \nchemotherapy with ATRA plus arsenic trioxide in newly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk APL \npatients (Study APL0406; see also section 5.1), serious adverse reactions including hepatic toxicity, \nthrombocytopenia, neutropenia and QTc prolongation were observed in patients treated with arsenic \ntrioxide. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following undesirable effects have been reported in the APL0406 study in newly diagnosed \npatients and in clinical trials and/or post-marketing experience in relapsed/refractory APL patients. \nUndesirable effects are listed in table 2 below as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and \nfrequencies observed during TRISENOX clinical trials in 52 patients with refractory/relapsed APL. \nFrequencies are defined as: (very common \u2265 1/10), (common \u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), \n(uncommon \u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), not known (cannot be estimated from available data).   \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n \nTable 2 \n\n All grades Grades \u2265 3 \nInfections and infestations \nHerpes zoster Common Not known \nSepsis Not known Not known \nPneumonia Not known Not known \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nFebrile neutropenia Common Common \nLeucocytosis Common Common \nNeutropenia Common Common \nPancytopenia Common Common \nThrombocytopenia Common Common \nAnaemia Common Not known \nLeukopenia Not known Not known \nLymphopenia Not known Not known \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nHyperglycaemia Very Common Very Common \nHypokalaemia Very Common Very Common \nHypomagnesaemia Very Common Common \nHypernatraemia Common Common \nKetoacidosis Common Common \nHypermagnesaemia Common Not known \nDehydration Not known Not known \nFluid retention Not known Not known \nPsychiatric disorders \nConfusional state Not known Not known \nNervous system disorders \nParaesthesia Very Common Common \nDizziness Very Common Not known \nHeadache Very Common Not known \nConvulsion Common Not known \nEncephalopathy, Wernicke \nencephalopathy \n\nNot known Not known \n\nEye disorders \nVision blurred Common Not known \n\n\n\n9 \n\n All grades Grades \u2265 3 \nCardiac disorders \nTachycardia Very Common Common \nPericardial effusion Common Common \nVentricular extrasystoles Common Not known \nCardiac failure Not known Not known \nVentricular tachycardia Not known Not known \nVascular disorders \nVasculitis Common Common \nHypotension Common Not known \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nDifferentiation syndrome Very Common Very Common \nDyspnoea Very Common Common \nHypoxia Common Common \nPleural effusion Common Common \nPleuritic pain Common Common \nPulmonary alveolar haemorrhage Common Common \nPneumonitis Not known Not known \nGastrointestinal disorders \nDiarrhoea Very Common Common \nVomiting Very Common Not known \nNausea Very Common Not known \nAbdominal pain Common Common \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nPruritus Very Common Not known \nRash Very Common Not known \nErythema Common Common \nFace oedema Common Not known \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nMyalgia Very Common Common \nArthralgia Common Common \nBone pain Common Common \nRenal and urinary disorders \nRenal failure Common Not known \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nPyrexia Very Common Common \nPain Very Common Common \nFatigue Very Common Not known \nOedema Very Common Not known \nChest pain Common Common \nChills Common Not known \nInvestigations \nAlanine amino transferase increased Very Common Common \nAspartate amino transferase increased Very Common Common \nElectrocardiogram QT prolonged Very Common Common \nHyperbilirubinaemia Common Common \nBlood creatinine increased Common Not known \nWeight increased Common Not known \nGamma-glutamyltransferase increased* Not known* Not known* \n\n*In the CALGB study C9710, 2 cases of grade \u22653 increased GGT were reported out of the 200 \npatients who received TRISENOX consolidation cycles (cycle 1 and cycle 2) versus none in the control \narm.  \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nDifferentiation syndrome \nDuring TRISENOX treatment, 14 of the 52 patients in the APL studies in the relapsed setting had one \nor more symptoms of APL differentiation syndrome, characterised by fever, dyspnoea, weight gain, \npulmonary infiltrates and pleural or pericardial effusions, with or without leucocytosis (see section \n4.4). Twenty-seven patients had leucocytosis (WBC \uf0b3 10 x 103/\uf06dl) during induction, 4 of whom had \nvalues above 100,000/\uf06dl. Baseline white blood cell (WBC) counts did not correlate with development \nof leucocytosis on study, and WBC counts during consolidation therapy were not as high as during \ninduction. In these studies, leucocytosis was not treated with chemotherapeutic medicinal products. \nMedicinal products that are used to lower the white blood cell count often exacerbate the toxicities \nassociated with leucocytosis, and no standard approach has proven effective. One patient treated under \na compassionate use program died from cerebral infarct due to leucocytosis, following treatment with \nchemotherapeutic medicinal products to lower WBC count. Observation is the recommended approach \nwith intervention only in selected cases.  \n \nMortality in the pivotal studies in the relapsed setting from disseminated intravascular coagulation \n(DIC) associated haemorrhage was very common (> 10 %), which is consistent with the early \nmortality reported in the literature. \n \nIn newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate risk APL, differentiation syndrome was observed \nin 19 % including 5 severe cases.  \n \nIn post marketing experience, a differentiation syndrome, like retinoic acid syndrome, has also been \nreported for the treatment of malignancies other than APL with TRISENOX. \n \nQT interval prolongation \nArsenic trioxide can cause QT interval prolongation (see section 4.4). QT prolongation can lead to a \ntorsade de pointes-type ventricular arrhythmia, which can be fatal. The risk of torsade de pointes is \nrelated to the extent of QT prolongation, concomitant administration of QT prolonging medicinal \nproducts, a history of torsade de pointes, pre-existing QT interval prolongation, congestive heart \nfailure, administration of potassium-wasting diuretics, or other conditions that result in hypokalaemia \nor hypomagnesaemia. One patient (receiving multiple, concomitant medicinal products, including \namphotericin B) had asymptomatic torsade de pointes during induction therapy for relapsed APL with \narsenic trioxide. She went onto consolidation without further evidence of QT prolongation.  \n \nIn newly diagnosed patients, with low to intermediate risk APL, QTc prolongation was observed in \n15.6 %. In one patient induction treatment was terminated because of severe prolongation of the QTc \ninterval and electrolyte abnormalities on day 3. \n \nPeripheral neuropathy \nPeripheral neuropathy, characterised by paraesthesia/dysaesthisia, is a common and well known effect \nof environmental arsenic. Only 2 relapsed/refractory APL patients discontinued treatment early due to \nthis adverse event and one went on to receive additional TRISENOX on a subsequent protocol. \nForty-four per cent of relapsed/refractory APL patients experienced symptoms that could be associated \nwith neuropathy; most were mild to moderate and were reversible upon cessation of treatment with \nTRISENOX. \n \nHepatotoxicity (grade 3-4) \nIn newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate risk APL 63.2 % developed grade 3 or 4 hepatic \ntoxic effects during induction or consolidation treatment with TRISENOX in combination with \nATRA. However, toxic effects resolved with temporary discontinuation of either TRISENOX, ATRA \nor both (see section 4.4). \n \nHaematological and gastrointestinal toxicity  \nIn newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate risk APL, gastrointestinal toxicity, grade 3-4 \nneutropenia and grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia occurred, however these were 2.2 times less frequent \n\n\n\n11 \n\nin patients treated with TRISENOX in combination with ATRA compared to patients treated with \nATRA + chemotherapy. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIf symptoms suggestive of serious acute arsenic toxicity (e.g. convulsions, muscle weakness and \nconfusion) appear, TRISENOX must be immediately discontinued and chelating therapy with \npenicillamine at a daily dose \u2264 1 g per day may be considered. The duration of treatment with \npenicillamine must be evaluated taking into account the urinary arsenic laboratory values. For patients \nwho cannot take oral medicinal product, dimercaprol administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg \nintramuscularly every 4 hours until any immediately life-threatening toxicity has subsided may be \nconsidered. Thereafter, penicillamine at a daily dose \u2264 1 g per day may be given. In the presence of \ncoagulopathy, the oral administration of the chelating agent Dimercaptosuccinic Acid Succimer (DCI) \n10 mg/kg or 350 mg/m2 every 8 hours during 5 days and then every 12 hours during 2 weeks is \nrecommended. For patients with severe, acute arsenic overdose, dialysis should be considered  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX27 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe mechanism of action of TRISENOX is not completely understood. Arsenic trioxide causes \nmorphological changes and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis in \nNB4 human promyelocytic leukaemia cells in vitro. Arsenic trioxide also causes damage or \ndegradation of the fusion protein promyelocytic leukaemia/retinoic acid receptor-alpha \n(PML/RAR alpha).  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nNewly diagnosed non high risk APL patients \nTRISENOX has been investigated in 77 newly diagnosed patients with low to intermediate risk APL, \nin a controlled, randomized, non-inferiority Phase 3 clinical study comparing the efficacy and safety \nof TRISENOX combined with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) with those of ATRA + chemotherapy \n(eg, idarubicin and mitoxantrone) (Study APL0406). Patients with newly diagnosed APL confirmed \nby the presence of t(15; 17) or PML-RAR\u03b1 by RT-PCR or micro speckled PML nuclear distribution in \nleukaemic cells were included. No data are available on patient with variant translocations like \nt(11;17) (PLZF/RAR\u03b1). Patients with significant arrhythmias, EKG abnormalities (congenital long QT \nsyndrome, history or presence of significant ventricular or atrial tachyarrhythmia, clinically significant \nresting bradycardia (< 50 beats per minute), QTc > 450 msec on screening EKG, right bundle branch \nblock plus left anterior hemiblock, bifascicular block) or neuropathy were excluded from the study. \nPatients in the ATRA + TRISENOX treatment group received oral ATRA at 45 mg/m2 daily and IV \nTRISENOX at 0.15 mg/kg daily until CR. During consolidation, ATRA was given at the same dose \nfor periods of 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off for a total of 7 courses, and TRISENOX was given at the \nsame dose 5 days per week, 4 weeks on and 4 weeks off, for a total of 4 courses. Patients in the \nATRA + chemotherapy treatment group received IV idarubicin at 12 mg/m2 on days 2, 4, 6, and 8 and \noral ATRA at 45 mg/m2 daily until CR. During consolidation, patients received idarubicin at 5 mg/m2 \non days 1 to 4 and ATRA at 45 mg/m2 daily for 15 days, then IV mitoxantrone at 10 mg/m2 on days 1 \n\n\n\n12 \n\nto 5 and ATRA again at 45 mg/m2 daily for 15 days, and finally a single dose of idarubicin at \n12 mg/m2 and ATRA at 45 mg/m2 daily for 15 days. Each course of consolidation was initiated at \nhaematological recovery from the previous course defined as absolute neutrophil count > 1.5 \u00d7 109/l \nand platelets > 100 \u00d7 109/l. Patients in the ATRA + chemotherapy treatment group also received \nmaintenance treatment for up to 2 years, consisting of oral 6-mercaptopurine at 50 mg/m2 daily, \nintramuscular methotrexate at 15 mg/m2 weekly, and ATRA at 45 mg/m2 daily for 15 days every \n3 months. \n \nThe key efficacy results are summarised in table 3 below: \n \nTable 3 \n\nEndpoint ATRA +  \nTRISENOX \n\n(n = 77) \n[%] \n\nATRA +  \nChemotherapy \n\n(n = 79) \n[%] \n\nConfidence \ninterval (CI) \n\n \n \n\nP-value \n\n2-Year event-free \nsurvival (EFS) 97 86 \n\n95 % CI for \nthe difference, \n\n2-22 \npercentage \n\npoints \n\np < 0.001 \nfor non-inferiority \n\n \np = 0.02 \n\nfor superiority of \nATRA + TRISENOX \n\nHaematologic \ncomplete remission \n(HCR) \n\n100 95  p = 0.12 \n\n2-Year overall \nsurvival (OS) 99 91  p = 0.02 \n\n2-Year disease-free \nsurvival (DFS) 97 90  p = 0.11 \n\n2-Year cumulative \nincidence of relapse \n(CIR) \n\n1 6  p = 0.24 \n\nAPL = acute promyelocytic leukaemia; ATRA = all-trans-retinoic acid \n \nRelapsed/refractory APL \nTRISENOX has been investigated in 52 APL patients, previously treated with an anthracycline and a \nretinoid regimen, in two open-label, single-arm, non-comparative studies. One was a single \ninvestigator clinical study (n=12) and the other was a multicentre, 9-institution study (n=40). Patients \nin the first study received a median dose of 0.16 mg/kg/day of TRISENOX (range 0.06 to \n0.20 mg/kg/day) and patients in the multicentre study received a fixed dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day. \nTRISENOX was administered intravenously over 1 to 2 hours until the bone marrow was free of \nleukaemic cells, up to a maximum of 60 days. Patients with complete remission received consolidation \ntherapy with TRISENOX for 25 additional doses over a 5 week period. Consolidation therapy began \n6 weeks (range, 3-8) after induction in the single institution study and 4 weeks (range, 3-6) in the \nmulticentre study. Complete remission (CR) was defined as the absence of visible leukaemic cells in \nthe bone marrow and peripheral recovery of platelets and white blood cells.  \n \nPatients in the single centre study had relapsed following 1-6 prior therapy regimens and 2 patients \nhad relapsed following stem cell transplantation. Patients in the multicentre study had relapsed \nfollowing 1-4 prior therapy regimens and 5 patients had relapsed following stem cell transplantation. \nThe median age in the single centre study was 33 years (age range 9 to 75). The median age in the \nmulticentre study was 40 years (age range 5 to 73). \n \nThe results are summarised in the table 4 below. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nTable 4 \n Single centre trial \n\nN=12 \nMulticentre trial \n\nN=40 \nTRISENOX dose, mg/kg/day \n(median, range) \n\n0.16 (0.06 \u2013 0.20) 0.15 \n\nComplete remission 11 (92 %) 34 (85 %) \nTime to bone marrow \nremission (median) \n\n32 days 35 days \n\nTime to CR (median)  54 days 59 days \n18-Month survival  67 % 66 % \n\n \nThe single institution study included 2 paediatric patients (< 18 years old), both of whom achieved \nCR. The multicentre trial included 5 paediatric patients (< 18 years old), 3 of whom achieved CR. No \nchildren of less than 5 years of age were treated.  \n \nIn a follow-up treatment after consolidation, 7 patients in the single institution study and 18 patients in \nthe multicentre study received further maintenance therapy with TRISENOX. Three patients from the \nsingle institution study and 15 patients from the multicentre study had stem cell transplants after \ncompleting TRISENOX. The Kaplan-Meier median CR duration for the single institution study is 14 \nmonths and has not been reached for the multicentre study. At last follow-up, 6 of 12 patients in the \nsingle institution study were alive with a median follow-up time of 28 months (range 25 to 29). In the \nmulticentre study 27 of 40 patients were alive with a median follow-up time of 16 months (range \n9 to 25).

The response rate was \nsimilar for both genders. There is no experience on the effect of TRISENOX on the variant APL \ncontaining the t(11;17) and t(5;17) chromosomal translocations. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe experience in children is limited. Of 7 patients under 18 years of age (range 5 to 16 years) treated \nwith TRISENOX at the recommended dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day, 5 patients achieved a complete \nresponse (see section 4.2). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe inorganic, lyophilized form of arsenic trioxide, when placed into solution, immediately forms the \nhydrolysis product arsenious acid (AsIII). AsIII is the pharmacologically active species of arsenic \ntrioxide.  \n \nDistribution \nThe volume of distribution (Vd) for AsIII is large (> 400 l) indicating significant distribution into the \ntissues with negligible protein binding. Vd is also weight dependent, increasing with increasing body \nweight. Total arsenic accumulates mainly in the liver, kidney, and heart and, to a lesser extent, in the \nlung, hair, and nails. \n \nBiotransformation  \nThe metabolism of arsenic trioxide involves oxidation of arsenious acid (AsIII), the active species of \narsenic trioxide, to arsenic acid (AsV), as well as oxidative methylation to monomethylarsonic acid \n(MMAV) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAV) by methyltransferases, primarily in the liver. The \npentavalent metabolites, MMAV and DMAV, are slow to appear in plasma (approximately 10-24 hours \nafter first administration of arsenic trioxide), but due to their longer half-life, accumulate more upon \nmultiple dosing than does AsIII. The extent of accumulation of these metabolites is dependent on the \ndosing regimen. Approximate accumulation ranged from 1.4- to 8-fold following multiple as \ncompared to single dose administration. AsV is present in plasma only at relatively low levels.   \n \nIn vitro enzymatic studies with human liver microsomes revealed that arsenic trioxide has no \ninhibitory activity on substrates of the major cytochrome P450 enzymes such as 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, \n2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4/5, 4A9/11. Substances that are substrates for these P450 enzymes are not \nexpected to interact with TRISENOX. \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nElimination \nApproximately 15 % of the administered TRISENOX dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged AsIII.  \nThe methylated metabolites of AsIII (MMAV, DMAV) are primarily excreted in the urine. The plasma \nconcentration of AsIII declines from peak plasma concentration in a biphasic manner with a mean \nterminal elimination half-life of 10 to 14 hours. The total clearance of AsIII over the single-dose range \nof 7-32 mg (administered as 0.15 mg/kg) is 49 l/h and the renal clearance is 9 l/h. Clearance is not \ndependent on the weight of the subject or the dose administered over the dose range studied. The mean \nestimated terminal elimination half-lives of the metabolites MMAV and DMAV are 32 hours and \n70 hours, respectively. \n \nRenal impairment \nPlasma clearance of AsIII was not altered in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance \nof 50-80 ml/min) or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30-49 ml/min). The plasma \nclearance of AsIII in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min) \nwas 40 % lower when compared with patients with normal renal function (see section 4.4). \n \nSystemic exposure to MMAV and DMAV tended to be larger in patients with renal impairment; the \nclinical consequence of this is unknown but no increased toxicity was noted.  \n \nHepatic impairment \nPharmacokinetic data from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma having mild to moderate hepatic \nimpairment indicate that AsIII or AsV do not accumulate following twice-weekly infusions. No clear \ntrend toward an increase in systemic exposure to AsIII, AsV, MMAV or DMAV was observed with \ndecreasing level of hepatic function as assessed by dose-normalized (per mg dose) AUC. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nIn the total single dose range of 7 to 32 mg (administered as 0.15 mg/kg), systemic exposure (AUC) \nappears to be linear. The decline from peak plasma concentration of AsIII occurs in a biphasic manner \nand is characterized by an initial rapid distribution phase followed by a slower terminal elimination \nphase. After administration at 0.15 mg/kg on a daily (n=6) or twice-weekly (n=3) regimen, an \napproximate 2-fold accumulation of AsIII was observed as compared to a single infusion. This \naccumulation was slightly more than expected based on single-dose results.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nLimited reproductive toxicity studies of arsenic trioxide in animals indicate embryotoxicity and \nteratogenicity (neural tube defects, anophthalmia and microphthalmia) at administration of 1-10 times \nthe recommended clinical dose (mg/m2). Fertility studies have not been conducted with TRISENOX. \nArsenic compounds induce chromosomal aberrations and morphological transformations of \nmammalian cells in vitro and in vivo. No formal carcinogenicity studies of arsenic trioxide have been \nperformed. However, arsenic trioxide and other inorganic arsenic compounds are recognised as human \ncarcinogens. \n \n \n6.

What you need to know before you are given TRISENOX \n \nTRISENOX must be given under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of acute \nleukaemias.  \n \nYou must not receive TRISENOX \nIf you are allergic to arsenic trioxide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nYou must talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given TRISENOX, if \n\n- you have impaired kidney function. \n- you have any liver problems. \n\n \nYour doctor will take the following precautions: \n\n- Tests will be performed to check the amount of potassium, magnesium, calcium and creatinine \nin your blood before your first dose of TRISENOX.  \n\n- You should have an electrical recording of the heart (electrocardiogram ECG) performed before \nyour first dose.  \n\n- Blood tests (potassium, calcium, magnesium and liver function) should be repeated during your \ntreatment with TRISENOX.  \n\n- In addition, you will receive electrocardiograms twice weekly.  \n- If you are at risk for a certain type of abnormal heart rhythm (e.g. torsade de pointes or QTc \n\nprolongation), your heart will be monitored continuously.  \n- Your doctor may monitor your health during and after treatment, since arsenic trioxide, the \n\nactive substance in TRISENOX, may cause other cancers. You should report any new and \nexceptional symptoms and circumstances whenever you see your doctor. \n\n\n\n30 \n\n- Follow-up of your cognitive and mobility functions if you are at risk for vitamin B1 deficiency. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nTRISENOX is not recommended in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and TRISENOX \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nIn particular tell your doctor  \n\n- if you are taking any of various types of medicines which could cause a change in the rhythm of \nyour heartbeat. These include:  \n\n\uf0b7 some types of antiarrhythmics (medicines used to correct irregular heart beats, e.g. \nquinidine, amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide)  \n\n\uf0b7 medicines to treat psychosis (loss of contact with reality, e.g. thioridazine)  \n\uf0b7 medicines for depression (e.g. amitriptyline)  \n\uf0b7 some types of medicines to treat bacterial infections (e.g. erythromycin and sparfloxacin) \n\uf0b7 some medicines to treat allergies such as hay fever, called antihistamines (e.g. terfenadine \n\nand astemizole) \n\uf0b7 any medicines that cause a decrease in magnesium or potassium in your blood (e.g. \n\namphotericin B) \n\uf0b7 cisapride (a medicine used to relieve certain stomach problems).  \n\nThe effect of these medicines on your heartbeat can be made worse by TRISENOX. You must \nbe sure to tell your doctor about all medicines you are taking. \n\n- if you are taking or have recently taken any medicine which may affect your liver. If you are not \nsure, show the bottle or pack to your doctor. \n\n \nTRISENOX with food and drink \nThere are no restrictions on your food or drink while you are receiving TRISENOX. \n \nPregnancy \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.  \nTRISENOX may cause harm to the foetus when used by pregnant women.  \nIf you are able to become pregnant, you must use effective birth control during treatment with \nTRISENOX.  \nIf you are pregnant or you become pregnant during the treatment with TRISENOX, you must ask your \ndoctor for advice. \nMen should also use effective contraception during treatment with TRISENOX. \n \nBreast-feeding \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.  \nThe arsenic in TRISENOX passes into breast milk.  \nBecause TRISENOX can harm nursing infants, do not breast-feed while on TRISENOX. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTRISENOX is expected to have no or negligible influence on your ability to drive and use machines. \nIf you experience discomfort or if you feel unwell after a TRISENOX injection, you should wait until \nthe symptoms go away before driving or using machines. \n \nTRISENOX contains sodium \nTRISENOX contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. This means that the medicine is \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How TRISENOX is given \n \nDuration and frequency of treatment \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \nPatients with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukaemia \nYour doctor will give you TRISENOX once every day as an infusion. In your first treatment cycle, \nyou may be treated every day up to 60 days at most or until your doctor determines that your disease is \nbetter. If your disease responds to TRISENOX, you will be given 4 additional treatment cycles. Each \ncycle consists of 20 doses given 5 days per week (followed by 2 days interruption) for 4 weeks \nfollowed by 4 weeks interruption. Your doctor will decide exactly how long you must continue on \ntherapy with TRISENOX. \n \nPatients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia, whose disease has not responded to other therapies \nYour doctor will give you TRISENOX once every day as an infusion. In your first treatment cycle, \nyou may be treated every day up to 50 days at most or until your doctor determines that your disease is \nbetter. If your disease responds to TRISENOX, you will be given a second treatment cycle of 25 doses \ngiven 5 days per week (followed by 2 days interruption) for 5 weeks. Your doctor will decide exactly \nhow long you must continue on therapy with TRISENOX. \n \nMethod and route of administration \n \nTRISENOX must be diluted with a solution containing glucose or a solution containing sodium \nchloride. \n \nTRISENOX is normally given by a doctor or a nurse. It is given as a drip (infusion) into a vein over \n1-2 hours, but the infusion may last longer if side effects like flushing and dizziness occur.  \n \nTRISENOX must not be mixed with, or infused through the same tube with other medicines.  \n \nIf your doctor or nurse gives you more TRISENOX than he/she should \nYou may experience convulsions, muscle weakness and confusion. If this happens, treatment with \nTRISENOX must be stopped immediately and your doctor will treat the arsenic overdose.  \n \nIf you have any further question on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4.
