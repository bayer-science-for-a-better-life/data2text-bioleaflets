CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of influenza  \nTamiflu is indicated in adults and children including full term neonates who present with symptoms \ntypical of influenza, when influenza virus is circulating in the community. Efficacy has been \ndemonstrated when treatment is initiated within two days of first onset of symptoms.  \n \nPrevention of influenza \n- Post-exposure prevention in individuals 1 year of age or older following contact with a \n\nclinically diagnosed influenza case when influenza virus is circulating in the community. \n \n- The appropriate use of Tamiflu for prevention of influenza should be determined on a case by \n\ncase basis by the circumstances and the population requiring protection. In exceptional \nsituations (e.g. in case of a mismatch between the circulating and vaccine virus strains, and a \npandemic situation) seasonal prevention could be considered in individuals one year of age or \nolder. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n- Tamiflu is indicated for post-exposure prevention of influenza in infants less than 1 year of age \nduring a pandemic influenza outbreak (see section 5.2). \n\n \nTamiflu is not a substitute for influenza vaccination.  \n \nThe use of antivirals for the treatment and prevention of influenza should be determined on the basis \nof official recommendations. Decisions regarding the use of oseltamivir for treatment and prophylaxis \nshould take into consideration what is known about the characteristics of the circulating influenza \nviruses, available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns for each season and the impact \nof the disease in different geographical areas and patient populations (see section 5.1).  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nTamiflu hard capsules and Tamiflu suspension are bioequivalent formulations. 75 mg doses can be \nadministered as either  \n- one 75 mg capsule or  \n- one 30 mg capsule plus one 45 mg capsule or  \n- by administering one 30 mg dose plus one 45 mg dose of suspension.  \n \nCommercially manufactured Tamiflu powder for oral suspension (6 mg/ml) is the preferred product \nfor paediatric and adult patients who have difficulties swallowing capsules or where lower doses are \nneeded.   \n \nAdults, and adolescents 13 years and over \n \nTreatment: The recommended oral dose is 75 mg oseltamivir twice daily for 5 days for adolescents (13 \nto 17 years of age) and adults.  \n \n\nBody Weight Recommended dose for 5 days Recommended dose for 10 days* \nImmunocompromised Patients \n\n> 40 kg 75 mg twice daily 75 mg twice daily \n* The recommended treatment duration in immunocompromised adults and adolescents is 10 days. See Special Populations, \nImmunocompromised Patients for more information. \n \nTreatment should be initiated as soon as possible within the first two days of onset of symptoms of \ninfluenza.  \n \nPost-exposure prevention: The recommended dose for prevention of influenza following close contact \nwith an infected individual is 75 mg oseltamivir once daily for 10 days for adolescents (13 to 17 years \nof age) and adults.  \n \n\nBody Weight Recommended dose for 10 days \n \n\nRecommended dose for 10 days \nImmunocompromised Patients \n\n> 40 kg 75 mg once daily 75 mg once daily \n \nTherapy should begin as soon as possible within two days of exposure to an infected individual. \n \nPrevention during an influenza epidemic in the community: The recommended dose for prevention of \ninfluenza during a community outbreak is 75 mg oseltamivir once daily for up to 6 weeks (or up to 12 \nweeks in immunocompromised patients, see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nChildren 1 to 12 years of age  \nTamiflu 30 mg, 45 mg and 75 mg capsules and oral suspension are available for infants and children \n1 year of age or older \n \nTreatment: The following weight-adjusted dosing regimens are recommended for treatment of infants \nand children 1 year of age or older: \n \n\nBody Weight Recommended dose for 5 days Recommended dose for 10 days* \nImmunocompromised Patients \n\n10 kg to 15 kg 30 mg twice daily 30 mg twice daily \n> 15 kg to 23 kg 45 mg twice daily 45 mg twice daily \n> 23 kg to 40 kg 60 mg twice daily 60 mg twice daily \n> 40 kg 75 mg twice daily 75 mg twice daily \n\n*The recommended treatment duration in immunocompromised children (\u22651 year old) is 10 days.  See Special Populations, \nImmunocompromised Patients for more information.  \n \nTreatment should be initiated as soon as possible within the first two days of onset of symptoms of \ninfluenza.  \n \nPost-exposure prevention: The recommended post-exposure prevention dose of Tamiflu is: \n \n\nBody Weight Recommended dose for 10 days Recommended dose for 10 days \nFor Immunocomprmised Patients \n\n10 kg to 15 kg 30 mg once daily 30 mg once daily \n> 15 kg to 23 kg 45 mg once daily 45 mg once daily \n> 23 kg to 40 kg 60 mg once daily 60 mg once daily \n> 40 kg 75 mg once daily 75 mg once daily \n\n \nPrevention during an influenza epidemic in the community: Prevention during an influenza epidemic \nhas not been studied in children below 12 years of age. \n \nInfants 0 \u2013 12 months of age \n \nTreatment: The recommended treatment dose for infants 0 - 12 months of age is 3 mg/kg twice daily. \nThis is based upon pharmacokinetic and safety data indicating that this dose in infants 0 - 12 months \nprovides plasma concentrations of the pro-drug and active metabolite that are anticipated to be \nclinically efficacious with a safety profile comparable to that seen in older children and adults (see \nsection 5.2). The following dosing regimen is recommended for treatment of infants 0 - 12 months of \nage: \n \n\nBody weight* Recommended dose for 5 days Recommended dose for 10 days** \nImmunocompromised Patients \n\n3 kg 9 mg twice daily 9 mg twice daily \n4 kg 12 mg twice daily 12 mg twice daily \n5 kg 15 mg twice daily 15 mg twice daily \n6 kg 18 mg twice daily 18 mg twice daily \n7 kg 21 mg twice daily 21 mg twice daily \n8 kg 24 mg twice daily 24 mg twice daily \n9 kg 27 mg twice daily 27 mg twice daily \n\n10 kg 30 mg twice daily 30 mg twice daily \n* This table is not intended to contain all possible weights for this population. For all patients under the age of 1 year, \n\n3 mg/kg should be used to determine dose regardless of the weight of the patient. \nTreatment should be initiated as soon as possible within the first two days of onset of symptoms of influenza. \n** The recommended duration in immunocompromised infants (0-12 months old) is 10 days. See Special Populations, \nImmunocompromised Patients for more information. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nThis dosing recommendation is not intended for premature infants, i.e. those with a post-conceptual \nage less than 36 weeks. Insufficient data are available for these patients, in whom different dosing may \nbe required due to the immaturity of physiological functions. \n \nPost-exposure prevention: The recommended prophylaxis dose for infants less than 1 year of age \nduring a pandemic influenza outbreak is half of the daily treatment dose. This is based upon clinical \ndata in infants and children 1 year of age or older and adults showing that a prophylaxis dose \nequivalent to half the daily treatment dose is clinically efficacious for the prevention of influenza. The \nfollowing age-adjusted dosing prophylaxis regimen is recommended for infants 0 - 12 months of age  \n(see Section 5.2 for exposure simulation): \n \n\nAge Recommended dose for 10 days Recommended dose for 10 days \nImmunocompromised Patients \n\n0 - 12 months 3 mg/kg once daily 3 mg/kg once daily \n \nThis dosing recommendation is not intended for premature infants, i.e. those with a post-conceptual \nage less than 36 weeks. Insufficient data are available for these patients, in whom different dosing may \nbe required due to the immaturity of physiological functions. \n \nPrevention during an influenza epidemic in the community: Prevention during an influenza epidemic \nhas not been studied in children 0-12 months of age. \n \nFor instructions on preparing the extemporaneous formulation, see section 6.6. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required either for treatment or for prevention in patients with hepatic \ndysfunction. No studies have been carried out in paediatric patients with hepatic disorder. \n \nRenal impairment  \nTreatment of influenza: Dose adjustment is recommended for adults and adolescents (13 to 17 years of \nage) with moderate or severe renal impairment. Recommended doses are detailed in the table below.  \n \n\nCreatinine clearance  Recommended dose for treatment \n> 60 (ml/min) 75 mg twice daily \n\n> 30 to 60 (ml/min) 30 mg (suspension or capsules) twice daily \n> 10 to 30 (ml/min) 30 mg (suspension or capsules) once daily \n\n\u00a3 10 (ml/min)  Not recommended (no data available) \nHaemodialysis patients 30 mg after each haemodialysis session \n\nPeritoneal dialysis patients* 30 mg (suspension or capsules) single dose \n* Data derived from studies in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients; the clearance of \n\noseltamivir carboxylate is expected to be higher when automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) mode is used. \nTreatment mode can be switched from APD to CAPD if considered necessary by a nephrologist. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nPrevention of influenza: Dose adjustment is recommended for adults and adolescents (13 to 17 years \nof age) with moderate or severe renal impairment as detailed in the table below. \n \n\nCreatinine clearance  Recommended dose for prevention \n> 60 (ml/min) 75 mg once daily \n\n> 30 to 60 (ml/min) 30 mg (suspension or capsules) once daily \n> 10 to 30 (ml/min) 30 mg (suspension or capsules) every second \n\nday \n\u00a3 10 (ml/min)  Not recommended (no data available) \n\nHaemodialysis patients 30 mg after every second haemodialysis session \nPeritoneal dialysis patients* 30 mg (suspension or capsules) once weekly \n\n* Data derived from studies in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients; the clearance of \noseltamivir carboxylate is expected to be higher when automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) mode is used. \nTreatment mode can be switched from APD to CAPD if considered necessary by a nephrologist. \n\n \nThere is insufficient clinical data available in infants and children (12 years of age and younger) with \nrenal impairment to be able to make any dosing recommendation. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required, unless there is evidence of moderate or severe renal impairment. \n \nImmunocompromised patients  \n \nTreatment: For treatment of influenza, the recommended duration for immunocompromised patients is \n10 days (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). No dose adjustment is necessary.   Treatment should be \ninitiated as soon as possible within the first two days of onset of symptoms of influenza. \n \nSeasonal prophylaxis: Longer duration of seasonal prophylaxis up to 12 weeks has been evaluated in \nimmunocompromised patients (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. \nPatients who are unable to swallow capsules may receive appropriate doses of Tamiflu suspension. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nOseltamivir is effective only against illness caused by influenza viruses. There is no evidence for \nefficacy of oseltamivir in any illness caused by agents other than influenza viruses (see section 5.1).  \n \nTamiflu is not a substitute for influenza vaccination. Use of Tamiflu must not affect the evaluation of \nindividuals for annual influenza vaccination. The protection against influenza lasts only as long as \nTamiflu is administered. Tamiflu should be used for the treatment and prevention of influenza only \nwhen reliable epidemiological data indicate that influenza virus is circulating in the community. \nSusceptibility of circulating influenza virus strains to oseltamivir has been shown to be highly variable \n(see section 5.1). Therefore, prescribers should take into account the most recent information available \non oseltamivir susceptibility patterns of the currently circulating viruses when deciding whether to use \nTamiflu. \n \nSevere concomitant condition \nNo information is available regarding the safety and efficacy of oseltamivir in patients with any \nmedical condition sufficiently severe or unstable to be considered at imminent risk of requiring \nhospitalisation.  \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nImmunocompromised patients \nThe efficacy of oseltamivir in either treatment or prophylaxis of influenza in immunocompromised \npatients has not been firmly established (see section 5.1).  \n \nCardiac / respiratory disease \nEfficacy of oseltamivir in the treatment of subjects with chronic cardiac disease and/or respiratory \ndisease has not been established. No difference in the incidence of complications was observed \nbetween the treatment and placebo groups in this population (see section 5.1). \n \nPaediatric population \nNo data allowing a dose recommendation for premature children (< 36 weeks post-conceptual age) are \ncurrently available. \n \nSevere renal impairment \nDose adjustment is recommended for both treatment and prevention in adolescents (13 to 17 years of \nage) and adults with severe renal impairment. There is insufficient clinical data available in infants and \nchildren (1 year of age or older) with renal impairment to be able to make any dosing recommendation \n(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nNeuropsychiatric events \nNeuropsychiatric events have been reported during administration of Tamiflu in patients with \ninfluenza, especially in children and adolescents. These events are also experienced by patients with \ninfluenza without oseltamivir administration. Patients should be closely monitored for behavioural \nchanges, and the benefits and risks of continuing treatment should be carefully evaluated for each \npatient (see section 4.8). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPharmacokinetic properties of oseltamivir, such as low protein binding and metabolism independent of \nthe CYP450 and glucuronidase systems (see section 5.2), suggest that clinically significant drug \ninteractions via these mechanisms are unlikely. \n \nProbenecid \nNo dose adjustment is required when co-administering with probenecid in patients with normal renal \nfunction. Co-administration of probenecid, a potent inhibitor of the anionic pathway of renal tubular \nsecretion, results in an approximate 2-fold increase in exposure to the active metabolite of oseltamivir.  \n \nAmoxicillin \nOseltamivir has no kinetic interaction with amoxicillin, which is eliminated via the same pathway, \nsuggesting that oseltamivir interaction with this pathway is weak.  \n \nRenal elimination \nClinically important drug interactions involving competition for renal tubular secretion are unlikely, \ndue to the known safety margin for most of these substances, the elimination characteristics of the \nactive metabolite (glomerular filtration and anionic tubular secretion) and the excretion capacity of \nthese pathways. However, care should be taken when prescribing oseltamivir in subjects when taking \nco-excreted agents with a narrow therapeutic margin (e.g. chlorpropamide, methotrexate, \nphenylbutazone).  \n \nAdditional information \nNo pharmacokinetic interactions between oseltamivir or its major metabolite have been observed \nwhen co-administering oseltamivir with paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid, cimetidine, antacids \n(magnesium and aluminium hydroxides and calcium carbonates), rimantadine or warfarin (in subjects \nstable on warfarin and without influenza). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nInfluenza is associated with adverse pregnancy and foetal outcomes, with a risk of major congenital \nmalformations, including congenital heart defects. A large amount of data on oseltamivir exposure of \npregnant women from post-marketing reports and observational studies (more than 1000 exposed \noutcomes during the first trimester) indicate no malformative nor feto/neonatal toxicity by oseltamivir.  \n \nHowever, in one observational study, while the overall malformation risk was not increased, the \nresults for major congenital heart defects diagnosed within 12 months of birth were not conclusive. In \nthis study, the rate of major congenital heart defects following oseltamivir exposure during the first \ntrimester was 1.76% (7 infants out of 397 pregnancies) compared to 1.01% in unexposed pregnancies \nfrom the general population (Odds Ratio 1.75, 95% Confidence Interval 0.51 to 5.98). The clinical \nsignificance of this finding is not clear, as the study had limited power. Additionally, this study was \ntoo small to reliably assess individual types of major malformations; moreover women exposed to \noseltamivir and women unexposed could not be made fully comparable, in particular whether or not \nthey had influenza. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nThe use of Tamiflu may be considered during pregnancy if necessary and after considering the \navailable safety and benefit information (for data on benefit in pregnant women please refer to section \n5.1 \u201ctreatment of influenza in pregnant women\u201d), and the pathogenicity of the circulating influenza \nvirus strain. \n \nBreastfeeding \nIn lactating rats, oseltamivir and the active metabolite are excreted in milk. Very limited information is \navailable on children breast-fed by mothers taking oseltamivir and on excretion of oseltamivir in \nbreast milk. Limited data demonstrated that oseltamivir and the active metabolite were detected in \nbreast milk, however the levels were low, which would result in a subtherapeutic dose to the infant. \nConsidering this information, the pathogenicity of the circulating influenza virus strain and the \nunderlying condition of the breastfeeding woman, administration of oseltamivir may be considered, \nwhere there are clear potential benefits to breastfeeding mothers. \n \nFertility \nBased on preclinical data, there is no evidence that Tamiflu has an effect on male or female fertility \n(see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTamiflu has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe overall safety profile of Tamiflu is based on data from 6049 adult/adolescent and 1473 paediatric \npatients treated with Tamiflu or placebo for influenza, and on data from 3990 adult/adolescent and 253 \npaediatric patients receiving Tamiflu or placebo/no treatment for the prophylaxis of influenza in \nclinical trials. In addition, 245 immunocompromised patients (including 7 adolescents and 39 children) \nreceived Tamiflu for the treatment of influenza and 475 immunocompromised patients (including 18 \nchildren, of these 10 Tamiflu and 8 placebo) received Tamiflu or placebo for the prophylaxis of \ninfluenza. \n \nIn adults/adolescents, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (ARs) were nausea and vomiting \nin the treatment studies, and nausea in the prevention studies. The majority of these ARs were reported \non a single occasion on either the first or second treatment day and resolved spontaneously within 1-2 \n\n\n\n9 \n\ndays. In children, the most commonly reported adverse reaction was vomiting. In the majority of \npatients, these ARs did not lead to discontinuation of Tamiflu. \n \nThe following serious adverse reactions have been rarely reported since oseltamivir has been \nmarketed: Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions, hepatic disorders (fulminant hepatitis, hepatic \nfunction disorder and jaundice), angioneurotic oedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic \nepidermal necrolysis, gastrointestinal bleeding and neuropsychiatric disorders.  \n(Regarding neuropsychiatric disorders, see section 4.4.) \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe ARs listed in the tables below fall into the following categories: Very common (\u2265 1/10), common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), and very rare \n(< 1/10,000). ARs are added to the appropriate category in the tables according to the pooled analysis \nfrom clinical studies.  \n \nTreatment and prevention of influenza in adults and adolescents:  \nIn adult/adolescent treatment and prevention studies, ARs that occurred the most frequently at the \nrecommended dose (75  mg bid for 5  days for treatment and 75  mg od for up to 6  weeks for \nprophylaxis) are shown in Table 1. \n \nThe safety profile reported in subjects who received the recommended dose of Tamiflu for prophylaxis \n(75 mg once daily for up to 6 weeks) was qualitatively similar to that seen in the treatment studies, \ndespite a longer duration of dosing in the prophylaxis studies. \n \nTable 1 Adverse reactions in studies investigating Tamiflu for treatment and prevention of \n\ninfluenza in adults and adolescents or through post-marketing surveillance \n \nSystem Organ \nClass (SOC) \n\nAdverse reactions according to frequency \nVery common Common Uncommon Rare \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n Bronchitis, \nHerpes simplex, \nNasopharyngitis, \nUpper respiratory \ntract infections, \nSinusitis \n\n  \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n   Thrombocytopenia \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity \nreaction \n\nAnaphylactic \nreactions, \nAnaphylactoid \nreactions \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n   Agitation,  \nAbnormal behaviour, \nAnxiety,  \nConfusion, \nDelusions, Delirium, \nHallucination, \nNightmares,  \nSelf-injury \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache Insomnia Altered level of \nconsciousness, \nConvulsion \n\n \n\nEye disorders    Visual disturbance \nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n  Cardiac \narrhythmia \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nSystem Organ \nClass (SOC) \n\nAdverse reactions according to frequency \nVery common Common Uncommon Rare \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Cough,  \nSore throat, \nRhinorrhea \n\n  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea Vomiting  \nAbdominal pain \n(incl. upper \nabdominal pain), \nDyspepsia \n\n Gastrointestinal \nbleedings, \nHaemorrhagic \ncolitis \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n  Elevated liver \nenzymes \n\nFulminant hepatitis, \nHepatic failure, \nHepatitis \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Eczema, \nDermatitis,  \nRash,  \nUrticaria \n\nAngioneurotic \noedema,  \nErythema \nmultiforme, \nStevens-Johnson \nsyndrome,  \nToxic epidermal \nnecrolysis \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\n Pain  \nDizziness (incl. \nvertigo),  \nFatigue, \nPyrexia, \nPain in limb \n\n  \n\n \nTreatment and prevention of influenza in children:  \n \nA total of 1473 children (including otherwise healthy children aged 1-12 years old and asthmatic \nchildren aged 6-12 years old) participated in clinical studies of oseltamivir given for the treatment of \ninfluenza. Of those, 851 children received treatment with oseltamivir suspension. A total of 158 \nchildren received the recommended dose of Tamiflu once daily in a post-exposure prophylaxis study \nin households (n = 99), a 6-week paediatric seasonal prophylaxis study (n = 49) and a 12-week \npaediatric seasonal prophylaxis study in immunocompromised subjects (n = 10). \n \nTable 2 shows the most frequently reported ARs from paediatric clinical trials.  \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nTable 2 Adverse reactions in studies investigating Tamiflu for treatment and prevention of \ninfluenza in children (age/weight-based dosing [30 mg to 75 mg o.d.]) \n\n \nSystem Organ \nClass (SOC) \n\nAdverse reactions according to frequency \nVery common Common Uncommon Rare \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n Otitis media, \n \n\n  \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n Headache   \n\nEye disorders:  Conjunctivitis \n(including red \neyes, eye \ndischarge and eye \npain) \n\n  \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders: \n\n Earache Tympanic \nmembrane disorder \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\nCough,  \nNasal congestion \n\nRhinorrhoea   \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nVomiting Abdominal pain \n(incl. upper \nabdominal pain), \nDyspepsia, \nNausea  \n\n  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Dermatitis \n(including allergic \nand atopic \ndermatitis) \n\n \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nPsychiatric disorders and nervous system disorders \nInfluenza can be associated with a variety of neurologic and behavioural symptoms which can include \nevents such as hallucinations, delirium, and abnormal behaviour, in some cases resulting in fatal \noutcomes. These events may occur in the setting of encephalitis or encephalopathy but can occur \nwithout obvious severe disease. \n \nIn patients with influenza who were receiving Tamiflu, there have been postmarketing reports of \nconvulsions and delirium (including symptoms such as altered level of consciousness, confusion, \nabnormal behaviour, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, nightmares), in a very few cases \nresulting in self-injury or fatal outcomes. These events were reported primarily among paediatric and \nadolescent patients and often had an abrupt onset and rapid resolution. The contribution of Tamiflu to \nthose events is unknown. Such neuropsychiatric events have also been reported in patients with \ninfluenza who were not taking Tamiflu. \n \nHepato-biliary disorders \nHepato-biliary system disorders, including hepatitis and elevated liver enzymes in patients with \ninfluenza-like illness. These cases include fatal fulminant hepatitis/hepatic failure. \n \nOther special populations \n \nPaediatric population (infants less than one year of age) \nIn two studies to characterise the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety profile of \noseltamivir therapy in 135 influenza infected children less than one year of age, the safety profile was \nsimilar among age cohorts with vomiting, diarrohea and diaper rash being the most frequently reported \n\n\n\n12 \n\nadverse events (see section 5.2). Insufficient data are available for infants who have a post-conceptual \nage of less than 36 weeks. \n \nSafety information available on oseltamivir administered for treatment of influenza in infants less than \none year of age from prospective and retrospective observational studies (comprising together more \nthan 2,400 infants of that age class), epidemiological databases research and postmarketing reports \nsuggest that the safety profile in infants less than one year of age is similar to the established safety \nprofile of children aged one year and older. \n \nOlder people and patients with chronic cardiac and/or respiratory disease \nThe population included in the influenza treatment studies is comprised of otherwise healthy \nadults/adolescents and patients \u201cat risk\u201d (patients at higher risk of developing complications associated \nwith influenza, e.g. older people and patients with chronic cardiac or respiratory disease). In general, \nthe safety profile in the patients \u201cat risk\u201d was qualitatively similar to that in otherwise healthy \nadults/adolescents. \n \nImmunocompromised patients \n \nThe treatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients were evaluated in two studies receiving \nstandard dose or high dose regimens (double dose or triple dose) of Tamiflu (see section 5.1). The \nsafety profile of Tamiflu observed in these studies was consistent with that observed in previous \nclinical trials where Tamiflu was administered for treatment of influenza in non-immunocompromised \npatients across all age groups (otherwise healthy patients or \u201cat risk\u201d patients [i.e., those with \nrespiratory and/or cardiac co-morbidities]). The most frequent adverse reaction reported in \nimmunocompromised children was vomiting (28%).  \n \nIn a 12-week prophylaxis study in 475 immunocompromised patients, including 18 children 1 to \n12 years of age and older, the safety profile in the 238 patients who received oseltamivir was \nconsistent with that previously observed in Tamiflu prophylaxis clinical studies. \n \nChildren with pre-existing bronchial asthma \nIn general, the adverse reaction profile in children with pre-existing bronchial asthma was qualitatively \nsimilar to that of otherwise healthy children. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nReports of overdoses with Tamiflu have been received from clinical trials and during post-marketing \nexperience. In the majority of cases reporting overdose, no adverse events were reported. \n \nAdverse events reported following overdose were similar in nature and distribution to those observed \nwith therapeutic doses of Tamiflu, described in section 4.8 Undesirable effects. \n \nNo specific antidote is known. \n \nPaediatric population \nOverdose has been reported more frequently for children than adults and adolescents. Caution should \nbe exercised when preparing Tamiflu oral suspension and when administering Tamiflu products to \nchildren. \n \n \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n13 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, neuraminidase inhibitors ATC code: \nJ05AH02 \n \nOseltamivir phosphate is a pro-drug of the active metabolite (oseltamivir carboxylate). The active \nmetabolite is a selective inhibitor of influenza virus neuraminidase enzymes, which are glycoproteins \nfound on the virion surface. Viral neuraminidase enzyme activity is important both for viral entry into \nuninfected cells and for the release of recently formed virus particles from infected cells, and for the \nfurther spread of infectious virus in the body. \n \nOseltamivir carboxylate inhibits influenza A and B neuraminidases in vitro. Oseltamivir phosphate \ninhibits influenza virus infection and replication in vitro. Oseltamivir given orally inhibits influenza A \nand B virus replication and pathogenicity in vivo in animal models of influenza infection at antiviral \nexposures similar to that achieved in man with 75 mg twice daily. \n \nAntiviral activity of oseltamivir was supported for influenza A and B by experimental challenge \nstudies in healthy volunteers.  \n \nNeuraminidase enzyme IC50 values for oseltamivir for clinically isolated influenza A ranged from \n0.1 nM to 1.3 nM, and for influenza B was 2.6 nM. Higher IC50 values for influenza B, up to a \nmedian of 8.5 nM, have been observed in published studies. \n \nClinical studies \n \nTreatment of influenza infection \n \nThe indication is based on clinical studies of naturally occurring influenza in which the predominant \ninfection was influenza A. \n \nOseltamivir is effective only against illnesses caused by influenza virus. Statistical analyses are \ntherefore presented only for influenza-infected subjects. In the pooled treatment study population, \nwhich included both influenza-positive and -negative subjects (ITT), primary efficacy was reduced \nproportionally to the number of influenza-negative individuals. In the overall treatment population, \ninfluenza infection was confirmed in 67 % (range 46 % to 74 %) of the recruited patients. Of the older \nsubjects, 64 % were influenza-positive and of those with chronic cardiac and/or respiratory disease \n62 % were influenza-positive. In all phase III treatment studies, patients were recruited only during the \nperiod in which influenza was circulating in the local community.   \n \nAdults and adolescents 13 years of age and older: Patients were eligible if they reported within \n36 hours of onset of symptoms, had fever \u2265 37.8 \u221eC, accompanied by at least one respiratory symptom \n(cough, nasal symptoms or sore throat) and at least one systemic symptom (myalgia, chills/sweats, \nmalaise, fatigue or headache). In a pooled analysis of all influenza-positive adults and adolescents \n(N = 2,413) enrolled into treatment studies, oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days reduced the \nmedian duration of influenza illness by approximately one day from 5.2 days (95 % CI 4.9 \u2013 5.5 days) \nin the placebo group to 4.2 days (95 % CI 4.0 \u2013 4.4 days; p \u2264 0.0001).  \n \nThe proportion of subjects who developed specified lower respiratory tract complications (mainly \nbronchitis) treated with antibiotics was reduced from 12.7 % (135/1,063) in the placebo group to \n8.6 % (116/1,350) in the oseltamivir treated population (p = 0.0012).  \n \nTreatment of influenza in high risk populations: The median duration of influenza illness in older \nsubjects (\u2265 65 years) and in subjects with chronic cardiac and/or respiratory disease receiving \noseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days was not reduced significantly. The total duration of fever was \nreduced by one day in the groups treated with oseltamivir. In influenza-positive older people , \n\n\n\n14 \n\noseltamivir significantly reduced the incidence of specified lower respiratory tract complications \n(mainly bronchitis) treated with antibiotics from 19 % (52/268) in the placebo group to 12 % (29/250) \nin the oseltamivir treated population (p = 0.0156).  \n \nIn influenza-positive patients with chronic cardiac and/or respiratory disease, the combined incidence \nof lower respiratory tract complications (mainly bronchitis) treated with antibiotics was 17 % (22/133) \nin the placebo group and 14 % (16/118) in the oseltamivir treated population (p = 0.5976).  \n \nTreatment of influenza in pregnant women: No controlled clinical studies have been conducted on the \nuse of oseltamivir in pregnant women, however, there is evidence from post-marketing and \nretrospective observational studies showing benefit of the current dosing regimen in this patient \npopulation in terms of lower morbidity/mortality. Results from pharmacokinetic analyses indicate a \nlower exposure to the active metabolite, however dose adjustments are not recommended for pregnant \nwomen in the treatment or prophylaxis of influenza (see section 5.2, Pharmacokinetics, Special \nPopulation). \n \nTreatment of influenza in children: In a study of otherwise healthy children (65 % influenza-positive) \naged 1 to 12 years (mean age 5.3 years) who had fever (\u2265 37.8 \u00b0C) plus either cough or coryza, 67 % \nof influenza-positive patients were infected with influenza A and 33 % with influenza B. Oseltamivir \ntreatment, started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, significantly reduced the time to freedom \nfrom illness (defined as the simultaneous return to normal health and activity and alleviation of fever, \ncough and coryza) by 1.5 days (95 % CI 0.6 \u2013 2.2 days; p < 0.0001) compared to placebo. Oseltamivir \nreduced the incidence of acute otitis media from 26.5 % (53/200) in the placebo group to 16 % \n(29/183) in the oseltamivir treated children (p = 0.013). \n \nA second study was completed in 334 asthmatic children aged 6 to 12 years old of which 53.6 % were \ninfluenza-positive. In the oseltamivir treated group, the median duration of illness was not reduced \nsignificantly. By day 6 (the last day of treatment) FEV1 had increased by 10.8 % in the oseltamivir \ntreated group compared to 4.7 % on placebo (p = 0.0148) in this population. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nTamiflu in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in influenza. See section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use. \n \nThe indication in infants below the age of 1 is based upon extrapolation of efficacy data from older \nchildren and the recommended posology is based upon pharmacokinetic modelling data (see Section \n5.2). \n  \nTreatment of influenza B infection: Overall, 15 % of the influenza-positive population were infected by \ninfluenza B, proportions ranging from 1 to 33 % in individual studies. The median duration of illness \nin influenza B infected subjects did not differ significantly between the treatment groups in individual \nstudies. Data from 504 influenza B infected subjects were pooled across all studies for analysis. \nOseltamivir reduced the time to alleviation of all symptoms by 0.7 days (95 % CI 0.1 \u2013 1.6 days; \np = 0.022) and the duration of fever (\u2265 37.8 \u00b0C), cough and coryza by one day (95 % CI 0.4 \u2013 \n1.7 days; p < 0.001) compared to placebo.  \n \nTreatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients: A randomized, double blind study, to \nevaluate safety and characterize the effects of oseltamivir on the development of resistant influenza \nvirus (primary analysis) in influenza-infected immunocompromised patients, included 151 adult \npatients, 7 adolescents and 9 children evaluable for efficacy of oseltamivir (secondary analysis, not \npowered). The study included solid organ transplant [SOT] patients, haematopoietic stem cell \ntransplant [HSCT] patients, HIV positive patients with a CD4+ cell count <500 cells/mm3, patients on \nsystemic immunosuppressive therapy, and those with haematological malignancy. These patients were \nrandomized to be treated, within 96 hours of symptoms onset for a duration of 10 days. The treatment \nregimens were: standard dose (75mg or weight adjusted dose for children) twice daily (73 adult \npatients, 4 adolescent patients and 4 children) or double dose (150 mg or weight-adjusted dose for \nchildren) twice daily (78 adult patients, 3 adolescent patients and 5 children) of oseltamivir.  \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \nThe median time to resolution of symptoms (TTRS) for adults and adolescents was similar between \nthe standard dose group (103.4 hours [95% CI 75.4-122.7]) and double dose group (107.2 hours [95% \nCI 63.9-140.0]).  The TTRS for children was variable and the interpretation is limited by the small \nsample size. The proportion of adult patients with secondary infections in the standard dose group and \ndouble dose group was comparable (8.2% vs 5.1%). For adolescents and children, only one patient (an \nadolescent) in the standard dose group experienced a secondary infection (bacterial sinusitis). \n \nA pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics study was conducted in severely immunocompromised \nchildren (\u226412 years of age, n=30) receiving standard (75 mg or weight adjusted twice daily) vs. triple \ndose (225 mg or weight adjusted twice daily) oseltamivir for an adaptive dosing period of 5 to 20 days \ndependant on duration of viral shedding (mean treatment duration: 9 days). No patients in the standard \ndose group and 2 patients in the triple dose group reported secondary bacterial infections (bronchitis \nand sinusitis). \n \nPrevention of influenza \nThe efficacy of oseltamivir in preventing naturally occurring influenza illness has been demonstrated \nin a post-exposure prevention study in households and two seasonal prevention studies. The primary \nefficacy parameter for all of these studies was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza. The \nvirulence of influenza epidemics is not predictable and varies within a region and from season to \nseason, therefore the number needed to treat (NNT) in order to prevent one case of influenza illness \nvaries. \n \nPost-exposure prevention: In a study in contacts (12.6 % vaccinated against influenza) of an index \ncase of influenza, oseltamivir 75 mg once daily was started within 2 days of onset of symptoms in the \nindex case and continued for seven days. Influenza was confirmed in 163 out of 377 index cases. \nOseltamivir significantly reduced the incidence of clinical influenza illness occurring in the contacts of \nconfirmed influenza cases from 24/200 (12 %) in the placebo group to 2/205 (1 %) in the oseltamivir \ngroup (92 % reduction [95 % CI 6 \u2013 16; p \u2264 0.0001]). The number needed to treat (NNT) in contacts \nof true influenza cases was 10 (95 % CI 9 \u2013 12) and was 16 (95 % CI 15 \u2013 19) in the whole population \n(ITT) regardless of infection status in the index case.  \n \nThe efficacy of oseltamivir in preventing naturally occurring influenza illness has been demonstrated \nin a post-exposure prevention study in households that included adults, adolescents, and children aged \n1 to 12 years, both as index cases and as family contacts. The primary efficacy parameter for this study \nwas the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza in the households. Oseltamivir \nprophylaxis lasted for 10 days. In the total population, there was a reduction in the incidence of \nlaboratory-confirmed clinical influenza in households from 20 % (27/136) in the group not receiving \nprevention to 7 % (10/135) in the group receiving prevention (62.7 % reduction [95 % CI 26.0 \u2013 81.2; \np = 0.0042]). In households of influenza-infected index cases, there was a reduction in the incidence of \ninfluenza from 26 % (23/89) in the group not receiving prevention to 11 % (9/84) in the group \nreceiving prevention (58.5 % reduction [95 % CI 15.6 \u2013 79.6; p = 0.0114]). \nAccording to subgroup analysis in children at 1 to 12 years of age, the incidence of laboratory-\nconfirmed clinical influenza among children was significantly reduced from 19 % (21/111) in the \ngroup not receiving prevention to 7 % (7/104) in the group receiving prevention (64.4 % reduction \n[95 % CI 15.8 \u2013 85.0; p = 0.0188]). Among children who were not already shedding virus at baseline, \nthe incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was reduced from 21 % (15/70) in the group \nnot receiving prevention to 4 % (2/47) in the group receiving prevention (80.1 % reduction [95 % CI \n22.0 \u2013 94.9; p = 0.0206]). The NNT for the total paediatric population was 9 (95 % CI 7 \u2013 24) and \n8 (95 % CI 6, upper limit not estimable) in the whole population (ITT) and in paediatric contacts of \ninfected index cases (ITTII), respectively. \n \nPost-exposure prevention of influenza in infants less than 1 year of age during a pandemic: \nPrevention during an influenza pandemic has not been studied in controlled clinical studies in children \n0-12 months of age. See Section 5.2 for exposure simulation details. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nPrevention during an influenza epidemic in the community: In a pooled analysis of two other studies \nconducted in unvaccinated otherwise healthy adults, oseltamivir 75 mg once daily given for 6 weeks \nsignificantly reduced the incidence of clinical influenza illness from 25/519 (4.8 %) in the placebo \ngroup to 6/520 (1.2 %) in the oseltamivir group (76 % reduction [95 % CI 1.6 \u2013 5.7; p = 0.0006]) \nduring a community outbreak of influenza. The NNT in this study was 28 (95 % CI 24 \u2013 50). \nA study in older people in nursing homes, where 80 % of participants received vaccine in the season \nof the study, oseltamivir 75 mg once daily given for 6 weeks significantly reduced the incidence of \nclinical influenza illness from 12/272 (4.4 %) in the placebo group to 1/276 (0.4 %) in the oseltamivir \ngroup (92 % reduction [95 % CI 1.5 \u2013 6.6; p = 0.0015]). The NNT in this study was 25 (95 % CI 23 \u2013 \n62).  \n \nProphylaxis of influenza in immunocompromised patients: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, \nrandomised study was conducted for seasonal prophylaxis of influenza in 475 immunocompromised \npatients (388 patients with solid organ transplantation [195 placebo; 193 oseltamivir], 87 patients with \nhaemopoetic stem cell transplantation [43 placebo; 44 oseltamivir], no patient with other \nimmunosuppressant conditions), including 18 children 1 to 12 years of age. The primary endpoint in \nthis study was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza as determined by viral culture \nand/or a four-fold rise in HAI antibodies. The incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was \n2.9 % (7/238) in the placebo group and 2.1 % (5/237) in the oseltamivir group (95 % CI -2.3 % \u2013 \n4.1 %; p = 0.772). \n \nSpecific studies have not been conducted to assess the reduction in the risk of complications. \n \nOseltamivir resistance \nClinical studies: The risk of emergence of influenza viruses with reduced susceptibility or frank \nresistance to oseltamivir has been examined during Roche-sponsored clinical studies. Developing \noseltamivir-resistant virus during treatment was more frequent in children than adults, ranging from \nless than 1% in adults to 18% in infants aged below 1 year. Children who were found to carry \noseltamivir-resistant virus in general shed the virus for a prolonged period compared with subjects \nwith susceptible virus. However, treatment-emergent resistance to oseltamivir did not affect treatment \nresponse and caused no prolongation of influenza symptoms.  \n \nAn overall higher incidence of oseltamivir-resistance was observed in adult and adolescent \nimmunocompromised patients treated with standard dose or double dose of oseltamivir for a duration \nof 10 days [14.5% (10/69) in standard dose group and 2.7% (2/74) in double dose group], compared to \ndata from studies with oseltamivir-treated otherwise healthy adult and adolescent patients. The \nmajority of adult patients that developed resistance were transplant recipients (8/10 patients in the \nstandard dose group and 2/2 patients in the double dose group). Most of the patients with oseltamivir-\nresistant virus were infected with influenza type A and had prolonged viral shedding. \n \nThe incidence of oseltamivir-resistance observed in immunocompromised children (\u226412 years of age) \ntreated with Tamiflu across the two studies and evaluated for resistance was 20.7% (6/29). Of the six \nimmunocompromised children found with treatment-emergent resistance to oseltamivir, 3 patients \nreceived standard dose and 3 patients high dose (double or triple dose). The majority had acute \nlymphoid leukemia and were \u2264 5 years of age.  \n \nIncidence of Oseltamivir Resistance in Clinical Studies \n \n\nPatient Population \nPatients with Resistance Mutations (%) \n\nPhenotyping* Geno- and Phenotyping* \nAdults and adolescents 0.88% (21/2382) \n\n \n1.13% (27/2396) \n\n \nChildren (1-12 years) 4.11% (71/1726) 4.52% (78/1727) \nInfants (<1year) 18.31% (13/71) 18.31% (13/71) \n\n* Full genotyping was not performed in all studies. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nProphylaxis of Influenza \nThere has been no evidence for emergence of drug resistance associated with the use of Tamiflu in \nclinical studies conducted to date in post-exposure (7 days), post-exposure within household groups \n(10 days) and seasonal (42 days) prevention of influenza in immunocompetent patients. There was no \nresistance observed during a 12-week prophylaxis study in immunocompromised patients.  \n \nClinical and surveillance data: Natural mutations associated with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir \nin vitro have been detected in influenza A and B viruses isolated from patients without exposure to \noseltamivir. Resistant strains selected during oseltamivir treatment have been isolated from both \nimmunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. Immunocompromised patients and young \nchildren are at a higher risk of developing oseltamivir-resistant virus during treatment. \n \nOseltamivir-resistant viruses isolated from oseltamivir-treated patients and oseltamivir-resistant \nlaboratory strains of influenza viruses have been found to contain mutations in N1 and N2 \nneuraminidases. Resistance mutations tend to be viral sub-type specific. Since 2007 naturally \noccurring resistance associated with the H275Y mutation in seasonal H1N1 strains has been \nsporadically detected. The susceptibility to oseltamivir and the prevalence of such viruses appear to \nvary seasonally and geographically. In 2008, H275Y was found in > 99 % of circulating H1N1 \ninfluenza isolates in Europe. The 2009 H1N1 influenza (\u201cswine flu\u201d) was almost uniformly \nsusceptible to oseltamivir, with only sporadic reports of resistance in connection with both therapeutic \nand prophylactic regimens. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nGeneral Information \n \nAbsorption \nOseltamivir is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration of oseltamivir \nphosphate (pro-drug) and is extensively converted by predominantly hepatic esterases to the active \nmetabolite (oseltamivir carboxylate). At least 75 % of an oral dose reaches the systemic circulation as \nthe active metabolite. Exposure to the pro-drug is less than 5 % relative to the active metabolite. \nPlasma concentrations of both pro-drug and active metabolite are proportional to dose and are \nunaffected by co-administration with food. \n \nDistribution \nThe mean volume of distribution at steady state of the oseltamivir carboxylate is approximately \n23 litres in humans, a volume equivalent to extracellular body fluid. Since neuraminidase activity is \nextracellular, oseltamivir carboxylate distributes to all sites of influenza virus spread. \n \nThe binding of the oseltamivir carboxylate to human plasma protein is negligible (approximately 3 %). \n \nBiotransformation \nOseltamivir is extensively converted to oseltamivir carboxylate by esterases located predominantly in \nthe liver. In vitro studies demonstrated that neither oseltamivir nor the active metabolite is a substrate \nfor, or an inhibitor of, the major cytochrome P450 isoforms. No phase 2 conjugates of either \ncompound have been identified in vivo. \n \nElimination \nAbsorbed oseltamivir is primarily (> 90 %) eliminated by conversion to oseltamivir carboxylate. It is \nnot further metabolised and is eliminated in the urine. Peak plasma concentrations of oseltamivir \ncarboxylate decline with a half-life of 6 to 10 hours in most subjects. The active metabolite is \neliminated entirely by renal excretion. Renal clearance (18.8 l/h) exceeds glomerular filtration rate \n(7.5 l/h) indicating that tubular secretion occurs in addition to glomerular filtration. Less than 20 % of \nan oral radiolabelled dose is eliminated in faeces. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nOther special populations \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInfants less than 1 year of age:  The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of Tamiflu have \nbeen evaluated in two uncontrolled open-label studies including influenza infected children less than \none year of age (n=135). The rate of clearance of the active metabolite, corrected for body-weight, \ndecreases with ages below one year. Metabolite exposures are also more variable in the youngest \ninfants. The available data indicates that the exposure following a 3 mg/kg dose in infants 0 -\n 12 months of age provides pro-drug and metabolite exposures anticipated to be efficacious with a \nsafety profile comparable to that seen in older children and adults using the approved dose (see \nsections 4.1 and 4.2).The reported adverse events were consistent with the established safety profile in \nolder children.  \n \nThere are no data available for infants below 1 year of age for post exposure prevention of influenza. \nPrevention during an influenza epidemic in the community has not been studied in children below 12 \nyears of age. \n \nPost-exposure prevention of influenza in infants less than 1 year of age during a pandemic:  \nSimulation of once daily dosing of 3mg/kg in infants <1 year shows an exposure in the same range or \nhigher than for once daily dosing of 75 mg in adults. Exposure does not exceed that for treatment of \ninfants < 1 year (3 mg/kg twice daily) and is anticipated to result in a comparable safety profile (see \nSection 4.8). No clinical studies of prophylaxis in infants aged <1 have been performed.     \n \nInfants and children 1 year of age or older: The pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir have been evaluated \nin single-dose pharmacokinetic studies in infants, children and adolescents 1 to 16 years of age. \nMultiple-dose pharmacokinetics were studied in a small number of children enrolled in a clinical \nefficacy study. Younger children cleared both the pro-drug and its active metabolite faster than adults, \nresulting in a lower exposure for a given mg/kg dose. Doses of 2 mg/kg give oseltamivir carboxylate \nexposures comparable to those achieved in adults receiving a single 75 mg dose (approximately \n1 mg/kg). The pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir in children and adolescents 12 years of age or older are \nsimilar to those in adults. \n \nElderly \nExposure to the active metabolite at steady state was 25 to 35 % higher in older people (age 65 to 78 \nyears) compared to adults less than 65 years of age given comparable doses of oseltamivir. Half-lives \nobserved in older people were similar to those seen in young adults. On the basis of drug exposure and \ntolerability, dosage adjustments are not required for older people unless there is evidence of moderate \nor severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 60 ml /min) (see section 4.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nAdministration of 100 mg oseltamivir phosphate twice daily for 5 days to patients with various \ndegrees of renal impairment showed that exposure to oseltamivir carboxylate is inversely proportional \nto declining renal function. For dosing, see section 4.2. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn vitro studies have concluded that exposure to oseltamivir is not expected to be increased \nsignificantly nor is exposure to the active metabolite expected to be significantly decreased in patients \nwith hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n \nPregnant Women \nA pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that the Tamiflu dosage regimen described in \nSection 4.2 Posology and method of administration results in lower exposure (30% on average across \nall trimesters) to the active metabolite in pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women. The \nlower predicted exposure however, remains above inhibitoy concentrations (IC95 values) and at a \ntherapeutic level for a range of influenza virus strains. In addition, there is evidence from \n\n\n\n19 \n\nobservational studies showing benefit of the current dosing regimen in this patient population. \nTherefore, dose adjustments are not recommended for pregnant women in the treatment  \nor prophylaxis of influenza (see section 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation). \n \nImmunocompromised Patients \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that treatment of adult and paediatric (<18 years old) \nimmunocompromised patients with oseltamivir (as described in Section 4.2. Posology and method of \nadministration) results in an increased predicted exposure (from approximately 5% up to 50%) to the \nactive metabolite when compared to non-immunocompromised patients with comparable creatinine \nclearance. Due to the wide safety margin of the active metabolite, no dose adjustments are required in \npatients due to their immunocompromised status. However, for immunocompromised patients with \nrenal impairment, doses should be adjusted as outlined in section 4.2. Posology and method of \nadministration.  \n \nPharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses from two studies in immunocompromised patients \nindicated that there was no meaningful additional benefit in exposures higher than those achieved after \nthe administration of the standard dose.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity and genotoxicity. Results of the conventional rodent \ncarcinogenicity studies showed a trend towards a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of some \ntumours that are typical for the rodent strains used. Considering the margins of exposure in relation to \nthe expected exposure in the human use, these findings do not change the benefit-risk of Tamiflu in its \nadopted therapeutic indications.  \n \nTeratology studies have been conducted in rats and rabbits at doses of up to 1,500 mg/kg/day and \n500 mg/kg/day, respectively. No effects on foetal development were observed. A rat fertility study up \nto a dose of 1,500 mg/kg/day demonstrated no adverse reactions on either sex. In pre- and post-natal \nrat studies, prolonged parturition was noted at 1,500 mg/kg/day: the safety margin between human \nexposure and the highest no-effect dose (500 mg/kg/day) in rats is 480-fold for oseltamivir and 44-fold \nfor the active metabolite, respectively. Foetal exposure in the rats and rabbits was approximately 15 to \n20 % of that of the mother. \n \nIn lactating rats, oseltamivir and the active metabolite are excreted in the milk. Limited data indicate \nthat oseltamivir and the active metabolite are excreted in human milk. Extrapolation of the animal data \nprovides estimates of 0.01 mg/day and 0.3 mg/day for the respective compounds.  \n \nA potential for skin sensitisation to oseltamivir was observed in a \"maximisation\" test in guinea pigs. \nApproximately 50 % of the animals treated with the unformulated active substance showed erythema \nafter challenging the induced animals. Reversible irritancy of rabbits' eyes was detected.  \n \nWhereas very high oral single doses of oseltamivir phosphate salt, up to the highest dose tested \n(1,310 mg/kg), had no adverse reactions in adult rats, such doses resulted in toxicity in juvenile 7-day-\nold rat pups, including death.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTamiflu 6 mg/ml powder for oral suspension \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml of reconstituted suspension contains oseltamivir phosphate equivalent to 6 mg of oseltamivir. \nOne bottle of reconstituted suspension (65 ml) contains 390 mg of oseltamivir. \n \nExcipients with known effect: \n5 ml oseltamivir suspension delivers 0.9 g of sorbitol. \n7.5 ml oseltamivir suspension delivers 1.3 g of sorbitol. \n10 ml oseltamivir suspension delivers 1.7 g of sorbitol. \n12.5 ml oseltamivir suspension delivers 2.1 g of sorbitol. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for oral suspension \nThe powder is a granulate or clumped granulate with a white to light yellow colour. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of influenza \nTamiflu is indicated in adults and children including full term neonates who present with symptoms \ntypical of influenza, when influenza virus is circulating in the community. Efficacy has been \ndemonstrated when treatment is initiated within two days of first onset of symptoms.  \n \nPrevention of influenza  \n- Post-exposure prevention in individuals 1 year of age or older following contact with a \n\nclinically diagnosed influenza case when influenza virus is circulating in the community. \n \n- The appropriate use of Tamiflu for prevention of influenza should be determined on a case by \n\ncase basis by the circumstances and the population requiring protection. In exceptional \nsituations (e.g. in case of a mismatch between the circulating and vaccine virus strains, and a \npandemic situation) seasonal prevention could be considered in individuals one year of age or \nolder.  \n\n \n- Tamiflu is indicated for post-exposure prevention of influenza in infants less than 1 year of age \n\nduring a pandemic influenza outbreak (see section 5.2). \n \nTamiflu is not a substitute for influenza vaccination. \n \nThe use of antivirals for the treatment and prevention of influenza should be determined on the basis \nof official recommendations. Decisions regarding the use of oseltamivir for treatment and prophylaxis \nshould take into consideration what is known about the characteristics of the circulating influenza \nviruses, available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns for each season and the impact \nof the disease in different geographical areas and patient populations (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nTamiflu suspension and Tamiflu hard capsules are bioequivalent formulations. 75 mg doses can be \nadministered as either  \n- one 75 mg capsule or  \n- one 30 mg capsule plus one 45 mg capsule or  \n- by administering one 30 mg dose plus one 45 mg dose of suspension.  \n \nAdults, adolescents or children (> 40 kg) who are able to swallow capsules may receive appropriate \ndoses of Tamiflu capsules.  \n \nTreatment \nTreatment should be initiated as soon as possible within the first two days of onset of symptoms of \ninfluenza.  \n \nFor adolescents (13 to 17 years of age) and adults: The recommended oral dose is 75 mg oseltamivir \ntwice daily for 5 days (or 10 days in immunocompromised patients). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nFor infants and children1 year of age or older: The recommended dose of Tamiflu 6 mg/ml oral \nsuspension is indicated in the table below. Tamiflu 30 mg and 45 mg capsules are available as an \nalternative to the recommended dose of Tamiflu 6 mg/ml suspension.  \n \nThe following weight-adjusted dosing regimens are recommended for infants and children 1 year of \nage or older: \n \n\nBody weight \nRecommended dose for \n\n5 days \n\nRecommended dose for \n10 days* \n\nImmunocompromised \nPatients \n\nAmount of oral \nsuspension to withdraw \n\n10 kg to 15 kg 30 mg twice daily 30 mg twice daily 5 ml twice daily \n> 15 kg to 23 kg 45 mg twice daily 45 mg twice daily 7.5 ml twice daily \n> 23 kg to 40 kg 60 mg twice daily 60 mg twice daily 10 ml twice daily \n> 40 kg 75 mg twice daily 75 mg twice daily 12.5 ml twice daily \n\n*The recommended duration in immunocompromised patients (\u22651 year old) is 10 days.  See Special Populations, \nImmunocompromised Patients for more information. \n \nChildren weighing > 40 kg and who are able to swallow capsules may receive treatment with the adult \ndosage of 75 mg capsules twice daily for 5 days as an alternative to the recommended dose of Tamiflu \nsuspension. \n \nFor infants less than 1 year of age: The recommended treatment dose for infants 0 - 12 months of age \nis 3 mg/kg twice daily. This is based upon pharmacokinetic and safety data indicating that this dose in \ninfants 0 - 12 months provides plasma concentrations of the pro-drug and active metabolite that are \nanticipated to be clinically efficacious with a safety profile comparable to that seen in older children \nand adults (see section 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nA 3 ml oral dispenser (graduated in 0.1 ml steps) should be used for dosing children 0 - 12 months of \nage requiring 1 ml to 3 ml of Tamiflu 6 mg/ml oral suspension. For higher doses the 10 ml syringe \nshould be used.

Insufficient data are available for these patients, in whom different dosing may \nbe required due to the immaturity of physiological functions. \n \nPrevention \nPost-exposure prevention \nFor adolescents (13 to 17 years of age) and adults: The recommended dose for prevention of influenza \nfollowing close contact with an infected individual is 75 mg oseltamivir once daily for 10 days. \nTherapy should begin as soon as possible within two days of exposure to an infected individual.  \n \nFor infants and children 1 year of age or older: Tamiflu 30 mg and 45 mg capsules are available as an \nalternative to the recommended dose of Tamiflu 6 mg/ml suspension.  \n \nThe recommended post-exposure prevention dose of Tamiflu is: \n \n\nBody weight Recommended dose for \n10 days \n\nImmunocompromised \nPatients  \n\nRecommended dose for \n10 days \n\n \n\nAmount of oral \nsuspension to withdraw   \n\n10 kg to 15 kg 30 mg once daily 30 mg once daily 5 ml once daily \n> 15 kg to 23 kg 45 mg once daily 45 mg once daily 7.5 ml once daily \n> 23 kg to 40 kg 60 mg once daily 60 mg once daily 10 ml once daily \n> 40 kg 75 mg once daily 75 mg once daily 12.5 ml once daily \n\n \nChildren weighing > 40 kg and who are able to swallow capsules may receive prophylaxis with a \n75 mg capsule once daily for 10 days as an alternative to the recommended dose of Tamiflu \nsuspension. \n \nFor infants less than 1 year of age: The recommended prophylaxis dose for infants less than 12 months \nduring a pandemic influenza outbreak is half of the daily treatment dose. This is based upon clinical \n\n\n\n32 \n\ndata in children > 1 year of age and adults showing that a prophylaxis dose equivalent to half the daily \ntreatment dose is clinically efficacious for the prevention of influenza (see Section 5.2 for exposure \nsimulation).  \n \nIn case of a pandemic, a 3 ml oral dispenser (graduated in 0.1 ml steps) should be used for dosing \nchildren below 1 year of age requiring 1 ml to 3 ml of Tamiflu 6 mg/ml oral suspension. For higher \ndoses the 10 ml syringe should be used.   \n \nThe following dosing regimen is recommended for infants less than 1 year of age: \n \nDosing table of oseltamivir for children below one year of age: 3 mg/kg once daily \n \n\nBody \nWeight*  \n\nRecommended dose \nfor 10 days \n\nImmunocompromised \nPatients  \n\nRecommended dose for 10 \ndays \n\n \n\nAmount of oral \nsuspension to \n\nwithdraw \n\nDispenser size \nto use \n\n3 kg 9 mg once daily 9 mg once daily 1.5 ml once daily 3 ml \n3.5 kg 10.5 mg once daily 10.5 mg once daily 1.8 ml once daily 3 ml \n4 kg 12 mg once daily 12 mg once daily 2.0 ml once daily 3 ml \n\n4.5 kg 13.5 mg once daily 13.5 mg once daily 2.3 ml once daily 3 ml \n5 kg 15 mg once daily 15 mg once daily 2.5 ml once daily 3 ml \n\n5.5 kg 16.5 mg once daily 16.5 mg once daily 2.8 ml once daily 3 ml \n6 kg 18 mg once daily 18 mg once daily 3.0 ml once daily 3 ml \n\n> 6 - 7 kg 21 mg once daily 21 mg once daily 3.5 ml once daily 10 ml \n> 7 - 8 kg 24 mg once daily 24 mg once daily 4.0 ml once daily 10 ml \n> 8 - 9 kg 27 mg once daily 27 mg once daily 4.5 ml once daily 10 ml \n\n> 9 - 10 kg 30 mg once daily 30 mg once daily 5.0 ml once daily  10 ml \n* This table is not intended to contain all possible weights for this population.  \n \nThis dosing recommendation is not intended for premature infants, i.e. those with a post-conceptual \nage less than 36 weeks. Insufficient data are available for these patients, in whom different dosing may \nbe required due to the immaturity of physiological functions. \n \nPrevention during an influenza epidemic in the community \nPrevention during an influenza epidemic has not been studied in children below 12 years of age. The \nrecommended dose for adults and adolescents for prevention of influenza during a community \noutbreak is 75 mg oseltamivir once daily for up to 6 weeks (or up to 12 weeks in \nimmunocompromised patients).  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required either for treatment or for prevention in patients with hepatic \ndysfunction. No studies have been carried out in paediatric patients with hepatic disorder. \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nRenal impairment  \nTreatment of influenza: Dose adjustment is recommended for adults and adolescents (13 to 17 years of \nage) with moderate or severe renal impairment. Recommended doses are detailed in the table below. \n \n\nCreatinine clearance  Recommended dose for treatment \n> 60 (ml/min) 75 mg twice daily \n\n> 30 to 60 (ml/min) 30 mg (suspension or capsules) twice daily \n> 10 to 30 (ml/min) 30 mg (suspension or capsules) once daily \n\n\u00a3 10 (ml/min)  Not recommended (no data available) \nHaemodialysis patients 30 mg after each haemodialysis session \n\nPeritoneal dialysis patients* 30 mg (suspension or capsules) single dose \n* Data derived from studies in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients; the clearance of \n\noseltamivir carboxylate is expected to be higher when automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) mode is used. \nTreatment mode can be switched from APD to CAPD if considered necessary by a nephrologist. \n\n \nPrevention of influenza: Dose adjustment is recommended for adults and adolescents (13 to 17 years \nof age) with moderate or severe renal impairment as detailed in the table below. \n \n\nCreatinine clearance  Recommended dose for prevention \n> 60 (ml/min) 75 mg once daily \n\n> 30 to 60 (ml/min) 30 mg (suspension or capsules) once daily \n> 10 to 30 (ml/min) 30 mg (suspension or capsules) every second day \n\n\u00a3 10 (ml/min)  Not recommended (no data available) \nHaemodialysis patients 30 mg after every second haemodialysis session \n\nPeritoneal dialysis patients* 30 mg (suspension or capsules) once weekly \n* Data derived from studies in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients; the clearance of \n\noseltamivir carboxylate is expected to be higher when automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) mode is used. \nTreatment mode can be switched from APD to CAPD if considered necessary by a nephrologist. \n\n \nThere is insufficient clinical data available in infants and children (12 years of age and younger) with \nrenal impairment to be able to make any dosing recommendation. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required, unless there is evidence of moderate or severe renal impairment. \n \nImmunocompromised patients  \nTreatment:   For treatment of influenza, the recommended duration for immunocompromised patients \nis 10 days (see sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1).  No dose adjustment is necessary. Treatment should be initiated \nas soon as possible within the first two days of onset of symptoms of influenza. \n \nSeasonal prophylaxis: Longer duration of seasonal prophylaxis up to 12 weeks has been evaluated in \nimmunocompromised patients (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nMethod of administration \nFor dosing, a 3 ml and 10 ml oral dispenser is provided in the box.  \nIt is recommended that Tamiflu powder for oral suspension be constituted by a pharmacist prior to \ndispensing to the patient (see section 6.6). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nOseltamivir is effective only against illness caused by influenza viruses. There is no evidence for \nefficacy of oseltamivir in any illness caused by agents other than influenza viruses (see section 5.1).  \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nTamiflu is not a substitute for influenza vaccination. Use of Tamiflu must not affect the evaluation of \nindividuals for annual influenza vaccination. The protection against influenza lasts only as long as \nTamiflu is administered. Tamiflu should be used for the treatment and prevention of influenza only \nwhen reliable epidemiological data indicate that influenza virus is circulating in the community. \nSusceptibility of circulating influenza virus strains to oseltamivir has been shown to be highly variable \n(see section 5.1). Therefore, prescribers should take into account the most recent information available \non oseltamivir susceptibility patterns of the currently circulating viruses when deciding whether to use \nTamiflu. \n \nSevere concomitant condition \nNo information is available regarding the safety and efficacy of oseltamivir in patients with any \nmedical condition sufficiently severe or unstable to be considered at imminent risk of requiring \nhospitalisation.  \n \nImmunocompromised patients \nThe efficacy of oseltamivir in either treatment or prophylaxis of influenza in immunocompromised \npatients has not been firmly established(see section 5.1).  \n \nCardiac / respiratory disease \nEfficacy of oseltamivir in the treatment of subjects with chronic cardiac disease and/or respiratory \ndisease has not been established. No difference in the incidence of complications was observed \nbetween the treatment and placebo groups in this population (see section 5.1). \n \nPaediatric population \nNo data allowing a dose recommendation for premature children (<36 weeks post-conceptual age) are \ncurrently available. \n \nSevere renal impairment \nDose adjustment is recommended for both treatment and prevention in adolescents (13 to 17 years of \nage) and adults with severe renal impairment. There is insufficient clinical data available in infants and \nchildren (1 year of age or older) with renal impairment to be able to make any dosing recommendation \n(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nNeuropsychiatric events \nNeuropsychiatric events have been reported during administration of Tamiflu in patients with \ninfluenza, especially in children and adolescents. These events are also experienced by patients with \ninfluenza without oseltamivir administration. Patients should be closely monitored for behavioural \nchanges, and the benefits and risks of continuing treatment should be carefully evaluated for each \npatient (see section 4.8). \n \nThis medicinal product contains sorbitol. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance \nshould not take this medicine. \nSorbitol can have a mild laxative effect. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPharmacokinetic properties of oseltamivir, such as low protein binding and metabolism independent of \nthe CYP450 and glucuronidase systems (see section 5.2), suggest that clinically significant drug \ninteractions via these mechanisms are unlikely. \n \nProbenecid \nNo dose adjustment is required when co-administering with probenecid in patients with normal renal \nfunction. Co-administration of probenecid, a potent inhibitor of the anionic pathway of renal tubular \nsecretion, results in an approximate 2-fold increase in exposure to the active metabolite of oseltamivir.  \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nAmoxicillin \nOseltamivir has no kinetic interaction with amoxicillin, which is eliminated via the same pathway, \nsuggesting that oseltamivir interaction with this pathway is weak.  \n \nRenal elimination \nClinically important drug interactions involving competition for renal tubular secretion are unlikely, \ndue to the known safety margin for most of these substances, the elimination characteristics of the \nactive metabolite (glomerular filtration and anionic tubular secretion) and the excretion capacity of \nthese pathways. However, care should be taken when prescribing oseltamivir in subjects when taking \nco-excreted agents with a narrow therapeutic margin (e.g. chlorpropamide, methotrexate, \nphenylbutazone). \n \nAdditional information \nNo pharmacokinetic interactions between oseltamivir or its major metabolite have been observed \nwhen co-administering oseltamivir with paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid, cimetidine, antacids \n(magnesium and aluminium hydroxides and calcium carbonates), rimantadine or warfarin (in subjects \nstable on warfarin and without influenza). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nInfluenza is associated with adverse pregnancy and foetal outcomes, with a risk of major congenital \nmalformations, including congenital heart defects. A large amount of data on oseltamivir exposure of \npregnant women from post-marketing reports and observational studies (more than 1000 exposed \noutcomes during the first trimester) indicate no malformative nor feto/neonatal toxicity by oseltamivir.  \n \nHowever, in one observational study, while the overall malformation risk was not increased, the \nresults for major congenital heart defects diagnosed within 12 months of birth were not conclusive. In \nthis study, the rate of major congenital heart defects following oseltamivir exposure during the first \ntrimester was 1.76% (7 infants out of 397 pregnancies) compared to 1.01% in unexposed pregnancies \nfrom the general population (Odds Ratio 1.75, 95% Confidence Interval 0.51 to 5.98). The clinical \nsignificance of this finding is not clear, as the study had limited power. Additionally, this study was \ntoo small to reliably assess individual types of major malformations; moreover women exposed to \noseltamivir and women unexposed could not be made fully comparable, in particular whether or not \nthey had influenza. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nThe use of Tamiflu may be considered during pregnancy if necessary and after considering the \navailable safety and benefit information (for data on benefit in pregnant women please refer to section \n5.1 \u201cTreatment of influenza in pregnant women\u201d), and the pathogenicity of the circulating influenza \nvirus strain. \n \nBreastfeeding \nIn lactating rats, oseltamivir and the active metabolite are excreted in milk. Very limited information is \navailable on children breast-fed by mothers taking oseltamivir and on excretion of oseltamivir in \nbreast milk. Limited data demonstrated that oseltamivir and the active metabolite were detected in \nbreast milk, however the levels were low, which would result in a subtherapeutic dose to the infant. \nConsidering this information, the pathogenicity of the circulating influenza virus strain and the \nunderlying condition of the breastfeeding woman, administration of oseltamivir may be considered, \nwhere there are clear potential benefits to breastfeeding mothers. \n \nFertility \nBased on preclinical data, there is no evidence that Tamiflu has an effect on male or female fertility \n(see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTamiflu has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe overall safety profile of Tamiflu is based on data from 6049 adult/adolescent and 1473 paediatric \npatients treated with Tamiflu or placebo for influenza, and on data from 3990 adult/adolescent and 253 \npaediatric patients receiving Tamiflu or placebo/no treatment for the prophylaxis of influenza in \nclinical trials. In addition, 245 immunocompromised patients (including 7 adolescents and 39 children) \nreceived Tamiflu for the treatment of influenza and 475 immunocompromised patients (including 18 \nchildren, of these 10 Tamiflu and 8 placebo) received Tamiflu or placebo for the prophylaxis of \ninfluenza. \n \nIn adults/adolescents, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (ARs) were nausea and vomiting \nin the treatment studies, and nausea in the prevention studies. The majority of these ARs were reported \non a single occasion on either the first or second treatment day and resolved spontaneously within 1-2 \ndays. In children, the most commonly reported adverse reaction was vomiting. In the majority of \npatients, these ARs did not lead to discontinuation of Tamiflu. \n \nThe following serious adverse reactions have been rarely reported since oseltamivir has been \nmarketed: Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions, hepatic disorders (fulminant hepatitis, hepatic \nfunction disorder and jaundice), angioneurotic oedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic \nepidermal necrolysis, gastrointestinal bleeding and neuropsychiatric disorders.  \n(Regarding neuropsychiatric disorders, see section 4.4.) \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe ARs listed in the tables below fall into the following categories: Very common (\u2265 1/10), common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), and very rare \n(< 1/10,000). ARs are added to the appropriate category in the tables according to the pooled analysis \nfrom clinical studies.  \n \nTreatment and prevention of influenza in adults and adolescents:  \nIn adult/adolescent treatment and prevention studies, ARs that occurred the most frequently at the \nrecommended dose (75  mg bid for 5  days for treatment and 75  mg od for up to 6  weeks for \nprophylaxis) are shown in Table 1. \n \nThe safety profile reported in subjects who received the recommended dose of Tamiflu for prophylaxis \n(75 mg once daily for up to 6 weeks) was qualitatively similar to that seen in the treatment studies, \ndespite a longer duration of dosing in the prophylaxis studies. \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nTable 1 Adverse reactions in studies investigating Tamiflu for treatment and prevention of \ninfluenza in adults and adolescents or through post-marketing surveillance \n\n \nSystem Organ \nClass (SOC) \n\nAdverse reactions according to frequency \nVery common Common Uncommon Rare \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n Bronchitis, \nHerpes simplex, \nNasopharyngitis, \nUpper respiratory \ntract infections, \nSinusitis \n\n  \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n   Thrombocytopenia \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity \nreaction \n\nAnaphylactic \nreactions, \nAnaphylactoid \nreactions \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n   Agitation,  \nAbnormal behaviour, \nAnxiety,  \nConfusion, \nDelusions, Delirium, \nHallucination, \nNightmares,  \nSelf-injury \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache Insomnia Altered level of \nconsciousness, \nConvulsion \n\n \n\nEye disorders    Visual disturbance \nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n  Cardiac \narrhythmia \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Cough,  \nSore throat, \nRhinorrhea \n\n  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea Vomiting  \nAbdominal pain \n(incl. upper \nabdominal pain), \nDyspepsia \n\n Gastrointestinal \nbleedings, \nHaemorrhagic \ncolitis \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n  Elevated liver \nenzymes \n\nFulminant hepatitis, \nHepatic failure, \nHepatitis \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Eczema, \nDermatitis,  \nRash,  \nUrticaria \n\nAngioneurotic \noedema,  \nErythema \nmultiforme, \nStevens-Johnson \nsyndrome,  \nToxic epidermal \nnecrolysis \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\n Pain  \nDizziness (incl. \nvertigo),  \nFatigue, \nPyrexia, \nPain in limb \n\n  \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \nTreatment and prevention of influenza in children:  \n \nA total of 1473 children (including otherwise healthy children aged 1-12 years old and asthmatic \nchildren aged 6-12 years old) participated in clinical studies of oseltamivir given for the treatment of \ninfluenza.

A total of 158 \nchildren received the recommended dose of Tamiflu once daily in a post-exposure prophylaxis study \nin households (n = 99), a 6-week paediatric seasonal prophylaxis study (n = 49) and a 12-week \npaediatric seasonal prophylaxis study in immunocompromised subjects (n = 10). \n \nTable 2 shows the most frequently reported ARs from paediatric clinical trials.  \n \nTable 2 Adverse reactions in studies investigating Tamiflu for treatment and prevention of \n\ninfluenza in children (age/weight-based dosing [30 mg to 75 mg o.d.]) \n \nSystem Organ \nClass (SOC) \n\nAdverse reactions according to frequency \nVery common Common Uncommon Rare \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n Otitis media, \n \n\n  \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n Headache   \n\nEye disorders:  Conjunctivitis \n(including red \neyes, eye \ndischarge and eye \npain) \n\n  \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders: \n\n Earache Tympanic membrane \ndisorder \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\nCough,  \nNasal congestion \n\nRhinorrhoea   \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nVomiting Abdominal pain \n(incl. upper \nabdominal pain), \nDyspepsia, \nNausea  \n\n  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Dermatitis (including \nallergic and atopic \ndermatitis) \n\n \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nPsychiatric disorders and nervous system disorders \nInfluenza can be associated with a variety of neurologic and behavioural symptoms which can include \nevents such as hallucinations, delirium, and abnormal behaviour, in some cases resulting in fatal \noutcomes. These events may occur in the setting of encephalitis or encephalopathy but can occur \nwithout obvious severe disease. \n \nIn patients with influenza who were receiving Tamiflu, there have been postmarketing reports of \nconvulsions and delirium (including symptoms such as altered level of consciousness, confusion, \nabnormal behaviour, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, nightmares), in a very few cases \nresulting in self-injury or fatal outcomes. These events were reported primarily among paediatric and \nadolescent patients and often had an abrupt onset and rapid resolution. The contribution of Tamiflu to \nthose events is unknown. Such neuropsychiatric events have also been reported in patients with \ninfluenza who were not taking Tamiflu. \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \nHepato-biliary disorders \nHepato-biliary system disorders, including hepatitis and elevated liver enzymes in patients with \ninfluenza-like illness. These cases include fatal fulminant hepatitis/hepatic failure. \n \nOther special populations \n \nPaediatric population (infants less than one year of age) \nIn two studies to characterise the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety profile of \noseltamivir therapy in 135 influenza infected children less than one year of age, the safety profile was \nsimilar among age cohorts with vomiting, diarrohea and diaper rash being the most frequently reported \nadverse events (see section 5.2). Insufficient data are available for infants who have a post-conceptual \nage of less than 36 weeks. \n \nSafety information available on oseltamivir administered for treatment of influenza in infants less than \none year of age from prospective and retrospective observational studies (comprising together more \nthan 2,400 infants of that age class), epidemiological databases research and postmarketing reports \nsuggest that the safety profile in infants less than one year of age is similar to the established safety \nprofile of children aged one year and older. \n \nOlder people and patients with chronic cardiac and/or respiratory disease \nThe population included in the influenza treatment studies is comprised of otherwise healthy \nadults/adolescents and patients \u201cat risk\u201d (patients at higher risk of developing complications associated \nwith influenza, e.g. older people and patients with chronic cardiac or respiratory disease). In general, \nthe safety profile in the patients \u201cat risk\u201d was qualitatively similar to that in otherwise healthy \nadults/adolescents. \n \nImmunocompromised patients \n \nThe treatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients were evaluated in two studies receiving \nstandard dose or high dose regimens (double dose or triple dose) of Tamiflu (see section 5.1). The \nsafety profile of Tamiflu observed in these studies was consistent with that observed in previous \nclinical trials where Tamiflu was administered for treatment of influenza in non-immunocompromised \npatients across all age groups (otherwise healthy patients or \u201cat risk\u201d patients [i.e., those with \nrespiratory and/or cardiac co-morbidities]). The most frequent adverse reaction reported in \nimmunocompromised children was vomiting (28%).  \n \nIn a 12-week prophylaxis study in 475 immunocompromised patients, including 18 children 1 to \n12 years of age and older, the safety profile in the 238 patients who received oseltamivir was \nconsistent with that previously observed in Tamiflu prophylaxis clinical studies. \n \nChildren with pre-existing bronchial asthma \nIn general, the adverse reaction profile in children with pre-existing bronchial asthma was qualitatively \nsimilar to that of otherwise healthy children. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nReports of overdoses with Tamiflu have been received from clinical trials and during post-marketing \nexperience. In the majority of cases reporting overdose, no adverse events were reported. \n \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n40 \n\nAdverse events reported following overdose were similar in nature and distribution to those observed \nwith therapeutic doses of Tamiflu, described in section 4.8 Undesirable effects. \n \nNo specific antidote is known. \n \nPaediatric population \nOverdose has been reported more frequently for children than adults and adolescents. Caution should \nbe exercised when preparing Tamiflu oral suspension and when administering Tamiflu products to \nchildren. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, neuraminidase inhibitors ATC code: \nJ05AH02 \n \nOseltamivir phosphate is a pro-drug of the active metabolite (oseltamivir carboxylate). The active \nmetabolite is a selective inhibitor of influenza virus neuraminidase enzymes, which are glycoproteins \nfound on the virion surface. Viral neuraminidase enzyme activity is important both for viral entry into \nuninfected cells and for the release of recently formed virus particles from infected cells, and for the \nfurther spread of infectious virus in the body. \n \nOseltamivir carboxylate inhibits influenza A and B neuraminidases in vitro. Oseltamivir phosphate \ninhibits influenza virus infection and replication in vitro. Oseltamivir given orally inhibits influenza A \nand B virus replication and pathogenicity in vivo in animal models of influenza infection at antiviral \nexposures similar to that achieved in man with 75 mg twice daily. \n \nAntiviral activity of oseltamivir was supported for influenza A and B by experimental challenge \nstudies in healthy volunteers.  \n \nNeuraminidase enzyme IC50 values for oseltamivir for clinically isolated influenza A ranged from \n0.1 nM to 1.3 nM, and for influenza B was 2.6 nM. Higher IC50 values for influenza B, up to a \nmedian of 8.5 nM, have been observed in published studies. \n \nClinical studies \nTreatment of influenza infection \nThe indication is based on clinical studies of naturally occurring influenza in which the predominant \ninfection was influenza A.Oseltamivir is effective only against illnesses caused by influenza virus. \nStatistical analyses are therefore presented only for influenza-infected subjects. In the pooled \ntreatment study population, which included both influenza-positive and -negative subjects (ITT), \nprimary efficacy was reduced proportionally to the number of influenza-negative individuals. In the \noverall treatment population, influenza infection was confirmed in 67 % (range 46 % to 74 %) of the \nrecruited patients. Of the older subjects, 64 % were influenza-positive and of those with chronic \ncardiac and/or respiratory disease 62 % were influenza-positive. In all phase III treatment studies, \npatients were recruited only during the period in which influenza was circulating in the local \ncommunity.  \n \nAdults and adolescents 13 years of age and older: Patients were eligible if they reported within \n36 hours of onset of symptoms, had fever \u2265 37.8 \u221eC, accompanied by at least one respiratory symptom \n(cough, nasal symptoms or sore throat) and at least one systemic symptom (myalgia, chills/sweats, \nmalaise, fatigue or headache). In a pooled analysis of all influenza-positive adults and adolescents \n(N = 2,413) enrolled into treatment studies, oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days reduced the \nmedian duration of influenza illness by approximately one day from 5.2 days (95 % CI 4.9 \u2013 5.5 days) \nin the placebo group to 4.2 days (95 % CI 4.0 \u2013 4.4 days; p \u2264 0.0001).  \n \n\n\n\n41 \n\nThe proportion of subjects who developed specified lower respiratory tract complications (mainly \nbronchitis) treated with antibiotics was reduced from 12.7 % (135/1,063) in the placebo group to \n8.6 % (116/1,350) in the oseltamivir treated population (p = 0.0012).  \n \nTreatment of influenza in high risk populations: The median duration of influenza illness in older \nsubjects (\u2265 65 years) and in subjects with chronic cardiac and/or respiratory disease receiving \noseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days was not reduced significantly. The total duration of fever was \nreduced by one day in the groups treated with oseltamivir. In  influenza-positive older people, \noseltamivir significantly reduced the incidence of specified lower respiratory tract complications \n(mainly bronchitis) treated with antibiotics from 19 % (52/268) in the placebo group to 12 % (29/250) \nin the oseltamivir treated population (p = 0.0156).  \n \nIn influenza-positive patients with chronic cardiac and/or respiratory disease, the combined incidence \nof lower respiratory tract complications (mainly bronchitis) treated with antibiotics was 17 % (22/133) \nin the placebo group and 14 % (16/118) in the oseltamivir treated population (p = 0.5976).  \n \nTreatment of influenza in pregnant women: No controlled clinical studies have been conducted on the \nuse of oseltamivir in pregnant women, however, there is evidence from post-marketing and \nretrospective observational studies showing benefit of the current dosing regimen in this patient \npopulation in terms of lower morbidity/mortality. Results from pharmacokinetic analyses indicate a \nlower exposure to the active metabolite, however dose adjustments are not recommended for pregnant \nwomen in the treatment or prophylaxis of influenza (see section 5.2, Pharmacokinetics, Special \nPopulation). \n \nTreatment of influenza in children: In a study of otherwise healthy children (65 % influenza-positive) \naged 1 to 12 years (mean age 5.3 years) who had fever (\u2265 37.8 \u00b0C) plus either cough or coryza, 67 % \nof influenza-positive patients were infected with influenza A and 33 % with influenza B. Oseltamivir \ntreatment, started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, significantly reduced the time to freedom \nfrom illness (defined as the simultaneous return to normal health and activity and alleviation of fever, \ncough and coryza) by 1.5 days (95 % CI 0.6 \u2013 2.2 days; p < 0.0001) compared to placebo. Oseltamivir \nreduced the incidence of acute otitis media from 26.5 % (53/200) in the placebo group to 16 % \n(29/183) in the oseltamivir treated children (p = 0.013). \n \nA second study was completed in 334 asthmatic children aged 6 to 12 years old of which 53.6 % were \ninfluenza-positive. In the oseltamivir treated group, the median duration of illness was not reduced \nsignificantly. By day 6 (the last day of treatment) FEV1 had increased by 10.8 % in the oseltamivir \ntreated group compared to 4.7 % on placebo (p = 0.0148) in this population. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nTamiflu in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in influenza. See section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use. \nThe indication in infants below the age of 1 is based upon extrapolation of efficacy data from older \nchildren and the recommended posology is based upon pharmacokinetic modelling data (see Section \n5.2). \n \nTreatment of influenza B infection: Overall, 15 % of the influenza-positive population were infected by \ninfluenza B, proportions ranging from 1 to 33 % in individual studies. The median duration of illness \nin influenza B infected subjects did not differ significantly between the treatment groups in individual \nstudies. Data from 504 influenza B infected subjects were pooled across all studies for analysis. \nOseltamivir reduced the time to alleviation of all symptoms by 0.7 days (95 % CI 0.1 \u2013 1.6 days; \np = 0.022) and the duration of fever (\u2265 37.8 \u00b0C), cough and coryza by one day (95 % CI 0.4 \u2013 \n1.7 days; p < 0.001) compared to placebo.  \n \nTreatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients: A randomized, double blind study, to \nevaluate safety and characterize the effects of oseltamivir on the development of resistant influenza \nvirus (primary analysis) in influenza-infected immunocompromised patients, included 151 adult \npatients, 7 adolescents and 9 children evaluable for efficacy of oseltamivir (secondary analysis, not \n\n\n\n42 \n\npowered). The study included solid organ transplant [SOT] patients, haematopoietic stem cell \ntransplant [HSCT] patients, HIV positive patients with a CD4+ cell count <500 cells/mm3, patients on \nsystemic immunosuppressive therapy, and those with haematological malignancy. These patients were \nrandomized to be treated, within 96 hours of symptoms onset for a duration of 10 days. The treatment \nregimens were: standard dose (75mg or weight-adjusted dose for children) twice daily (73 adult \npatients, 4 adolescent patients and 4 children) or double dose (150mg or weight-adjusted dose for \nchildren) twice daily (78 adult patients, 3 adolescent patients and 5 children) of oseltamivir.  \n \nThe median time to resolution of symptoms (TTRS) for adults and adolescents was similar between \nthe standard dose group (103.4 hours [95% CI 75.4-122.7]) and double dose group (107.2 hours [95% \nCI 63.9-140.0]).  The TTRS for children was variable and the interpretation is limited by the small \nsample size.The proportion of adult patients with secondary infections in the standard dose group and \ndouble dose group was comparable (8.2% vs 5.1%). For adolescents and children, only one patient (an \nadolescent) in the standard dose group experienced a secondary infection (bacterial sinusitis). \n \nA pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics study was conducted in severely immunocompromised \nchildren (\u226412 years of age, n=30) receiving standard (75mg or weight adjusted twice daily) vs. triple \ndose (225mg or weight-adjusted dose twice daily) oseltamivir for an adaptive dosing period of 5 to 20 \ndays dependent on duration of viral shedding (mean treatment duration: 9 days). No patients in the \nstandard dose group and 2 patients in the triple dose group reported secondary bacterial infections \n(bronchitis and sinusitis). \n \nPrevention of influenza \nThe efficacy of oseltamivir in preventing naturally occurring influenza illness has been demonstrated \nin a post-exposure prevention study in households and two seasonal prevention studies. The primary \nefficacy parameter for all of these studies was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza. The \nvirulence of influenza epidemics is not predictable and varies within a region and from season to \nseason, therefore the number needed to treat (NNT) in order to prevent one case of influenza illness \nvaries. \n \nPost-exposure prevention: In a study in contacts (12.6 % vaccinated against influenza) of an index \ncase of influenza, oseltamivir 75 mg once daily was started within 2 days of onset of symptoms in the \nindex case and continued for seven days. Influenza was confirmed in 163 out of 377 index cases. \nOseltamivir significantly reduced the incidence of clinical influenza illness occurring in the contacts of \nconfirmed influenza cases from 24/200 (12 %) in the placebo group to 2/205 (1 %) in the oseltamivir \ngroup (92 % reduction [95 % CI 6 \u2013 16; p \u2264 0.0001]). The number needed to treat (NNT) in contacts \nof true influenza cases was 10 (95 % CI 9 \u2013 12) and was 16 (95 % CI 15 \u2013 19) in the whole population \n(ITT) regardless of infection status in the index case.  \n \nThe efficacy of oseltamivir in preventing naturally occurring influenza illness has been demonstrated \nin a post-exposure prevention study in households that included adults, adolescents, and children aged \n1 to 12 years, both as index cases and as family contacts. The primary efficacy parameter for this study \nwas the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza in the households. Oseltamivir \nprophylaxis lasted for 10 days. In the total population, there was a reduction in the incidence of \nlaboratory-confirmed clinical influenza in households from 20 % (27/136) in the group not receiving \nprevention to 7 % (10/135) in the group receiving prevention (62.7 % reduction [95 % CI 26.0 \u2013 81.2; \np = 0.0042]). In households of influenza-infected index cases, there was a reduction in the incidence of \ninfluenza from 26 % (23/89) in the group not receiving prevention to 11 % (9/84) in the group \nreceiving prevention (58.5 % reduction [95 % CI 15.6 \u2013 79.6; p = 0.0114]). \nAccording to subgroup analysis in children at 1 to 12 years of age, the incidence of laboratory-\nconfirmed clinical influenza among children was significantly reduced from 19 % (21/111) in the \ngroup not receiving prevention to 7 % (7/104) in the group receiving prevention (64.4 % reduction \n[95 % CI 15.8 \u2013 85.0; p = 0.0188]). Among children who were not already shedding virus at baseline, \nthe incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was reduced from 21 % (15/70) in the group \nnot receiving prevention to 4 % (2/47) in the group receiving prevention (80.1 % reduction [95 % CI \n22.0 \u2013 94.9; p = 0.0206]). The NNT for the total paediatric population was 9 (95 % CI 7 \u2013 24) and \n\n\n\n43 \n\n8 (95 % CI 6, upper limit not estimable) in the whole population (ITT) and in paediatric contacts of \ninfected index cases (ITTII), respectively. \n \nPost-exposure prevention of influenza in infants less than 1 year of age during a pandemic: \nPrevention during an influenza pandemic has not been studied in controlled clinical studies in children \n0-12 months of age. See Section 5.2 for exposure simulation details. \n \nPrevention during an influenza epidemic in the community: In a pooled analysis of two other studies \nconducted in unvaccinated otherwise healthy adults, oseltamivir 75 mg once daily given for 6 weeks \nsignificantly reduced the incidence of clinical influenza illness from 25/519 (4.8 %) in the placebo \ngroup to 6/520 (1.2 %) in the oseltamivir group (76 % reduction [95 % CI 1.6 \u2013 5.7; p = 0.0006]) \nduring a community outbreak of influenza. The NNT in this study was 28 (95 % CI 24 \u2013 50). \nA study in older people in nursing homes, where 80 % of participants received vaccine in the season \nof the study, oseltamivir 75 mg once daily given for 6 weeks significantly reduced the incidence of \nclinical influenza illness from 12/272 (4.4 %) in the placebo group to 1/276 (0.4 %) in the oseltamivir \ngroup (92 % reduction [95 % CI 1.5 \u2013 6.6; p = 0.0015]). The NNT in this study was 25 (95 % CI 23 \u2013 \n62).  \n \nProphylaxis of influenza in immunocompromised patients: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, \nrandomised study was conducted for seasonal prophylaxis of influenza in 475 immunocompromised \npatients (388 patients with solid organ transplantation [195 placebo; 193 oseltamivir], 87 patients with \nhaemopoetic stem cell transplantation [43 placebo; 44 oseltamivir], no patient with other \nimmunosuppressant conditions), including 18 children 1 to 12 years of age. The primary endpoint in \nthis study was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza as determined by viral culture \nand/or a four-fold rise in HAI antibodies. The incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was \n2.9 % (7/238) in the placebo group and 2.1 % (5/237) in the oseltamivir group (95 % CI -2.3 % \u2013 \n4.1 %; p = 0.772). \n \nSpecific studies have not been conducted to assess the reduction in the risk of complications. \n \nOseltamivir resistance \nClinical studies: The risk of emergence of influenza viruses with reduced susceptibility or frank \nresistance to oseltamivir has been examined during Roche-sponsored clinical studies. Developing \noseltamivir-resistant virus during treatment was more frequent in children than adults, ranging from \nless than 1% in adults to 18% in infants aged below 1 year.  Children who were found to carry \noseltamivir-resistant virus in general shed the virus for a prolonged period compared with subjects \nwith susceptible virus.  However treatment-emergent resistance to oseltamivir did not affect treatment \nresponse and caused no prolongation of influenza symptoms. \n \nAn overall higher incidence of oseltamivir resistance was observed in adult and adolescent \nimmunocompromised patients treated with standard dose or double dose of oseltamivir for a duration \nof 10 days [14.5% (10/69) in standard dose group and 2.7% (2/74) in double dose group], compared to \ndata from studies with oseltamivir-treated otherwise healthy adult and adolescent patients. The \nmajority of adult patients that developed resistance were transplant recipients (8/10 patients in the \nstandard dose group and 2/2 patients in the double dose group). Most of the patients with oseltamivir-\nresistant virus were infected with influenza type A and had prolonged viral shedding. \n \nThe incidence of oseltamivir-resistance observed in immunocompromised children (\u226412 years of age) \ntreated with Tamiflu across the two studies and evaluated for resistance was 20.7% (6/29). Of the six \nimmunocompromised children found with treatment-emergent resistance to oseltamivir, 3 patients \nreceived standard dose and 3 patients high dose (double or triple dose). The majority had acute \nlymphoid leukemia and were \u2264 5 years of age. \n \n\n\n\n44 \n\nIncidence of Oseltamivir Resistance in Clinical Studies \n \n\nPatient Population \nPatients with Resistance Mutations (%) \n\nPhenotyping* Geno- and Phenotyping* \nAdults and adolescents 0.88% (21/2382) 1.13% (27/2396) \nChildren (1-12 years) 4.11% (71/1726) 4.52% (78/1727) \nInfant (<1 year) 18.31% (13/71) 18.31 (13/71) \n\n* Full genotyping was not performed in all studies. \n \nProphylaxis of Influenza \nThere has been no evidence for emergence of drug resistance associated with the use of Tamiflu in \nclinical studies conducted to date in post-exposure (7 days), post-exposure within household groups \n(10 days) and seasonal (42 days) prevention of influenza in immunocompetent patients. There was no \nresistance observed during a 12-week prophylaxis study in immunocompromised patients.  \n \nClinical and surveillance data: Natural mutations associated with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir \nin vitro have been detected in influenza A and B viruses isolated from patients without exposure to \noseltamivir. Resistant strains selected during oseltamivir treatment have been isolated from both \nimmunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. Immunocompromised patients and young \nchildren are at a higher risk of developing oseltamivir-resistant virus during treatment. \n \nOseltamivir-resistant viruses isolated from oseltamivir-treated patients and oseltamivir-resistant \nlaboratory strains of influenza viruses have been found to contain mutations in N1 and N2 \nneuraminidases. Resistance mutations tend to be viral sub-type specific. Since 2007 naturally \noccurring resistance associated with the H275Y mutation in seasonal H1N1 strains has been \nsporadically detected. The susceptibility to oseltamivir and the prevalence of such viruses appear to \nvary seasonally and geographically. In 2008, H275Y was found in > 99 % of circulating H1N1 \ninfluenza isolates in Europe. The 2009 H1N1 influenza (\u201cswine flu\u201d) was almost uniformly \nsusceptible to oseltamivir, with only sporadic reports of resistance in connection with both therapeutic \nand prophylactic regimens. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nGeneral Information \n \nAbsorption \nOseltamivir is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration of oseltamivir \nphosphate (pro-drug) and is extensively converted by predominantly hepatic esterases to the active \nmetabolite (oseltamivir carboxylate). At least 75 % of an oral dose reaches the systemic circulation as \nthe active metabolite. Exposure to the pro-drug is less than 5 % relative to the active metabolite. \nPlasma concentrations of both pro-drug and active metabolite are proportional to dose and are \nunaffected by co-administration with food. \n \nDistribution \nThe mean volume of distribution at steady state of the oseltamivir carboxylate is approximately \n23 litres in humans, a volume equivalent to extracellular body fluid. Since neuraminidase activity is \nextracellular, oseltamivir carboxylate distributes to all sites of influenza virus spread. \n \nThe binding of the oseltamivir carboxylate to human plasma protein is negligible (approximately 3 %). \n \nBiotransformation \nOseltamivir is extensively converted to oseltamivir carboxylate by esterases located predominantly in \nthe liver. In vitro studies demonstrated that neither oseltamivir nor the active metabolite is a substrate \nfor, or an inhibitor of, the major cytochrome P450 isoforms. No phase 2 conjugates of either \ncompound have been identified in vivo. \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nElimination \nAbsorbed oseltamivir is primarily (> 90 %) eliminated by conversion to oseltamivir carboxylate. It is \nnot further metabolised and is eliminated in the urine. Peak plasma concentrations of oseltamivir \ncarboxylate decline with a half-life of 6 to 10 hours in most subjects. The active metabolite is \neliminated entirely by renal excretion. Renal clearance (18.8 l/h) exceeds glomerular filtration rate \n(7.5 l/h) indicating that tubular secretion occurs in addition to glomerular filtration. Less than 20 % of \nan oral radiolabelled dose is eliminated in faeces. \n \nOther special populations \n \nPaediatric population \nInfants less than 1 year of age: The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of Tamiflu have \nbeen evaluated in two uncontrolled open-label studies including influenza infected children less than \none year of age (n=135). The rate of clearance of the active metabolite, corrected for body-weight, \ndecreases with ages below one year. Metabolite exposures are also more variable in the youngest \ninfants. The available data indicates that the exposure following a 3 mg/kg dose in infants 0-12 months \nof age provides pro-drug and metabolite exposures anticipated to be efficacious with a safety profile \ncomparable to that seen in older children and adults using the approved dose (see sections 4.1 and \n4.2).The reported adverse events were consistent with the established safety profile in older children.  \n \nThere are no data available for infants below 1 year of age for post exposure prevention of influenza. \nPrevention during an influenza epidemic in the community has not been studied in children below 12 \nyears of age. \n \nPost-exposure prevention of influenza in infants less than 1 year of age during a pandemic: \nSimulation of once daily dosing of 3mg/kg in infants <1 year shows an exposure in the same range or \nhigher than for once daily dosing of 75 mg in adults. Exposure does not exceed that for treatment of \ninfants < 1 year (3 mg/kg twice daily) and is anticipated to result in a comparable safety profile (see \nSection 4.8). No clinical studies of prophylaxis in infants aged <1 have been performed.     \n \nInfants and children 1 year of age or older: The pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir have been evaluated \nin single-dose pharmacokinetic studies in infants, children and adolescents 1 to 16 years of age. \nMultiple-dose pharmacokinetics were studied in a small number of children enrolled in a clinical \nefficacy study. Younger children cleared both the pro-drug and its active metabolite faster than adults, \nresulting in a lower exposure for a given mg/kg dose. Doses of 2 mg/kg give oseltamivir carboxylate \nexposures comparable to those achieved in adults receiving a single 75 mg dose (approximately \n1 mg/kg). The pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir in children and adolescents 12 years of age or older are \nsimilar to those in adults. \n  \nElderly \nExposure to the active metabolite at steady state was 25 to 35 % higher in older people (age 65 to 78 \nyears) compared to adults less than 65 years of age given comparable doses of oseltamivir. Half-lives \nobserved in older people were similar to those seen in young adults. On the basis of drug exposure and \ntolerability, dosage adjustments are not required for older people unless there is evidence of moderate \nor severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 60 ml /min) (see section 4.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nAdministration of 100 mg oseltamivir phosphate twice daily for 5 days to patients with various \ndegrees of renal impairment showed that exposure to oseltamivir carboxylate is inversely proportional \nto declining renal function. For dosing, see section 4.2. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn vitro studies have concluded that exposure to oseltamivir is not expected to be increased \nsignificantly nor is exposure to the active metabolite expected to be significantly decreased in patients \nwith hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nPregnant Women \nA pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that the Tamiflu dosage regimen described in \nSection 4.2 Posology and method of administration results in lower exposure (30% on average across \nall trimesters) to the active metabolite in pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women. The \nlower predicted exposure however, remains above inhibitoy concentrations (IC95 values) and at a \ntherapeutic level for a range of influenza virus strains. In addition, there is evidence from \nobservational studies showing benefit of the current dosing regimen in this patient population. \nTherefore, dose adjustments are not recommended for pregnant women in the treatment  \nor prophylaxis of influenza (see section 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation). \n \nImmunocompromised Patients \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that treatment of adult and paediatric (<18 years old) \nimmunocompromised patients with oseltamivir (as described in Section 4.2. Posology and method of \nadministration) results in an increased predicted exposure (from approximately 5% up to 50%) to the \nactive metabolite when compared to non-immunocompromised patients with comparable creatinine \nclearance. Due to the wide safety margin of the active metabolite, no dose adjustments are required in \npatients due to their immunocompromised status. However, for immunocompromised patients with \nrenal impairment, doses should be adjusted as outlined in section 4.2. Posology and method of \nadministration.  \n \nPharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics analyses from two studies in immunocompromised patients \nindicated that there was no meaningful additional benefit in exposures higher than those achieved after \nthe administration of the standard dose. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity and genotoxicity. Results of the conventional rodent \ncarcinogenicity studies showed a trend towards a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of some \ntumours that are typical for the rodent strains used. Considering the margins of exposure in relation to \nthe expected exposure in the human use, these findings do not change the benefit-risk of Tamiflu in its \nadopted therapeutic indications.  \n \nTeratology studies have been conducted in rats and rabbits at doses of up to 1,500 mg/kg/day and \n500 mg/kg/day, respectively. No effects on foetal development were observed. A rat fertility study up \nto a dose of 1,500 mg/kg/day demonstrated no adverse reactions on either sex. In pre- and post-natal \nrat studies, prolonged parturition was noted at 1,500 mg/kg/day: the safety margin between human \nexposure and the highest no-effect dose (500 mg/kg/day) in rats is 480-fold for oseltamivir and 44-fold \nfor the active metabolite, respectively. Foetal exposure in the rats and rabbits was approximately 15 to \n20 % of that of the mother. \n \nIn lactating rats, oseltamivir and the active metabolite are excreted in the milk. Limited data indicate \nthat oseltamivir and the active metabolite are excreted in human milk. Extrapolation of the animal data \nprovides estimates of 0.01 mg/day and 0.3 mg/day for the respective compounds.  \n \nA potential for skin sensitisation to oseltamivir was observed in a \"maximisation\" test in guinea pigs. \nApproximately 50 % of the animals treated with the unformulated active substance showed erythema \nafter challenging the induced animals. Reversible irritancy of rabbits' eyes was detected.  \n \nWhereas very high oral single doses of oseltamivir phosphate salt, up to the highest dose tested \n(1,310 mg/kg), had no adverse reactions in adult rats, such doses resulted in toxicity in juvenile 7-day-\nold rat pups, including death. These reactions were seen at doses of 657 mg/kg and higher. At \n500 mg/kg, no adverse reactions were seen, including upon chronic treatment (500 mg/kg/day \nadministered from 7 to 21 days post partum). \n \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\n6.

You may need to read it again. \n\u2211 If you have further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\u2211 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\u2211 If you get any of the side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Tamiflu is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Tamiflu  \n3. How to take Tamiflu  \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Tamiflu  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Tamiflu is and what it is used for \n \n\u2211 Tamiflu is used for adults, adolescents, children and infants (including full-term newborn \n\nbabies) for treating flu (influenza). It can be used when you have flu symptoms, and the flu \nvirus is known to be going round in your community. \n\n\u2211 Tamiflu can also be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants above 1 year of age \nfor preventing flu, on a case-by-case basis \u2013 for instance, if you have been in contact with \nsomeone who has flu.  \n\n\u2211 Tamiflu may be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and  infant (including full-term  \nnewborn babies) as preventive treatment in exceptional circumstances \u2013 for example, if there \nis a global epidemic of flu (a flu pandemic) and the seasonal flu vaccine may not provide \nsufficient protection.  \n\n \nTamiflu contains oseltamivir, which belongs to a group of medicines named neuraminidase inhibitors. \nThese medicines prevent the flu virus from spreading inside the body. They help to ease or prevent the \nsymptoms of the flu virus infection. \n \nInfluenza, usually called flu, is an infection caused by a virus. The signs of flu often include a sudden \nfever (more than 37.8 \u00b0C), cough, runny or stuffy nose, headaches, muscle aches and extreme \ntiredness. These symptoms can also be caused by other infections. True influenza infection only \noccurs during annual outbreaks (epidemics) when flu viruses are spreading in the local community. \nOutside epidemic periods, flu-like symptoms are usually caused by a different type of illness.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Tamiflu \n \nDo not take Tamiflu: \n\u2211 if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to oseltamivir or any of the other ingredients of Tamiflu \n\nlisted in section 6.  \nTalk to your doctor if this applies to you. Do not take Tamiflu. \n \n\n\n\n67 \n\nWarnings and precautions: \nBefore you take Tamiflu, make sure the prescribing doctor knows \n\u2211 if you are allergic to other medicines \n\u2211 if you have problems with your kidneys. If so, your dose may need adjustment \n\u2211 if you have a severe medical condition, which may require immediate hospitalisation \n\u2211 if your immune system is not working \n\u2211 if you have chronic heart disease or respiratory disease. \n \nDuring treatment with Tamiflu, tell a doctor immediately: \n\u2211 if you notice changes in behaviour or mood (neuropsychiatric events), especially in children and \n\nadolescents). These may be signs of rare but serious side effects.  \n \nTamiflu is not a flu vaccine \nTamiflu is not a vaccine: it treats infection, or prevents the flu virus spreading. A vaccine gives you \nantibodies against the virus. Tamiflu will not change the effectiveness of a flu vaccine, and you might \nbe prescribed both by your doctor.  \n \nOther medicines and Tamiflu \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, or have recently taken any. This \nincludes medicines obtained without a prescription. The following medicines are particularly \nimportant: \n\n\u2211 chlorpropamide (used to treat diabetes) \n\u2211 methotrexate (used to treat e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) \n\u2211 phenylbutazone (used to treat pain and inflammation) \n\u2211 probenecid (used to treat gout) \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou must tell your doctor if you are pregnant, if you think you are pregnant or if you are trying to get \npregnant so that your doctor can decide if Tamiflu is right for you. \n \nThe effects on breast-fed infants are unknown. You must tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding so \nthat your doctor can decide if Tamiflu is right for you. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTamiflu has no effect on your ability to drive or use machines. \n \n \n3. How to take Tamiflu \n \nTake this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you \nare not sure. \n \nTake Tamiflu as soon as possible, ideally within two days of the flu symptoms starting. \n \nThe recommended doses \n \nFor treating flu, take two doses daily. It is usually convenient to take one dose in the morning and \none in the evening. It is important to complete the whole 5-day course, even if you start to feel \nbetter quickly. \n \nFor patients with a weak immune system, treatment will continue for 10 days. \n \nFor preventing flu or after being exposed to an infected person, take one dose daily for 10 days. It \nis best to take this in the mornings with breakfast. \n \n\n\n\n68 \n\nIn special situations, such as widespread flu or for patients with a weak immune system, treatment will \ncontinue for up to 6 or 12 weeks. \n \nThe recommended dose is based on the patient\u2019s body weight.You must use the amount of oral \ncapsules or suspension prescribed by the doctor.  \n \nAdults, and adolescents 13 years and over  \n \nBody weight Treating flu:  \n\ndose  \nfor 5 days \n\nTreating flu \n(Immunocompromised \nPatients):  \ndose  \nfor 10 days*  \n\nPreventing flu:  \ndose  \nfor 10 days \n\n40 kg or more 75 mg** twice daily 75 mg** twice daily 75 mg** once daily \n* For patients with a weak immune system, treatment is for 10 days \n**75 mg can be made up of a 30 mg capsule plus a 45 mg capsule \n \nChildren 1 to 12 years  \n \nBody weight Treating flu:  \n\ndose  \nfor 5 days  \n\nTreating flu \n(Immunocompromised \nPatients): \ndose  \nfor 10 days*  \n\nPreventing flu:  \ndose  \nfor 10 days \n\n10 to 15 kg 30 mg twice daily 30 mg twice daily 30 mg once daily \nMore than 15 kg and up \nto 23 kg \n\n45 mg twice daily 45 mg twice daily 45 mg once daily \n\nMore than 23 kg and up \nto 40 kg \n\n60 mg twice daily 60 mg twice daily 60 mg once daily \n\nMore than 40 kg 75 mg** twice daily 75 mg** twice daily 75 mg** once daily \n* For children with a weak immune system, treatment is for 10 days**75 mg can be made up of a 30 mg capsule \nplus a 45 mg capsule \n \nInfants less than 1 year (0 to 12 months) \nGiving Tamiflu to infants less than 1 year old for preventing flu during flu pandemic should be based \nupon the judgment of a doctor after considering the potential benefit versus any potential risk to the \ninfant.  \n \nBody weight Treating flu:  \n\ndose  \nfor 5 days \n\nTreating flu \n(Immunocompromised \nPatients): \ndose  \nfor 10 days* \n\nPreventing flu:  \ndose  \nfor 10 days \n\n3 kg to 10+ kg, \n \n\n3 mg per kg body  \nweight**, twice daily \n\n3 mg per kg body  \nweight**, twice daily \n\n3 mg per kg**, once \ndaily \n\n* For infants with a weak immune system, treatment is for 10 days. \n** mg per kg = mg for each kilogram of the infant\u2019s body weight. For example: \nIf a 6-month-old weighs 8 kg, the dose is \n8 kg x 3mg per kg = 24 mg \n \nMethod of administration \nSwallow the capsules whole with water. Do not break or chew the capsules. \n \nTamiflu can be taken with or without food, although taking it with food can reduce the chance of \nfeeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). \n \n\n\n\n69 \n\nPeople who find it hard to take capsules can use a liquid medicine, Tamiflu oral suspension. If you \nneed Tamiflu oral suspension, but it\u2019s not available from your pharmacy, you can make a liquid form \nof Tamiflu from these capsules. See Making liquid Tamiflu at home, over the page. \n \nIf you take more Tamiflu than you should  \nStop taking Tamiflu and contact a doctor or pharmacist immediately. \nIn most cases of overdose, people have not reported any side effects. When side effects were reported, \nthey were similar to those from normal doses, as listed in section 4. \nOverdose has been reported to have occurred more frequently when Tamiflu was given to children \nthan to adults and adolescents. Caution should be exercised when preparing liquid Tamiflu for \nchildren and when administering Tamiflu capsules or liquid Tamiflu to children. \n \nIf you forget to take Tamiflu \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten capsule. \n \nIf you stop taking Tamiflu \nThere are no side effects when you stop Tamiflu. But if Tamiflu is stopped earlier than your doctor \ntold you, the symptoms of flu may come back. Always complete the course that your doctor \nprescribed. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Many of \nthe side effects listed below may also be caused by influenza. \n \nThe following serious side effects have been rarely reported since oseltamivir has been marketed: \n\n\u2211 Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions: severe allergic reactions, with face and skin \nswelling, itchy rashes, low blood pressure and breathing difficulties \n\n\u2211 Hepatic disorders (fulminant hepatitis, hepatic function disorder and jaundice): yellowing of \nthe skin and white of the eyes, change in stool color, changes in behaviour \n\n\u2211 Angioneurotic oedema: sudden onset of severe swelling of the skin mainly around the head \nand neck area, including eyes and tongue, with difficulties breathing \n\n\u2211 Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: complicated, possibly life-\nthreatening allergic reaction, severe inflammation of the outer and possibly inner skin, \ninitially with fever, sore throat, and fatigue, skin rashes, leading to blisters, peeling, shedding \nof larger areas of skin, possible breathing difficulties and low blood pressure \n\n\u2211 Gastrointestinal bleeding: prolonged bleeding from the large bowel or spitting up blood \n\u2211 Neuropsychiatric disorders, as described below. \n \n\nIf you notice any of these symptoms, get medical help immediately. \n \nThe most frequently (very common and common) reported side effects of Tamiflu are feeling or being \nsick (nausea, vomiting), stomach ache, stomach upset, headache and pain.

This pharmacy preparation is \nthe preferred option. \n \nIf the pharmacy preparation is not available either, you can make liquid Tamiflu from these capsules at \nhome. \n \nThe dose is the same for treating or preventing flu. The difference is how often it is given. \n \nMaking liquid Tamiflu at home \n \n\u2211 If you have the right capsule for the dose needed (a 30 mg or a 60 mg dose), you will open the \n\ncapsule and stir its contents into one teaspoon (or less) of a suitable sweetened food product. \nThis is usually suitable for children over 1 year. See the upper set of instructions. \n\n \n\u2211 If you need smaller doses, making liquid Tamiflu from capsules involves extra steps. This is \n\nsuitable for younger children and babies: they usually need a Tamiflu dose of less than 30 mg. \nSee the lower set of instructions. \n\n \nChildren 1 to 12 years \n \nTo make a 30 mg or a 60 mg dose, \nyou need: \n\n\u2211 One or two 30 mg Tamiflu capsule(s) \n\u2211 Sharp scissors \n\u2211 One small bowl \n\u2211 Teaspoon (5 ml spoon) \n\u2211 Water \n\u2211 Sweet food to hide the bitter taste of the powder. \n Examples are: chocolate or cherry syrup, and dessert toppings such as caramel or fudge \n\nsauce. Or you can make sugar water: mix a teaspoon of water with three-quarters (3/4) of a \nteaspoon of sugar. \n\n \nStep 1: Check the dose is correct \n \n\nTo find the correct amount to use, find the patient\u2019s weight on the left of the table. \nLook at the right column to check the number of capsules you will need to give the patient for a \nsingle dose. The amount is the same whether treating or preventing flu. \n \n\n30 mg dose \n \n\n60 mg dose \n \n\n \nYou should use only 30 mg capsules for 30 mg and 60 mg doses. Do not try to make a 45 mg or \n75 mg dose by using the contents of 30 mg capsules. Use the appropriate size capsule instead.  \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \nWeight Dose of Tamiflu Number of capsules \nUp to 15 kg 30 mg 1 capsule \n15 kg up to 23 kg 45 mg Do not use 30 mg capsules \n23 kg up to 40 kg 60 mg 2 capsules \n\n \nStep 2: Pour all the powder into a bowl \n \n\nHold a 30 mg capsule upright over a bowl and carefully snip off the rounded tip with scissors.   \nPour all of the powder into the bowl. \nOpen a second capsule for a 60 mg dose. Pour all of the powder into the bowl.   \nBe careful with the powder, because it may irritate your skin and eyes. \n\n \n\n   \n \nStep 3: Sweeten the powder and give the dose \n \n\nAdd a small amount \u2013 no more than one teaspoonful \u2013 of sweet food to the powder in the bowl.  \nThis is to hide the bitter taste of the Tamiflu powder. \nStir the mixture well.  \n\n \n\n   \n \n\nGive the whole contents of the bowl to the patient straight away.  \n \nIf there is some mixture left in the bowl, rinse the bowl with a small amount of water and get \nthe patient to drink it all. \n \nRepeat this procedure every time you need to give the medicine. \n\n \nInfants less than 1 year  \n \nTo make a smaller single dose, you need: \n\n\u2211 One 30 mg Tamiflu capsule \n\u2211 Sharp scissors \n\u2211 Two small bowls (use separate pairs of bowls for each child) \n\u2211 One large oral dose dispenser to measure out water \u2013 a 5 or 10 ml dispenser \n\u2211 One small oral dose dispenser showing measurements of 0.1 ml, to give the dose \n\u2211 Teaspoon (5 ml spoon) \n\u2211 Water \n\u2211 Sweet food to hide the bitter taste of the Tamiflu. \n\nExamples are: chocolate or cherry syrup and dessert toppings such as caramel or fudge \nsauce.  \nOr you can make sugar water: mix a teaspoon of water with three-quarters (3/4) of a \nteaspoon of sugar. \n\n \n\n\n\n76 \n\nStep 1: Pour all the powder into a bowl \n \nHold a 30 mg capsule upright over one of the bowls and carefully snip off the rounded tip with \nscissors. Be careful with the powder: it may irritate your skin and eyes. \nPour all of the powder into the bowl, whatever the dose you are making. \nThe amount is the same whether you are treating or preventing flu. \n\n \n\n    \n \nStep 2: Add water to dilute the medicine \n \n\nUse the larger dispenser \nto draw up 5 ml water. \n \nAdd the water to the \npowder in the bowl. \n\n \n \n\nStir the mixture with \nthe teaspoon for \nabout 2 minutes. \n\n \n \nDon\u2019t worry if not all of the powder dissolves. The undissolved powder is just inactive \ningredients. \n\n \nStep 3: Choose the correct amount for your child\u2019s weight \n\nLook up the child\u2019s weight on the left side of the table.  \nThe column on the right of the table shows how much of the liquid mixture you will need to \ndraw up.  \n\n \nInfants less than 1 year (including full-term newborn babies) \n \n\nChild\u2019s weight \n(nearest) \n\nHow much mixture  \nto draw up \n\n3 kg 1.5 ml \n3.5 kg 1.8 ml \n4 kg 2.0 ml \n4.5 kg 2.3 ml  \n5 kg 2.5 ml \n5.5 kg 2.8 ml   \n6 kg 3.0 ml \n6.5 kg 3.3 ml \n7 kg 3.5 ml \n7.5 kg 3.8 ml \n8 kg 4.0 ml \n8.5 kg 4.3 ml \n9 kg 4.5 ml \n9.5 kg 4.8 ml \n10 kg or more 5.0 ml \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \nStep 4: Draw up the liquid mixture \n \n\nMake sure you have the right size dispenser.  \nDraw up the correct amount of liquid mixture from the first bowl.  \nDraw it up carefully so as not to include air bubbles. \nGently squirt the correct dose into the second bowl.  \n\n \n\n   \n \nStep 5: Sweeten and give to the child \n \n\nAdd a small amount \u2013 no more than one teaspoonful \u2013 of a sweet food to the second bowl. \nThis is to hide the bitter taste of the Tamiflu. \nMix the sweet food and Tamiflu liquid well.  \n\n \n\n   \n \n\nGive the whole contents of the second bowl (Tamiflu liquid mixture with sweet food added) to \nthe child straight away. \n \nIf there is anything left in the second bowl, rinse the bowl with a small amount of water and \nget the child to drink it all. For children unable to drink from a bowl, spoon-feed or use a bottle \nto feed the child the remaining liquid. \n \nGive the child something to drink. \n \nThrow away any unused liquid left in the first bowl. \n\n \n Repeat this procedure every time you need to give the medicine. \n  \n\n\n\n78 \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nInformation for healthcare professionals only \n \nPatients who are unable to swallow capsules:   \nCommercially manufactured Tamiflu for oral suspension (6mg/ml) is the preferred product for \npaediatric and adult patients who have difficulties swallowing capsules or where lower doses are \nneeded.  In the event thatTamiflu powder for oral suspension is not available, the pharmacist may \ncompound a suspension (6 mg/ml) from Tamiflu capsules. If the pharmacy compounded suspension is \nalso not available, patients may prepare the suspension from capsules at home. \n \nOral dose dispensers (oral syringes) of appropriate volume and grading should be provided for \nadministering the pharmacy compounded suspension, and for the procedures involved in the home \npreparation. In both cases, the correct volumes should preferably be marked on the dispensers. For \nhome preparation, separate dispensers should be provided for taking the correct volume of water and \nfor measuring the Tamiflu-water mixture. For measuring 5.0 ml of water, dispensers of 5 ml or 10 ml \nshould be used. \n \nThe appropriate dispenser sizes for taking the correct volume of Tamiflu suspension (6 mg/ml) are \nshown below. \n \nInfants less than 1 year (including full term new born babies):  \n \n\nDose of Tamiflu \nAmount of Tamiflu \n\nsuspension \nDispenser size to use \n\n(grading 0.1 ml) \n9 mg 1.5 ml 2.0 ml (or 3.0 ml) \n\n10 mg 1.7 ml 2.0 ml (or 3.0 ml) \n11.25 mg 1.9 ml 2.0 ml (or 3.0 ml) \n12.5 mg 2.1 ml 3.0 ml \n13.75 mg 2.3 ml 3.0 ml \n\n15 mg 2.5 ml 3.0 ml \n16.25 mg 2.7 ml 3.0 ml \n\n18 mg 3.0 ml 3.0 ml (or 5.0 ml) \n19.5 mg 3.3 ml 5.0 ml \n21 mg 3.5 ml 5.0 ml \n\n22.5 mg 3.8 ml 5.0 ml \n24 mg 4.0 ml 5.0 ml \n\n25.5 mg 4.3 ml 5.0 ml \n27 mg 4.5 ml 5.0 ml \n\n28.5 mg 4.8 ml 5.0 ml \n30 mg 5.0 ml 5.0 ml \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n79 \n\nPackage Leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nTamiflu 45 mg hard capsules \noseltamivir \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n\u2211 Keep this leaflet.

What Tamiflu is and what it is used for \n \n\u2211 Tamiflu is used for adults, adolescents, children and infants (including full-term newborn \n\nbabies) for treating flu (influenza). It can be used when you have flu symptoms, and the flu \nvirus is known to be going round in your community. \n\n\u2211 Tamiflu can also be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants above 1 year of age \nfor preventing flu, on a case-by-case basis \u2013 for instance, if you have been in contact with \nsomeone who has flu.  \n\n\u2211 Tamiflu may be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants (including full-term \nnewborn babies) as preventive treatment in exceptional circumstances \u2013 for example, if there \nis a global epidemic of flu (a flu pandemic) and the seasonal flu vaccine may not provide \nsufficient protection.  \n\n \nTamiflu contains oseltamivir, which belongs to a group of medicines named neuraminidase inhibitors. \nThese medicines prevent the flu virus from spreading inside the body. They help to ease or prevent the \nsymptoms of the flu virus infection. \n \nInfluenza, usually called flu, is an infection caused by a virus. The signs of flu often include a sudden \nfever (more than 37.8 \u00b0C), cough, runny or stuffy nose, headaches, muscle aches and extreme \ntiredness. These symptoms can also be caused by other infections. True influenza infection only \noccurs during annual outbreaks (epidemics) when flu viruses are spreading in the local community. \nOutside epidemic periods, flu-like symptoms are usually caused by a different type of illness.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Tamiflu \n \nDo not take Tamiflu: \n\u2211 if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to oseltamivir or any of the other ingredients of Tamiflu \n\nlisted in section 6.  \nTalk to your doctor if this applies to you. Do not take Tamiflu. \n \n\n\n\n80 \n\nWarnings and precautions: \nBefore you take Tamiflu, make sure the prescribing doctor knows \n\u2211 if you are allergic to other medicines \n\u2211 if you have problems with your kidneys. If so, your dose may need adjustment \n\u2211 if you have a severe medical condition, which may require immediate hospitalisation \n\u2211 if your immune system is not working \n\u2211 if you have chronic heart disease or respiratory disease. \n \nDuring treatment with Tamiflu, tell a doctor immediately: \n\u2211 if you notice changes in behaviour or mood (neuropsychiatric events), especially in children and \n\nadolescents). These may be signs of rare but serious side effects.  \n \nTamiflu is not a flu vaccine \nTamiflu is not a vaccine: it treats infection, or prevents the flu virus spreading. A vaccine gives you \nantibodies against the virus. Tamiflu will not change the effectiveness of a flu vaccine, and you might \nbe prescribed both by your doctor.  \n \nOther medicines and Tamiflu \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, or have recently taken any. This \nincludes medicines obtained without a prescription. The following medicines are particularly \nimportant: \n\n\u2211 chlorpropamide (used to treat diabetes) \n\u2211 methotrexate (used to treat e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) \n\u2211 phenylbutazone (used to treat pain and inflammation) \n\u2211 probenecid (used to treat gout) \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou must tell your doctor if you are pregnant, if you think you are pregnant or if you are trying to get \npregnant so that your doctor can decide if Tamiflu is right for you. \n \nThe effects on breast-fed infants are unknown. You must tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding so \nthat your doctor can decide if Tamiflu is right for you. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTamiflu has no effect on your ability to drive or use machines. \n \n \n3. How to take Tamiflu \n \nTake this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you \nare not sure. \n \nTake Tamiflu as soon as possible, ideally within two days of the flu symptoms starting. \n \nThe recommended doses  \n \nFor treating flu, take two doses daily. It is usually convenient to take one dose in the morning and \none in the evening. It is important to complete the whole 5-day course, even if you start to feel \nbetter quickly. \n \nFor patients with a weak immune system, treatment will continue for 10 days. \n \nFor preventing flu or after being exposed to an infected person, take one dose daily for 10 days. It \nis best to take this in the mornings with breakfast. \n \n\n\n\n81 \n\nIn special situations, such as widespread flu or for patients with a weak immune system, treatment will \ncontinue for up to 6 or 12 weeks. \n \nThe recommended dose is based on the patient\u2019s body weight.You must use the amount of oral \ncapsules or suspension prescribed by the doctor.  \n \nAdults, and adolescents 13 years and over  \n \nBody weight Treating flu:  \n\ndose  \nfor 5 days \n\nTreating flu \n(Immunocompromised \nPatients):  \ndose  \nfor 10 days* \n\nPreventing flu:  \ndose  \nfor 10 days \n\n40 kg or more 75 mg** twice daily 75 mg** twice daily 75 mg** once daily \n* For patients with a weak immune system, treatment is for 10 days. \n**75 mg can be made up of a 30 mg capsule plus a 45 mg capsule \n \nChildren 1 to 12 years  \n \nBody weight Treating flu:  \n\ndose  \nfor 5 days \n\nTreating flu \n(Immunocompromised \nPatients):  \ndose  \nfor 10 days* \n\nPreventing flu:  \ndose  \nfor 10 days \n\n10 to 15 kg 30 mg twice daily 30 mg twice daily 30 mg once daily \nMore than 15 kg and up \nto 23 kg \n\n45 mg twice daily 45 mg twice daily 45 mg once daily \n\nMore than 23 kg and up \nto 40 kg \n\n60 mg twice daily 60 mg twice daily 60 mg once daily \n\nMore than 40 kg 75 mg** twice daily 75 mg** twice daily 75 mg** once daily \n* For children with a weak immune system, treatment is for 10 days. \n** 75 mg can be made up of a 30 mg capsule plus a 45 mg capsule \n \nInfants less than 1 year (0 to 12 months) \nGiving Tamiflu to infants less than 1 year old for preventing flu during flu pandemic should be based \nupon the judgment of a doctor after considering the potential benefit versus any potential risk to the \ninfant.  \n \nBody weight Treating flu:  \n\ndose  \nfor 5 days \n\nTreating flu \n(Immunocompromised \nPatients):  \ndose  \nfor 10 days* \n\nPreventing flu:  \ndose  \nfor 10 days \n\n3 kg to 10+ kg, \n \n\n3 mg per kg body  \nweight**, twice daily \n\n3 mg per kg body  \nweight**, twice daily \n\n3 mg per kg**,  \nonce daily \n\n* For infants with a weak immune system, treatment is for 10 days. \n**mg per kg = mg for each kilogram of the infant\u2019s body weight. For example: \nIf a 6-month-old weighs 8 kg, the dose is \n8 kg x 3mg per kg = 24 mg \n \nMethod of administration \nSwallow the capsules whole with water. Do not break or chew the capsules. \n \nTamiflu can be taken with or without food, although taking it with food can reduce the chance of \nfeeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). \n \n\n\n\n82 \n\nPeople who find it hard to take capsules can use a liquid medicine, Tamiflu oral suspension. If you \nneed Tamiflu oral suspension, but it\u2019s not available from your pharmacy, you can make a liquid form \nof Tamiflu from these capsules. See Making liquid Tamiflu at home, over the page. \n \nIf you take more Tamiflu than you should  \nStop taking Tamiflu and contact a doctor or pharmacist immediately. \nIn most cases of overdose, people have not reported any side effects. When side effects were reported, \nthey were similar to those from normal doses, as listed in section 4. \nOverdose has been reported to have occurred more frequently when Tamiflu was given to children \nthan to adults and adolescents. Caution should be exercised when preparing liquid Tamiflu for \nchildren and when administering Tamiflu capsules or liquid Tamiflu to children. \n \nIf you forget to take Tamiflu \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten capsule. \n \nIf you stop taking Tamiflu \nThere are no side effects when you stop Tamiflu. But if Tamiflu is stopped earlier than your doctor \ntold you, the symptoms of flu may come back. Always complete the course that your doctor \nprescribed. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Many of \nthe side effects listed below may also be caused by influenza. \n \nThe following serious side effects have been rarely reported since oseltamivir has been marketed: \n\n\u2211 Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions: severe allergic reactions, with face and skin \nswelling, itchy rashes, low blood pressure and breathing difficulties \n\n\u2211 Hepatic disorders (fulminant hepatitis, hepatic function disorder and jaundice): yellowing of \nthe skin and white of the eyes, change in stool color, changes in behaviour \n\n\u2211 Angioneurotic oedema: sudden onset of severe swelling of the skin mainly around the head \nand neck area, including eyes and tongue, with difficulties breathing \n\n\u2211 Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: complicated, possibly life-\nthreatening allergic reaction, severe inflammation of the outer and possibly inner skin, \ninitially with fever, sore throat, and fatigue, skin rashes, leading to blisters, peeling, shedding \nof larger areas of skin, possible breathing difficulties and low blood pressure \n\n\u2211 Gastrointestinal bleeding: prolonged bleeding from the large bowel or spitting up blood \n\u2211 Neuropsychiatric disorders, as described below. \n \n\nIf you notice any of these symptoms, get medical help immediately. \n \nThe most frequently (very common and common) reported side effects of Tamiflu are feeling or being \nsick (nausea, vomiting), stomach ache, stomach upset, headache and pain. These side effects mostly \noccur after the first dose of the medicine and will usually stop as treatment continues. The frequency \nof these effects is reduced if the medicinal product is taken with food. \n \nRare but serious effects: get medical help at once \n(These may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people)  \nDuring Tamiflu treatment, rare events have been reported that include \n\n\u2211 Convulsions and delirium, including altered level of consciousness \n\u2211 Confusion, abnormal behaviour \n\u2211 Delusions, hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, nightmares \n\n\n\n83 \n\nThese are reported primarily among children and adolescents and often started suddenly and resolved \nrapidly.

This pharmacy preparation is \nthe preferred option. \n \nIf the pharmacy preparation is not available either, you can make liquid Tamiflu from these capsules at \nhome. \n \nThe dose is the same for treating or preventing flu. The difference is how often it is given. \n \nMaking liquid Tamiflu at home \n \n\n\u2211 If you have the right capsule for the dose needed (a 45 mg dose), you will open the capsule \nand stir its contents into one teaspoon (or less) of a suitable sweetened food product. This is \nusually suitable for children over 1 year. See the upper set of instructions. \n\n \n\u2211 If you need smaller doses, making liquid Tamiflu from capsules involves extra steps. This \n\nis suitable for younger, lighter children and babies: they usually need a Tamiflu dose of less \nthan 45 mg. See the lower set of instructions.  \n\n \nChildren 1 to 12 years \n \nTo make a 45 mg dose, you need:  \n\n\u2211 One 45 mg Tamiflu capsule \n\u2211 Sharp scissors \n\u2211 One small bowl  \n\u2211 Teaspoon (5 ml spoon)  \n\u2211 Water \n\u2211 Sweet food to hide the bitter taste of the powder.  \n\nExamples are chocolate or cherry syrup, and dessert toppings such as caramel or fudge \nsauce. Or you can make sugar water: mix a teaspoon of water with three-quarters (3/4) of a \nteaspoon of sugar. \n\n \nStep 1: Check the dose is correct \n \n\nTo find the correct amount to use, find the patient\u2019s weight on the left of the table.   \nLook at the right column to check the number of capsules you will need to give the patient for a \nsingle dose. The amount is the same whether treating or preventing flu.  \n \n\n45 mg dose  \n\n \nYou should use only 45 mg capsules for 45 mg doses. Do not try to make a 30 mg, 60 mg or \n75 mg dose by using the contents of 45 mg capsules. Use the appropriate size capsule instead.  \n\n \nWeight Dose of Tamiflu Number of capsules \nUp to 15 kg 30 mg Do not use 45 mg capsules \n15 kg up to 23 kg 45 mg 1 capsule \n23 kg up to 40 kg 60 mg Do not use 45 mg capsules \n\n\n\n88 \n\n \nStep 2: Pour all the powder into a bowl \n \n\nHold a 45 mg capsule upright over a bowl and carefully snip off the rounded tip with scissors.   \nPour all of the powder into the bowl.   \nBe careful with the powder, because it may irritate your skin and eyes. \n\n \n\n   \n \nStep 3: Sweeten the powder and give the dose \n \n\nAdd a small amount \u2013 no more than one teaspoonful \u2013 of sweet food to the powder in the bowl.  \nThis is to hide the bitter taste of the Tamiflu powder. \nStir the mixture well.  \n\n \n\n   \n \n\nGive the whole contents of the bowl to the patient straight away.  \n \nIf there is some mixture left in the bowl, rinse the bowl with a small amount of water and get \nthe patient to drink it all. \n \nRepeat this procedure every time you need to give the medicine. \n\n \nInfants less than 1 year \n \nTo make a smaller single dose, you need: \n\n\u2211 One 45 mg Tamiflu capsule \n\u2211 Sharp scissors \n\n\u2211 Two small bowls (use separate pairs of bowls for each child) \n\u2211 One large oral dose dispenser to measure out water \u2013 a 5 ml dispenser or 10 ml dispenser \n\u2211 One small oral dose dispenser showing measurements of 0.1 ml, to give the dose \n\u2211 Teaspoon (5 ml spoon) \n\u2211 Water \n\u2211 Sweet food to hide the bitter taste of the Tamiflu. \n\nExamples are: chocolate or cherry syrup and dessert toppings such as caramel or fudge \nsauce.  \nOr you can make sugar water: mix a teaspoon of water with three-quarters (3/4) of a \nteaspoon of sugar. \n\n \nStep 1: Pour all the powder into a bowl \n \n\nHold a 45 mg capsule upright over one of the bowls and carefully snip off the rounded tip with \nscissors. Be careful with the powder: it may irritate your skin and eyes. \nPour all of the powder into the bowl, whatever the dose you are making.  \nThe amount is the same whether you are treating or preventing flu. \n \n\n\n\n89 \n\n     \n \nStep 2: Add water to dilute the medicine \n \n\nUse the larger dispenser \ndraw up 7.5 ml water. \n \nAdd the water to the \npowder in the bowl. \n\n \n \n\nStir the mixture with \nthe teaspoon for \nabout 2 minutes. \n\n \n \nDon\u2019t worry if not all of the powder dissolves. The undissolved powder is just inactive \ningredients. \n\n \nStep 3: Choose the correct amount for your child\u2019s weight \n\nLook up the child\u2019s weight on the left side of the table.  \nThe column on the right of the table shows how much of the liquid mixture you will need to \ndraw up.  \n\n \nInfants less than 1 year (including full term newborn babies) \n \n\nChild\u2019s weight \n(nearest) \n\nHow much mixture  \nto draw up \n\n3 kg 1.5 ml \n3.5 kg 1.8 ml \n4 kg 2.0 ml \n4.5 kg 2.3 ml \n5 kg 2.5 ml \n5.5 kg 2.8 ml \n6 kg 3.0 ml \n6.5 kg 3.3 ml \n7 kg 3.5 ml \n7.5 kg 3.8 ml \n8 kg 4.0 ml \n8.5 kg 4.3 ml \n9 kg 4.5 ml \n9.5 kg 4.8 ml \n10 kg or more 5.0 ml \n\n \n\n\n\n90 \n\nStep 4: Draw up the liquid mixture \n \n\nMake sure you have the right size dispenser.  \nDraw up the correct amount of liquid mixture from the first bowl.  \nDraw it up carefully so as not to include air bubbles. \nGently squirt the correct dose into the second bowl.  \n\n \n\n     \n \nStep 5: Sweeten and give to the child \n \n\nAdd a small amount \u2013 no more than one teaspoonful \u2013 of a sweet food to the second bowl. \nThis is to hide the bitter taste of the Tamiflu. \nMix the sweet food and Tamiflu liquid well.  \n\n \n\n   \n \n\nGive the whole contents of the second bowl (Tamiflu liquid mixture with sweet food added) to \nthe child straight away. \n \nIf there is anything left in the second bowl, rinse the bowl with a small amount of water and \nget the child to drink it all. For children unable to drink from a bowl, spoon-feed or use a bottle \nto feed the child the remaining liquid. \n \nGive the child something to drink. \n \nThrow away any unused liquid left in the first bowl. \n\n \n Repeat this procedure every time you need to give the medicine. \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n91 \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nInformation for healthcare professionals only \n \nPatients who are unable to swallow capsules \nCommercially manufactured Tamiflu for oral suspension (6mg/ml) is the preferred product for \npaediatric and adult patients who have difficulties swallowing capsules or where lower doses are \nneeded.  In the event thatTamiflu powder for oral suspension is not available, the pharmacist may \ncompound a suspension (6 mg/ml) from Tamiflu capsules. If the pharmacy compounded suspension is \nalso not available, patients may prepare the suspension from capsules at home. \n \nOral dose dispensers (oral syringes) of appropriate volume and grading should be provided for \nadministering the pharmacy compounded suspension, and for the procedures involved in the home \npreparation. In both cases, the correct volumes should preferably be marked on the dispensers. For \nhome preparation, separate dispensers should be provided for taking the correct volume of water and \nfor measuring the Tamiflu-water mixture. For measuring 5.0 ml of water, dispensers of 5 ml or 10 ml \nshould be used. \n \nThe appropriate dispenser sizes for taking the correct volume of Tamiflu suspension (6 mg/ml) are \nshown below. \n \nInfants less than 1 year (including full term new born babies):  \n \n\nDose of Tamiflu \nAmount of Tamiflu \n\nsuspension \nDispenser size to use \n\n(grading 0.1 ml) \n9 mg 1.5 ml 2.0 ml (or 3.0 ml) \n\n10 mg 1.7 ml 2.0 ml (or 3.0 ml) \n11.25 mg 1.9 ml 2.0 ml (or 3.0 ml) \n12.5 mg 2.1 ml 3.0 ml \n13.75 mg 2.3 ml 3.0 ml \n\n15 mg 2.5 ml 3.0 ml \n16.25 mg 2.7 ml 3.0 ml \n\n18 mg 3.0 ml 3.0 ml (or 5.0 ml) \n19.5 mg 3.3 ml 5.0 ml \n21 mg 3.5 ml 5.0 ml \n\n22.5 mg 3.8 ml 5.0 ml \n24 mg 4.0 ml 5.0 ml \n\n25.5 mg 4.3 ml 5.0 ml \n27 mg 4.5 ml 5.0 ml \n\n28.5 mg 4.8 ml 5.0 ml \n30 mg 5.0 ml 5.0 ml \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n92 \n\nPackage Leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nTamiflu 75 mg hard capsules \noseltamivir \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n\u2211 Keep this leaflet.

It can be used when you have flu symptoms, and the flu \nvirus is known to be going round in your community. \n\n\u2211 Tamiflu can also be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants above 1 year of age \nfor preventing flu, on a case-by-case basis \u2013 for instance, if you have been in contact with \nsomeone who has flu.  \n\n\u2211 Tamiflu may be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants (including full-term \nnewborn babies) as preventive treatment in exceptional circumstances \u2013 for example, if there \nis a global epidemic of flu (a flu pandemic) and the seasonal flu vaccine may not provide \nsufficient protection.  \n\n \nTamiflu contains oseltamivir, which belongs to a group of medicines named neuraminidase inhibitors. \nThese medicines prevent the flu virus from spreading inside the body. They help to ease or prevent the \nsymptoms of the flu virus infection. \n \nInfluenza, usually called flu, is an infection caused by a virus. The signs of flu often include a sudden \nfever (more than 37.8 \u00b0C), cough, runny or stuffy nose, headaches, muscle aches and extreme \ntiredness. These symptoms can also be caused by other infections. True influenza infection only \noccurs during annual outbreaks (epidemics) when flu viruses are spreading in the local community. \nOutside epidemic periods, flu-like symptoms are usually caused by a different type of illness.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Tamiflu \n \nDo not take Tamiflu: \n\u2211 if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to oseltamivir or any of the other ingredients of Tamiflu \n\nlisted in section 6.  \nTalk to your doctor if this applies to you. Do not take Tamiflu. \n \n\n\n\n93 \n\nWarnings and precautions: \nBefore you take Tamiflu, make sure the prescribing doctor knows \n\u2211 if you are allergic to other medicines \n\u2211 if you have problems with your kidneys. If so, your dose may need adjustment \n\u2211 if you have a severe medical condition, which may require immediate hospitalisation \n\u2211 if your immune system is not working \n\u2211 if you have chronic heart disease or respiratory disease. \n \nDuring treatment with Tamiflu, tell a doctor immediately: \n\u2211 if you notice changes in behaviour or mood (neuropsychiatric events), especially in children and \n\nadolescents). These may be signs of rare but serious side effects.  \n \nTamiflu is not a flu vaccine \nTamiflu is not a vaccine: it treats infection, or prevents the flu virus spreading. A vaccine gives you \nantibodies against the virus. Tamiflu will not change the effectiveness of a flu vaccine, and you might \nbe prescribed both by your doctor.  \n \nOther medicines and Tamiflu \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, or have recently taken any. This \nincludes medicines obtained without a prescription. The following medicines are particularly \nimportant: \n\n\u2211 chlorpropamide (used to treat diabetes) \n\u2211 methotrexate (used to treat e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) \n\u2211 phenylbutazone (used to treat pain and inflammation) \n\u2211 probenecid (used to treat gout) \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou must tell your doctor if you are pregnant, if you think you are pregnant or if you are trying to get \npregnant so that your doctor can decide if Tamiflu is right for you. \n \nThe effects on breast-fed infants are unknown. You must tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding so \nthat your doctor can decide if Tamiflu is right for you. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTamiflu has no effect on your ability to drive or use machines. \n \n \n3. How to take Tamiflu \n \nTake this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you \nare not sure. \n \nTake Tamiflu as soon as possible, ideally within two days of the flu symptoms starting. \n \nThe recommended doses \n \nFor treating flu, take two doses daily. It is usually convenient to take one dose in the morning and \none in the evening. It is important to complete the whole 5-day course, even if you start to feel \nbetter quickly. \n \nFor patients with a weak immune system, treatment will continue for 10 days. \n \nFor preventing flu or after being exposed to an infected person, take one dose daily for 10 days. It \nis best to take this in the mornings with breakfast. \n \n\n\n\n94 \n\nIn special situations, such as widespread flu or for patients with a weak immune system, treatment will \ncontinue for up to 6 or 12 weeks. \n \nThe recommended dose is based on the patient\u2019s body weight.You must use the amount of oral \ncapsules or suspension prescribed by the doctor.  \n \nAdults, and adolescents 13 years and over  \n \nBody weight Treating flu:  \n\ndose  \nfor 5 days  \n\nTreating flu \n(Immunocompromised \nPatients):  \ndose  \nfor 10 days * \n\nPreventing flu:  \ndose  \nfor 10 days \n\n40 kg or more 75 mg** twice daily 75 mg** twice daily 75 mg** once daily \n* For patients with a weak immune system, treatment is for 10 days. \n**75 mg can be made up of a 30 mg capsule plus a 45 mg capsule \n \nChildren 1 to 12 years  \n \nBody weight Treating flu:  \n\ndose  \nfor 5 days \n\nTreating flu \n(Immunocompromised \nPatients):  \ndose  \nfor 10 days* \n\nPreventing flu:  \ndose  \nfor 10 days \n\n10 to 15 kg 30 mg twice daily 30 mg twice daily 30 mg once daily \nMore than 15 kg and up \nto 23 kg \n\n45 mg twice daily 45 mg twice daily 45 mg once daily \n\nMore than 23 kg and up \nto 40 kg \n\n60 mg twice daily 60 mg twice daily 60 mg once daily \n\nMore than 40 kg 75 mg** twice daily 75 mg** twice daily 75 mg** once daily \n* For children with a weak immune system, treatment is for 10 days. \n**75 mg can be made up of a 30 mg capsule plus a 45 mg capsule \n \nInfants less than 1 year (0 to 12 months) \nGiving Tamiflu to infants less than 1 year old for preventing flu during flu pandemic should be based \nupon the judgment of a doctor after considering the potential benefit versus any potential risk to the \ninfant.  \n \nBody weight Treating flu:  \n\ndose  \nfor 5 days \n\nTreating flu \n(Immunocompromised \nPatients):  \ndose  \nfor 10 days* \n\nPreventing flu:  \ndose  \nfor 10 days \n\n3 kg to 10+ kg, \n \n\n3 mg per kg body  \nweight**, twice daily \n\n3 mg per kg body  \nweight**, twice daily \n\n3 mg per kg**,  \nonce daily \n\n* For infants with a weak immune system, treatment is for 10 days. \n**mg per kg = mg for each kilogram of the infant\u2019s body weight. For example: \nIf a 6-month-old weighs 8 kg, the dose is \n8 kg x 3mg per kg = 24 mg \n \nMethod of administration \nSwallow the capsules whole with water. Do not break or chew the capsules. \n \nTamiflu can be taken with or without food, although taking it with food can reduce the chance of \nfeeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). \n \n\n\n\n95 \n\nPeople who find it hard to take capsules can use a liquid medicine, Tamiflu oral suspension. If you \nneed Tamiflu oral suspension, but it\u2019s not available from your pharmacy, you can make a liquid form \nof Tamiflu from these capsules. See Making liquid Tamiflu at home, over the page. \n \nIf you take more Tamiflu than you should  \nStop taking Tamiflu and contact a doctor or pharmacist immediately. \nIn most cases of overdose, people have not reported any side effects. When side effects were reported, \nthey were similar to those from normal doses, as listed in section 4. \nOverdose has been reported to have occurred more frequently when Tamiflu was given to children \nthan to adults and adolescents. Caution should be exercised when preparing liquid Tamiflu for \nchildren and when administering Tamiflu capsules or liquid Tamiflu to children. \n \nIf you forget to take Tamiflu \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten capsule. \n \nIf you stop taking Tamiflu \nThere are no side effects when you stop Tamiflu. But if Tamiflu is stopped earlier than your doctor \ntold you, the symptoms of flu may come back. Always complete the course that your doctor \nprescribed. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Many of \nthe side effects listed below may also be caused by influenza. \n \nThe following serious side effects have been rarely reported since oseltamivir has been marketed: \n\n\u2211 Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions: severe allergic reactions, with face and skin \nswelling, itchy rashes, low blood pressure and breathing difficulties \n\n\u2211 Hepatic disorders (fulminant hepatitis, hepatic function disorder and jaundice): yellowing of \nthe skin and white of the eyes, change in stool color, changes in behaviour \n\n\u2211 Angioneurotic oedema: sudden onset of severe swelling of the skin mainly around the head \nand neck area, including eyes and tongue, with difficulties breathing \n\n\u2211 Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: complicated, possibly life-\nthreatening allergic reaction, severe inflammation of the outer and possibly inner skin, \ninitially with fever, sore throat, and fatigue, skin rashes, leading to blisters, peeling, shedding \nof larger areas of skin, possible breathing difficulties and low blood pressure \n\n\u2211 Gastrointestinal bleeding: prolonged bleeding from the large bowel or spitting up blood \n\u2211 Neuropsychiatric disorders, as described below. \n \n\nIf you notice any of these symptoms, get medical help immediately. \n \nThe most frequently (very common and common) reported side effects of Tamiflu are feeling or being \nsick (nausea, vomiting), stomach ache, stomach upset, headache and pain. These side effects mostly \noccur after the first dose of the medicine and will usually stop as treatment continues. The frequency \nof these effects is reduced if the medicinal product is taken with food. \n \nRare but serious effects: get medical help at once \n(These may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people)  \nDuring Tamiflu treatment, rare events have been reported that include \n\n\u2211 Convulsions and delirium, including altered level of consciousness \n\u2211 Confusion, abnormal behaviour \n\u2211 Delusions, hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, nightmares \n\n\n\n96 \n\nThese are reported primarily among children and adolescents and often started suddenly and resolved \nrapidly.

This pharmacy preparation is \nthe preferred option. \n \nIf the pharmacy preparation is not available either, you can make liquid Tamiflu from these capsules at \nhome. \n \nThe dose is the same for treating or preventing flu. The difference is how often it is given. \n \nMaking liquid Tamiflu at home \n \n\u2211 If you have the right capsule strength for the dose needed (a 75 mg dose), you will open the \n\ncapsule and stir its contents into one teaspoon (or less) of a suitable sweetened food product. \nThis is usually suitable for children over 1 year. See the upper set of instructions. \n\n \n\u2211 If you need smaller doses, making liquid Tamiflu from capsules involves extra steps. This is \n\nsuitable for younger children and babies: they usually need a Tamiflu dose of less than 30 mg. \nSee the lower set of instructions. \n\n \nAdults, adolescents 13 years and over, and children weighing 40 kg and over \n \nTo make a 75 mg dose, you need: \n\n\u2211 One 75 mg Tamiflu capsule \n\u2211 Sharp scissors \n\u2211 One small bowl  \n\u2211 Teaspoon (5 ml spoon) \n\u2211 Water \n\u2211 Sweet food to hide the bitter taste of the powder. \n Examples are: chocolate or cherry syrup, and dessert toppings such as caramel or fudge \n\nsauce. Or you can make sugar water: mix a teaspoon of water with three-quarters (3/4) of a \nteaspoon of sugar. \n\n \nStep 1: Check the dose is correct \n \n\nTo find the correct amount to use, find the patient\u2019s weight on the left of the table. \nLook at the right column to check the number of capsules you will need to give the patient for a \nsingle dose. The amount is the same whether treating or preventing flu. \n \n\n75 mg dose  \n\n \nYou should use only 75 mg capsules for 75 mg doses. Do not try to make a 75 mg dose by using \nthe contents of 30 mg or 45 mg capsules.  \n\n \nWeight \n \n\nDose of Tamiflu Number of capsules \n\n40 kg and over 75 mg 1 capsule \n \n\n\n\n101 \n\nNot for children who weigh less than 40 kg \nYou will need to prepare a dose of less than 75 mg for children who weigh less than 40 kg. See \nbelow.   \n\n \nStep 2: Pour all the powder into a bowl \n \n\nHold a 75 mg capsule upright over a bowl and carefully snip off the rounded tip with scissors.   \nPour all of the powder into the bowl. \nBe careful with the powder, because it may irritate your skin and eyes. \n\n \n\n   \n \nStep 3: Sweeten the powder and give the dose \n \n\nAdd a small amount \u2013 no more than one teaspoonful \u2013 of sweet food to the powder in the bowl.  \nThis is to hide the bitter taste of the Tamiflu powder. \nStir the mixture well.  \n\n \n\n   \n \n\nGive the whole contents of the bowl to the patient straight away.  \n \nIf there is some mixture left in the bowl, rinse the bowl with a small amount of water and get \nthe patient to drink it all. \n \nRepeat this procedure every time you need to give the medicine. \n\n \nInfants less than 1 year, and children weighing less than 40 kg \n \nTo make a smaller single dose, you need: \n\n\u2211 One 75 mg Tamiflu capsule \n\u2211 Sharp scissors \n\u2211 Two small bowls  \n\u2211 One large oral dose dispenser to measure out water \u2013 a 5 or 10 ml dispenser \n\u2211 One small oral dose dispenser showing measurements of 0.1 ml, to give the dose  \n\u2211 Teaspoon (5 ml spoon) \n\u2211 Water \n\u2211 Sweet food to hide the bitter taste of the Tamiflu. \n\nExamples are: chocolate or cherry syrup and dessert toppings such as caramel or fudge \nsauce.  \nOr you can make sugar water: mix a teaspoon of water with three-quarters (3/4) of a \nteaspoon of sugar. \n\n \nStep 1: Pour all the powder into a bowl \n\n \nHold a 75 mg capsule upright over one of the bowls and carefully snip off the rounded tip with \nscissors. Be careful with the powder: it may irritate your skin and eyes. \n\n\n\n102 \n\nPour all of the powder into the bowl, whatever the dose you are making. \nThe amount is the same whether you are treating or preventing flu. \n\n \n\n    \n \nStep 2: Add water to dilute the medicine \n \n\nUse the larger dispenser \nto draw up 12.5 ml water.  \n \nAdd the water to the \npowder in the bowl. \n\n \n \n\nStir the mixture with \nthe teaspoon for \nabout 2 minutes. \n\n \n \nDon\u2019t worry if not all of the powder dissolves. The undissolved powder is just inactive \ningredients. \n\n \nStep 3: Choose the correct amount for your child\u2019s weight \n \n\nLook up the child\u2019s weight on the left side of the table.  \nThe column on the right of the table shows how much of the liquid mixture you will need to \ndraw up.  \n\n \nInfants less than 1 year (including full-term newborn babies)  \n\nChild\u2019s weight \n(nearest) \n\nHow much mixture  \nto draw up \n\n3 kg 1.5 ml \n3.5 kg 1.8 ml \n4 kg 2.0 ml \n4.5 kg 2.3 ml \n5 kg 2.5 ml \n5.5 kg 2.8 ml \n6 kg 3.0 ml \n6.5 kg 3.3 ml \n7 kg 3.5 ml \n7.5 kg 3.8 ml \n8 kg 4.0 ml \n8.5 kg 4.3 ml \n9 kg 4.5 ml \n9.5 kg 4.8 ml \n10 kg or more 5.0 ml \n\n \n\n\n\n103 \n\nChildren 1 year or older, weighing less than 40 kg \nChild\u2019s weight \n(nearest) \n\nHow much mixture  \nto draw up \n\nUp to 15 kg 5.0 ml \n15 to 23 kg 7.5 ml \n23 to 40 kg 10.0 ml \n\n \nStep 4: Draw up the liquid mixture \n \n\nMake sure you have the right size dispenser.  \nDraw up the correct amount of liquid mixture from the first bowl.  \nDraw it up carefully so as not to include air bubbles. \nGently squirt the correct dose into the second bowl.  \n\n \n\n    \n \nStep 5: Sweeten and give to the child \n \n\nAdd a small amount \u2013 no more than one teaspoonful \u2013 of a sweet food to the second bowl. \nThis is to hide the bitter taste of the Tamiflu. \nMix the sweet food and Tamiflu liquid well.  \n\n \n\n   \n \n\nGive the whole contents of the second bowl (Tamiflu liquid mixture with sweet food added) to \nthe child straight away. \n \nIf there is anything left in the second bowl, rinse the bowl with a small amount of water and \nget the child to drink it all. For children unable to drink from a bowl, spoon-feed or use a bottle \nto feed the child the remaining liquid. \n \nGive the child something to drink.  \n \nThrow away any unused liquid left in the first bowl. \n \nRepeat this procedure every time you need to give the medicine. \n\n  \n\n\n\n104 \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nInformation for healthcare professionals only \n \nPatients who are unable to swallow capsules:  \nCommercially manufactured Tamiflu for oral suspension (6mg/ml) is the preferred product for \npaediatric and adult patients who have difficulties swallowing capsules or where lower doses are \nneeded.  In the event thatTamiflu powder for oral suspension is not available, the pharmacist may \ncompound a suspension (6 mg/ml) from Tamiflu capsules. If the pharmacy compounded suspension is \nalso not available, patients may prepare the suspension from capsules at home. \n \nOral dose dispensers (oral syringes) of appropriate volume and grading should be provided for \nadministering the pharmacy compounded suspension, and for the procedures involved in the home \npreparation. In both cases, the correct volumes should preferably be marked on the dispensers. For \nhome preparation, separate dispensers should be provided for taking the correct volume of water and \nfor measuring the Tamiflu-water mixture. For measuring 12.5 ml of water a 10 ml dispenser should be \nused. \n \nThe appropriate dispenser sizes for taking the correct volume of Tamiflu suspension (6 mg/ml) are \nshown below. \n \nInfants less than 1 year (including full-term new born babies):  \n \n\nDose of Tamiflu \nAmount of Tamiflu \n\nsuspension \nDispenser size to use \n\n(grading 0.1 ml) \n9 mg 1.5 ml 2.0 ml (or 3.0 ml) \n\n10 mg 1.7 ml 2.0 ml (or 3.0 ml) \n11.25 mg 1.9 ml 2.0 ml (or 3.0 ml) \n12.5 mg 2.1 ml 3.0 ml \n13.75 mg 2.3 ml 3.0 ml \n\n15 mg 2.5 ml 3.0 ml \n16.25 mg 2.7 ml 3.0 ml \n\n18 mg 3.0 ml 3.0 ml (or 5.0 ml) \n19.5 mg 3.3 ml 5.0 ml \n21 mg 3.5 ml 5.0 ml \n\n22.5 mg 3.8 ml 5.0 ml \n24 mg 4.0 ml 5.0 ml \n\n25.5 mg 4.3 ml 5.0 ml \n27 mg 4.5 ml 5.0 ml \n\n28.5 mg 4.8 ml 5.0 ml \n30 mg 5.0 ml 5.0 ml \n\n \nChildren 1 year or older, weighing less than 40 kg: \n \n\nDose of Tamiflu \nAmount of Tamiflu \n\nsuspension \nDispenser size to use \n\n(grading 0.1 ml) \n30 mg 5.0 ml 5.0 ml (or 10.0 ml) \n45 mg 7.5 ml 10.0 ml \n60 mg 10.0 ml  10.0 ml \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n105 \n\nPackage Leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nTamiflu 6 mg/ml powder for oral suspension \noseltamivir \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n\u2211 Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\u2211 If you have further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\u2211 This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\u2211 If you get any of the side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Tamiflu is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Tamiflu  \n3. How to take Tamiflu  \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Tamiflu  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Tamiflu is and what it is used for \n \n\u2211 Tamiflu is used for adults, adolescents, children and infants (including full-term newborn \n\nbabies) for treating flu (influenza). It can be used when you have flu symptoms, and the flu \nvirus is known to be going round in your community. \n\n\u2211 Tamiflu can also be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants above 1 year of age \nfor preventing flu, on a case-by-case basis \u2013 for instance, if you have been in contact with \nsomeone who has flu.  \n\n\u2211 Tamiflu may be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants (including full-term \nnewborn babies) as preventive treatment in exceptional circumstances \u2013 for example, if there \nis a global epidemic of flu (a flu pandemic) and the seasonal flu vaccine may not provide \nsufficient protection.  \n\n \nTamiflu contains oseltamivir, which belongs to a group of medicines named neuraminidase inhibitors. \nThese medicines prevent the flu virus from spreading inside the body. They help to ease or prevent the \nsymptoms of the flu virus infection. \n \nInfluenza, usually called flu, is an infection caused by a virus. The signs of flu often include a sudden \nfever (more than 37.8 \u00b0C), cough, runny or stuffy nose, headaches, muscle aches and extreme \ntiredness. These symptoms can also be caused by other infections. True influenza infection only \noccurs during annual outbreaks (epidemics) when flu viruses are spreading in the local community. \nOutside epidemic periods, flu-like symptoms are usually caused by a different type of illness.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Tamiflu \n \nDo not take Tamiflu: \n\u2211 if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to oseltamivir or any of the other ingredients of Tamiflu \n\nlisted in section 6.  \nTalk to your doctor if this applies to you. Do not take Tamiflu. \n \n\n\n\n106 \n\nWarnings and precautions: \nBefore you take Tamiflu, make sure the prescribing doctor knows \n\u2211 if you are allergic to other medicines \n\u2211 if you have problems with your kidneys. If so, your dose may need adjustment \n\u2211 if you have a severe medical condition, which may require immediate hospitalisation \n\u2211 if your immune system is not working \n\u2211 if you have chronic heart disease or respiratory disease. \n \nDuring treatment with Tamiflu, tell a doctor immediately: \n\u2211 if you notice changes in behaviour or mood (neuropsychiatric events), especially in children and \n\nadolescents). These may be signs of rare but serious side effects.  \n \nTamiflu is not a flu vaccine \nTamiflu is not a vaccine: it treats infection, or prevents the flu virus spreading. A vaccine gives you \nantibodies against the virus. Tamiflu will not change the effectiveness of a flu vaccine, and you might \nbe prescribed both by your doctor.  \n \nOther medicines and Tamiflu \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, or have recently taken any. This \nincludes medicines obtained without a prescription. The following medicines are particularly \nimportant: \n\n\u2211 chlorpropamide (used to treat diabetes) \n\u2211 methotrexate (used to treat e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) \n\u2211 phenylbutazone (used to treat pain and inflammation) \n\u2211 probenecid (used to treat gout) \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou must tell your doctor if you are pregnant, if you think you are pregnant or if you are trying to get \npregnant so that your doctor can decide if Tamiflu is right for you. \n \nThe effects on breast-fed infants are unknown. You must tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding so \nthat your doctor can decide if Tamiflu is right for you. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTamiflu has no effect on your ability to drive or use machines. \n \nTamiflu contains fructose \nBefore you take Tamiflu, make sure your prescribing doctor knows if you have hereditary fructose \nintolerance. This medicine contains sorbitol, which is a form of fructose.  \nSorbitol can have a mild laxative effect. \n \n \n3. How to take Tamiflu \n \nTake this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you \nare not sure. \n \nAlways use the oral dispenser that is provided in the box and has markings indicating the dose in \nmillilitres (ml). \n \nTake Tamiflu as soon as possible, ideally within two days of the flu symptoms starting. \n \n\n\n\n107 \n\nThe recommended doses \n \nFor treating flu, take two doses daily. It is usually convenient to take one dose in the morning and \none in the evening. It is important to complete the whole 5-day course, even if you start to feel \nbetter quickly. \n \nFor patients with a weak immune system, treatment will continue for 10 days. \n \nFor preventing flu or after being exposed to an infected person, take one dose daily for 10 days. It \nis best to take this in the mornings with breakfast. \n \nIn special situations, such as widespread flu, or for patients with a weak immune system, treatment \nwill continue for up to 6 or 12 weeks. \n \nThe recommended dose is based on the patient\u2019s body weight. You must use the amount of \nTamiflu prescribed by the doctor. The oral suspension can be used by people who find it hard to take \ncapsules. See the instructions overleaf to make up and give a dose. \n \nAdults, and adolescents 13 years and over \n \nBody weight Treating flu:  \n\ndose  \nfor 5 days \n\nTreating flu \n(Immunocompromised \nPatients):  \ndose  \nfor 10 days* \n\nPreventing flu: \ndose  \nfor 10 days \n\n40 kg or more 12.5 ml** twice daily 12.5 ml** twice daily 12.5 ml** once \ndaily \n\n*For patients with a weak immune system, treatment is for 10 days. \n**12.5 ml is made up of a 5 ml dose plus a 7.5 ml dose \n \nChildren 1 to 12 years  \n \nBody weight Treating flu: \n\ndose  \nfor 5 days \n\nTreating flu \n(Immunocompromised \nPatients): \ndose  \nfor 10 days* \n\nPreventing flu: \ndose  \nfor 10 days \n\n10 kg to 15 kg 5.0 ml twice daily 5.0 ml twice daily 5.0 ml once daily \nMore than 15 kg,  \nup to 23 kg \n\n7.5 ml twice daily 7.5 ml twice daily 7.5 ml once daily \n\nMore than 23 kg,  \nup to 40 kg \n\n10.0 ml twice daily 10.0 ml twice daily 10.0 ml once daily \n\nMore than 40 kg 12.5 ml** twice daily 12.5 ml** twice daily 12.5 ml** once \ndaily \n\n*For children with a weak immune system, treatment is for 10 days. \n**12.5 ml is made up of a 5 ml dose plus a 7.5 ml dose \n \nInfants less than 1 year (0 to 12 months) \nGiving Tamiflu to infants less than 1 year old for preventing flu during flu pandemic should be based \nupon the judgment of a doctor after considering the potential benefit versus any potential risk to the \ninfant.  \nA 3 ml oral dispenser (graduated in 0.1 ml steps) should be used for dosing infants less than 1 year old \nrequiring 1 to 3 ml of Tamiflu oral suspension.  \n \n\n\n\n108 \n\nBody weight Treating flu: \ndose \nfor 5 days \n\nTreating flu \n(Immunocompromised \nPatients): \ndose \nfor 10 days* \n\nPreventing flu: \ndose  \nfor 10 days \n\nDispenser size \nto use \n\n3 kg 1.5 ml twice daily 1.5 ml twice daily 1.5 ml once daily 3 ml \n3.5 kg 1.8 ml twice daily 1.8 ml twice daily 1.8 ml once daily 3 ml \n4 kg 2.0 ml twice daily 2.0 ml twice daily 2.0 ml once daily 3 ml \n4.5 kg 2.3 ml twice daily 2.3 ml twice daily 2.3 ml once daily 3 ml \n5 kg 2.5 ml twice daily 2.5 ml twice daily 2.5 ml once daily 3 ml \n5.5 kg 2.8 ml twice daily 2.8 ml twice daily 2.8 ml once daily 3 ml \n6 kg 3.0 ml twice daily 3.0 ml twice daily 3.0 ml once daily 3 ml \n> 6 to 7 kg 3.5 ml twice daily 3.5 ml twice daily 3.5 ml once daily 10 ml \n> 7 to 8 kg 4.0 ml twice daily 4.0 ml twice daily 4.0 ml once daily 10 ml \n> 8 to 9 kg 4.5 ml twice daily 4.5 ml twice daily 4.5 ml once daily 10 ml \n> 9 to 10 kg 5.0 ml twice daily 5.0 ml twice daily 5.0 ml once daily 10 ml \n\n*For patients with a weak immune system, treatment is for 10 days. \n \nIf you take more Tamiflu than you should \nStop taking Tamiflu and contact a doctor or pharmacist immediately. \nIn most cases of overdose, people have not reported any side effects. When side effects were reported, \nthey were similar to those from normal doses, as listed in section 4. \nOverdose has been reported to have occurred more frequently when Tamiflu was given to children \nthan to adults and adolescents. Caution should be exercised when preparing liquid Tamiflu for \nchildren and when administering Tamiflu capsules or liquid Tamiflu to children. \n \nIf you forget to take Tamiflu \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Tamiflu \nThere are no side effects when you stop Tamiflu. But if Tamiflu is stopped earlier than your doctor \ntold you, the symptoms of flu may come back. Always complete the course that your doctor \nprescribed. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Many of \nthe side effects listed below may also be caused by influenza. \n \nThe following serious side effects have been rarely reported since oseltamivir has been marketed: \n\n\u2211 Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions: severe allergic reactions, with face and skin \nswelling, itchy rashes, low blood pressure and breathing difficulties \n\n\u2211 Hepatic disorders (fulminant hepatitis, hepatic function disorder and jaundice): yellowing of \nthe skin and white of the eyes, change in stool color, changes in behaviour \n\n\u2211 Angioneurotic oedema: sudden onset of severe swelling of the skin mainly around the head \nand neck area, including eyes and tongue, with difficulties breathing \n\n\u2211 Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: complicated, possibly life-\nthreatening allergic reaction, severe inflammation of the outer and possibly inner skin, \ninitially with fever, sore throat, and fatigue, skin rashes, leading to blisters, peeling, shedding \nof larger areas of skin, possible breathing difficulties and low blood pressure \n\n\u2211 Gastrointestinal bleeding: prolonged bleeding from the large bowel or spitting up blood \n\u2211 Neuropsychiatric disorders, as described below. \n\n\n\n109 \n\nIf you notice any of these symptoms, get medical help immediately. \n \nThe most frequently (very common and common) reported side effects of Tamiflu are feeling or being \nsick (nausea, vomiting), stomach ache, stomach upset, headache and pain. These side effects mostly \noccur after the first dose of the medicine and will usually stop as treatment continues. The frequency \nof these effects is reduced if the medicinal product is taken with food. \n \nRare but serious effects: get medical help at once \n(These may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people)  \nDuring Tamiflu treatment, rare events have been reported that include \n\n\u2211 Convulsions and delirium, including altered level of consciousness \n\u2211 Confusion, abnormal behaviour \n\u2211 Delusions, hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, nightmares \n\nThese are reported primarily among children and adolescents and often started suddenly and resolved \nrapidly.

See the first set of instructions. You only need to do this \nonce, at the beginning of your course.  \n\n \nStage 2 Measure and give the correct dose \n\nShake the suspension well and draw the appropriate recommended dose into the dispenser. See \nthe second set of instructions. You will need to do this every time you need a dose. \n\n \nStage 1: Prepare a new bottle of the medicine \n \nYou will need: \n\n\u2211 The bottle, containing Tamiflu powder (in the medicine pack) \n\u2211 The bottle cap (in the medicine pack) \n\u2211 A plastic measuring jug (in the medicine pack) \n\u2211 The plastic bottle adapter (in the medicine pack) \n\u2211 Water \n\n \n\n  \n \n\u2211 Tap the bottle to loosen the powder  \n\nTap the closed bottle gently several times to loosen the powder. \n \n\u2211 Use the jug to measure 55 ml of water  \n\nThe measuring jug in the pack has a line marked to show you an exact amount.  \nFill it with water to the indicated level.  \n\n \n\u2211 Add all the water, close and shake  \n\nPour all of the water from the jug into the bottle, onto the powder.  \nAlways use 55 ml of water, whatever the dose you need. \nPut the cap back on the bottle. Shake the bottle well for 15 seconds. \n\n \n\u2211 Press in the adapter \n\nOpen the bottle and press the bottle adapter hard into the neck of the bottle.  \n \n\n\u2211 Close the bottle again \nScrew the cap tightly onto the top of the bottle, which now includes the adapter.  \nThis will make sure that the bottle adapter fits in the bottle in the right position. \n\n \nYou now have a bottle of Tamiflu oral suspension ready to measure out a dose. You will not need to \nprepare it again unless you start a new bottle.  \n \n\n\n\n114 \n\n \nStage 2: Measure and give the correct dose \n \nYou will need:  \n\n\u2211 A bottle of prepared Tamiflu oral suspension \n\u2211 Depending on the required dose you will need the 3 ml oral dispenser (orange plunger, \n\n0.1 ml graduation) or the 10 ml oral dispenser (transparent plunger 0.5 ml graduation) \nfrom the medicine pack.  \n\n\u2211 For doses from 1.0  ml to 3.0 ml, the 3 ml oral dispenser should be used. For doses above 3.0 \nml to 10 ml, 10 ml oral dispenser should be used. \n\n \nAlways use the oral dispenser provided with your medicine to measure a correct dose.  \n\n                   \n \n\u2211 Shake the bottle \n\nCheck the cap is secure, and then shake the bottle of Tamiflu oral suspension. \nAlways shake well before use. \n\n \n\u2211 Prepare the oral dispenser \n\nDepending on the required dose, use the 3 ml dispenser (orange plunger) or the 10 ml oral \ndispenser (transparent plunger) provided in the pack.  \nPush the plunger completely down toward the tip of the dispenser.  \n\n \n\n  \n \n\u2211 Fill the dispenser with the correct dose \n\nUnscrew the cap from the bottle. \nPush the tip of the dispenser into the bottle adapter.  \nThen turn the whole unit upside down (bottle and dispenser together).  \n \n\n\n\n115 \n\n \n \nSlowly pull out the plunger to draw medicine into the dispenser.  \nStop at the mark that shows the dose you need.  \nTurn the whole unit upright. \nRemove the dispenser from the bottle.  \n \n\n\u2211 Give the medicine into the mouth \nDeliver the suspension directly into the mouth by pushing down the plunger of the dispenser. \nMake sure the medicine is swallowed.  \nYou may drink and eat something after taking the medicine. \n \n\n\u2211 Close the bottle, keep it safe \nPut the cap back on the bottle. Keep it out of sight and reach of children. \n \nStore the medicine below 25 \u00ba C for up to 10 days. See 5 How to store Tamiflu, overleaf. \n\n \nTake the dispenser apart straight after dosing, and rinse both parts of the dispenser under running tap \nwater. \n\n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

newborn babies) for treating flu (influenza). it can be used when you have flu symptoms, and the flu virus is known to be going round in your community. \u2211 tamiflu can also be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infants above 1 year of age for preventing flu, on a case-by-case basis for instance, if you have been in contact with someone who has flu. \u2211 tamiflu may be prescribed for adults, adolescents, children and infant (including full-term newborn babies) as preventive treatment in exceptional circumstances for example, if there is a global epidemic of flu (a flu pandemic) and the seasonal flu vaccine may not provide sufficient protection. tamiflu contains oseltamivir, which belongs to a group of medicines named neuraminidase inhibitors. these medicines prevent the flu virus from spreading inside the body. they help to ease or prevent the symptoms of the flu virus infection. influenza, usually called flu, is an infection caused by a virus. the signs of flu often include a sudden fever (more than 37.8 ), cough, runny or stuffy nose, headaches, muscle aches and extreme tiredness. these symptoms can also be caused by other infections. true influenza infection only occurs during annual outbreaks (epidemics) when flu viruses are spreading in the local community. outside epidemic periods, flu-like symptoms are usually caused by a different type of

be taken with or without food, although taking it with food can reduce the chance of feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). people who find it hard to take capsules can use a liquid medicine, tamiflu oral suspension. if you need tamiflu oral suspension, but it's not available from your pharmacy, you can make a liquid form of tamiflu from these capsules. see making liquid tamiflu at home, over the page. if you take more tamiflu than you should stop taking tamiflu and contact a doctor or pharmacist immediately. in most cases of overdose, people have not reported any side effects. when side effects were reported, they were similar to those from normal doses, as listed in section 4. overdose has been reported to have occurred more frequently when tamiflu was given to children than to adults and adolescents. caution should be exercised when preparing liquid tamiflu for children and when administering tamiflu capsules or liquid tamiflu to children. if you forget to take tamiflu do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten capsule. if you stop taking tamiflu there are no side effects when you stop tamiflu. but if tamiflu is stopped earlier than your doctor told you, the symptoms of flu may come back. always complete the course that your doctor prescribed. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.",
