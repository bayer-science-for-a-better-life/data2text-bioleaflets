NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nINVIRASE 500 mg film-coated tablets. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne film-coated tablet contains 500 mg of saquinavir as saquinavir mesilate. \n \nExcipient with known effect: Lactose monohydrate: 38.5 mg. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nLight orange to greyish or brownish orange film-coated tablet of oval cylindrical biconvex shape with \nthe marking \"SQV 500\" on the one side and \"ROCHE\" on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nInvirase is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adult patients. Invirase should only be given \nin combination with ritonavir and other antiretroviral medicinal products (see section 4.2). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nTherapy with Invirase should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV \ninfection. \n \nIn combination with ritonavir \nThe recommended dose of Invirase is 1000 mg (2 x 500 mg film-coated tablets) two times daily with \nritonavir 100 mg two times daily in combination with other antiretroviral agents. For treatment-naive \npatients initiating treatment with Invirase/ritonavir, the starting recommended dose of Invirase is \n500 mg (1 x 500 mg film-coated tablet) two times daily with ritonavir 100 mg two times daily in \ncombination with other antiretroviral agents for the first 7 days of treatment. After 7 days, the \nrecommended dose of Invirase is 1000 mg two times daily with ritonavir 100 mg two times daily in \ncombination with other antiretroviral agents. Patients switching immediately from treatment with \nanother protease inhibitor taken with ritonavir or from a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor \nbased regimen, except rilpivirine (see section 4.5), without a wash-out period, should however initiate \nand continue Invirase at the standard recommended dose of 1000 mg two times daily with ritonavir \n100 mg two times daily. \n \nRenal impairment: \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Caution \nshould be exercised in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment: \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for HIV-infected patients with mild hepatic impairment. No dosage \nadjustment seems warranted for patients with moderate hepatic impairment based on limited data. \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nClose monitoring of safety (including signs of cardiac arrhythmia) and of virologic response is \nrecommended due to increased variability of the exposure in this population. Invirase/ritonavir is \ncontraindicated in patients with decompensated hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population: \nThe safety and activity of saquinavir boosted with ritonavir in HIV-infected patients less than 2 years \nhave not been established. No dose recommendations for paediatric patients ≥2 years of age could be \nestablished that are both effective and below thresholds of concern for QT and PR interval \nprolongation. \n \nAdults over 60 years: \nThe experience with Invirase in adults over 60 years is limited. \n \nMethod of administration \nInvirase film-coated tablets should be swallowed whole and taken at the same time as ritonavir with or \nafter food (see section 5.2).  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nInvirase is contraindicated in patients with: \n\n• hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n• decompensated liver disease (see section 4.4) \n• congenital or documented acquired QT prolongation  \n• electrolyte disturbances, particularly uncorrected hypokalaemia \n• clinically relevant bradycardia \n• clinically relevant heart failure with reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction \n• previous history of symptomatic arrhythmias \n• concurrent therapy with any of the following drugs, which may interact and result in \n\npotentially life-threatening undesirable effects (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8): \n- drugs that prolong the QT and/or PR interval (see sections 4.4 and 4.5) \n- midazolam administered orally (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, see \n\nsection 4.5), triazolam (potential for prolonged or increased sedation, respiratory \ndepression) \n\n- simvastatin, lovastatin (increased risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis) \n- ergot alkaloids (e.g. ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine) \n\n(potential for acute ergot toxicity) \n- rifampicin (risk of severe hepatocellular toxicity) (see sections 4.4, 4.5, and 4.8) \n- quetiapine (risk of coma, see section 4.5).  \n- lurasidone (potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions, see section 4.5) \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nConsiderations when initiating Invirase therapy: Invirase should not be given as the sole protease \ninhibitor. Invirase should only be given in combination with ritonavir (see section 4.2). Invirase is not \nrecommended for use in combination with cobicistat as dosing recommendations for this combination \nhave not been established. \n \nPatients should be informed that saquinavir is not a cure for HIV infection and that they may continue \nto acquire illnesses associated with advanced HIV infection, including opportunistic infections. While \neffective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce the risk \nof sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission should \nbe taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nPatients should also be advised that they might experience undesirable effects associated with co-\nadministered medications.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nCardiac conduction and repolarisation abnormalities:  \nDose-dependent prolongations of QT and PR intervals have been observed in healthy volunteers \nreceiving ritonavir-boosted Invirase (see section 5.1). Concomitant use of ritonavir-boosted \nInvirase with other medicinal products that prolong the QT and/or PR interval is therefore \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nSince the magnitude of QT and PR prolongation increases with increasing concentrations of \nsaquinavir, the recommended dose of ritonavir-boosted Invirase should not be exceeded. Ritonavir-\nboosted Invirase at a dose of 2000 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily has not been \nstudied with regard to the risk of QT prolongation and is not recommended. Other medicinal products \nknown to increase the plasma concentration of ritonavir-boosted Invirase should be used with caution. \n \nWomen and elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT and/or PR \ninterval. \n \n• Clinical Management: \nConsideration should be given for performing baseline and follow-up electrocardiograms after \ninitiation of treatment, e.g. in patients taking concomitant medication known to increase the exposure \nof saquinavir (see section 4.5). If signs or symptoms suggesting cardiac arrhythmia occur, continuous \nmonitoring of ECG should be performed. Ritonavir-boosted Invirase should be discontinued if \narrhythmias are demonstrated, or if prolongation occurs in the QT or PR interval. \n \nPatients initiating therapy with ritonavir-boosted Invirase: \n\n- An ECG should be performed on all patients prior to initiation of treatment: patients with \na QT interval > 450 msec should not use ritonavir-boosted Invirase. For patients with a \nQT interval < 450 msec, an on treatment ECG is recommended. \n\n- For treatment-naïve patients initiating treatment with Invirase/ritonavir 500/100 mg two \ntimes daily for the first 7 days of treatment followed by Invirase 1000 mg two times daily \nwith ritonavir 100 mg two times daily after 7 days and with a baseline QT interval < 450 \nmsec, an on-treatment ECG is suggested after approximately 10 days of therapy. \n\n- Patients demonstrating a subsequent increase in QT-interval to > 480 msec or \nprolongation over pre-treatment by > 20 msec should discontinue ritonavir-boosted \nInvirase. \n\n \nPatients stable on ritonavir-boosted Invirase and requiring concomitant medication with \npotential to increase the exposure of saquinavir or patients on medication with potential to \nincrease the exposure of saquinavir and requiring concomitant ritonavir-boosted Invirase where \nno alternative therapy is available and the benefits outweigh the risks: \n\n- An ECG should be performed prior to initiation of the concomitant therapy: patients with \na QT interval > 450 msec should not initiate the concomitant therapy (see section 4.5). \n\n- For patients with a baseline QT interval < 450 msec, an on-treatment ECG should be \nperformed. For patients demonstrating a subsequent increase in QT-interval to > 480 msec \nor increase by > 20 msec after commencing concomitant therapy, the physician should use \nbest clinical judgment to discontinue either ritonavir-boosted Invirase or the concomitant \ntherapy or both. \n\n \n• Essential Patient Information: \nPrescribers must ensure that patients are fully informed regarding the following information on \ncardiac conduction and repolarisation abnormalities:  \n\n- Patients initiating therapy with ritonavir boosted Invirase should be warned of the \narrhythmogenic risk associated with QT and PR prolongation and told to report any sign \nor symptom suspicious of cardiac arrhythmia (e.g., chest palpitations, syncope, \npresyncope) to their physician. \n\n- Physicians should enquire about any known familial history of sudden death at a young \nage as this may be suggestive of congenital QT prolongation. \n\n- Patients should be advised of the importance not to exceed the recommended dose. \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n- Each patient (or patient’s caregiver) should be reminded to read the Package Leaflet \nincluded in the Invirase Package. \n\n \nLiver disease: The safety and efficacy of saquinavir/ritonavir has not been established in patients with \nsignificant underlying liver disorders, therefore saquinavir/ritonavir should be used cautiously in this \npatient population. Invirase/ritonavir is contraindicated in patients with decompensated liver disease \n(see section 4.3). Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral \ntherapy are at an increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events. In case of \nconcomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information \nfor these medicinal products. \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be \nmonitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \n \nNo dosage adjustment seems warranted for patients with moderate hepatic impairment based on \nlimited data. Close monitoring of safety (including signs of cardiac arrhythmia) and of virologic \nresponse is recommended due to increased variability of the exposure in this population (see sections \n4.2 and 5.2). There have been reports of exacerbation of chronic liver dysfunction, including portal \nhypertension, in patients with underlying hepatitis B or C, cirrhosis and other underlying liver \nabnormalities. \n \nRenal impairment: Renal clearance is only a minor elimination pathway, the principal route of \nmetabolism and excretion for saquinavir being via the liver. Therefore, no initial dose adjustment is \nnecessary for patients with renal impairment. However, patients with severe renal impairment have not \nbeen studied and caution should be exercised when prescribing saquinavir/ritonavir in this population.  \n \nPatients with chronic diarrhoea or malabsorption: No information on boosted saquinavir and only \nlimited information on the safety and efficacy of unboosted saquinavir is available for patients \nsuffering from chronic diarrhoea or malabsorption. It is unknown whether patients with such \nconditions could receive subtherapeutic saquinavir levels. \n \nPaediatric population: The safety and activity of saquinavir boosted with ritonavir in HIV-infected \npatients less than 2 years have not been established. No dose recommendations for paediatric patients \n≥2 years of age could be established that are both effective and below thresholds of concern for QT \nand PR interval prolongation. Therefore, use in this population is not recommended. \n \nAdults over 60 years: The experience with Invirase in adults over 60 years is limited. Elderly patients \nmay be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT and/or PR interval. \n \nLactose intolerance: Invirase 500 mg film-coated tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary \nproblems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption \nshould not take this medicine. \n \nPatients with haemophilia: There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin \nhaematomas and haemarthroses, in haemophiliac patients type A and B treated with protease inhibitors. \nIn some patients additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment \nwith protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal \nrelationship has been evoked, although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated. \nHaemophiliac patients should therefore be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters: An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose \nmay occur during antiretroviral therapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and \nlifestyle. For lipids, there is in some cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there \nis no strong evidence relating this to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nglucose reference is made to established HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed \nas clinically appropriate. \n \nOsteonecrosis: Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, \nalcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis \nhave been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV–disease and/or long-term exposure to \ncombination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they \nexperience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome: In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time \nof institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to \nasymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or \naggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or \nmonths of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or \nfocal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms \nshould be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. \n \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \ncan occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nCYP3A4 Interactions: Saquinavir could interact and modify the pharmacokinetics of other drugs that \nare substrates for CYP3A4 and/or P-gp and should be used with caution. Conversely, other drugs that \ninduce CYP3A4 may also reduce saquinavir plasma concentrations. Monitoring of saquinavir plasma \nconcentration might be indicated. See table 1, section 4.5, for drugs known and/or having the potential \nto interact with saquinavir and specific recommendations. \n \nInteraction with ritonavir: The recommended dose of Invirase and ritonavir is 1000 mg Invirase plus \n100 mg ritonavir twice daily. Higher doses of ritonavir have been shown to be associated with an \nincreased incidence of adverse events. Co-administration of saquinavir and ritonavir has led to severe \nadverse events, mainly diabetic ketoacidosis and liver disorders, especially in patients with pre-\nexisting liver disease.  \n \nInteraction with tipranavir: Concomitant use of boosted saquinavir and tipranavir, co-administered \nwith low dose ritonavir in a dual-boosted regimen, results in a significant decrease in saquinavir \nplasma concentrations (see section 4.5). Therefore, the co-administration of boosted saquinavir and \ntipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is not recommended. \n \nInteraction with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: Caution must be exercised if Invirase/ritonavir is \nused concurrently with atorvastatin, which is metabolised to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. In this \nsituation a reduced dose of atorvastatin should be considered. If treatment with a HMG-CoA reductase \ninhibitor is indicated, pravastatin or fluvastatin is recommended with careful monitoring (see section \n4.5). \n \nOral contraceptives: Because concentration of ethinyl estradiol may be decreased when co-\nadministered with Invirase/ritonavir, alternative or additional contraceptive measures should be used \nwhen oestrogen-based oral contraceptives are co-administered (see section 4.5). \n \nGlucocorticoids: Concomitant use of boosted saquinavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that \nare metabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs \nthe risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nInteraction with efavirenz: The combination of saquinavir and ritonavir with efavirenz has been \nshown to be associated with an increased risk of liver toxicity; liver function should be monitored \nwhen saquinavir and ritonavir are co-administered with efavirenz. No clinically significant alterations \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nof either saquinavir or efavirenz concentration were noted in studies in healthy volunteers or in HIV-\ninfected patients (see section 4.5). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nMost drug interaction studies with saquinavir have been completed with unboosted Invirase or \nunboosted saquinavir soft capsules. A limited number of studies have been completed with ritonavir \nboosted Invirase or ritonavir boosted saquinavir soft capsules. \n \nObservations from drug interaction studies done with unboosted saquinavir might not be \nrepresentative of the effects seen with saquinavir/ritonavir therapy. Furthermore, results seen with \nsaquinavir soft capsules may not predict the magnitude of these interactions with Invirase/ritonavir. \n \nThe metabolism of saquinavir is mediated by cytochrome P450, with the specific isoenzyme CYP3A4 \nresponsible for 90 % of the hepatic metabolism. Additionally, in vitro studies have shown that \nsaquinavir is a substrate and an inhibitor for P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Therefore, medicinal products that \neither share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 and/or P-gp activity (see \"Other potential \ninteractions\") may modify the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir. Similarly, saquinavir might also \nmodify the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products that are substrates for CYP3A4 or P-gp. \n \nRitonavir can affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products because it is a potent inhibitor \nof CYP3A4 and P-gp. Therefore, when saquinavir is co-administered with ritonavir, consideration \nshould be given to the potential effects of ritonavir on other medicinal products (see the Summary of \nProduct Characteristics for Norvir). \n \nBased on the finding of dose-dependent prolongations of QT and PR intervals in healthy volunteers \nreceiving Invirase/ritonavir (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1), additive effects on QT and PR interval \nprolongation may occur. Therefore, concomitant use of ritonavir-boosted Invirase with other \nmedicinal products that prolong the QT and/or PR interval is contraindicated. The combination of \nInvirase/ritonavir with drugs known to increase the exposure of saquinavir is not recommended and \nshould be avoided when alternative treatment options are available. If concomitant use is deemed \nnecessary because the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk, particular caution is \nwarranted (see section 4.4; for information on individual drugs, see Table 1). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nTable 1: Interactions and dose recommendations with other medicinal products \n \nMedicinal product by \ntherapeutic area (dose of \nInvirase used in study) \n\nInteraction Recommendations concerning co-\nadministration \n\nAntiretroviral agents \nNucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) \n\n  \n\n- Zalcitabine and/or \nZidovudine \n \n\nNo pharmacokinetic interaction \nstudies have been completed.  \nUse of unboosted saquinavir with \nzalcitabine and/or zidovudine has \nbeen studied in adults. Absorption, \ndistribution and elimination of each of \nthe drugs are unchanged when they \nare used together. \n \nInteraction with zalcitabine is \nunlikely due to different routes of \nmetabolism and excretion. \nFor zidovudine (200 mg every 8 \nhours) a 25 % decrease in AUC was \nreported when combined with \nritonavir (300 mg every 6 hours).

Clinical experience in pregnant women is limited: Congenital malformations, \nbirth defects and other disorders (without a congenital malformation) have been reported rarely in \npregnant women who had received saquinavir in combination with other antiretroviral agents. \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\nHowever, so far the available data are insufficient and do not identify specific risks for the unborn \nchild. Saquinavir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential \nrisk to the foetus (see section 5.3). \n \nBreast-feeding: There are no laboratory animal or human data available on secretion of saquinavir in \nbreast milk. The potential for adverse reactions to saquinavir in nursing infants cannot be assessed, \nand therefore, breast-feeding should be discontinued prior to receiving saquinavir. It is recommended \nthat HIV-infected women do not breast feed their infants under any circumstances in order to avoid \ntransmission of HIV. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nInvirase may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

Summary of the safety profile \n \nLimited data is available from two clinical studies where the safety of saquinavir soft capsule \n(1000 mg twice daily) used in combination with low dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) for at least 48 \nweeks was studied in 311 patients.  \n \nThe following adverse events with an at least possible relationship to ritonavir boosted saquinavir (i.e. \nadverse reactions) were reported most frequently: nausea, diarrhoea, fatigue, vomiting, flatulence, and \nabdominal pain. \n \nThe following adverse events were reported with the highest severity (grades 3 and 4): anaemia, \ndiabetes mellitus, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and fatigue.  \n \nFor comprehensive dose adjustment recommendations and drug-associated adverse reactions for \nritonavir and other medicinal products used in combination with saquinavir, physicians should refer to \nthe Summary of Product Characteristics for each of these medicinal products. \n \nb. Tabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions from two pivotal studies of saquinavir soft capsule (1000 mg twice daily) used in \ncombination with low dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) for at least 48 weeks are summarised in \nTable 2.  Also included are serious and non-serious adverse reactions from post-marketing \nspontaneous reports for which a causal relationship to saquinavir cannot be excluded.  \nAdverse reactions are presented according to the MedDRA system organ classification.

Description of selected adverse reactions \n \nMetabolic parameters \nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section \n4.4). \n \nThere have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and \nhaemarthroses, in haemophilic patients type A and B treated with protease inhibitors (see section 4.4). \n \nIncreased CPK, myalgia, myositis and rarely, rhabdomyolysis have been reported with protease \ninhibitors, particularly in combination with nucleoside analogues. Cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or \nlong-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). The frequency of this is unknown \n(see section 4.4).  \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nd. Paediatric population \n \nLimited safety data are available from a paediatric study (NV20911, n=18) in which the safety of \nsaquinavir hard capsules (50 mg/kg bid, not to exceed 1000 mg bid) used in combination with low \ndose ritonavir oral solution (3 mg/kg bid for body weight from 5 to <15 kg, 2.5 mg/kg bid for body \nweight from 15 to 40 kg and 100 mg bid for body weight >40 kg) has been studied in paediatric \npatients aged 4 months to 6 years old. \n \nFour patients in the study experienced five adverse events that were considered related to trial \ntreatment. These events were vomiting (3 patients), abdominal pain (1 patient) and diarrhoea (1 \npatient). No unexpected adverse events were observed in this study. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is limited experience of overdose with saquinavir. Whereas acute or chronic overdose of \nsaquinavir alone did not result in major complications, in combination with other protease inhibitors, \noverdose symptoms and signs such as general weakness, fatigue, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, hair loss, \ndry mouth, hyponatraemia, weight loss and orthostatic hypotension have been observed. There is no \nspecific antidote for overdose with saquinavir. Treatment of overdose with saquinavir should consist \nof general supportive measures, including monitoring of vital signs and ECG, and observations of the \npatient’s clinical status. If indicated, prevention of further absorption can be considered. Since \nsaquinavir is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of the \nactive substance. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmaco-therapeutic group: Antiviral agent, ATC code J05A E01 \n \nMechanism of action: The HIV protease is an essential viral enzyme required for the specific \ncleavage of viral gag and gag-pol polyproteins. Saquinavir selectively inhibits the HIV protease, \nthereby preventing the creation of mature infectious virus particles. \n \nQT and PR prolongation on electrocardiogram: The effects of therapeutic (1000/100 mg twice daily) \nand supra-therapeutic (1500/100 mg twice daily) doses of Invirase/ritonavir on the QT interval were \nevaluated in a 4-way crossover, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) \nstudy in healthy male and female volunteers aged 18 to 55 years old (N=59). On Day 3 of dosing, \nECG measurements were done over a period of 20 hours. The Day 3 timepoint was chosen since the \npharmacokinetic exposure was maximum on that day in a previous 14-day multiple dose \npharmacokinetic study. On Day 3, mean Cmax values were approximately 3-fold and 4-fold higher with \nthe therapeutic and supra-therapeutic doses, respectively, relative to the mean Cmax observed at steady \nstate with the therapeutic dose administered to HIV patients. On Day 3, the upper 1-sided 95% \nconfidence interval of the maximum mean difference in pre-dose baseline-corrected QTcS (study \nspecific heart rate corrected QT) between the active drug and placebo arms was > 10 msec for the two \nritonavir-boosted Invirase treatment groups (see results in Table 3). While the supra-therapeutic dose \nof Invirase/ritonavir appeared to have a greater effect on the QT interval than the therapeutic dose of \nInvirase/ritonavir, it is not sure if maximum effect for both doses has been observed. In the therapeutic \nand the supra-therapeutic arm 11% and 18% of subjects, respectively, had a QTcS between 450 and \n480 msec. There was no QT prolongation > 500 msec and no torsade de pointes in the study (see also \nsection 4.4). \n \nTable 3: Maximum mean of ddQTcS† (msec) on day 3 for therapeutic dose of Invirase/ritonavir, \n\nsupra-therapeutic dose of Invirase/ritonavir and active control moxifloxacin in healthy \nvolunteers in Thorough QT (TQT) Study \n\n \nTreatment Post-Dose \n\nTime Point \nMean  \n\nddQTcS \nStandard \n\nError \nUpper 95%-CI of \n\nddQTcS \nInvirase/ritonavir \n1000/100 mg BID \n\n12 hours 18.86 1.91 22.01 \n\nInvirase/ritonavir \n1500/100 mg BID \n\n20 hours 30.22 1.91 33.36 \n\nMoxifloxacin  ̂ 4 hours 12.18 1.93 15.36 \n† Derived difference of pre-dose baseline corrected QTcS between active treatment and placebo \narms \n ̂ 400 mg was administered only on Day 3 \n\nNote: QTcS in this study was QT/RR0.319 for males and QT/RR0.337 for females, which are similar to \nFridericia’s correction (QTcF=QT/RR0.333). \n \nIn this study, PR interval of > 200 msec was also observed in 40% and 47% of subjects receiving \nInvirase/ritonavir 1000/100 mg twice daily and 1500/100 mg twice daily, respectively, on Day 3. PR \nintervals of > 200 msec were seen in 3% of subjects in the active control group (moxifloxacin) and 5% \nin the placebo arm. The maximum mean PR interval changes relative to the pre-dose baseline value \nwere 25 msec and 34 msec in the two ritonavir-boosted Invirase treatment groups, 1000/100 mg twice \ndaily and 1500/100 mg twice daily, respectively (also see section 4.4). \n \nEvents of syncope/presyncope occurred at a higher than expected rate and were seen more frequently \nunder treatment with saquinavir (11 of 13). The clinical relevance of these findings from this study in \nhealthy volunteers to the use of Invirase/ritonavir in HIV-infected patients is unclear, but doses \nexceeding Invirase/ritonavir 1000/100 mg twice daily should be avoided. \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\n \nThe effect of treatment initiation with a dosing regimen of Invirase/ritonavir 500 /100 mg twice daily \nin combination with 2 NRTIs for the first 7 days of treatment followed by Invirase/ritonavir 1000 / \n100 mg twice daily in combination with 2 NRTIs in the subsequent 7 days on QTc interval, PK, and \nviral load was evaluated in an open-label 2-week observational study in 23 HIV-1 infected, treatment-\nnaïve patients initiating Invirase/ritonavir therapy. ECG and PK measurements were collected on Days \n3, 4, 7, 10, and 14 of treatment with the modified Invirase/ritonavir treatment. The primary study \nvariable was maximal change from dense predose baseline in QTcF (ΔQTcFdense). The modified \nInvirase/ritonavir regimen reduced mean maximum ΔQTcFdense in the first week of treatment \ncompared with the same value in healthy volunteers receiving the standard Invirase/ritonavir dosing \nregimen in the TQT study on Day 3, (Table 4) based on cross-study comparison in a different \npopulation. Only 2/21 (9%) patients across all study days had maximum QTcF change from dense \npredose baseline ≥ 30 ms following administration of the modified Invirase/ritonavir regimen in the \ntreatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patient population; and the maximum mean change from dense \npredose baseline in QTcF was < 10 ms across all study days. These results suggest that the QTc \nliability is reduced with the modified Invirase/ritonavir dosing regimen, based on a cross-study \ncomparison in a different population (Table 4). The proportion of patients with a reported PR interval \nprolongation > 200 ms in this study ranged from 3/22 (14%) (day 3) to 8/21 (38%) (day14). \n \nFollowing the modified Invirase/ritonavir regimen, saquinavir exposure during the first week peaked \non Day 3 and declined to the lowest exposure on Day 7 with ritonavir induction effects, while Day 14 \nsaquinavir PK parameters (following full doses of Invirase/ritonavir in the second week) approached \nthe range of historical mean values for saquinavir steady-state values in HIV-1 infected patients (Table \n9). Mean Invirase Cmax with the modified Invirase/ritonavir regimen was approximately 53-83% lower \nacross study days in the HIV-1 infected patients relative to the mean Cmax achieved in healthy \nvolunteers in the TQT study on Day 3. Continuous declines in HIV-RNA were observed in all \ntreatment-naïve patients receiving the modified Invirase/ritonavir dosing regimen over the 2-week \ntreatment period, suggesting HIV viral suppression during the time of the study. No long-term efficacy \nwas evaluated with the modified regimen.  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Electrocardiogram Parameters following administration of the Modified \nInvirase/ritonavir Regimen in Treatment Naïve HIV-1 infected Patients initiating treatment with \nInvirase/ritonavir \n\nParameter Day 3 \n500/100 \nmg \n(n=22) \n\nDay 4 \n500/100 \nmg \n(n=21) \n\nDay 7 \n500/100 \nmg \n(n=21) \n\nDay 10 \n1000/100 \nmg \n(n=21) \n\nDay 14 \n1000/100 \nmg \n(n=21) \n\nTQT \nStudy  \nDay 3* \n(n=57) \n\nMean Maximal \nΔQTcF\n\ndense\n ms (SD) \n\n3.26 ± \n7.01 \n\n0.52 ± \n9.25  \n\n7.13 ± \n7.36 \n\n11.97 ± \n11.55 \n\n7.48 ± \n8.46 \n\n32.2 ± 13.4 \n\nPatients with maximal \nΔQTcF\n\ndense\n ≥ 30 ms (%) \n\n0 0 0 2/21 (9%) 0 29/57 \n(51%) \n\n*Historical data from the thorough QT study conducted in healthy volunteers \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro: Saquinavir demonstrates antiviral activity against a panel of laboratory \nstrains and clinical isolates of HIV-1 with typical EC50 and EC90 values in the range 1-10 nM and 5-50 \nnM, respectively, with no apparent difference between subtype B and non-B clades. The \ncorresponding serum (50% human serum) adjusted EC50 ranged from 25-250 nM. Clinical isolates of \nHIV-2 demonstrated EC50 values in the range of 0.3-2.4 nM. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\nResistance \n \nAntiviral activity according to baseline genotype and phenotype: \n \nGenotypic and phenotypic clinical cut-offs predicting the clinical efficacy of ritonavir boosted \nsaquinavir have been derived from retrospective analyses of the RESIST 1 and 2 clinical studies and \nanalysis of a large hospital cohort (Marcelin et al 2007).  \n \nBaseline saquinavir phenotype (shift in susceptibility relative to reference, PhenoSense Assay) was \nshown to be a predictive factor of virological outcome. Virological response was first observed to \ndecrease when the fold shift exceeded 2.3-fold; whereas virological benefit was not observed when the \nfold shift exceeded 12-fold. \n \nMarcelin et al (2007) identified nine protease codons (L10F/I/M/R/V, I15A/V, K20I/M/R/T, L24I, \nI62V, G73S/T, V82A/F/S/T, I84V, L90M) that were associated with decreased virological response to \nsaquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily) in 138 saquinavir naive patients. The presence of 3 or \nmore mutations was associated with reduced response to saquinavir/ritonavir. The association between \nthe number of these saquinavir-associated resistance mutations and virological response was \nconfirmed in an independent clinical study (RESIST 1 and 2) involving a more heavily treatment \nexperienced patient population, including 54% who had received prior saquinavir (p=0.0133, see \nTable 5). The G48V mutation, previously identified in vitro as a saquinavir signature mutation, was \npresent at baseline in virus from three patients, none of whom responded to therapy. \n \nTable 5: Virological response to saquinavir/ritonavir stratified by the number of baseline saquinavir-\n\nassociated resistance mutations \n \nNumber of \nSaquinavir \nAssociated \nResistance \nMutations \n\nat Baseline* \n\nMarcelin et al (2007) RESIST 1 & 2 \nSQV Naive Population SQV Naive/Experienced Population \n\nN=138 \nChange in Baseline \n\nPlasma HIV-1 RNA at \nWeeks 12-20 \n\nN=114 \nChange in Baseline \n\nPlasma HIV-1 RNA at \nWeek 4 \n\n0 35 -2.24 2 -2.04 \n1 29 -1.88 3 -1.69 \n2 24 -1.43 14 -1.57 \n3 30 -0.52 28 -1.41 \n4 9 -0.18 40 -0.75 \n5 6 -0.11 17 -0.44 \n6 5 -0.30 9 0.08 \n7 0 - 1 0.24 \n\n* Saquinavir Mutation Score Mutations: L10F/I/M/R/V, I15A/V, K20I/M/R/T, L24I, I62V, G73S/T, \nV82A/F/S/T, I84V, L90M \n\n \nClinical results from studies with treatment naïve and experienced patients \n \nIn the MaxCmin1 study, the safety and efficacy of saquinavir soft capsules/ritonavir 1000/100 mg \ntwice daily plus 2 NRTIs/Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) was compared \nto indinavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg twice daily plus 2 NRTIs/NNRTIs in over 300 (both protease \ninhibitor treatment naïve and experienced) subjects. The combination of saquinavir and ritonavir \nexhibited a superior virological activity compared with the indinavir and ritonavir arm when switch \nfrom the assigned treatment was counted as virological failure.  \n \nIn the MaxCmin2 study, the safety and efficacy of saquinavir soft capsules/ritonavir 1000/100 mg \ntwice daily plus 2 NRTIs/NNRTIs was compared with lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily plus \n2 NRTIs/NNRTIs in 324 (both protease inhibitor treatment naïve and experienced) subjects.

The infants and young children were \nstratified into 2 groups: Group A “Low Age Group” 4 months to less than 2 years old (n=5) and Group \nB “High Age Group” children 2 years to less than 6 years old (n=13).  \n \nIn the “High Age Group”, the number of patients with a viral load <400 copies/mL at week 48 was 11 \nof 13.  The number of patients with viral load <50 copies/mL was 9 of 13 for the same period.  The \nCD4 lymphocyte count expressed as percentage mean CD4 increased by a mean of 2.97% over the \nsame 48 week period. The size of the study was too small to allow conclusions on clinical benefit. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nSaquinavir is essentially completely metabolised by CYP3A4. Ritonavir inhibits the metabolism of \nsaquinavir, thereby increasing (\"boosting\") the plasma levels of saquinavir.  \n \nAbsorption: In HIV-infected adult patients, Invirase in combination with ritonavir at doses of \n1000/100 mg twice daily provides saquinavir systemic exposures over a 24-hour period similar to or \ngreater than those achieved with saquinavir soft capsules 1200 mg tid (see Table 8). The \npharmacokinetics of saquinavir is stable during long-term treatment. \n \nTable 8: Mean (% CV) AUC, Cmax and Cmin of saquinavir in patients following multiple dosing of \n\nInvirase, saquinavir soft capsules, Invirase/ritonavir, and saquinavir soft capsules/ritonavir \n \nTreatment N AUCτ (ng·h/ml) AUC0-24 \n\n(ng·h/ml) † \nCmax \n\n(ng/ml) \nCmin \n\n(ng/ml) \nInvirase (hard capsule) \n600 mg tid \n\n10 866 (62) 2,598 197 (75) 75 (82) \n\nsaquinavir soft capsule \n1200 mg tid \n\n31 7,249 (85) 21,747 2,181 (74) 216 (84) \n\nInvirase (tablet) \n1000 mg bid plus \nritonavir 100 mg bid* \n(fasting condition) \n\n22 10,320 \n(2,530-30,327) \n\n20,640 1,509 \n(355-4,101) \n\n313 \n(70-1,725) †† \n\nInvirase (tablet) \n1000 mg bid plus \nritonavir 100 mg bid* \n(high fat meal) \n\n22 34,926 \n(11,826-105,992) \n\n69,852 5,208 \n(1,536-\n14,369) \n\n1,179 \n(334-5,176) †† \n\nτ = dosing interval, i.e. 8 hour for tid and 12 h for bid dosing. \nCmin = the observed plasma concentration at the end of the dose interval. \nbid = twice daily \ntid = three times daily \n* results are geometric mean (min - max)  \n† derived from tid or bid dosing schedule \n†† Ctrough values \n \nAbsolute bioavailability averaged 4 % (CV 73 %, range: 1 % to 9 %) in 8 healthy volunteers who \nreceived a single 600 mg dose (3 x 200 mg hard capsule) of Invirase following a heavy breakfast. The \nlow bioavailability is thought to be due to a combination of incomplete absorption and extensive first-\npass metabolism. Gastric pH has been shown to be only a minor component in the large increase in \nbioavailability seen when given with food. The absolute bioavailability of saquinavir co-administered \nwith ritonavir has not been established in humans. \n \nIn combination with ritonavir, bioequivalence of Invirase hard capsules and film-coated tablets was \ndemonstrated under fed conditions. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n\nEffective therapy in treatment naïve patients is associated with a Cmin of approximately 50 ng/ml and \nan AUC0-24 of about 20,000 ng·h/ml. Effective therapy in treatment experienced patients is associated \nwith a Cmin of approximately 100 ng/ml and an AUC0-24 of about 20,000 ng·h/ml. \n \nIn treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients initiating Invirase/ritonavir treatment with a modified \nInvirase/ritonavir dosing regimen of Invirase 500 mg two times daily with ritonavir 100 mg two times \ndaily for the first 7 days of treatment and increased to Invirase 1000 mg two times daily with ritonavir \n100 mg two times daily in the subsequent 7 days, saquinavir systemic exposures generally approached \nor exceeded the range of historical steady-state values with the standard Invirase/ritonavir \n1000 mg/100 mg bid dosing regimen across study days (see Tables 9 and 8).  \n \nTable 9: Mean (CV%) PK Parameters following administration of the Modified Invirase/ritonavir \nRegimen in Treatment Naïve HIV-1 infected Patients initiating treatment with Invirase/ritonavir \nParameter Day 3 \n\n500/100 mg \n(n=22) \n\nDay 4 \n500/100 mg \n(n=21) \n\nDay 7 \n500/100 mg \n(n=21) \n\nDay 10 \n1000/100 mg \n(n=21) \n\nDay 14 \n1000/100 mg \n(n=21) \n\nAUC0-12 \n(ng*hr/ml) \n\n27100 (35.7) 20300 (39.9) 12600 (54.5) 34200 (48.4) 31100 (49.6) \n\nCmax (ng/ml) 4030 (29.1) 2960 (40.2) 1960 (53.3) 5300 (36.0) 4860 (46.8) \n\nC12 (ng/ml) 899 (64.9) 782 (62.4) 416 (98.5) 1220 (91.6) 1120 (80.9) \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that saquinavir is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp). \n \nEffect of food: In a cross-over study in 22 HIV-infected patients treated with Invirase/ritonavir \n1000 mg/100 mg twice daily and receiving three consecutive doses under fasting conditions or after a \nhigh-fat, high-calorie meal (46 g fat, 1,091 Kcal), the AUC0-12, Cmax and Ctrough values of saquinavir \nunder fasting conditions were about 70 per cent lower than with a high-fat meal. All but one of the \npatients achieved Ctrough values of saquinavir above the therapeutic threshold (100 ng/ml) in the fasted \nstate. There were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetic profile of ritonavir in \nfasting and fed conditions but the ritonavir Ctrough (geometric mean 245 vs. 348 ng/ml) was lower in \nthe fasting state compared to the administration with a meal. Invirase/ritonavir should be administered \nwith or after food. \n \nDistribution in adults: Saquinavir partitions extensively into the tissues. The mean steady-state \nvolume of distribution following intravenous administration of a 12 mg dose of saquinavir was 700 l \n(CV 39 %). It has been shown that saquinavir is approximately 97 % bound to plasma proteins up to \n30 µg/ml. In two patients receiving Invirase 600 mg three times daily, cerebrospinal fluid \nconcentrations of saquinavir were negligible when compared to concentrations from matching plasma \nsamples. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination in adults: In vitro studies using human liver microsomes have \nshown that the metabolism of saquinavir is cytochrome P450 mediated with the specific isoenzyme, \nCYP3A4, responsible for more than 90 % of the hepatic metabolism. Based on in vitro studies, \nsaquinavir is rapidly metabolised to a range of mono- and di-hydroxylated inactive compounds. In a \nmass balance study using 600 mg 14C-saquinavir (n = 8), 88 % and 1 % of the orally administered \nradioactivity, was recovered in faeces and urine, respectively, within 4 days of dosing. In an additional \nfour subjects administered 10.5 mg 14C-saquinavir intravenously, 81 % and 3 % of the intravenously \nadministered radioactivity was recovered in faeces and urine, respectively, within 4 days of dosing. \n13 % of circulating saquinavir in plasma was present as unchanged compound after oral administration \nand the remainder as metabolites. Following intravenous administration 66 % of circulating saquinavir \nwas present as unchanged compound and the remainder as metabolites, suggesting that saquinavir \nundergoes extensive first pass metabolism. In vitro experiments have shown that the hepatic \nmetabolism of saquinavir becomes saturable at concentrations above 2 µg/ml. \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\nSystemic clearance of saquinavir was high, 1.14 l/h/kg (CV 12 %), slightly above the hepatic plasma \nflow, and constant after intravenous doses of 6, 36 and 72 mg. The mean residence time of saquinavir \nwas 7 hours (n = 8). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nEffect of gender following treatment with Invirase/ritonavir: A gender difference was observed with \nfemales showing higher saquinavir exposure than males (AUC on average 56 % higher and Cmax on \naverage 26 % higher) in the bioequivalence study comparing Invirase 500 mg film coated tablets with \nInvirase 200 mg hard capsules both in combination with ritonavir. There was no evidence that age and \nbody-weight explained the gender difference in this study. Limited data from controlled clinical \nstudies with the approved dosage regimen do not indicate a major difference in the efficacy and safety \nprofile between men and women. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment: The effect of hepatic impairment on the steady state \npharmacokinetics of saquinavir/ritonavir (1000 mg/100 mg twice daily for 14 days) was investigated \nin 7 HIV-infected patients with moderate liver impairment (Child Pugh Grade B score 7 to 9). The \nstudy included a control group consisting of 7 HIV-infected patients with normal hepatic function \nmatched with the hepatically impaired patients for age, gender, weight and tobacco use. The mean \n(% coefficient of variation in parentheses) values for saquinavir AUC0-12 and Cmax were 24.3 \n(102%) µg·hr/ml and 3.6 (83%) µg/ml, respectively, for HIV-infected patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment. The corresponding values in the control group were 28.5 (71%) µg·hr/ml and 4.3 \n(68%) µg/ml. The geometric mean ratio (ratio of pharmacokinetic parameters in hepatically impaired \npatients to patients with normal liver function) (90% confidence interval) was 0.7 (0.3 to 1.6) for both \nAUC0-12 and Cmax, which suggests approximately 30% reduction in the pharmacokinetic exposure in \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment. Results are based on total concentrations (protein-bound \nand unbound). Concentrations unbound at steady-state were not assessed. No dosage adjustment seems \nwarranted for patients with moderate hepatic impairment based on limited data. Close monitoring of \nsafety (including signs of cardiac arrhythmia) and of virologic response is recommended due to \nincreased variability of the exposure in this population (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nPaediatric Patients: Steady state pharmacokinetic information is available from HIV-infected \npaediatric patients from study NV20911. In this study, 5 patients were <2 years and 13 between 2 to \n<6 years and received 50 mg/kg saquinavir bid (not to exceed 1000 mg bid) boosted with ritonavir at \n3 mg/kg for patients with body weight ranging from 5 to <15 kg or 2.5 mg/kg for patients with body \nweight ranging from 15 to 40 kg (not to exceed 100 mg bid). Sixteen of 18 children could not swallow \nInvirase hard capsules and received medication by opening the capsules and mixing the contents with \ndifferent vehicles. The pharmacokinetic exposure parameters for the “High Age Group” are listed in \nTable 10. Results of the “Low Age Group” are not shown as data are limited due to the small size of \nthe group. \n \nTable 10: Pharmacokinetic parameters of saquinavir at steady-state in HIV-infected pediatric patients \n \n Mean ± SD Saquinavir (%CV) \n\nPharmacokinetic Parameters* \n\nStudy Age \nGroup \n(Years) \n\nN AUC0-12h \n(ng•h/mL) \n\nCtrough \n(ng/mL) \n\nCmax (ng/mL) \n\nNV20911 2 to < 6 years 13 38000 ± \n18100 \n\n(48%) \n\n1860 ± 1060 \n\n(57%) \n\n5570 ± 2780 \n\n(50%) \n\n* All parameters normalized to a 50 mg/kg dose \n \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\nSteady state saquinavir exposures observed in paediatric trials were substantially higher than historical \ndata in adults where dose- and exposure-dependent QTc and PR prolongation were observed (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAcute and chronic toxicity: Saquinavir was well tolerated in oral acute and chronic toxicity studies in \nmice, rats, dogs and marmosets. \n \nMutagenesis: Mutagenicity and genotoxicity studies, with and without metabolic activation where \nappropriate, have shown that saquinavir has no mutagenic activity in vitro in either bacterial (Ames \ntest) or mammalian cells (Chinese hamster lung V79/HPRT test). Saquinavir does not induce \nchromosomal damage in vivo in the mouse micronucleus assay or in vitro in human peripheral blood \nlymphocytes and does not induce primary DNA damage in vitro in the unscheduled DNA synthesis \ntest. \n \nCarcinogenesis: There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity after the administration of saquinavir \nmesilate for 96 to 104 weeks to rats and mice. The plasma exposures (AUC values) in rats (maximum \ndose 1000 mg/kg/day) and in mice (maximum dose 2500 mg/kg/day) were lower than the expected \nplasma exposures obtained in humans at the recommended clinical dose of ritonavir boosted Invirase.  \n \nReproductive toxicity: Fertility, peri- and postnatal development were not affected, and embryotoxic / \nteratogenic effects were not observed in rats or rabbits at plasma exposures lower than those achieved \nin humans at the recommended clinical dose of ritonavir boosted Invirase. Distribution studies in these \nspecies showed that the placental transfer of saquinavir is low (less than 5% of maternal plasma \nconcentrations). \n \nSafety pharmacology: Cloned human cardiac potassium channel (hERG) trafficking in vitro was \ninhibited by 75% at 30μM of saquinavir. Saquinavir inhibited both hERG current and L-type Ca++ \nchannel current with respective IC50s of 4.7 and 6.3 μM. In a myocardial distribution study in the rat \nan approximately 2-fold accumulation of saquinavir was observed in the heart compared to plasma \nafter coadministration of saquinavir and ritonavir. The clinical relevance of these preclinical results are \nunknown, however cardiac conduction and repolarisation abnormalities in humans have been observed \nwith saquinavir and ritonavir combination therapy (see section 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\n \nPackage Leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nInvirase 500 mg film-coated tablets \n\nSaquinavir \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What Invirase is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Invirase \n3. How to take Invirase \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Invirase \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Invirase is and what it is used for \n \nInvirase contains the active substance saquinavir which is an antiviral agent. It is a member of a class \nof medicines called protease inhibitors. It is for the treatment of infection with the human \nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV). \n \nInvirase is used by HIV-1-infected adults. Invirase is prescribed for use in combination with ritonavir \n(Norvir) and other antiretroviral medicines. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Invirase \n \nDo not take Invirase if you have: \n• an allergy to saquinavir, ritonavir or any of the other ingredients (see “Invirase contains lactose” \n\nlater in this section and “What Invirase contains” in Section 6) \n• any heart problems that show on an electrocardiogram (ECG, electrical recording of the heart) - \n\nyou may have been born with that \n• a very slow heart rate (bradycardia) \n• a weak heart (heart failure) \n• a history of an irregular heart beat (arrhythmias) \n• a salt imbalance in your blood, especially low blood concentrations of potassium (hypokalaemia), \n\nwhich is not currently controlled by treatment \n• severe liver problems such as jaundice, hepatitis or liver failure - where your belly fills with fluid, \n\nyou get confused or your oesophagus (the tube that runs from your mouth to your stomach) \nbleeds \n\n• recently taken the HIV medicine rilpivirine. \nDo not take Invirase if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking Invirase. \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\nDo not take Invirase if you are taking any of the following medicines: \nAny medicine that can change your heart beat, such as: \n• certain medicines for HIV - such as atazanavir, lopinavir, rilpivirine \n• certain heart medicines - amiodarone, bepridil, disopyramide, dofetilide, flecainide, \n\nhydroquinidine, ibutilide, lidocaine, propafenone, quinidine, sotalol \n• certain medicines for depression - amitriptyline, imipramine, trazodone, maprotiline \n• medicines for other severe mental health problems - such as clozapine, haloperidol, \n\nmesoridazine, phenothiazines, sertindole, sultopride, thioridazine, ziprasidone \n• certain medicines for infection - such as clarithromycin, dapsone, erythromycin, halofantrine, \n\npentamidine, sparfloxacin \n• certain strong pain killers (narcotics) - such as alfentanyl, fentanyl, methadone \n• medicines for erectile dysfunction - sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil \n• certain medicines that may be used for a variety of things: cisapride, diphemanil, mizolastine, \n\nquinine, vincamine. \n• certain medicines used to prevent rejection of new organs after a transplant operation such as \n\ntacrolimus \n• certain medicines used to treat the symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (an increase in size \n\nof the prostate) such as alfuzosin \n• certain medicines commonly used for allergy symptoms such as terfenadine and astemizole \n• certain medicines for severe mental health problems such as pimozide  \n• certain medicines (so called tyrosine kinase inhibitors) used to treat different types of cancer such \n\nas dasatinib and sunitinib. \n \nAny of these other medicines: \n• ergot alkaloids - for migraine attacks \n• triazolam and midazolam (taken by mouth) - to help you sleep or for anxiety \n• rifampicin - for preventing or treating tuberculosis \n• simvastatin and lovastatin - for lowering blood cholesterol \n• quetiapine – used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder \n• lurasidone – used to treat schizophrenia. \n \nDo not take Invirase with any other drug unless you have talked to your doctor first.  The drugs listed \nabove might cause serious side effects if you take them together with Invirase. \n \nDo not take Invirase if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or \npharmacist before taking Invirase. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nYou should know that Invirase/ritonavir is not a cure for HIV infection and that you may continue to \ndevelop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV disease. You should, therefore, remain under \nthe care of your doctor while taking Invirase/ritonavir. \n \nYou can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective \nantiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your physician the precautions needed to avoid infecting other \npeople. \n \nAt present, there is only limited information on the use of Invirase/ritonavir in children and in adults \nover the age of 60 years. \n \nAbnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias): \nInvirase can change how your heart beats - this can be serious. This can happen especially if you are \nfemale or elderly.  \n• If you are taking any medicine that decreases your blood potassium levels talk to your doctor \n\nbefore taking Invirase.  \n• Contact your doctor immediately, if you get palpitations or an irregular heart beat during \n\ntreatment. Your doctor may wish to do an ECG to check your heart beat. \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n\n \nOther conditions \nThere are certain conditions, which you may have, or have had, which require special care before or \nwhile taking Invirase/ritonavir. Therefore, before taking this medicine, you should have told your \ndoctor if you suffer from diarrhoea, or if you have allergies (see Section 4) or if you have an \nintolerance to some sugars (see section “Invirase contains lactose”). \n \nKidney disease: Consult your doctor if you have a history of kidney disease. \n \nLiver disease: Please speak with your doctor if you have a history of liver disease. Patients with \nchronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral agents are at increased risk of severe and \npotentially fatal liver adverse events and may require blood tests for control of liver function. \n \nInfection: In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic \ninfection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-\nHIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s \nimmune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious \nsymptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately (see \nSection 4). \n \nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the \nimmune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the \ntreatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of \ntreatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, \nweakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, \ntremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n \nBone problems: Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease \ncalled osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe \nimmunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for \ndeveloping this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the \nhip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor.  \n \nOther medicines and Invirase \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  \n \nInvirase/ritonavir may be taken with a number of other medications that are commonly used in HIV \ninfection. \n \nThere are some medications that must not be taken with Invirase/ritonavir (see section \"Do not take \nInvirase if you are taking any of the following medicines:\" above). There are also some medicines that \nrequire dosage reduction of that medicine or Invirase or ritonavir (see section “Medicines that can \ninteract with saquinavir or ritonavir include:” below). Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more \ninformation about taking Invirase/ritonavir with other medicines. \n \nMedicines that can interact with saquinavir or ritonavir include: \n• other HIV medicines - such as nelfinavir, indinavir, nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz, maraviroc, \n\ncobicistat \n• some medicines affecting the immune system - such as ciclosporin, sirolimus (rapamycin), \n\ntacrolimus \n• various steroids - such as dexamethasone, ethinyl estradiol, fluticasone \n• certain heart medicines - such as calcium channel blockers, quinidine, digoxin \n• medicines used to lower blood cholesterol - such as statins \n• antifungals - ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, miconazole \n• anticonvulsants - such as phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\n• sedative agents - such as midazolam administered by injection \n• certain antibiotics - such as quinupristin/dalfopristin, rifabutin, fusidic acid \n• medicines to treat depression - such as nefazodone, tricyclic antidepressants \n• medicines for anticoagulation - warfarin \n• herbal preparations containing St. John’s wort or garlic capsules \n• some medicines that treat diseases related to the acid in the stomach - such as omeprazole or other \n\nproton pump inhibitors \n• medicines used to treat asthma or other chest illness such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary \n\nDisease (COPD) such as salmeterol \n• medicines for gout, such as colchicine \n• medicines used to treat high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs (a disease known as \n\npulmonary arterial hypertension) such as bosentan. \n \nTherefore you should not take Invirase/ritonavir with other medicines without your doctor’s consent.  \n \nIf you are taking an oral contraceptive to prevent pregnancy, you should use an additional or different \ntype of contraception since ritonavir may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. \n \nInvirase with food and drink  \nInvirase must be taken together with ritonavir and with or after food.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. Inform your doctor if you are \npregnant or planning to become pregnant. This medicine should be taken during pregnancy only after \nconsultation with your doctor. \n \nYou should not breast-feed your baby if you are taking Invirase/ritonavir. \n \nDriving and using machines \nInvirase has not been tested for its effect on your ability to drive a car or operate machinery. However, \ndizziness, fatigue and visual impairment have been reported during treatment with Invirase. Do not \ndrive or operate machines if you experience these symptoms. \n \nInvirase contains lactose \nEach film-coated tablet contains lactose (monohydrate) 38.5 mg. If you have been told by your doctor \nthat you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n \n3. How to take Invirase \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. Invirase comes as a 500 mg film-coated tablet. Your doctor will prescribe Invirase \nin combination with ritonavir (Norvir) and other HIV medicines. \n \nHow to take \n• Take Invirase at the same time as your ritonavir (Norvir) capsules. \n• Take your Invirase film-coated tablets with or after food. \n• Swallow them whole with water. \n \nHow much to take \n \nStandard dose \n\n• Take two 500 mg film-coated tablets of Invirase twice a day. \n• Take one 100 mg capsule of ritonavir (Norvir) twice a day.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\nIf this is your first medicine for HIV or the first time you are taking ritonavir (Norvir) \nYou need to take a lower dose of Invirase for your first week.  \nWeek 1: \n• Take one 500 mg film-coated tablet of Invirase twice a day. \n• Take one 100 mg capsule of ritonavir (Norvir) twice a day.  \n \nWeek 2 onwards: \n• Continue with the standard dose. \n \nIf you take more Invirase than you should  \nIf you have taken more than the prescribed dose of Invirase/ritonavir you must contact your doctor or \npharmacist. \n \nIf you forget to take Invirase \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten individual dose. If you forget to take one dose, \ntake this dose as soon as you remember together with some food. Then go on with the regular schedule \nas prescribed. Do not change the prescribed dose yourself. \n \nIf you stop taking Invirase  \nContinue to take this medicine until your doctor tells you otherwise. \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmascist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and lifestyle, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.  \n \nWhen treating HIV infection it is not always possible to differentiate between unwanted effects caused \nby Invirase or by any other medicines you take at the same time or by the complications of the \ninfection. For these reasons it is very important to inform your doctor of any change in your condition. \n \nThe most frequently (in more than ten in a hundred persons) reported side effects of saquinavir taken \nwith ritonavir concern the gastrointestinal tract, with feeling sick, diarrhoea, tiredness, vomiting, wind \nand abdominal pain being the most common. Also, changes in laboratory markers (e.g., blood or urine \ntests) have been reported very commonly. \n \nOther reported side effects (in more than one in a hundred but less than one in ten persons), which \nmay occur are: rash, itching, eczema and dry skin, hair loss, dry mouth, headache, peripheral \nneuropathy (a disturbance of the nerves in the feet and hands that may take the form of numbness, pins \nand needles, shooting or burning pain), weakness, dizziness, libido problems, taste alteration, mouth \nulcers, dry lips, abdominal discomfort, indigestion, weight loss,constipation, increased appetite,  \nmuscle spasms and shortness of breath.  \n \n Other less frequently reported side effects (in more than one in one thousand persons but less than \none in a hundred persons) include: decreased appetite, visual disturbance, inflammation of the liver, \nfits, allergic reactions, blisters, sleepiness, abnormal renal function, inflammation of the pancreas, \nyellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes caused by liver problems and Steven’s Johnson syndrome \n(a serious illness with blistering of the skin, eyes, mouth and genitals).  \n \nIn patients with haemophilia type A and B, there have been reports of increased bleeding while taking \nthis treatment or another protease inhibitor. Should this happen to you, seek immediate advice from \nyour doctor. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\nThere have been reports of muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly with combination \nantiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors and nucleoside analogues. On rare occasions these \nmuscle disorders have been serious (rhabdomyolysis). \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.  This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Invirase \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date (EXP) which is stated on the bottle and carton. The \nexpiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nInvirase does not require any special storage conditions. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \nWhat Invirase contains \n \n• The active substance is saquinavir.
